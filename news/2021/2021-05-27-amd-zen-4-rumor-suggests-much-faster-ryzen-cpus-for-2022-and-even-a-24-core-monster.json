  "summary": "The latter is uncertain though, and if a 24-core model does arrive, it may not be with the initial launch",
  "article": [
    "AMD\u2019s Zen 4 CPUs, likely to be the next-gen Ryzen models which are expected to arrive later in 2022, will be a big leap in performance, and could be spearheaded by a 24-core processor \u2013 and while all this is just rumored, note that there are extra caveats with the latter (we\u2019ll come back to that).",
    "This fresh info comes from YouTube hardware leaker Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, and it underlines some spillage we\u2019ve heard in past rumors, while making some interesting new points.",
    "Moore\u2019s Law believes that Zen 4 chips will offer a performance increase of over 20% in terms of IPC (Instructions per Clock), and that\u2019s roughly in line with the potential 25% increase the rumor mill has previously floated. This might indicate that we could get a slightly lower figure than 25%, but of course this is just educated guesswork at this point anyway, and as Moore\u2019s Law reminds us, the design of Zen 4 isn\u2019t even fully complete yet.",
    "This is just how things look to be shaping up at this point in time, but the clear expectation from inside sources is that Zen 4 will represent a bigger performance leap than Zen 3 (Ryzen 5000) did.",
    "Another interesting nugget on the performance front concerns the core count for Zen 4 processors, bearing in mind that AMD has hinted in the past that more cores could be in the pipeline \u2013 above and beyond the current 16-cores for the flagship \u2013 and recent rumors have speculated about a possible 24-core model.",
    "Moore\u2019s Law is skeptical that such a model will come, but his sources do indicate that designs are floating around for a 24-core CPU. That only means it\u2019s theoretically possible, but Moore\u2019s Law asserts it doesn\u2019t seem likely, mainly because it\u2019s arguable whether AMD will even need such a chip, what with the IPC gains in the pipeline for Zen 4 \u2013 and that it\u2019d likely be prohibitively expensive for consumers.",
    "He doesn\u2019t rule out a 24-core flagship, though, and tentatively suggests that if it does eventually debut, it will be later on down the line, and the Zen 4 range will initially launch with a 16-core flagship in the same way as Zen 3.",
    "Other info imparted with this leak echoes recent buzz on the CPU grapevine, and includes that AMD\u2019s Zen 4 CPUs will be built on 5nm (by TSMC), and will introduce support for DDR5 RAM, but will stick with PCIe 4.0 (but with more lanes \u2013 28 rather than the current 24).",
    "Moore\u2019s Law believes that the most likely timeframe for launch will be Q3 of 2022, reinforcing the recent rumor that Zen 4 won\u2019t turn up until later in 2022. Considering that Zen 4 is now expected to be the next-gen range, Ryzen 6000 \u2013 with no launch of new (refreshed Zen 3+) CPUs coming this year, going by the rumor mill \u2013 this would leave a lengthy gap between Ryzen generations.",
    "It\u2019ll also leave Ryzen 5000 to face off against Intel\u2019s Alder Lake \u2013 which makes big changes for Team Blue \u2013 and Raptor Lake, the purported successor to (and a refresh of) Alder Lake, would be what Ryzen 6000 squares off with. In short, the danger is that this is giving Intel a window to claw back CPU territory, but as ever, we shouldn\u2019t get carried away with any of these rumors. Only time will tell exactly where AMD\u2019s CPU roadmap is heading\u2026",
