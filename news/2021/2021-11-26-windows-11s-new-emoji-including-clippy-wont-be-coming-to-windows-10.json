    "Windows 11 has just got some nifty looking new emoji, as you may recall, which are Fluent-style and modern-looking affairs \u2013 but these won\u2019t be coming to Windows 10.",
    "They landed earlier this week as part of a preview update for Windows 11, so are officially still only in testing even on that OS, although Microsoft will send them fully live for Windows 11 in December (on Patch Tuesday, which will be December 14).",
    "The emoji \u2013 which include the paperclip being replaced by Clippy, the iconic assistant who pestered, er, we mean helped us in Word back in the day \u2013 will not arrive in Windows 10, or at least that appears to be Microsoft\u2019s plan as reported by Windows Latest.",
    "The tech site claims that Microsoft has no intention of drafting the modern emoji over to Windows 10, and that they will remain exclusive to Windows 11, at least for the time being anyway. Windows Latest does further observe that Microsoft might change its mind in the future, though.",
    "Of course, many Windows 10 users will say that they won\u2019t especially be losing much sleep over the lack of refreshed emoji, and that\u2019s a fair point. They aren\u2019t a huge deal, and not a reason anyone would be upgrading to Windows 11, that\u2019s for sure.",
    "That said, they are nice to have, and it wouldn\u2019t be much of an effort to pipe them over to Windows 10. Maybe Microsoft feels that they\u2019d stick out a bit as odd, as the old operating system hasn\u2019t had the benefit of the Fluent Design-style makeover that Windows 11 arrived with.",
    "Whatever the reasoning right now, we could see them ported over eventually, as the report observes. In the meantime, Windows 10 users will just have to stick with their tired old vanilla emoji."
