    "Beginning on December 19, the postseason will commence with a number of different bowl games which will be played in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, California, Texas and other states throughout the country. Finally the AFCA National Championship Trophy also known as the Coaches\u2019 Trophy will be awarded to the winner of this season\u2019s CFP National Championship which will be held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on Monday, January 11.",
    "Whether you\u2019re rooting for a team in the Big Ten, Pac-12, SEC, ACC, Big 12 or Big East, our guide explains how to get a college football live stream and watch every NCAA game available this season, so you don\u2019t miss a single touchdown.",
    "If you live in the US and have a cable subscription, you\u2019ll need access to the following networks in order to watch all of the college football action this season: ABC, CBS, CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, ESPN 3, ESPN College Extra, NBC, Fox, FS1, FS2, Fox College Sports Atlantic, Fox College Sports Central, Fox College Sports Pacific, NFL Network, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, Longhorn Network, SEC Network, BTN (Big Ten Network) and Pac-12 Network.",
    "However, if you aren\u2019t a cable subscriber, you can still watch quite a few games over-the-air. With on of the best indoor TV antennas you can watch college football games shown on ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox.

    "As you can see, there's a dizzying array of channels that cover NCAA football in the US, so if you want to get a college football live stream for every single game of the season...you can't. And it would be impossible, given the sheer number of games played simultaneously every Saturday.",
    "What you can do is arm yourself with a good over-the-top streaming service, which will get you access to the channels you need to watch the biggest games each week.",
    "For your convenience, we've compiled a list of our favorite streaming services and the networks they give you access to below.",
    "If you're currently traveling abroad or there is no official broadcast option in your country, then you\u2019ll need to use a VPN to dial in to a location in the US that does have coverage.",
    "A VPN is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location. They're surprisingly easy to use, too! We\u2019ve tested hundreds of VPNs and can heartily recommend ExpressVPN as the best one right now.",
    "In some countries, you may be baffled by the fact that college football is just as popular as the NFL among some fans. But if you want to know what all the fuss is about or you're a US expat wanting to catch the college football, then ESPN Player has you covered.",
    "It's available in the UK, Europe, Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia and comes at a cost of \u00a39.99/\u20ac11.99 for the next month (or \u00a369.99/\u20ac79.99 for a whole year).",
    "That gets you live and on-demand coverage of most college football games in the 2020-21 season as well as access to other live sports events, ESPN originals and ESPN Films on-demand. The service also supports both desktop and mobile, so you\u2019ll never miss a game.",
    "As a result of Covid-19, four of the top 10 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) conferences including the Big Ten, Pac-12, Mid-American Conference (MAC) and Mountain West decided to cancel their seasons during the summer of 2020.",
    "However, by late-September the four conferences reversed their decisions and announced that they would play shortened seasons as opposed to cancelling outright.",
    "The Big Ten plays eight games over eight weeks from October 23, Pac-12 will play a seven-game schedule starting on November 6, MAC will play a six-game schedule from November 4 and Mountain West will play an eight-game schedule from October 24."
