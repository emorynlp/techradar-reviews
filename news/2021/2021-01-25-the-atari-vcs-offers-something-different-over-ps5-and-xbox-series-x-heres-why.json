    "The Atari VCS is an interesting proposition for gamers and, according to Atari VCS COO Michael Artz, it could find a niche which might have been overlooked.",
    "While the upcoming console certainly won\u2019t get the sort of fanfare that the PS5 and Xbox Series X have garnered \u2013 nor the unprecedented levels of demand \u2013 Arzt believes that the \"Atari VCS provides consumers who may be weary of the iterative nature of the console wars something different to consider.\"",
    "The Atari VCS' versatility as a mini-PC could also be one of its main strengths, along with the fact the hybrid console will be the best place to play all of Atari\u2019s back catalog of classic games.",
    "In an interview with T3, Artz explained why the Atari VCS should be on your radar, and how it\u2019s more than capable of becoming the focal point of your entertainment center.",
    "\"First and foremost the Atari VCS was designed for the living room, merging the benefits of a console, a streaming box, and a multimedia PC,\" Arzt said. \"The PC functionality, the all-in-one nature of the device, and the broad accessibility of streaming services means it can carry the lion\u2019s share of gaming and streaming activity in any living room. Plus, that doesn\u2019t preclude people using the Atari VCS as a dedicated mini-PC.\u201d",
    "With thousands of people working from home, the Atari VCS\u2019 PC functionalities are probably more appealing than ever before, and they\u2019ve resonated well with potential buyers \u2013 something which Artz is only too aware of.",
    "\"Users can tap into a wide variety of traditional PC functionalities, from office work, to email, to online shopping to PC gaming and much more,\u201d Arzt said. \u201cThere has been a lot of interest in the VCS as a PC, in part because it provides so much incremental value compared to other mini-PCs in our price range.\"",
    "The Atari VCS came about thanks to crowdfunding, as the project was successfully backed on Indiegogo in 2018. It smashed its initial $100,000 target and brought in $3 million worth of backers in total. Pre-orders have \u201cbeen strong\u201d, according to Artz, and he hopes that when units eventually arrive with backers, it will only \u201cincrease interest and drive additional pre-order volume.\u201d",
    "The hybrid console might be good value when compared to a dedicated mini-PC, but it isn\u2019t cheap by any means. It\u2019s set to cost $389.99 (about \u00a3285 / AU$504), but comes with a controller and joystick bundled in. That\u2019s nearly $100 more expensive than an Xbox Series S (which retails for $299 / \u00a3249 / $AU499), but while the Series S focuses purely on gaming and streaming, the VCS is a lot more versatile.",
    "The Atari VCS will start shipping this spring, and is available to pre-order directly from Atari, Walmart and GameStop. There\u2019s still no word on an international release, but Artz hinted it could arrive in other regions later this year, if distributors show enough interest."
