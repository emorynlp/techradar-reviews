    "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed that the automaker\u2019s driver safety testing system \u201cwill be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability\u201d \u2013 which could be a game-changer for the car insurance industry.",
    "At present, the system awards Tesla drivers a score between 0-100 that reflects how safely they operate their car over a given period, a figure which is then used to determine whether a driver qualifies for certain software updates.",
    "For instance, a recent major software update to Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving Mode (FSD) \u2013 a system which allows a vehicle to maneuver around other objects and onto highway ramps without the need for driver intervention \u2013 was only distributed to around 1,000 Tesla owners \u201cwith perfect 100/100 safety scores.\u201d",
    "Musk also suggested that \u201cfurther refinements\u201d were \u201cdefinitely\u201d coming to the company\u2019s safety scoring system \u2013 which is still in early beta stage \u2013 in response to a tweet asking whether this would be \u201cthe same [...] system used for Tesla insurance.\u201d",
    "In its current state, the system uses five metrics, called Safety Factors, to calculate the likelihood that a Tesla owner's driving could result in a future collision. Most drivers are expected to have a Safety Score of 80 or above, according to the company.",
    "Tesla currently only offers insurance packages to vehicle owners in California, though it plans to expand the service to Texas in October and then \u201caspirationally\u201d to \u201cmost of the US\u201d by the end of 2021.",
    "Right now, the automaker claims that its rates are \u201cup to 30% cheaper\u201d than the competition, though Musk\u2019s comments suggest its fledgling safety scoring system could play a major part in determining what premiums its customers can expect to pay when the service does roll out en masse \u2013 presumably, the better a driver\u2019s safety score, the cheaper their insurance.",
    "Of course, this isn\u2019t an entirely new system. For years, insurance companies have fitted so-called \u2018black box\u2019 systems to vehicles as a means of monitoring driver behaviour \u2013 a method often used to promote the safety of younger drivers.",
    "But Musk seems to be suggesting that his company\u2019s in-built safety scoring system \u2013 which, as mentioned, is currently being used as a measure of update eligibility \u2013 might double as a \u2018black box\u2019 system as Tesla\u2019s insurance division grows.",
    "If so, the move might encourage the implementation of similar systems in vehicles produced by rival automakers in an effort to eliminate the need for insurance companies entirely.",
    "If the manufacturer of a car can offer its customers accurate insurance premiums based on the safety of their driving behaviour \u2013 or \u201ccrash probability,\u201d as Musk puts it \u2013 why would those customers shop elsewhere for the same cover?",
    "This is, of course, all merely speculative at this point \u2013 but Musk\u2019s comments nonetheless allude to a simpler, hassle-free and fairer future of car insurance."
