    "Black Friday is here, and so are some huge savings on air dryers from big names including Ninja, Instant Pot, Tefal, and Philips. The big retailers including Amazon and Best Buy are competing against each other to offer the lowest price possible, which means we're seeing stacks of substantial savings.",
    "If you're in the US, you're spoilt for choice when it comes to air fryer deals this Black Friday. With deals like the Bella Pro Series half price at $29.99 at Best Buy, and the Instant Vortex Plus convection oven down to $89.95 at Amazon, you're spoilt for choice no matter what type or brand of air fryer you're after.",
    "Meanwhile, Ninja's official Black Friday sale in the UK includes a \u00a320 reduction on the Ninja Foodi Dual air fryer, which is on sale for \u00a3179.99, as well as \u00a340 off the brand new larger model, the Ninja Foodi Max dual-zone air fryer. The top-rated 9-in-1 Multi-Cooker has also been marked down to just \u00a3179, down from the retail price of \u00a3229.99.",
    "Here you'll find all the lowest prices, right through to Cyber Monday and beyond, so make sure to bookmark this page and check back regularly, ensuring you don't need to go to the effort of trawling through them all.",
    "Last year we saw some record low prices cropping up in Black Friday air fryer deals, most notably on Instant Pot and Ninja devices. However, in the lower end of the price range, Best Buy was offering some excellent discounts on its exclusive Bella line and Aria and GoWise were also dropping into this budget category as well.",
    "We can expect to see a similar trend heading into this year's offers, with smaller, cheaper machines (3-4Qt) available for under $40 and more premium models dropping by between 30-40%. Last year's best deals saw average discounts of 39%, and if trends continue, these savings may increase slightly in 2021.",
    "Many of the big name brands will likely be participating in this year's Black Friday air fryer deals, with Ninja leading the way for more high budget items. We've seen Cosori, Safe, Tower Vortex, Philips, and Instant Pot getting in to the action in recent years, though the best discounts tend to sit on mid-range models that have spent some time on the shelves.",
    "That means those who are willing to sacrifice picking up the newest release stand to save the most cash this year, by foregoing some of the fancier features 2021 might have in store.",
    "Finding the best Black Friday air fryer deal for your budget requires a little research, as the best discounts are the ones on models with the features you know you need. There's no point paying for a premium device if you won't use it, so make sure you know what you'll be cooking with to find the best prices for your wallet. That means checking out the different types of air fryers and what each one can offer before finding the products that best suit your needs.",
    "There are two types of air fryer on the market right now; basket and oven. The former is a smaller, cheaper device that will only serve air frying needs, however the latter packs in far more cooking options for a larger price tag. Choosing between the two will depend on how much food you will need to prepare each day, whether you need additional functions like roasting, grilling or baking, and how much counter space you have to play with."
