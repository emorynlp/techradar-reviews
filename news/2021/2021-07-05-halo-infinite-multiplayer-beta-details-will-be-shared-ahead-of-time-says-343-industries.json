    "Developer 343 Industries has said that details of the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta or \u201cflight\u201d that\u2019s due to take place this summer (from July to September) won\u2019t be dropped on players out of the blue.",
    "343 Industries community manager John Junyszek took to Twitter to say that Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer technical preview details will be made \u201cahead of time\u201d and that \u201cit will not be a surprise\u201d announcement.",
    "Junyszek did stress, however, that those who are interested in playing the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta will need to be registered as a Halo Insider.",
    "In terms of when the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta could take place, Junyszek said the team is \u201cconstantly evaluating the flighting build\u201d and that the \u201cexact timing is dictated by development realities\u201d. Once a firm date has been locked in, though, Junyszek said 343 Industries would let everyone know.",
    "Due to complications caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, 343 Industries has had to scale back its plans for Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer test, which means the number of players who will get to experience the next chapter of the series\u2019 multiplayer will be more limited.",
    "Still, after the game\u2019s multiplayer reveal at the Xbox Bethesda Showcase at E3 2021, anticipation is pleasingly high for a series that has arguably had more than a few missteps since Bungie handed the reins to 343 Industries back in 2007.",
    "If you want to be part of the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta, head to Halo Waypoint and near the top of the page you should see the option to \u2018Signup\u2019 to the program.",
    "Click the button and then fill in the form you see onscreen. You\u2019ll need to have an Xbox account and either a PC or an Xbox to sign up for testing sessions. We\u2019d also recommend you double-check the agreements that you have to sign. The whole process should take less than five minutes.",
    "Halo Infinite still doesn\u2019t have a firm release date, but Microsoft\u2019s first-party exclusive is due to release on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and PC sometime during \u201cHoliday 2021\u201d, which falls between November and early January. However, many are tipping the game to launch sometime in November of this year, particularly as the game\u2019s 20 year anniversary takes place on November 15, 2021.",
    "Halo Infinite will also launch on Xbox Game Pass day one for subscribers, and the series\u2019 multiplayer mode will be free-to-play for the very first time. The game will also support 120fps for those with compatible displays."
