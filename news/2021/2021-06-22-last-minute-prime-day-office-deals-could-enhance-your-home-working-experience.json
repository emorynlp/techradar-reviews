    "How has your home office experience treated you during the past year? If the TechRadar team has learned anything from the home working experience, it's that having the right combination of desk, chair, and laptop makes all the difference in the world. Being comfortable with your surroundings helps to emulate the office experience \u2013 and it sure beats trying to work from your kitchen counter on a stool.",
    "With the Prime Day deals for 2021 wrapping up in just a few hours, below we've collected a few of the best office-related sales for our US readers, covering areas like office furniture, and throwing in a selection of our favorite laptop deals to boot.",
    "Note that anything covered specifically by the Prime Day sale will require a Prime membership \u2013 so keep that in mind before you buy.",
    "As we're sure you know by now, Prime Day ends at midnight PDT \u2013 that means you only really have a few hours left to take advantage of any deals you might like, including many of those above.",
    "As you scope out how your next few months of working from home will play out, making an adjustment to your office setup could be meaningful.",
    "Hopefully, your employer is giving you the option for a more flexible future. Working from home isn't for everyone \u2013 not all of us have the space for a bespoke office, and miss the human company \u2013 but for many people, the time retrieved from avoiding the commute is vital.",
    "That's why the occasional office upgrade can make a world of difference to the same space you have to sit in every single day, even if it's just having access to slightly nicer coffee. It's like replacing a mattress or a sofa, in a lot of ways \u2013 not necessarily the most exciting upgrade, but one that makes an incremental difference to your everyday life."
