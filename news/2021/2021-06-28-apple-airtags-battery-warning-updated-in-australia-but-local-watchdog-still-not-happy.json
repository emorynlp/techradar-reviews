  "article": [
    "Following reports that Apple\u2019s AirTag key tracker was removed from shelves by a major Australian retailer over concerns with its button battery last month, the country's consumer watchdog has urged parents to keep the product away from children.",
    "The official warning comes after Apple had added more explicit button battery warnings to its packaging in Australia, though the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it wasn\u2019t enough to address its concerns with the product.",
    "In a statement, the ACCC said it was concerned \u201cabout the accessibility and security of the button battery inside the product.\u201d The consumer advocate says young children could access the battery compartment and remove the coin battery with ease.",
    "\u201cIn addition, the AirTag battery compartment\u2019s lid does not always secure fully on closing, and a distinctive sound plays when an AirTag\u2019s lid is being closed, suggesting the lid is secure when it may not be,\u201d said the ACCC.",
    "It\u2019s not just the physical product that the consumer watchdog has taken issue with, as the ACCC has also critiqued the product\u2019s warning labels.",
    "\u201cWe were also concerned that the outer product packaging does not have any warning about the presence and dangers of button batteries, and we note that Apple has now added a warning label to the AirTag\u2019s packaging,\u201d said the ACCC\u2019s Deputy Chair, Delia Rickard.",
    "\u201cHowever, this alone does not address our fundamental concerns about children being able to access the button batteries in these devices,\u201d Rickard said.",
    "The ACCC says it is also looking at similar Bluetooth tracking devices that use button batteries to determine their safety.",
    "Apple has updated its AirTag packaging, and at least in Australia, the product will be sold as early as this week with a warning sticker on the box and instructions inside the box that detail the risks associated with coin batteries.",
    "When reports first emerged that Australian retailer Officeworks had removed AirTags from sale, Apple issued a statement to TechRadar: \u201cAirTag is designed to meet international child safety standards, including those in Australia, by requiring a two step push-and-turn mechanism to access the user-replaceable battery.",
    "\"We are following the regulations closely and are working to ensure that our products will meet or exceed new standards, including those for package labelling, well ahead of the timeline required.\u201d",
    "Apple has indeed updated its AirTag warnings well ahead of schedule, as the compliance deadline was set for June 2022. Though given the ACCC\u2019s statement, this change has not addressed its concerns about the product's design.",
    "The consumer watchdog says it has raised these safety concerns with Apple, and discussions around the AirTag are continuing."
