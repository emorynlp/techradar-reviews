    "In a data breach letter sent to affected customers shared by Bleeping Computer, the company acknowledged the incident occurred earlier this year in March and allowed the unauthorized users to access the personal information relating to some of their guests, employees, and crew.",
    "When quizzed by Bloomberg, Carnival said that as soon as it became aware of the data breach, it \u201cacted quickly to shut down the event and prevent further unauthorized access.\u201d",
    "Soon after the company notified the regulators and also hired a cybersecurity firm to look into the breach.",
    "The investigation reportedly found that during the incident, personal data of customers, employees and crew of not just Carnival, but also of its subsidiaries Holland America and Princess lines, along with details of the company\u2019s medical operations were accessed.",
