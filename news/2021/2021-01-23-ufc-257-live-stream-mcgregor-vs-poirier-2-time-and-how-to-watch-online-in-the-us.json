    "Whether you know him as The Notorious, Mystic Mac, or plain ol' Conor McGregor - UFC's biggest star is back in action this weekend to headline the promotion's biggest PPV card since...well, the last time Conor McGregor stepped into the Octagon! Read on as we explain how to get a UFC 257 live stream and see McGregor vs Poirier 2, plus key details like the McGregor vs Poirier time.",
    "Irish MMA icon Conor McGregor returns to the Octagon this Saturday night for his first fight in a year - a rematch against American Dustin Poirier following the pair's clash way back in 2014. Taking place on Abu Dhabi's Yas Island, aka Fight Island, Dustin 'The Diamond' Poirier will be out for revenge after McGregor defeated him with a stunning first round TKO at UFC 178 all those years ago.",
    "A vicious left-hook from the then-underdog Dubliner was all it took - the legend was born and within a year The Notorious would be UFC Flyweight title en route to becoming one of the sport's first ever two-division champion.",
    "The two UFC vets have shared remarkably similar records since that encounter, with both suffering a pair of losses - in both cases, the most recent came at the hands of Khabib Nurmagodemov.",
    "With Khabib now out of the picture after his recent retirement, this fight is being regarded by many as a lightweight title eliminator, with the reward for the winner a likely match-up with Charles Oliveira for the belt later in the year.",
    "It's set to be one of the 2021's early sporting talking points, so follow our guide below as we explain key details.",
    "Quite a lot, as it happens - on top of being able to stream October's big event, a subscription to ESPN+ opens up access to over 20 exclusive live UFC Fight Nights, alongside original content including Dana White\u2019s Contender Series, UFC Destined, and Ariel & The Bad Guy, plus classic fights, replays, and there\u2019s also the perk of fewer commercials."
