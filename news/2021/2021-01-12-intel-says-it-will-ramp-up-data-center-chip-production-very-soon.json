    "Technology giant Intel has announced that it is set to ramp up production of a new data center processor. The admission suggests that the company\u2019s new active investor, Third Point, is having an influence on the company\u2019s long-term strategy.",
    "Although Intel remains the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of central processors, whether for PCs or data centers, the company has been struck by delays that have allowed its competitors to gain valuable market share. In particular, the company has struggled to increase production of both its 10-nanometer chip and its next-generation 7-nanometer processor.",
    "Intel has confirmed that a new generation of chipmaking tech will form the foundation of its output in 2021, with further details expected to emerge in the company\u2019s earnings call, which is set to take place on January 21.",
    "In exciting news, Intel added that its Ice Lake server chips would scale up production this quarter \u2013 although no specific figures were announced. The company also confirmed that 50 new processor designs for PCs would be unveiled later this year, with 30 using the firm\u2019s 10-nanometer technology.",
    "At the end of last year, it was revealed that Third Point had sent a letter to Intel\u2019s chairman, Omar Ishrak, questioning whether the company should keep chip design and production within a single business unit. The letter was viewed by many as a push for wider-scale changes at Intel.",
    "Intel\u2019s announcement of a production increase will certainly have a major impact on the company\u2019s strategy for the rest of the year but initially it may struggle to gain much audience traction. The firm has plenty of other news being pushed at the moment, with a number of new solutions being revealed at CES 2021.",
