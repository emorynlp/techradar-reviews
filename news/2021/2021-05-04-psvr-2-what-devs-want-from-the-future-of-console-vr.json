  "article": [
    "Following avid speculation, Sony officially confirmed it\u2019s working on PSVR 2 - a next-gen version of its virtual reality hardware - back in February. While the PS5 currently supports last-gen\u2019s PSVR through backwards compatibility - albeit with a camera adapter required - it\u2019s welcome news that Sony plans to utilize its new hardware to offer an improved VR experience.",
    "But, it\u2019s going to be a while before this next-gen PSVR releases, with Sony stating that we won\u2019t get our hands on the new hardware until sometime \u201cbeyond 2021\u201d.",
    "In the meantime, there\u2019s still plenty of fun to be had with the current PSVR hardware as developers work on games that\u2019ll continue to push experiences in this form. But what makes VR so special, and what can we hope to see with PSVR 2? We asked the developers behind some of PSVR\u2019s biggest titles.",
    "What made the early years of VR so exciting was the blank canvas devs had. \u201cEverything had to be discovered anew. I loved that, and I still do!\u201d says Erik Odeldahl, Fast Travel Game\u2019s creative director, currently working on Wraith: The Afterlife \u2013 Oblivion.",
    "PSVR 2 could offer this blank canvas once more, giving developers the chance to work with new features and letting them push the boundaries further than was previously possible. One of these new features is the new VR controller which will integrate innovations found in the PS5 DualSense controller, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. According to Odeldahl, improved controllers and haptics are key to VR: \u201cThe more precise you can let a player be in a VR world, the higher the sense of immersion.\u201d",
    "Charlie Amis, project director on I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy And The Liar, is excited to see Sony investing further in VR. \u201c[Sony went] from the first PS controller to the DualShock 2 controller with two analog sticks, where you can control your character and your camera simultaneously, [which] is now a staple,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the same level of innovation [in VR]. What\u2019s the DualShock 2 controller for virtual reality?\u201d he ponders. Well, we might have an answer in this as-of-yet-unnamed controller. The DualOrb? That might be one to leave to the naming professionals.",
    "There\u2019s room for headset hardware to improve, too. \u201cI\u2019d like to see headsets get much lighter, and I\u2019d like weight distribution to improve,\u201d Andy Tsen, co-founder of Ramen VR (working on VR MMO Zenith) tells us. \u201cFor presence, you need spatialized audio and really good haptic feedback, and that\u2019s where the adaptive trigger and haptic feedback technology of the DualSense controllers come in,\u201d explains Tsen, citing the classic example of bow tension.",
    "Steven Watt, creative director on VR shooter Fracked, feels similarly. \u201cImagine slipping down a chain in VR and feeling every link in your hands.\u201d Games have always been able to transport you somewhere else, but in VR you feel that sensation all over. \u201cMy body reacted totally differently when I first met a dinosaur in VR,\u201d Watt says, \u201cmy eyes got wider and the hairs on my arms stood up. No other medium could have done that.\u201d",
    "With the PSVR 2 controller set to utilize both haptic feedback and finger touch detection, Sony could continue to deliver uniquely immersive sensations with its new controller. But whether the headset will become less cumbersome remains to be seen, as Sony hasn\u2019t given us a look at the PSVR 2 headset yet - though we do know it will do away with the plethora of cords we seen with PSVR, instead opting for just one.",
    "\u201cUltimately I think what\u2019s going to convince more and more people to get into VR is a combination of having a robust set of games and experiences that players have access to, as well as making it way easier and more comfortable to strap on a VR headset,\u201d says Tsen.",
    "These days there are heaps of full games on PSVR, but there\u2019s still a lot of experimentation being done into taking mechanics off the TV and putting them onto your face in a way that feels right. Tsen pushes the boat out: \u201cI am dreaming of the day we have virtual reality headsets project images that are indistinguishable from real life.\u201d",
    "For many VR devs, what matters most is getting more people involved \u2013 not just players, but developers. \u201cI want more people playing and developing for it. Not just in numbers, but in the diversity of the players and developers,\u201d explains Amis. \u201cOne of the benefits of a new medium like this is that it can have a different culture around making the games and playing the games and experiences. I know we\u2019ll see more and more tech innovations, but it\u2019s really magical just as it is today.\u201d",
    "With PSVR 2 on the horizon, the time to strike is now. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to see Sony is reinvesting in the virtual reality space and dedicated to innovating on their hardware. I want to continue to see companies put out innovations in controllers, headset tracking, and eye-tracking,\u201d says Amis. \u201cWe\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what hardware innovation can do.\u201d"
