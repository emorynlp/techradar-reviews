  "article": [
    "Windows 11 doesn\u2019t boast Microsoft\u2019s promised native support for Android apps yet, as those keen to have it have doubtless noticed if they\u2019ve adopted the new OS, but the good news is that it looks like this much-awaited feature could be coming before too long.",
    "Or at least we\u2019ve caught a glimpse of Android apps now running under Windows 11 in testing, going by a leak from Bilibili (China) as highlighted by Windows Latest.",
    "The theory is \u2013 and naturally, take this with some degree of caution, as with any leak \u2013 that Microsoft is now testing the Android Subsystem for Windows 11, and that\u2019s exactly what these spilled screenshots (which include a glimpse of WeChat) show.",
    "If testing is underway internally, this indicates that pretty soon we can expect the feature to make its way to the regularly released preview builds of Windows 11 (and subsequently on to the full version of Microsoft\u2019s OS).",
    "It\u2019s a good sign, at any rate, and it\u2019s backed up by the fact that Amazon\u2019s App Store has been present in the Microsoft Store since about a month ago (though it\u2019s not yet available for download, of course). Amazon\u2019s store is how Microsoft will deliver Android apps in Windows 11 (rather than Google Play \u2013 and obviously with the limitations therein, as not every app is carried by Amazon, by any means).",
    "What\u2019s also interesting here is that the spilled screen grabs show multiple Android apps open in different windows at the same time, so multi-tasking will be facilitated here, as you might expect. Furthermore, any Android application will act like Windows software, in terms of being able to resize windows and so forth (and they\u2019ll work with the Notification Center too). The more seamless the integration, the better, naturally.",
    "Support for Android apps was something that was expected to debut with the initial version of Windows 11, as mentioned, but as soon as we started getting close to the release of the new OS, with no sign of the feature in test builds, it became clear enough that it wasn\u2019t going to make the cut.",
    "Since then, the question has become exactly how long are we going to have to wait for Android apps to grace the Windows 11 desktop? And at least seeing tangible evidence that testing is underway suggests that we might not have all that long to go \u2013 at least until Android support hits the official Windows 11 preview builds. Testing is expected to start before 2021 ends, of course, so we might just see something happen in the next month on that front.",
    "The road to release for the full version of Windows 11 could be a longer and windier one, though, and we must remember that Microsoft has dropped to a cadence of just one major feature update per year \u2013 so the next OS upgrade isn\u2019t coming until the second half of 2022. Because this is such a big feature, it may not pitch up until then, but you never know, there\u2019s always the possibility of a feature pack update arriving beforehand, earlier in 2022. We\u2019ll just have to see.",
    "Meantime, Android apps can still be used with Microsoft\u2019s OS as long as you go through the Your Phone app, but that\u2019s a limited way of doing things, and hardly the same as having native support built-in."
