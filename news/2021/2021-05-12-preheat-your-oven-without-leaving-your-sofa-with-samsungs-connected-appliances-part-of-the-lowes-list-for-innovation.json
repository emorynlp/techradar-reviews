    "Having earned the Lowe\u2019s List for Innovation 2021 badge, the Samsung Family Hub \u2122 is one of multiple Connected Home products featured on the list. The Family Hub\u2122 features an interactive touch screen and a wealth of innovative features to keep you connected to your entire home. It\u2019s the definition of innovation, as we\u2019ve come to expect from Samsung.",
    "Samsung's Connected Appliances features a number of innovations, the hub of which is the Family Hub. The Family Hub is the centerpiece of the Connected Home line, bringing together your whole home in one easy to use place.",
    "The Family Hub is more than just a smart fridge that can send you alerts if something is wrong. It is a fully connected appliance that can operate as the gateway to your entire home. The SmartThings\u2122 app can also show you the inside of the fridge from anywhere. Because the Family Hub works from both the fridge and connected smartphones, you can take a look inside the fridge while you\u2019re grocery shopping, making sure you don\u2019t pick up more milk when you\u2019ve still got a whole gallon at home. Even from home, this feature helps conserve energy for those moments when you open the fridge looking for a nebulous something.",
    "The Family Hub is also way smarter than other smart fridges. It can actually recognize the items inside the fridge and suggest recipes based on the ingredients you already have. Find an ingredient missing? Your Samsung Family Hub\u2122 can be used to order groceries for delivery. Want to streamline your meals? The meal planning tools in the Family Hub will help you organize and keep on top of your weekly cooking.",
    "The Family Hub also works with the rest of the Samsung\u00ae Connected Home Appliances, as well as a number of other connected devices. You can connect the family home with cameras around your home to see what is happening in every room. You can stream cooking videos to the hub so the pros can walk you through step-by-step. You can check on your Samsung Connected Washer and Dryer from the fridge to see if your laundry is done. You can mirror the screen from your Samsung smart TV so you don\u2019t have to stop the movie just because it\u2019s time to cook dinner. You can even connect with your Ring Doorbell to see who is at your door without having to pull out your phone to check the app.",
    "Having seen the first smart refrigerators when they hit the market, there is just no comparison to the Family Hub.",
    "Another winner of the Lowe\u2019s List for Innovation badge is the Samsung Smart Ranges. As far as ranges go, these smart ranges come with many features and options. Some of the options found in Samsung ranges includes: Rapid Boil, Air Fry, Flex Duo\u2122 , Integrated Griddles, and up to four beautiful fingerprint resistant finishes.",
    "Aside from being a top of the line range, it also comes with a number of innovative features that will make all your cooking and baking so much easier:",
    "Samsung didn\u2019t stop with refrigerators and ranges with this innovation either. You can connect several appliances to the Family Hub and the SmartThings \u2122 app to keep your entire home connected:",
    "There has never been a better time to innovate your home with new smart appliances. You can find the full line of Samsung Connected Appliances at Lowe\u2019s in a range of options. Available with a wide range of optional features and sleek finishes, you can be sure to get exactly what your home needs without paying for extra features you don\u2019t.
