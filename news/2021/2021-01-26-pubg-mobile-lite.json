    "If you have a weak smartphone, PUBG Mobile Lite might be one of the few complex mobile games you can play. It\u2019s a lightweight version of \u2018standard\u2019 PUBG Mobile, and it's designed for smartphones that have limited RAM or weaker chipsets than flagship devices sport.",
    "This makes PUBG Mobile Lite a great choice if you\u2019ve got a budget smartphone with low specs, or an older handset that can\u2019t play the newest and most intensive games. But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone with such a phone can play the game: the availability is a little more convoluted than that.",
    "PUBG Mobile Lite isn\u2019t available in all regions, and while there are workarounds, the game might not work properly depending on where you live. We\u2019ll explore more in our availability section below. It's also worth pointing out it's only available on Android phones - sorry, iPhone owners.",
    "We\u2019ll also run through what PUBG Mobile Lite is like, including the maps, weapons and features available, so you know all there is to know about the game.",
    "PUBG Mobile Lite is available in an odd scattering of countries across the world; since it launched in mid-2019, it\u2019s been in a beta phase, and full rollout has been expected for nearly two years now, but we\u2019re still waiting.",
    "Countries include Russia, many Latin American and Caribbean nations, quite a few south-east Asian countries and over half of Africa. Those in the US, UK and Australia aren\u2019t able to download the game.",
    "The overall list of compatible countries is spotty, so we recommend finding if your country is compatible by heading over to the Google Play Store entry for PUBG Mobile Lite. If you\u2019re unable to download the game, odds are your country isn\u2019t on the list. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t play the game though\u2026",
    "You don\u2019t have to be in a compatible region to play PUBG Mobile Lite, as long as you\u2019re willing to put in some extra work.",
    "On its website, PUBG Mobile Lite offers a downloadable APK version of its game, which you can download yourself and install on your smartphone. Several other websites also host PUBG Mobile Lite APKs - we\u2019d recommend only downloading it from the official site though so you don\u2019t install something riddled with malware.",
    "To download it, use the phone you want to play on, head over to the PUBG Mobile Lite website here and select \u2018APK Download\u2019. This should start the download process - when the file is fully downloaded, find it in your phone\u2019s downloads folder (or via the notification that should pop up) and select it.",
    "You\u2019ll be asked if you want to install the app - follow the processes and soon, you should have the game fully installed.",
    "It\u2019s worth pointing out this might not work for all, and it depends on server availability in your country. We tested the download in the UK, and while we could access the app, we couldn\u2019t log in due to a lack of servers. However, if you live near countries where the game is compatible you may be able to access the game.",
    "PUBG Mobile Lite has a few key differences from the main version of the game, to justify that low install size. The main one is a graphical downgrade, as the game doesn\u2019t exactly have next-gen graphics.",
    "The PUBG Mobile Lite map is quite a bit smaller than PUBG Mobile ones. At 2km by 2km (that's in-game distances) its map is dwarfed by the 8km by 8km options you have in the \u2018standard\u2019 version of the mobile game.",
    "There are 60 players per match, but in that relatively small map that should make for intensive and quick games. Vehicles are available in the map, as well as weapons and gear to scavenge.",
    "PUBG Mobile Lite gets regular themed updates, for example with winter-themed additions, which include new guns with particular camos.",
    "There\u2019s also a smaller arena mode in PUBG Mobile Lite, in which two teams of four players engage in firefights in a warehouse. It\u2019s not as thorough a list of modes as in PUBG Mobile but it\u2019s something.",
    "PUBG Mobile Lite also has the occasional limited-time mode, as with standard PUBG Mobile. These have included zombie or winter-themed game modes in the past."
