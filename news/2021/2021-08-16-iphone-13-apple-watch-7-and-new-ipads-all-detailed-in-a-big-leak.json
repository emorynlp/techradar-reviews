  "article": [
    "We\u2019re fast approaching the launch of the iPhone 13, a phone that will almost certainly land in September, likely alongside some other products such as the Apple Watch 7 and maybe even a new iPad. Unsurprisingly we\u2019ve heard a lot about these devices already, but the leaks just won\u2019t stop coming.",
    "Now Mark Gurman (a Bloomberg writer with an excellent track record for Apple information) has in his Power On newsletter revealed some likely specs and features of these upcoming devices.",
    "In many cases he\u2019s reiterating things that he\u2019s said before, but there is some new stuff here, including a claim that the Apple Watch 7 will come with a new Time to Run feature. This will presumably be similar to the podcast-like Time to Walk feature already found on the Apple Watch, but aimed at runners, and it will apparently be joined by audio meditations.",
    "As for the iPhone 13, here Gurman reiterates claims that the range will stick to the same screen sizes as the iPhone 12 did, that it will include a new A15 chipset, a 120Hz refresh rate on the Pro models, and possibly an always-on display.",
    "The iPhone 13 range is also said to include a new Cinematic Video setting for Portrait mode, an AI-driven filter system, and higher quality recording for the iPhone 13 Pro models in Apple\u2019s ProRes format.",
    "He also says the notch will be smaller, as has been widely rumored, and suggests that the upgrades are just about big enough to justify calling these phones the iPhone 13 range rather than the iPhone 12S \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t sound like he has any inside information on the names.",
    "Finally, Gurman claims that the iPad mini 6 will have thinner borders and a complete redesign, as we\u2019ve heard before, and that a slimmer and faster new iPad (2021) is also on the way.",
    "While most of this information isn\u2019t new, it does line up with what we\u2019ve heard before, so there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s accurate, and if all of these devices land this year as they\u2019re rumored to then Apple could have almost no new competition in the final few months of 2021.",
    "Apple potentially has four iPhone 13 models, the iPad mini 6, a new iPad and the Apple Watch 7 on the way in the next month or two, and what do rivals have? We\u2019re expecting the Google Pixel 6 range, Google Pixel 5a and perhaps the Pixel Fold, but there\u2019s very little else of note.",
    "Samsung has already unveiled most of its late 2021 line-up, and with foldables in place of the Galaxy Note 21, its offerings are arguably more niche than normal, though we might still see a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. Then there\u2019s OnePlus, which often brings new T models to the table in September or October, but is rumored not to be launching a OnePlus 9T.",
    "We\u2019re mostly talking phones here, but Apple might have even less new tablet competition, with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 likely to be a big rival, but possibly not launching until early 2022.",
    "So for anyone who\u2019s still holding out for a new flagship phone and hoping something catches their eye before the end of the year, it\u2019s mostly just Apple and Google left to come, and for tablets it\u2019s all Apple."
