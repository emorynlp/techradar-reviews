    "Spoilers follow for Ted Lasso season 2 episode 1 \u2018Goodbye, Earl\u2019.",
    "Ted Lasso is a TV show about overcoming adversity. Despite the humor and optimism that runs through Apple TV Plus\u2019 most popular series to date, it doesn\u2019t overlook the struggles that its eclectic cast of characters go through \u2013 and, ultimately, their ability to rise above it.",
    "With season 1 focusing on the hardship of key characters including Ted (Jason Sudeikis) and Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham), season 2 trains its eye on the show\u2019s supporting cast and the troubles \u2013 personal and professional \u2013 that they must conquer to grow as individuals.",
    "That includes Jamie Tartt. The antagonistic former AFC Richmond star\u2019s circumstances are a mystery at the start of Ted Lasso season 2 but, by the end of episode 1 \u2013 titled Goodbye, Earl \u2013 it appears that Jamie, more than anyone, needs a helping hand.",
    "Ahead of season 2\u2019s premiere, TechRadar sat down with Jamie Tartt actor Phil Dunster to discuss his character\u2019s stuttering soccer career. We also discuss the series\u2019 examination of difficult real-life subjects and whether we\u2019ll see Jamie in a Richmond shirt ever again.",
    "Ted Lasso\u2019s season 1 finale left Jamie at a crossroads. Recalled from his Richmond loan spell by Manchester City, the attacker ended up relegating Richmond by setting up City\u2019s winning goal on the final day of last season.",
    "Rather than celebrate Richmond\u2019s demotion to England\u2019s second tier, though, the egotistical soccer player found himself mulling over his part in proceedings \u2013 especially after Ted leaves him a note praising his unselfish behavior in assisting a goal rather than trying to score himself.",
    "Fast forward to season 2 and Jamie is conspicuous by his absence. That is, until the final scene in episode 1.",
    "Sitting down with his elderly female yoga friends, ex-Richmond midfielder Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) settles in to watch the latest episode of satirical Love Island-style show Lust Conquers All.",
    "To Roy\u2019s surprise, arch-rival Jamie is revealed to be part of the series\u2019 line up. So how did he go from starring for Manchester City to appearing on a reality TV show?",
    "\u201cJamie\u2019s at this place now where he\u2019s trying these different avenues,\u201d Dunster exclusively tells us. \u201cMaybe he feels like he couldn\u2019t continue to do all that work on his own [without Ted]. Perhaps he\u2019s stepping away from football and maybe trying something that is less to do with his talent.\u201d",
    "It appears, though, that Jamie is missing Ted and AFC Richmond\u2019s players. Deprived of their infectious optimism, collective spirit and support, the former Richmond superstar is seemingly taking control of his life for the first time \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Jamie\u2019s self-made decisions are what\u2019s best for him.",
    "Still, he\u2019s unlikely to admit to missing his former soccer coach and teammates. Based on his brief appearance in season 2\u2019s premiere, Jamie is as narcissistic and cocky as he was in season 1. Dunster, though, believes that it\u2019s all a front on Jamie\u2019s part to hide his deep-seated insecurities, which Ted was seemingly getting to the crux of before Jamie\u2019s Richmond departure.",
    "\u201cJamie spent the first season tussling with emotional growth and doing some emotional heavy lifting for the first time in his life,\u201d Dunster admits. \u201cHis shift in location [back to Manchester City] means that he\u2019s no longer around those people who were helping him try to grow. I think by doing that [emotional growth] on his own, by this point, he's been trying too hard and he\u2019s tired of doing it, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we see him at this crossroads [in his life].\u201d",
    "Despite its uplifting and heartwarming moments, Ted Lasso doesn\u2019t shy away from real world issues at the centre of the so-called \u2018beautiful game\u2019.",
    "The alarming rise in online discrimination towards soccer players, particularly England\u2019s Black footballers following the UEFA Euro 2020 final, made headlines across the globe and saw Sudeikis sport a sweater in support of those who were racially abused.",
    "It isn\u2019t, though, the only unwelcome aspect of the world\u2019s most popular sport. Sexism and homophobia, among other prejudices, are also rife throughout the game and, in many instances, they appear to boil down to one major societal issue that has been prevalent in recent years: toxic masculinity.",
    "It\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been explored in Ted Lasso before. During season 1\u2019s finale, Ted is shocked to overhear Jamie\u2019s dad scream \u2013 and physically abuse \u2013 his son for assisting Manchester City\u2019s winning goal rather than scoring himself. It makes for hard viewing and, unsurprisingly, leaves its mark on Ted and Jamie.",
    "Jamie\u2019s brief appearance in season 2\u2019s first episode, then, is his way of trying to escape his father\u2019s soccer-based mistreatment by removing it from his life, albeit temporarily.",
    "For Dunster, the examination of such difficult subject matter is what sets Ted Lasso apart from its contemporaries.",
    "As he puts it, Ted Lasso isn\u2019t a show that\u2019s eternally positive. By reckoning with tough topics, he hopes that viewers recognize that, much like the graft that Ted and Richmond\u2019s squad have to put in to become better players, hard work and education are required to try and eradicate these issues from soccer and society as a whole.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a phrase in the show that goes \u2018be curious, not judgmental\u2019, and it\u2019s so powerful and profound,\u201d Dunster says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple thing but it\u2019s difficult to put into practise. As a series, you see us challenge things like toxic masculinity and mental health, but one of the things that the show does really well is it looks at them in an obtuse way. We\u2019re not going \u2018Oh, that toxic masculinity is real\u2019; the writers and creators look at it through a sense of vulnerability and understanding. Hopefully that comes across to the audience.\u201d",
    "Even though his soccer career is temporarily on the back burner, Jamie\u2019s love for the game still shines through. His unashamed \u2018I\u2019m the island\u2019s top scorer \u2013 sexually!\u2019 comment in episode 1 teases the prospect of a return to the field in the future. So what can Dunster tell us about Jamie\u2019s next steps? Is a Richmond return on the cards, for instance?",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ll see a more emotionally evolved character [in season 2],\u201d Dunster teases without giving much away. \u201cI think Jamie will continue to tussle with his issues as we go forward and, just maybe, start to understand that the work is rarely finished.\u201d",
