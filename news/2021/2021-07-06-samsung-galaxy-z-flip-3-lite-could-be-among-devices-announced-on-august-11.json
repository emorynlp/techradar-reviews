    "August 11 looks to be a big day for Samsung, as rumors suggest it's when we\u2019ll see the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, and potentially other devices. But yet another phone is now rumored to be in the mix, namely the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 Lite.",
    "That\u2019s according to The Korea Herald, citing industry sources, and if true it could help make foldable phones a lot more affordable. The Galaxy Z Flip range is already cheaper than the Galaxy Z Fold range, and a Lite model would be cheaper still, though an exact price hasn\u2019t been put forward here.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting however that this claim should be taken with a serious helping of salt, as while there have been occasional rumors of a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 Lite, it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve heard much about, and recently Ross Young (a leaker with a good track record) claimed that the Galaxy Z Flip 3 Lite had been canceled due to the ongoing chipset shortage.",
    "Still, even if we don\u2019t get a Galaxy Z Flip 3 Lite, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 itself could be cheaper than its predecessor. Several leaks have pointed in this direction, including a recent one from leaker @FrontTron, who claimed that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G will cost $1,249 (around \u00a3900 / AU$1,650) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.",
    "For reference, the original Galaxy Z Flip sold for $1,380 / \u00a31,300 / AU$1,800, so this would be a significant reduction if true.",
    "We should find out soon, because all signs point to Samsung announcing its upcoming devices in August \u2013 originally we thought August 3, but both The Korea Times and another recent report now point to August 11.",
