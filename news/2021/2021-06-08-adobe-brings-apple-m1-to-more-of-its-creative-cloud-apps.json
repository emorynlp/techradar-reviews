    "Only a day after Apple\u2019s announcements at WWDC, Adobe has now announced native M1 support for three of its applications for Apple\u2019s M1 Macs, including the recently-released iMac and its assorted colors.",
    "Only last month Adobe Audition was updated to include M1 support, which works from Apple\u2019s Silicon chips rather than Intel\u2019s that has significant performance gains across the Creative Cloud suite.",
    "While Premiere Pro is still in beta testing for the M1 chips, it\u2019s a significant June update for Adobe that brings huge speed improvements to the three apps.",
    "Adobe is fast approaching having all of its Creative Cloud suite of apps running natively on Apple\u2019s M1 Macs. While there weren\u2019t any new MacBooks announced at the WWDC keynote, it still means that these updates bring over 80% faster speeds when working on a project.",
    "Lightroom Classic, Illustrator and InDesign now all run on Apple\u2019s M1 chip, but there\u2019s even more updates across the board:",
    "While M1 support is the headline feature in Adobe\u2019s June update, it\u2019s great to see custom brushes now appear on the iPad version of Photoshop, alongside new retouching features in Photoshop Express.",
    "The June update is now available in the Creative Cloud hub. Go to the \u2018Updates Available\u2019 option and once the June 2021 update appears, click Update and it will download and install, ready for you to use the M1 versions of Lightroom Classic, Illustrator and InDesign."
