    "Mobile Devices and Tablets:",

    "Connected TVs, Game Consoles, and Streaming Devices:",
    "Disney Plus supports all Fire TV devices and all Fire TV Edition Smart TVs (read here for how to set up the Amazon Fire TV Stick), while watching via Apple AirPlay requires Apple TV to be running tvOS 11.0 or higher.

    "You can download the streaming service's app to as many of your devices as you want. But! A single membership will only let you stream from four devices simultaneously.",
    "As our Disney Plus price comparison guide shows, that\u2019s actually pretty brilliant considering the modest monthly fee ($7.99, or \u00a37.99 in the UK, $11.99 in Canada, \u20ac8.99 in eurozone countries, and $11.99 in Australia). It's more than either Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu or HBO Max allow, yet less costly than all but Hulu. Plus, the monthly fee could potentially be split four ways...",
    "You can also download content to up to 10 mobile devices and watch offline, so you could squeeze even more value from the platform. As long as each device has sufficient storage space, there\u2019s the potential for large households to have 10 members watching Disney Plus films or shows offline, downloaded over a Wi-Fi connection beforehand."
