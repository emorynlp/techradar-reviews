    "James Bond has become synonymous with saving the world. The iconic spy has spent the past 59 years \u2013 cinematically at least \u2013 foiling numerous world-ending plots in the most stylish manner possible.",
    "Now, 007 has a new mission: reviving the theater-going experience. With the film industry still reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s impact, Bond\u2019s latest outing, No Time to Die, is viewed by many as the movie that\u2019ll jumpstart the global box office.",
    "Cinemagoers have high expectations, too. The spy-thriller is Daniel Craig\u2019s final turn as Bond, so fans are expecting No Time to Die to provide a suitable end to his time as 007. The film\u2019s 18-month long delay, thanks to the pandemic, has also heightened the need for another stellar entry in the film series.",
    "So, was it worth the wait, and is it actually good? In short, yes to both. No Time to Die is a fitting finale to the Daniel Craig era, one which provides a wonderful send-off for an actor who\u2019s certainly left his gritty, realistic mark on the franchise. Unfortunately, the film is let down by a few major flaws that prevent it from being a top-tier Bond movie, or even the best during Craig\u2019s run.",
    "No Time to Die opens with Bond having retired from active service (yes, again) and spending quality time with girlfriend Dr. Madeleine Swann (L\u00e9a Seydoux). When the pair\u2019s past comes back to haunt them, though, Bond teams up with old friend and CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) to put a stop to a new global threat led by the mysterious Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek).",
    "If that wasn\u2019t enough for Bond to deal with, teaming up with the CIA puts him at odds with his former MI6 employers, including new 007 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch).",
    "No Time to Die uses the backdrop of these clashing factions to build a tense and thrilling plot. It\u2019s unusual to see a rogue Bond (yes, again) duke it out against MI6, and it leads to some unexpected alliances \u2013 albeit brief ones \u2013 that offer a unique spin on the Bond formula. Unsurprisingly, Bond and MI6 eventually make peace and join forces once more but, for a time, it\u2019s compelling to watch them fight over the same target.",
    "Speaking of fighting, No Time to Die\u2019s action sequences are a traditional mix of vehicular fights, shootouts, and close-quarters combat. The majority are standard fare for a Bond flick, but they\u2019re delightfully fun nonetheless. One sequence set inside a stairwell, filmed in one continuous shot, is a particular highlight and pushes Bond to his physical limits. Given that the fictional spy (along with Daniel Craig) is older than he was in Bond\u2019s last film Spectre, it\u2019s impressive to see that his physicality hasn't diminished.",
    "Craig isn\u2019t the only standout performer in No Time to Die. Yes, it\u2019s his final hurrah as Bond, so it stands to reason that the film is primarily focused on him \u2013 and sets about tying up loose plot threads that extend all the way back to his first outing in Casino Royale.",
    "To simply laud Craig\u2019s performance, though, does a disservice to the rest of the film\u2019s cast. All of No Time to Die\u2019s new characters are excellent, save for Malek\u2019s Safin (more on this later), and bring levity to a film that might've seemed too serious in the trailers.",
    "Lynch revels in her role as MI6\u2019s new 007, Nomi. The dynamic between her and Craig\u2019s Bond is one of the old guard brushing up against the new blood, and the chemistry exhibited by the pair is natural and realistic. It\u2019s intriguing to see Bond pair up with her later on too, and relinquish his usual \u2018lone wolf\u2019 role in favor of being a team player in the film\u2019s third act.",
    "Ana de Armas\u2019 CIA agent Paloma, too, is a superb addition. The brevity of her character\u2019s appearance is slightly disappointing, especially when Paloma steals every scene she\u2019s in. Still, her role in proceedings contributes to one of No Time to Die\u2019s best action sequences in and around a Cuba-based stakeout. Much like Lynch and Craig\u2019s rapport, de Armas\u2019 on-screen relationship with the film\u2019s lead is top drawer and provides plenty of humorous moments.",
    "As for Seydoux, who reprises her role as Swann from 2015\u2019s Spectre, No Time to Die provides an opportunity to dig deeper into her character\u2019s backstory. The movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a chilling, horror-driven start \u2013 spotlights her history, and the entire film unravels her motives in real detail. It\u2019s pleasing to see Swann receive more character development than she did in Spectre, particularly as she ends up being such a key component of No Time to Die\u2019s overarching narrative.",
    "Unsurprisingly, Bond and Swann\u2019s relationship is the emotional heart of the film. There\u2019s a side to Bond here that we haven\u2019t seen since his ill-fated association with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale. It continues to show how flawed Bond is as a character and, in a way, it brings the titular hero\u2019s arc full circle, which is rather apt as Craig wraps up his run.",
    "Riveting and suspenseful as No Time to Die is, it isn\u2019t without its issues.",
    "For one, it doesn\u2019t make good use of Malek\u2019s Safin. The Mr. Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody star does a good job with the material he\u2019s given, but Safin isn\u2019t afforded the same level of development as some of the movie's other characters. In essence, he becomes a sideshow to No Time to Die\u2019s wider narrative and feels shoehorned into the flick for the sake of having an antagonist. Considering the Craig era has had its share of superb villains, Safin is a disappointing and underwhelming final foe for Bond to deal with.",
    "No Time to Die\u2019s runtime, too, is simultaneously too long and too short. It\u2019s the longest Bond movie ever \u2013 clocking in at 163 minutes \u2013 but overall, it doesn\u2019t make good use of that time.",
    "There aren\u2019t enough minutes to allow the film\u2019s supporting cast to shine (outside of a couple of moments for Ben Whishaw\u2019s Q) or provide newcomers like de Armas or Malek with enough screen time to show off their obvious talents. Equally, No Time to Die is often bogged down by a bit too much exposition: a slightly odd criticism to level at the film that doesn\u2019t actually do a stellar job of explaining its plot.",
    "No Time to Die\u2019s ending also feels anticlimactic and abrupt, despite having real emotional impact. Craig\u2019s five Bond movies have all been leading up to this point and, while it makes for a powerful send-off, it\u2019s somewhat lacking. It ends on a sombre note and doesn\u2019t come across as a celebration of Craig\u2019s time portraying the legendary spy. He gets his moment in the sun, sure, but we expected more as this particular spectacle drew to a close.",
    "No Time to Die is largely the send-off that Daniel Craig deserves. It\u2019s a genuinely fun, humorous, tension-filled and poignant final movie of this Bond era that exhibits the character\u2019s evolution over the past 15 years.",
    "Is it the best movie in Craig\u2019s slate of Bond movies? No, Skyfall and Casino Royale were more cohesive, captivating entries in the series. And, due to its noticeable problems with runtime and plotting, No Time to Die falls short of their lofty heights.",
    "Still, No Time to Die is a finale befitting Craig\u2019s 007 journey. Perhaps more importantly for the movie industry, it will entice people back to the cinema. Plenty of ordinary film fans won\u2019t care for its at-times outlandish story or unappealing villain but, even if some take exception to these problems, they don\u2019t make it a bad movie. It\u2019s still good \u2013 just not an all-time great.",
    "No Time to Die is bold, touching, filled with panache and, above all, enjoyable. And, ultimately, that\u2019s what a Bond film should be.",
    "No Time to Die arrives in theaters on September 30 in the UK and October 8 in the US."
