  "article": [
    "After a day using the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, I\u2019m in love. It\u2019s the best clamshell foldable we\u2019ve seen yet, and it\u2019s affordable enough compared to other foldables to actually recommend to consumers.",
    "Not everyone can afford the Z Flip 3\u2019s $999 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,499 price tag, and it\u2019s easy to imagine that if consumers are going to pay so much, they might want more functionality from a different (non-folding) phone \u2013 for the same price, you can get the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus\u2019 30x \u2018Space Zoom\u2019 telephoto capability, or the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s processing power and iOS interface, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra\u2019s stylus functionality.",
    "Heck, if you go to our current hands-on of the Z Flip 3 written by my colleagues in the UK, you\u2019ll hear the exact same thing: you\u2019re better served paying the same price for more in a traditional \u2018flat\u2019 phone. Even TechRadar is of divided mind.",
    "But that\u2019s a good premise to couch my impressions of the phone: it will impress some, but still won\u2019t be enough for others. And that comes down to the form factor. What will you pay for the ability to fold your phone in half?",
    "I personally think it\u2019s worth the trade-off, so long as you\u2019re not leaning on the phone for dynamic photos, and don\u2019t need your phone\u2019s battery to last you longer than a day. But I also think that I, like many others, am excited for foldables to simply change how we use our phones every day. I cringe at my screen-time report knowing that it\u2019s just me staring intently into a glass rectangle for hours per day \u2013 the Z Flip 3 at least shakes up how I\u2019m holding, pocketing, using, and previewing via the exterior screen on my phone.",
    "With updated specs (Snapdragon 888, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage to start) and a 1.9-inch external display, the Z Flip 3 is a better version of the original Samsung Galaxy Z Flip (which had a tiny 1.1-inch outer screen that could show a single line of text). Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like to use.",
    "I was one of the first media to see the original Motorola Razr at an event in November 2019 just before it launched, and I still appreciate its design flourishes, like the satisfying \u2018snap\u2019 when folding it close. And the 2.6-inch exterior screen is still the best among clamshell foldables (a category of just the Razr and Z Flip phones at present, to be fair), especially with the exterior screen app functionality that was expanded in the Motorola Razr 2020.",
    "That\u2019s still true. The Z Flip 3\u2019s 1.9-inch outer screen is four times larger than its predecessor\u2019s, but aside from adding more room for notifications, the app functionality is pretty limited to audio controls, weather, and a few other first-party controls \u2013 I can\u2019t, for example, reply to a Twitter DM or Slack message. On the other hand, the screen is large enough to preview your selfies, which is great.",
    "One of the first things anyone should do with a Z Flip 3 is something you can only do with a Samsung foldable: unfold the phone 90\u00ba and mess around with different apps, which split into top-and-bottom sections thanks to Flex Mode. Deployed this way, the Z Flip 3 looks like a makeup compact, but it\u2019s a great way to take relaxed selfies with friends (no awkward angles required) and listen to media.",
    "Yes, watching media this way on the top half of the 6.7-inch Full HD Plus AMOLED display doesn\u2019t fit how videos are formatted these days (for wide, not square, screens), so the picture is going to be small with big black bars on top and bottom. If you want to watch something, you\u2019re going to have a bad time. But if you want to listen \u2013 say, to your favorite YouTuber or Twitch stream \u2013 and don\u2019t need constant video, it\u2019s great to just prop the Z Flip 3 up and listen while you fold laundry or play games.",
    "Sure, you can unfold the phone to watch video in a widescreen format, but you either have to prop it up on something like a normal candybar (flat) phone or hold it \u2013 and in the latter case, your hand might cover the bottom-firing speaker. There\u2019s a slightly janky workaround: just bend the phone a bit until it stays upright on its side. Even though that leaves the picture a bit bent in turn, it\u2019s at least an option.",
    "Being able to fold the Z Flip 3 up and slip it into a pant or bag pocket is great, full stop. While I\u2019d hope the glass back and outer screen doesn\u2019t get scratched up when I throw the phone in with my keys, wallet, and other things, at least I don\u2019t have to worry about the inner display getting damaged.",
    "This makes the Z Flip 3 a great phone to take on a workout. Whether that\u2019s running with the phone (yes, I carry my phone in hand when jogging, and I have no defense) or toting it around the gym, I don\u2019t have to worry as much about it as I do a \u2018flat\u2019 phone, which I have to place face-up or face-down with its display exposed.",
    "While I haven\u2019t physically tested the Z Flip 3\u2019s ruggedness (Samsung claims its hinge is 10% more durable than its predecessor), it is nice to know the phone has the same IPX8 water resistance as the Z Fold 3, allowing it to be submerged in hip-deep (1.5 meter) water for half an hour without coming to harm \u2013 though I\u2019ll be sure to avoid dropping it in salt water or pool water, as recommended. The phone also isn\u2019t dust-resistant (hence \u2018IPX8\u2019 instead of \u2018IP68\u2019 rating in other phones), as the hinge is still a vector of entry for physical particles to potentially muck up the foldable.",
    "In other words, my first 24 hours with the Z Flip 3 has been filled with, well, pretty mundane activities: watching media, carrying the phone around, and figuring out how to fit it into my lifestyle. I\u2019ve only taken a few photos, more to try out Flex Mode than measure the Flip 3\u2019s photo capabilities against the other heavy hitters at its price point. I also haven\u2019t tested the battery, which already feels as limited as the battery in its predecessors \u2013 it took just under 1.5 hours to charge 80% of the Z Flip 3\u2019s 3,300mAh battery, and that was using a 60W charger.",
    "In any case, there\u2019s a lot left to discover about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, and we\u2019re eager to give it a full review \u2013 but after 24 hours, we\u2019re excited to see what it can teach us about using phones differently."
