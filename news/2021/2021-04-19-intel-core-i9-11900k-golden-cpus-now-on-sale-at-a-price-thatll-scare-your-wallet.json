  "article": [
    "If you want a \u2018golden sample\u2019 of Intel\u2019s Core i9-11900K, then it\u2019ll set you back a rather eye-watering $880 (around \u00a3635 or AU$1,130) over in the US.",
    "That\u2019s if you buy the Rocket Lake flagship from Silicon Lottery, the supplier which resells cherry-picked CPUs that are guaranteed to reach certain speeds (known as pre-binned chips). All processors are made to a minimum spec, but some models \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky \u2013 can run a sizeable chunk faster when you try to overclock them.",
    "As mentioned, the fastest pre-binned CPU that Silicon Lottery offers guarantees that the 11900K will run at an all-core boost speed of 5.1GHz when overclocked (the default all-core clock speed is 4.8GHz, so that\u2019s 300MHz faster).",
    "Silicon Lottery notes that of the 11900K chips it has bought in, 29% of them were top-end overclockers capable of 5.1GHz. The retailer also sells 11900K CPUs which are guaranteed for 5GHz across all-cores for $700 (around \u00a3505 or AU$900), and 4.9GHz chips are $620 (around \u00a3445 or AU$800).",
    "Most of the Rocket Lake flagship processors \u2013 73% of them, almost three-quarters \u2013 are capable of a 5GHz all-core overclock, so that theoretically bodes well for folks taking their chances and simply buying a plain CPU from a normal retailer.",
    "Silicon Lottery also offers Intel Core i5-11600K CPUs starting at $250 (around \u00a3180 or AU$320) for a 4.8GHz model, with 4.9GHz and 5GHz chips on sale too (you\u2019ll pay $340 \u2013 which is around \u00a3245 or AU$440 \u2013 for the latter).",
    "For the swiftest Core i9-11900K, you\u2019ll fork out 63% more than the recommended price for that 300MHz increase in speed, which is a steep ask for the extra performance \u2013 but then again, folks with plenty of money to throw at their PC probably won\u2019t bat an eyelid.",
    "Silicon Lottery guarantees that CPUs will be stable at their advertised overclocked speed \u2013 with \u2018rigorous\u2019 stress testing applied before they go on sale \u2013 but with the caveats that certain specified settings must be used, as well as certain qualified components. You get a one-year warranty and a \u201cone-time replacement for any defects or malfunctions that may develop over time\u201d (but things like physical damage to the CPU aren\u2019t covered, unsurprisingly).",
    "Also worth noting is that Intel has discontinued its overclocking insurance (Performance Tuning Protection Plan) as of the launch of its Rocket Lake range, apparently due to its lack of popularity.",
