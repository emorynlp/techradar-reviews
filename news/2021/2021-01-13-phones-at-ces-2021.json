  "article": [
    "While CES 2021 is certainly different than usual, plenty of phones have been revealed that are headed for retail shelves this year \u2013 and a few futuristic concepts have been teased, too. Here\u2019s all the phones at CES 2021, from today\u2019s best to tomorrow\u2019s most promising ideas.",
    "Let\u2019s limit your expectations up front: plenty of phonemakers have effectively sat out CES 2021, so don\u2019t expect to see lineups or teases from LG, Xiaomi, Huawei, or others. But other brands have gone on undeterred, with Motorola and TCL revealing new budget and mid-range handsets \u2013 including the cheapest 5G phones we\u2019ve seen in the US so far.",
    "And, of course, Samsung has jumped ahead of its typical release schedule to unveil its new lineup of flagship phones. While these may not strictly by CES 2021 announcements, rumors suggest we're about to see the Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra on January 14. These will be the first top-tier devices of the year, and set the tone for 2021\u2019s best phones.",
    "But there are some neat phone concepts at CES 2021, too \u2013 mostly in the form of rollables, which extend the display sideways to get the kind of screen real estate we\u2019ve only seen in foldables. Several phonemakers are showing off their rollables at CES, and unsurprisingly, they\u2019re the same brands that unveiled rollable full-size TVs in years prior.",
    "So here they are: the biggest phones at CES 2021, and despite this year\u2019s all-digital show, we\u2019ve actually gotten our hands on some of them.",
    "Motorola showed off this year\u2019s G-series phones, some of which had already been released in some form as the G9 line in other regions. But we\u2019re seeing the others for the first time, like the Moto G Stylus 2021 and the Motorola One 5G Ace.",
    "The latter is a refinement of the Motorola One 5G, but with a few trimmed features, the Motorola One 5G Ace comes in as one of the most affordable 5G phones we\u2019ve seen thus far with a starting price of $399 (around \u00a3294 / AU$514). With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G chipset, 6GB of RAM (in the US version), a triple rear camera (48MP main/8MP ultra-wide/2MP macro), and 5,000mAh battery, it\u2019s the mid-range 5G phone to beat.",
    "The Moto G Stylus has some slight refinements on the 2019 model (which was Motorola\u2019s first G-series stylus phone): a larger 6.8-inch Full HD Plus display (presumably LCD like its predecessor), Snapdragon 678 chipset, the same-size 4,000mAh battery, and a similar triple rear camera array (48MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro). The software has been improved, however, with more features (like splitting the screen to draw on half with an app open in the other half).",
    "The other two models are different versions of phones released in late 2020 in other regions: the Moto G Power, for instance, costs $199 (around \u00a3146 / AU$), which is somewhat cheaper than the higher-specced Moto G9 Power\u2019s \u00a3179 price. Likewise, the Moto G Play costs $169 (around \u00a3124 / AU$217), which is less powerful but cheaper than the G9 Play\u2019s \u00a3159 (roughly $210, AU$290) price.",
    "TCL introduced its first line of branded phones at CES 2020 last year, and it\u2019s following up with its new TCL 20 line of handsets \u2013 but only two out of five it\u2019s planning to announce in the near future. These two are its leading affordable model as well as its new cheap 5G phone, which will likely go against the Motorola One 5G Ace and other phones in an increasingly competitive mid-range 5G phone niche.",
    "The TCL 20 5G has a 6.67-inch LCD Full HD display, Snapdragon 695G chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 4,500mAh battery, and a triple rear camera (48MP main, ultra-wide, and depth sensor). And, obviously, 5G connectivity.",
    "The TCL 20 SE, also introduced, is a budget phone with a Snapdragon 460, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, but its huge 6.8-inch display, triple rear camera (48MP main, 5MP wide-angle with 117-degree FoV, and 2MP macro) with a 2MP depth sensor, and 5,000mAh battery make it a great affordable option.",
    "Sadly, we don\u2019t know how much the TCL 20 5G or 20 SE will cost nor their release dates, and have no idea when we\u2019ll see the other phones in the TCL 20 lineup.",
    "Foldables are so passe; the new hotness that TCL and Oppo have teased in concepts through 2020 are rollable phones, which roll out to expand a phone\u2019s display in a way that supposedly won\u2019t leave creases. At CES 2021, we didn\u2019t just hear about new rollables \u2013 we heard about one that could be coming out this year.",
    "That\u2019s the LG Rollable, which was featured in the brand\u2019s CES video, and which sources told CNET is coming out sometime in 2021. LG itself wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny the news, only giving anofficial statement: \u201cLG Rollable was previewed at CES 2021. Stay tuned for more details on LG Mobile's exciting 2021 portfolio.\u201d",
    "During a preview for its TCL 20 series of phones, TCL affirmed that its rollable phone is still in development \u2013 and during its CES 2021 presentation, the brand showed off two new rollable concepts: one that rolls upward to make the phone taller and a wide scroll-like display that unfurled to a 17-inch display, which would reach laptop-size screen dimensions.",
    "TCL showed off working tech demos of the vertical rollable and the scrolling display in tweets, demonstrating that, while they aren\u2019t implemented in market-ready phones yet, they\u2019re certainly on the way.",
    "CES 2021 will be the last big tech show for months now that we know MWC 2021 \u2013 which we\u2019d expect to occur at the end of February in a normal year \u2013 won\u2019t be held until the end of June. That means we won\u2019t have another big event for phonemakers to plan their device announcements around for half a year.",
    "In lieu of the usual release window, brands will just have to release phones on their own schedule. We\u2019ve already seen that with the Moto G phones, which have previously been unveiled during or after MWC, but which were shown off at CES 2021 \u2013 and this could be a boon for smaller phone makers who typically fight for attention during Mobile World Congress, the year\u2019s biggest phone event.",
    "Conversely, it could pressure brands to speed up their announcements and snag all the press instead of waiting until the usual February launch window. Which seems to be what Samsung is doing this year, as it\u2019s slated to reveal its Galaxy S21 phones on January 14 as CES 2021 wraps up. Which leads us to\u2026",
    "Yes, the Samsung Galaxy S21 phones are being revealed during CES. While it\u2019s not at CES, or not specifically affiliated, it\u2019s no coincidence that one of the biggest phone companies is releasing its new lineup of flagship handsets on the last day of the tech show... which is over a month earlier than we\u2019d expect.",
    "We\u2019re expecting three phones to come out of the January 14 launch event: the standard Samsung Galaxy S21, the larger Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus, and the top-specced Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Samsung\u2019s own teases point to a new design that ditches a camera block for a whole glossy-finished corner to house the rear cameras \u2013 in a vertical line for the S21 and S21 Plus, and a double column for the S21 Ultra.",
    "All the phones are rumored to cost less than last year\u2019s Samsung S20 line, but might compromise on some features, too \u2013 notably, the S21 and S21 Plus may have displays that max out at Full HD, with only the S21 Ultra packing a WQHD resolution screen. Conversely, the premium S21 Ultra may have even more features justifying its price, like running WQHD resolution and 120Hz refresh rate at the same time and packing an S Pen stylus.",
    "We\u2019ll know for sure what the S21 line will bring when it launches on January 14, which will make Samsung\u2019s new phones the first flagships to arrive in 2021, setting the standard (and expected prices) for the year\u2019s handsets."
