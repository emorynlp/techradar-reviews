    "Apple boss Tim Cook has dropped some hints as to the state of the company\u2019s much-anticipated Apple Car project.",
    "In an interview with the New York Times, Cook was expectedly evasive when probed about Apple\u2019s autonomous vehicle plans, but nonetheless acknowledged the existence of in-development self-driving technology.",
    "\u201cIn terms of the work that we\u2019re doing [in that field], obviously, I\u2019m going to be a little coy on that,\u201d Cook said, before adding, \u201cThe autonomy itself is a core technology\u2026 If you step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there\u2019s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we\u2019ll see what Apple does.\u201d",
    "Cook was then pushed on the question of whether the Apple Car \u2013 officially known as Project Titan \u2013 would end up being a fully-fledged vehicle or software-based project. \u201cWe love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that\u2019s where the magic occurs. And so that\u2019s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that\u2019s around that.\u201d",
    "While Cook and Apple are evidently reluctant to share details surrounding their plans for autonomous technology, his failure to deny that the project will focus on a self-driving car suggests Apple is still entertaining the prospect of producing an on-the-road vehicle, rather than merely an in-car operating system to be distributed among existing auto manufacturers.",
    "Tellingly, Cook also caveated his comments by saying: \u201cWe investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day. I\u2019m not saying that one will not.\u201d It\u2019s clear, then, that something is going on over at Apple \u2013 we just don\u2019t know exactly what yet.",
    "Ironically, Cook\u2019s suggestion that Apple \u201clove[s] to own [its] primary technology\u201d points to the central problem the company has faced in its failed efforts to partner with an auto manufacturer on its vehicle project.",
    "Despite being widely-considered the most successful business in the world, Apple's expertise lies in tech development, not automotive manufacturing. That means it needs help from another organisation if it hopes to build a road vehicle, but it would seem that the big car brands have been unwilling to become a bit-part supplier \u2013 in the same way Foxconn is to Tesla \u2013 on a vehicle that would ultimately bear the Apple name.",
    "This seems to be the reason why Apple\u2019s partnership talks with the likes of Hyundai, Kia and Nissan came to an abrupt halt. As for the latter, a recent report from the Financial Times suggests \"contact was brief and the discussions did not advance to senior management levels following divisions over branding\" \u2013 which tells you everything you need to know about the point of contention between both Apple and the manufacturers it hopes to partner with.",
    "Tim Cook\u2019s latest comments \u2013 while undoubtedly significant given the relative silence surrounding the project until now \u2013 still don\u2019t suggest the Apple Car vision will become a reality any time soon.",
    "Company analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently claimed that the Apple Car might not be launched until 2028 or later, given the continued impasse in negotiations, so expect to be waiting a long while to see it on the road.",
