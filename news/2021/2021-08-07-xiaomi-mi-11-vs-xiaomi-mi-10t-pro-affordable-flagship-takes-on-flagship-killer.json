    "Xiaomi has made quite an impression in recent years for its ability to turn in flagship-level phones for less money than its rivals.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 11 is the most recent example, offering a level of performance, display quality, and design excellence that makes you look twice at the price. But then, the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro impressed us just as much a mere handful of months prior - and for an even cheaper price to boot.",
    "So which Xiaomi Mi phone is better? Which would represent the smarter buy if you were shopping for a new phone today?",
    "When you release as many phones as Xiaomi does in a calendar year, things can get a little congested.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 11 was first announced in China on December 28, 2020. That was just three months after the September 30 announcement of the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro.",
    "The Mi 11 received a global launch in February 2021, while the Mi 10T Pro hit the UK in November 2020. As you can see, there\u2019s very little between these phones when it comes to length of time on the market.",
    "In terms of pricing, the Xiaomi Mi 11 starts from \u00a3749 / AU$1,099 (around $1,057) for the 128GB model, while a 256GB model is available for \u00a3799 (around $1,128). The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro launched at a price of \u00a3599 (roughly $780, AU$1,100), which makes it \u00a3200 cheaper even before you take discounts into consideration.",
    "Neither of these phones is being sold in the US, though, so American readers will have to go through an importer if you\u2019re intent on buying one.",
    "Both phones have glass to the front and rear, sandwiching an aluminum body. However, the Xiaomi Mi 11 is the sleeker, more curvaceous, more overtly \u2018premium\u2019 phone of the two.",
    "At 164.3 x 74.6mm, the Mi 11\u2019s footprint is a little smaller than the 165.1 x 76.4mm Mi 10T Pro. But the big difference here is thickness and weight - the Mi 11 is just 8.1mm thin and 196g, while the Mi 10T Pro is pretty hefty at 9.3mm and 218g.",
    "The Mi 11 also has a more unique design, with a pleasant rounded-square camera module that sets it apart from the crowd. The Mi 10T Pro has a rather more workmanlike appearance, with a chunky camera module that \u201clooks like a cyclops staring back at you,\u201d according to our reviewer.",
    "There\u2019s a different approach to biometric authentication here too. While the Mi 11 has an in-display system more commonly seen in flagship phones, the Mi 10T Pro goes with a side-mounted solution. We actually prefer the Mi 10T Pro on this one, as the Mi 11 sensor proves a little unreliable.",
    "Another interesting design difference, which leads us neatly into the next section, is the shape of the display. While the cheaper Mi 10T Pro goes for a dead flat screen, the Mi 11 curves off at the edges. Like we said, it\u2019s the more premium-looking phone of the two.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 11\u2019s screen is one of the best on the market. It\u2019s a 6.81-inch OLED beauty, with a 1440 x 3200 (QHD+) resolution.",
    "Conversely, the Mi 10T Pro is a 6.67-inch LCD display with a FHD+ resolution. It\u2019s simply less vibrant as a result, with grayer blacks and less accurate colors. It also doesn\u2019t get anywhere near as bright (650 nits vs 1500 nits, if you\u2019re wondering).",
    "The Mi 10T Pro display hits back when it comes to refresh rate, somewhat surprisingly. While the Mi 11 can manage 120Hz at the same time as hitting that QHD resolution, the Mi 10T Pro goes right up to 144Hz.",
    "Outside of a few gaming smartphones, such a fluid refresh rate is practically unheard of. Its practical application is quite limited, though you\u2019ll never have zoomed through your social media feeds quite so rapidly.",
    "Before you hardcore gamers slap down your money on a new Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro, consider the matter of touch sampling rates. At 480Hz the Xiaomi Mi 11 screen obliterates its older brother on 180Hz for sheer responsiveness.",
    "In short, while the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro has that stand-out refresh rate, we\u2019d take the Xiaomi Mi 11\u2019s more balanced display offering any day of the week.",
    "These two phones are surprisingly different considering their shared brand and similar vintage. But the one area of potential hardware asset sharing would appear to be the cameras.",
    "Both phones are led by 108MP 1/1.33\" Samsung image sensors, though delve a little deeper and you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re not identical. The Xiaomi Mi 11 uses a newer Samsung ISOCELL HM3 sensor, which is the same sensor used in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, and is technically more advanced than the Samsung ISOCELL HMX sensor used by the Mi 10T Pro.",
    "Another difference, this time ostensibly in favor of the Mi 10T Pro, is the latter\u2019s uses a wider f/1.7 aperture compared to the f/1.9 Mi 11. This means it can let more light in to hit that sensor, though the benefits of this aren\u2019t always so clear-cut.",
    "Besides this, both phones have underwhelming 13MP f/2.4 ultra-wide sensors with unusually wide 123-degree fields of view, as well as 5MP macro cameras. They even have similar 20MP selfie cameras.",
    "If you\u2019re eagle-eyed, you\u2019ll have spotted that neither phone has a telephoto lens. That\u2019s way more forgivable in the Mi 10T Pro, which costs a fair amount less.",
    "Both phones take crisp, balanced shots, utilizing Xiaomi\u2019s AI image processing smarts and pixel-binning techniques. Thanks to OIS, both can remain relatively steady for Night shots.",
    "OIS will also benefit video capture. Talking of which, both phones can manage 8K video at 30fps or 4K video at 60fps.",
    "All in all, neither of these phones really stands out for its camera offering, but both offer pretty good results in most conditions. We\u2019d possibly give the Mi 11 the edge for its more advanced main sensor, but you might expect more of an advantage given the price premium.",
    "While they were only released a couple of months apart, the Xiaomi Mi 11 is a whole generation ahead when it comes to performance.",
    "The newer, more expensive phone pack a Snapdragon 888 SoC from Qualcomm. This is the 2021 replacement for the Snapdragon 865 found in the Mi 10T Pro.",
    "You\u2019ll get 8GB or 12GB of RAM with the Mi 11, whereas the Mi 10T Pro only offers 8GB.",
    "In the CPU-focused Geekbench 5, a multi-core score of 3569 for the Mi 11 pips the Mi 10T Pro by around 200 to 300 points, so it\u2019s not a seismic difference. In general usage, you probably won\u2019t even be able to spot the difference. Any contrast you do pick up on will probably come down to that differing display technology.",
    "When it comes to storage, both phones come in both 128GB and 256GB guises. Neither offers a microSD slot.",
    "While both phones pack stereo speakers, only the Mi 11 benefits from the expertise of audio specialist Harman Kardon. It sounds better as a result.",
    "In terms of software, both phones lean on Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI, with its garish icons, its busy menus, and it\u2019s excessive bloatware. It\u2019s a lot better than it used to be, but if you prioritize clean and considered software over all else, neither of these phones is for you.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 11 runs on a 4600 mAh battery, while the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro packs a much larger 5,000 mAh cell. So that explains why the latter is such a chunky monkey.",
    "Our reviewer found that the Xiaomi Mi 11 would burn through its charge in short time, only managing to last through a full day if they kept their usage to the minimum. It\u2019s not terrible by the standard of modern flagship phones, but it\u2019s also far from the best.",
    "Xiaomi\u2019s brute force approach with the Mi 10T Pro really pays off, as it lasts noticeably longer than the Mi 11. Some of that advantage can be pinned to the 10T Pro\u2019s smaller, dimmer and less sharp display as well.",
    "Whatever the reason behind it, we were unable to exhaust the Mi 10T Pro\u2019s battery in a day, no matter how much gaming, photography or video or music streaming we did. It\u2019s impressive stuff.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 11 wins some points back when it comes to recharging. Its rapid 55W wired charger, which is supplied in the box, will get you from 0 to 100% in around half an hour. By contrast, the Mi 10T Pro\u2019s 33W charger will take closer to an hour.",
    "Elsewhere, the Mi 11 supports fast 50W wireless charging, while the Mi 10T Pro doesn\u2019t support wireless charging at all.",
    "We awarded both of these phones 9 out of 10 in their respective reviews, and these were issued just a few months apart. They\u2019re both really good handsets, quite obviously.",
    "Thanks to the difference in pricing, picking a winner isn\u2019t straightforward. They\u2019re swimming in slightly different waters, with the Xiaomi Mi 11 undercutting true flagship phones like the OnePlus 9 Pro, and the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro taking on almost-flagships like the OnePlus 8T.",
    "Hidden in that last point is the reason we feel able to pick a clear winner, however. The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is operating a whole hardware generation behind the Xiaomi Mi 11 - in terms of power, design, and (despite initial appearances) camera tech. Meanwhile the Mi 11\u2019s display is simply streets ahead.",
    "If you can find the Mi 10T Pro for a bargain price, it\u2019s still a brilliant phone. But the Mi 11 is flat out better in most of the ways that matter, and its newer processor means it\u2019ll remain relevant for longer too."
