  "article": [
    "Last month Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said in an earnings report that the company would unveil a new product in March \u2013 and now we can confirm that will be the case.",
    "Earlier today, Sonos sent out invitations to a new Sonos speaker event happening March 9 at 1pm PST / 4pm EST / 9pm BST.",
    "According to the invite sent to TechRadar, the event will be viewable on the company\u2019s press website (Sonos.press) but you\u2019ll likely be able to find a stream of it on YouTube, too.",
    "This will be the company\u2019s first event since the release of the Sonos Arc soundbar that was released last June and the event could possibly be related to a patent filing at the German Patent and Trademark Office we saw earlier for a new pair of Sonos headphones.",
    "The image for the event depicted someone walking out in a field that suggests the product Sonos has in store for us is a new, smaller portable speaker \u2013 a follow-up to the Sonos Move \u2013 however, Sonos didn\u2019t mention anything in the invitation itself.",
    "Like the headphones, we\u2019ve also seen patent filings for a battery-powered speaker, which would line up with the photo, but that\u2019s no guarantee unfortunately.",
    "If it does turn out to be the new Sonos Move speaker, we expect the compact form could be cheaper than the Sonos Move, in the same way that the Apple HomePod Mini is a cheaper version of the original HomePod smart speaker.",
    "We certainly wouldn\u2019t put that past Sonos to make a few versions of the same speaker as that\u2019s been the company\u2019s strategy for years with its Play series, but we won\u2019t know for sure if that\u2019s the case until March 9 rolls around."
