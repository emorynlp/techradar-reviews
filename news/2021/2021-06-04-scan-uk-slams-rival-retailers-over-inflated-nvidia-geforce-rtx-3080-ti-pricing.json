    "While many hardware retailers are taking advantage of the GPU shortage to hike up prices for consumers, Scan UK has taken a stand against \"unrealistic\" RTX 30-series pricing.",
    "As reported by Overclock3D, the UK retailer has hit out at rival retailers that are selling Nvidia RTX 30-series GPUs, including the new Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, at inflated prices.",
    "This has been a problem since Nvidia first introduced its RTX 30-series graphics card lineup. For example, the Nvidia RTX 3060, which has an MSRP of \u20ac329 (around $400 / \u00a3280 / AU$500), is available at a few stores starting at a whopping \u20ac999 (around $1,200 / \u00a3950 / AU$1,570) and even going as high as \u20ac1,122 (around $1,370 / \u00a31,000 / AU$1,800).",
    "Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 is perhaps the worst affected by retailers\u2019 price-gouging, so it's no surprise to see the RTX 3080 Ti following suit. While it\u2019s supposed to sell for \u20ac719 (around $880 / \u00a3620 / AU$1,120), it\u2019s being sold at some retailers for as much as \u20ac2,999 (around $3,600 / \u00a32,600 / AU$4,700) - a huge 317% increase over the MRSP.",
    "That won\u2019t be the case if you buy an Nvidia GPU from Scan, however, as the online retailer has pledged than rather than taking pre-orders for unsecured stock, or inflating prices as a result of stock shortages, it will sell the Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti graphics cards at MSRP.",
    "In a statement on its \"Nvidia 30 Series status\" page, the it said: \"We feel it [is] unfair that people are selling the cards in marketplaces at unrealistic prices.\"",
    "That\u2019s the good news. While the retailer is taking a bold stance against price-gouging, it\u2019s warned that it expects stock of the RTX 3080 Ti to sell out \u201cextremely quickly\u201d",
    "\u201cWe will not be in a position to take pre-orders due to the demand,\u201d it said in a statement posted on Thursday.",
    "\u201cTo avoid any ambiguity all products will be marked with \u2018sold out accordingly. We will not be getting additional supplies for the remainder of the week.\u201d",
