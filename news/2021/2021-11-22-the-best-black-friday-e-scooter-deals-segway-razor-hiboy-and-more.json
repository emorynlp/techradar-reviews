    "Cyber Monday is here, and it means that this might be your last chance to grab an electric scooter Cyber Monday deal for a brilliant price.",
    "With Black Friday behind us, this week's sales are in their death throws \u2013 with a handful of discounts still going or just starting to appear, before we revert back to the painful reality of regular list prices.",
    "Thankfully, though, discounts on e-scooters are still around. There are big savings on all the most popular brands, including Pure Electric, Bird, Xiaomi and Segway, with offers on solid commuter scooters and two-wheelers built for weekend fun.",
    "There's one very important thing to bear in mind, though: if you're looking for a scooter for yourself or another adult and you see a particularly cheap deal, double check to make sure it's not a kid's scooter. All the major brands make scooters for both grown-ups and youngsters, and the designs are almost identical so it's easy to think you're snagging a great deal and end up with a toy on your hands.",
    "The second-generation Pure Air Pro takes our top prize for the best electric scooter of 2021. It's a big upgrade from last year's model, with a longer range, more powerful battery and \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 a smaller price tag, even outside the sales. It can hit a top speed of 15.5mph at full throttle, but offers a very impressive maximum range of 50km (about 31 miles) if you're willing to cut back the speed and ride at a slightly more sedate pace.",

    "The Xiaomi M365 Pro (also known as the Mi Electric Scooter Pro) is a mid-priced scooter with specifications that rival much more expensive models. With a large platform, non-slip handlebars, built-in lights and reflectors, it's one of the most practical scooters in its price bracket, and feels safe and comfortable to ride even in bad weather and after dark.",

    "The experts at Segway know a thing or two about getting around on two wheels, and that experience has helped it build one of the best electric scooters around, while keeping its price surprisingly affordable. Its real world performance will depend on how and where your ride, but the Segway-Ninebot ES4 Electric KickScooter has a quoted range of 28 miles and a top speed of 18.6mph, making it one of the fastest scooters in this price bracket."
