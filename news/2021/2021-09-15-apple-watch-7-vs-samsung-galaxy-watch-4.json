    "It\u2019s that time of year again: endless speculation, renders and rumors before Apple finally drops a brand new Apple Watch.",
    "This year\u2019s Apple Watch Series 7 isn\u2019t a huge upgrade over the Apple Watch Series 6, but there are some important improvements \u2013 not least a bigger display and tougher crystal.",
    "It's important to note that Samsung's watch only works with Android handsets, while Apple's is just exclusive to iPhone models. This will likely have made your decision for you.",
    "So how does the Apple Watch 7 compare with Samsung\u2019s flagship, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4? Let\u2019s take a look.",
    "There are two Galaxy Watch 4 models, the Galaxy Watch 4 and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The non-Classic one is smaller, lighter and has a capacitive touch-sensing band rather than the rotating bezel of the Classic. We\u2019ll focus on the standard Watch 4 here.",
    "We think the Galaxy Watch 4 is a very good-looking device, and the streamlined Armour Aluminum frame is particularly good looking in Pink Gold, although unfortunately that option isn\u2019t available in the 44mm model. Like the Apple Watch you have a choice of sizes \u2013 40mm and 44mm here \u2013 and colors: Black and Silver in any size, Green in 44mm only and Pink Gold in the 40mm.",
    "There\u2019s a decent selection of bands too, including Hybrid Leather and Sport options. The Super AMOLED screen is 1.4\u201d in the 44mm and 1.19\u201d in the 40mm. The Samsung is IP68 rated for water and dust resistance.",
    "Rumors suggested a radical redesign for the Apple Watch Series 7 but this is an evolution, not a revolution: thinner borders make for a bigger screen without a noticeably bigger case (the Series 7 is 1mm bigger than the Series 6 and compatible with existing Apple Watch straps and bands), and the crystal cover has been redesigned to make it stronger.",
    "It now has IP6X dust resistance as well as WR50 water resistance.",
    "The display is 20% bigger than before (and 50% bigger than a Series 3) and enables you to view more data and have more on-screen complications. There are new colors too: midnight, starlight, green, blue and PRODUCT(RED) for the aluminum models. Stainless steel models come in silver, graphite or gold, and titanium is available in natural and space black. There are also new Nike sport and Hermes bands.",
    "The unique selling point of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is its bioelectrical impedance sensor (BIA), which can provide data on your body composition in much the same way as the body fat monitors in electrical scales. The BIA sits alongside an optical heart rate sensor and an ECG in what Samsung calls the BioActive sensor, and it can tell you your water percentage, metabolic rate and body fat percentage.",
    "That\u2019s useful because weight is a poor guide for fitness and health: muscle weighs more than fat. There\u2019s sleep tracking with snoring detection and overnight blood oxygen monitoring, and in some markets the Watch can also track your blood pressure.",
    "The use of Google\u2019s Wear OS means that more Google apps and services are available, such as YouTube Music (including offline mode), Google Maps and Google Pay. Wear has a much bigger library than Tizen, Samsung\u2019s own previous OS, so that\u2019s good news. Google Assistant hasn\u2019t made it across yet \u2013 for now you\u2019re stuck with Bixby \u2013 but Samsung promises an update soon.",
    "There are no new sensors in the Apple Watch Series 7, which retains the ECG and blood oxygen sensors of the Series 6. Fall detection now works for cyclists, and there are improved algorithms for biking and e-biking. There are some new watch faces and a full keyboard that you can use with typing or swiping. Machine learning will try to guess your intent to make text input faster.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is powered by Google\u2019s own WearOS and runs Samsung\u2019s One UI 3 with an impressive range of attractive watch faces. There\u2019s 16GB of internal storage, 1.5GB of RAM and a dual-core Exynos W920 chipset, which promises to be 20% faster than its predecessor.",
    "There\u2019s a dedicated low-power display processor to keep the main processor offline when it isn\u2019t required, resulting in battery life that easily runs for 24 hours of normal use. Wi-Fi here is dual band to 802.11n and there\u2019s also NFC.",
    "It\u2019s important to note that unlike other Wear watches, the Galaxy Watch 4 can\u2019t be paired with an iPhone and some key features, such as the ECG, only work if your Android phone is a Samsung. You\u2019ll also need to use the Galaxy Wearable app, not the standard Wear OS one.",
    "Apple\u2019s focus this time around appears to have been on energy efficiency, so that bigger screen doesn\u2019t mean less battery life: expect the same 18 hours as before. The Series 7 charges more quickly, though \u2013 33% faster \u2013 thanks to its new USB-C charger, and Apple says that 8 minutes on charge is good for 8 hours of sleep tracking. It hasn\u2019t published details of the processor, RAM or storage so we\u2019re assuming the spec is similar or identical to the Series 6.",
    "As ever, the Apple Watch runs Apple\u2019s own watchOS: version 8 this time. It\u2019s a mature and user friendly operating system now with a decent collection of apps, including many Google ones as well as Apple\u2019s own options and third party apps.",
    "The Galaxy Watch 7 is \u00a3249 / $249.99 for the 40mm model and \u00a3269 / $279.99 for the 44mm. Add \u00a340 / $50 plus a data contract if you want the LTE version, which can use the mobile data network as well as Wi-Fi.",
    "The Apple Watch Series 7 starts at \u00a3379 / $399 for the standard model and $499 for the cellular option, which also requires a data plan. We've yet to find out prices for other regions, and we don't yet know when the Apple Watch 7 will go on sale.",
    "Chances are you\u2019ve probably picked a side already: if you\u2019re an iPhone user you probably won\u2019t want a Galaxy Watch 4 (which won\u2019t talk to your phone) and if you\u2019re on Android then the Apple Watch won\u2019t be for you either.",
    "But it\u2019s interesting to compare the different ways in which the two tech titans have approached their latest wearables: while on the surface both firms appear to have tweaked their existing products, Samsung has jettisoned its entire OS in favor of going back to Google power.",
    "What you gain in apps, you lose in compatibility: where the Apple Watch gives you the same experience with any iPhone, Samsung doesn\u2019t extend the full Galaxy Watch experience to every Android phone."
