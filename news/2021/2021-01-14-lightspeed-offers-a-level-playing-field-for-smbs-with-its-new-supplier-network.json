    "Lightspeed, the Canadian specialist in cloud-based e-commerce platforms has announced Supplier Network, a stock ordering solution aimed at North American retailers.",
    "The Montreal-based company claims that the Lightspeed Supplier Network has the potential to transform supply chain management for SMBs. Merchants signing up for the new system will be able to benefit from an automatically updating catalog system, easy order management tools plus automated shipment handling.",
    "The point of sale expert has introduced the product in response to growing pressures on existing supply chains as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Supplier Network has been designed to help redress the imbalance between major e-commerce chains and smaller, independent businesses.",
    "SMBs looking to improve the efficiency of their systems can also use the cloud-based Lightspeed Supplier Network to improve the efficiency of their POS technology by connecting with suppliers more effectively and increasing control of supplier branding. The dynamic edge of the new product also means that it will provide suppliers with access to sell-through data in real-time.",
    "\u201cConnecting SMB retailers directly to their suppliers through the Lightspeed Supplier Network is nothing short of revolutionary. This new tool enables independent businesses to discover new products, more easily sell online and make better use of their capital to strategically increase order frequency,\u201d said Dax Dasilva, Founder and CEO of Lightspeed.",
