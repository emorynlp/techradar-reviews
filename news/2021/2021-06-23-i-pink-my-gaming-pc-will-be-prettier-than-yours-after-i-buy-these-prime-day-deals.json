    "We've covered a lot of PC gaming deals here on TechRadar for Prime Day, but in the ocean of matte black and silver, there were a few bargains that caught my eye, like a rose-colored beacon. Many of you will likely already be aware of Razer's famous Quartz range of peripherals and accessories, providing the same high quality seen in its well-established lineup, but in a gorgeous shade of pastel pink. With Razer typically on the luxury end of the gaming market, big annual sales are a great time to grab these deals before they're back on the shelves at full price. A few of these coveted Quartz-toned products have made an appearance in the Prime Day sale, but it got me hungry for variety, and as such, I present to you some of the cutest gaming accessories and kit I found while delving into the huge list of available deals. Be it headphones, keyboards, or some more...interesting finds (that I won't apologize for), this curated list of bargains will leave you feeling 'wowed' or 'worried'. Either way, you're welcome.",
