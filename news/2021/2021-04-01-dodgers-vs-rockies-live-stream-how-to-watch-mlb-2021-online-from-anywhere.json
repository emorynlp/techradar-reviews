    "The Dodgers begin their title defense as most baseball fans' favorites for this season's World Series, but they have a potentially tricky game to kick off the campaign with. The Rockies closed last season in hopeless form, but they were the only team to beat the Dodgers in a series, getting the better of the champions-in-waiting last September. Could they spring another huge surprise today? Read on as we explain how to watch the Dodgers vs Rockies game online and live stream today's MLB action from anywhere in the world.",
    "The Dodgers were outstanding in 2020 and look primed to pick up right where they left off, but as we've seen in recent years, being top dog isn't always easy. We've seen both the Nats and the Red Sox struggle under the weight of expectations in the past two years, and as champions the Dodgers now have a great big target on their back - theirs is the scalp that everybody's after.",
    "Things aren't looking good in the Rockies camp, however, after the departure of Nolan Arenado. Trevor Story may soon follow him out of the door, while retirement may be on the cards for Scott Oberg, and Kyle Freeland is out injured.",
    "The Dodgers boast the deepest rotation in the league, and Clayton Kershaw has got the nod as their Opening Day starter for the 11th consecutive year, his counterpart being rising star German Marquez.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a Dodgers fan in LA, a Rockies fan in Colorado or just an MLB follower wanting to watch the baseball at Coors Field, we\u2019ll show you how to get a high-quality MLB live stream of the Dodgers vs Rockies game from anywhere.",
    "If you're abroad right now, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you re-position your device of choice to a location of your choosing, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred MLB live stream.",
    "This functionality also means that VPNs are great for getting around in-market black out restrictions, making them something every MLB fan should have in their bat bag.",
