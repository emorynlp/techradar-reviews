    "Cybercriminals\u2019 password-guessing game against Remote Desktop Protocol services has never been this strong, according to ESET. The company has published a report in which they claim to have detected 55 billion new brute-force attacks in the second quarter of the year.",
    "In its \u201cESET threat report T2 2021\u201d, the company says the number represents a 104% surge in brute-force attacks, compared to the first quarter of 2021.",
    "Pulling data from its detection systems, ESET said the average number of daily attacks, per unique client, increased \u201cimpressively\u201d, doubling from 1,392 attempts per machine, per day, in the first quarter of the year, to 2,756 attempts in the second quarter.",
    "These password-guessing attacks, ESET further claims, often serve as a \u201cgateway for ransomware\u201d. However, cryptocurrency-related incidents have fallen into a downtrend, the company told The Register.",
    "\"Our data suggest a strong connection between cryptocurrency price and cryptocurrency-related attacks \u2013 mainly when it comes to cryptomining,\" Roman Kov\u00e1\u010d, chief research officer at ESET, told the publication.",
    "There could be multiple reasons why a surge in brute-force attacks wasn\u2019t followed up by a similar surge in ransomware, including the fact that the prices of the most popular cryptocurrencies have been steadily declining since hitting an all-time high in early April.",
    "However, ESET believes that the two high-profile attacks (Colonial Pipeline and the Kaseya incident) drew the attention of law enforcement agencies, which not only shut down a number of ransomware operators (Emotet, for example), but also scared others away, as well.",
    "\u201cRansomware gangs may have overdone it this time: the involvement of law enforcement in these high-impact incidents forced several gangs to leave the field,\u201d Kov\u00e1\u010d explained further. \u201cThe same can\u2019t be said for TrickBot, which appears to have bounced back from last year\u2019s disruption efforts, doubling in our detections and boasting new features.\u201d",
