    "Have you ever heard a professional speaker pitch their audience on tricks and tips to \u201cget rich quick\u201d or \u201cshred weight fast\u201d? The thing about pitches such as these is that they are designed in a particular way to capture the attention of the audience, engage with them to maintain that attention, and ultimately, hit them with the \u201ctrue\u201d ask or pitch at the end.",
    "The thing is, after the audience has already been sold, many members of that audience realize that there is no \u201cquick\u201d or \u201cfast\u201d way to achieve the goals they want \u2013 at least, not without putting in the hard work. The space of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is no different.",
    "Though there are numerous ways for businesses and brands to approach their SEO strategy, every one of them does so with the end goal of improving their digital presence and increasing their reach to potential customers, customers, or sponsors. In this article, I want to highlight the three most important points any brand will need to cover to ensure its SEO strategy is successful.",
    "Before your business or brand can begin optimizing your SEO strategy for success, you need to understand both your target audience, as well as the behavioral patterns of that audience. This means asking questions such as:",
    "It is also important to remember that these questions should not be asked with a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d perspective in regard to your SEO strategy. This is because your target audience will not only use search engines to find your business\u2019s or brand\u2019s content. These questions and others like them should also be asked to help optimize your digital presence on other platforms such as:",
    "The overall goal of understanding the multitudes of search platforms is to maximize visibility for your brand and the products or services you offer to your target audience. By optimizing your brand\u2019s presence and content across each of these platforms, you can begin optimizing a strategy that not only improves your SEO performance, but also improves the search experience for your customers.",
    "It can sometimes be easy to forget that the digital presence our brands have and the way they present themselves online are ultimately meant for people, not search engines themselves. As such, the overarching goal for any SEO strategy is to maximize your brand\u2019s reach through SEO in order to increase consumer traffic and engagement.",
    "The goal here is to create content that targets customers, not search engines. If you\u2019re wondering how that can be done, here are a few steps to help get you started:",
    "For example, if your brand is viewed by customers as a source of information or data, such as a weekly newsletter, using a few extra shorter keywords (e.g., \u201cemail marketing\u201d) may help improve your web pages appear higher in search queries by customers as they help answer the questions customers search for.",
    "However, if your brand is a digital marketing agency with the goal to improve your digital transaction rates, you may want to use longer and more specific keywords (e.g., \u201ccross-channel enterprise marketing channels\u201d) to improve your rankings, which will lead to increased traffic to your content and improving your chances at achieving higher transaction rates.",
    "The goal of this step is simple: give your target audience what they want. This can be achieved through generating high-quality written copy, visual content, such as easy-to-read infographics, and ensuring both are mobile-device-friendly with your SEO strategy.",
    "The final step in ensuring success for your brand\u2019s SEO strategy lies in one word: content.",
    "Without content \u2013 be it written, visual, or otherwise \u2013 your brand has no leverage insofar as what it has to offer to your target audience or customers, and your brand will have virtually zero visibility online or in the digital spaces you seek to gain a spot in.",
    "Here are a few quick questions you can ask to make sure that the content your brand publishes and distributes to your target audience is optimized for SEO:",
    "Once you have asked and answered these questions, you can begin optimizing your online content, data, and resources to improve both your SEO rankings as well as the customer experience.",
    "A few ways to begin this process include:",
    "A few more advanced tasks may include:",
    "With these three main steps complete, your business or brand should be well on its way to ensuring success for your SEO strategy in the weeks and months to come."
