    "One of the most interesting and engaging ways to get me to play your battle royale multiplayer mode is to tie it to the game\u2019s overarching narrative, and that\u2019s just what Halo Infinite might be doing, if recent rumors are to be believed.",
    "If you\u2019re out of the loop, rumors of a Halo Infinite battle royale have been circulating for a good while now, but conflicting reports suggest that it may not even be in development. However, notable leaker Tom Henderson suggested in a tweet that the rumored multiplayer mode for Halo Infinite could be closely tied to the game\u2019s campaign.",
    "There\u2019s one big caveat, though. Henderson admitted that he didn\u2019t know if the Halo Infinite battle royale had since been scrapped, claiming that it\u2019s been in development for years.",
    "Before this, leaked Halo Infinite voice files lent credence to the idea of a battle royale mode existing within the game. The voice clip in particular features multiplayer announcer Jeff Stitzer yelling \"Battle Royale\" in his usual charismatic fashion.",
    "That\u2019s not concrete proof, of course, as developer 343 Industries could have had the line recorded for a number of reasons. It may be just a placeholder in case they ever do decide to introduce a battle royale mode to Halo Infinite down the line. It could also be a line players will be able to insert into their custom Forge maps and modes.",
    "Let\u2019s not beat around the bush, many of you are likely tired of seeing battle royale modes shoehorned into any game with a gun in it. I\u2019m among these people, too, having had my fill of games like PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite. But Halo is a bit different.",
    "Halo isn\u2019t your typical run-and-gun shooter fest. The series\u2019 multiplayer offerings are typically of a slower pace, with a huge focus placed on learning how each weapon works and where the powerful ones spawn, getting to know the layout of every map as well as relying on your personal accuracy.",
    "This careful, calculated approach extends to Halo\u2019s numerous campaigns. There\u2019s a lot to wrap your head around when it comes to Halo\u2019s story and universe, and that\u2019s before considering the litany of books, comics and animations that spin off from the central narrative. Most of it is great stuff, which is why having a battle royale mode tie into Halo Infinite\u2019s story is such a compelling prospect.",
    "Why? Because many of Halo\u2019s spin-off titles are where the story hits the hardest. Both Halo 3: ODST and Halo Reach provide some of the series\u2019 most emotional gut punches. And while I don\u2019t exactly expect to be moved to tears by a battle royale mode, of all things, it could provide some extra insight into the war surrounding Master Chief. After all, the extended Halo narrative makes it quite clear that our favorite Spartan is incapable of saving everyone.",
    "I\u2019d usually roll my eyes at the announcement of a battle royale mode in any game, but I would be willing to give Halo the benefit of the doubt. The series\u2019 more calculated gameplay and approach to storytelling could greatly impact its take on a prospective battle royale mode, allowing it to be both fun and something for Halo lore enthusiasts to sink their teeth into."
