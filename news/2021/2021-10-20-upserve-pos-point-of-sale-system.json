    "One of the best things about Upserve POS is its powerful ordering and order management software. The program runs on various mobile devices, allowing your staff to quickly take, manage, and modify orders where required.

    "All reports suggest that Upserve\u2019s support and ongoing customer care are both excellent. The Knowledge Center contains a suite of articles and how-to guides detailing various actions and setup procedures. There are also various webinars for more in-depth training, and live chat support is available 24/7 via the company website.",
    "Additionally, online reports suggest that the Upserve team does a great job of looking after customers post-sales. For example, it receives a decent 4.4/5 star rating from 246 reviews on Capterra, which is higher than many of its competitors get. Many of these focus on the excellent 24/7 live support, which should instill a high level of confidence in prospective users.",
    "Upserve is a great option for small businesses in the hospitality industry, but there are plenty of alternatives out there worth considering.",
    "For example, Lightspeed POS provides a feature-rich system that is targeted at restaurants, retail, and e-commerce businesses. Prices start from $59 per month, which is similar to Upserve, but you will benefit from a wide range of advanced tools that can be personalized for your business.",
    "Epos Now is another popular hospitality-specific POS service provider. Its prices start at $39 per month or $750 for a one-off software license, and it also comes with great loyalty and customer relationship management (CRM) features.",
