    "It\u2019s no secret that Chadwick Boseman\u2019s tragic and unexpected passing left a T\u2019Challa-sized hole in Marvel\u2019s plans for future Black Panther movies \u2013 but fans are still yet to learn who, if anyone, will be taking up the titular hero\u2019s mantle.",
    "For months, the presumption had been that Letitia Wright, who plays T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, Shuri, in the first movie and upcoming sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, would step into the lead role. Recent reports, though, have suggested that this may not be the case, after all.",
    "Now, we\u2019re hearing rumors (per a story from Giant Freakin\u2019 Robot (GFR)) that Winston Duke\u2019s M\u2019Baku will be inheriting the Black Panther moniker, instead. This news comes by way of the publication\u2019s supposedly \u201ctrusted and proven inside sources,\u201d but we\u2019d still advise taking it with a hefty pinch of salt.",
    "It\u2019s worth clarifying Marvel\u2019s official comments regarding the future of the Black Panther universe following Boseman\u2019s death in August 2020. At the time, Marvel confirmed that it wouldn\u2019t recast the role of T\u2019Challa as a tribute to the late actor\u2019s powerful portrayal.",
    "\"Honoring Chadwick Boseman's legacy and portrayal of T'Challa, Marvel Studios will not recast the character, but will explore the world of Wakanda and the rich characters introduced in the first film,\" a company tweet read last year.",
    "Many fans took this to mean that Shuri would likely step into T'Challa\u2019s shoes in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which is scheduled for release on November 11, 2022 as part of Marvel\u2019s Phase 4 movie roster.",
    "But, although shooting began on the project earlier this year, Wright sustained an injury which forced her to return home to London.",
    "It seems, then, that Marvel may be considering contingency plans for the future of the franchise. In our opinion, that\u2019s why GFR\u2019s claims about Winston Duke hold water \u2013 even if we\u2019re not totally convinced about their authenticity.",
    "So, would Winston Duke actually make a good Black Panther?",
    "Duke\u2019s character, M\u2019Baku, has a rocky relationship with Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa in the original Black Panther movie. He is the leader of the Jabari Tribe, a group of Wakandans who have removed themselves from mainstream society, and challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat.",
    "The eponymous hero defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die, but he\u2019s clearly less-than-impressed with his new leader. Still, as repayment for his debt, M'Baku and the Jabari tribe arrive to reinforce T'Challa against Michael B. Jordan\u2019s Killmonger during the movie\u2019s final battle.",
    "In the comics, M'Baku remains T'Challa\u2019s domestic foe, though his appearances in both Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame \u2013 fighting alongside the Wakandan army against Thanos\u2019 forces \u2013 suggest Marvel would be willing to further digress from its source material by appointing him leader of the Wakandans in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.",
    "It\u2019s plausible, then, but is it likely? We know that Wakanda Forever will be focusing on \u201cthe rich characters introduced in the first film,\u201d one of whom is M'Baku, so audiences could be exposed to a more kind-hearted, likeable leader than the gruff warrior we\u2019ve seen so far.",
    "That said, M\u2019Baku has previous form for showcasing his jovial side. We saw as much in Black Panther, when he joked with T\u2019Challa and company after Bosewick\u2019s character is revealed to be alive following his defeat to Killmonger earlier in the movie. So, while M\u2019Baku portrays himself to be a very serious individual, his underlying personality, combined with his clearly imposing physical presence, would make him an ideal replacement for T\u2019Challa.",
    "Still, we\u2019re unsure about anyone assuming the mantle of Black Panther sometime soon. In our view, T\u2019Challa (and Boseman, by extension), is Black Panther. Seeing someone else in his suit with his superpowers, then, would be strange, even if it\u2019s done with the best intentions on Marvel\u2019s part.",
    "It\u2019ll be a while before we find out for sure, anyway. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever won\u2019t arrive in theaters for another 12 months, and we suspect that Marvel will keep this particular card close to its chest until it\u2019s finally released.",
    "Hopefully, the studio makes the right decision in honoring Boseman either way."
