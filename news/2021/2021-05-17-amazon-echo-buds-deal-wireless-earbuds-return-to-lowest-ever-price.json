    "The Amazon Echo Buds were the tech giant's first foray into the world of true wireless earbuds, and they still offer a capable alternative to pricier buds like the Apple AirPods.",
    "They come with Alexa built in, a five-hour battery life (plus 20 hours from the charging case), and an IPX4 water-resistance rating, making them suitable for use while working out.",
    "They've since been usurped by the Amazon Echo Buds (2nd Gen), which come with some substantial upgrades \u2013 not least the introduction of full active noise cancellation.",
    "However, the latest Echo Buds are pricier, so if you want to try a pair of Alexa earbuds without spending upwards of $100, buying the original Echo Buds is a good compromise.",
