    "Some nights I wake up in a cold sweat thinking about my next boss fight \u2013 or about the one I just beat before going to bed. Some days it gets so bad that, when I close my eyes, I can still see Zagreus dodging bolts of purple energy, leaving behind him a trail of flashing thunder. When I\u2019m not playing it, I\u2019m plotting out upgrades for my next run.",
    "I can\u2019t help myself. Hades on Nintendo Switch is a hell I just can't quit.",
    "You\u2019re reading Download This, TechRadar\u2019s new weekly guide to the must-have downloads to fill your phones, tablets, consoles and computers with. Games, eBooks, albums, apps or movies \u2013 we\u2019ve got you covered.",
    "Where traditional action RPGs might give you a skill tree or a list of stats for you to slowly sink your points into, Hades gives you something better \u2013 the power of the gods. Each run up through the Underworld towards Mount Olympus will give you different powers from the Greek gods, each of which can in turn be enhanced or combined every few levels.",
    "Because the game\u2019s a roguelike (a game that\u2019s procedurally generated rather than linear), the levels themselves change, as do each level\u2019s enemies and final bosses. That, combined with the powers, means no two runs ever look the same.",
    "Not only does the game incentivize you by showing you a new power or a new boss each time you play, but it also drip-feeds you permanent upgrades that makes each successive run the tiniest iota easier than the last, allowing you to keep pushing forward.",
    "Well now, you must be thinking, that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019d be that addictive. Surely tons of games have similar mechanics, and all those are easy to put down after a few hours?",
    "You\u2019re right, sort of. Hades isn\u2019t the first roguelike to ever be made and the powers system, while unique, does bear a resemblance to other popular ARPGs like Diablo where gems allow you add status effects to your weapons that also grow more powerful with each playthrough.",
    "But when you combine those elements, and put them on a handheld device like the Nintendo Switch that is simply made to be brought with you anywhere and everywhere you go, you have a recipe for a powerful dopamine ride that you rarely have to get off of.",
    "Because runs are fairly short \u2013 say 20 to 30 minutes \u2013 it\u2019s easy to die, invest any new materials into upgrades and start anew again ad nauseum, all to get one step closer to the game\u2019s ending\u2026 er, well, its true ending.",
    "While others have made defeating the Soul of Cinder in Dark Souls 3 or clearing the b-sides in Celeste their white whale, mine\u2019s defeating Hades not once or twice, but 10 times to reach the \u2018true\u2019 ending. It\u2019s going to take me some time, but with the rate I\u2019m playing \u2013 and improving \u2013 it\u2019s only a matter of time before I beat it. If not, there\u2019s always tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next day\u2026 in fact, maybe I better try my luck again right now.",
    "I\u2019m pretty addicted to the game (I\u2019m not lying when I say I\u2019m losing sleep over it) but I know its hold is temporary. Sooner or later I\u2019ll get through it or try all the combinations of powers. Eventually I\u2019ll reclaim my free time, but for now I\u2019m hopelessly addicted to what I honestly think is the best roguelike since FTL: Faster Than Light. If you\u2019ve got some free time in your schedule, you might want to lose yourself to it, too."
