    "Sylveon has finally been added to Pok\u00e9mon Go, marking the last of the Eevee evolutions coming to the popular mobile game.",
    "Originally introduced in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, Sylveon is a fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon adorned with pink ribbons and bows arriving to sit alongside Jolteon, Vaporeon, Flareon, Umbreon, Espeon, Leafeon and Glaceon.",
    "To get it \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest, we all want it \u2013 you\u2019ll have to use the naming trick, which we\u2019ll walk you through below.",
    "The easiest way to the Eevee evolution your heart desires is to give it a specific nickname before it evolves, and Sylveon is no different.",
    "So, grab yourself an Eevee and the 25 candies you\u2019ll need to evolve it, and then give it the nickname \u201cKira\u201d. Once you do that, you should see a silhouette appear underneath the standard \u201cevolve\u201d button. Tap that, and you\u2019ve got yourself a Sylveon.",
    "It\u2019s worth bearing in mind, though, that this method only works once for each Eeveelution.",
    "For help obtaining all seven of the other Eevee evolutions through the naming trick \u2013 as well as the tricks to getting more than one \u2013 check out our guide.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Go has now been going strong for near-on five years, so where does it go next?",
    "Well, the game\u2019s developer, Niantic, recently hinted at the future of the mega-popular mobile game, suggesting that \"exciting things are in the works.\"",
    "In an exclusive interview with TechRadar, lead product manager for augmented reality (AR) at Niantic, Kjell Bronder, described the company\u2019s ambition to reach the multiplayer potential of Pok\u00e9mon Go first established by its launch trailer back in 2016.",
    "\u201cIf you look at that original Pok\u00e9mon Go trailer,\u201d Bronder said, \u201cyou'll see that there's a lot of stuff in there we still want to do.\u201d This coincides with the launch of Niantic\u2019s new developer platform, Niantic Lightship, which aims to bring a host of new AR capabilities to market \u2013 suggesting Pok\u00e9mon Go could be set for a major update very soon.",
    "In the meantime, catching Sylveon should keep you busy."
