  "article": [
    "As weeks go in the tech world, the last one was decidedly rumor-packed. We saw major leaks surrounding iOS 15, the iPhone 13 and some potentially game-changing VR mechanics \u2013 not to mention the new Google earbuds which were accidentally revealed by\u2026 Google.",
    "It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the TechRadar site has been a lively place.

We\u2019ve even gone ahead and published a guide to the best film cameras \u2013 because who doesn\u2019t want to rediscover the joys of analogue photography?",
    "There\u2019s also a host of review and opinion content for you to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re after something a little easier on the eyes (but maybe not the ears), we\u2019ve parked the latest episode of the TechRadar Noise Cancelling Podcast at the end of this article for your listening pleasure.",

    "At times, Amazon Prime Video\u2019s latest big drama series, Them, is unwatchable. That\u2019s not because it\u2019s poorly acted or badly written, but because of its distressing content, inspired by the injustice and terror that Black Americans have historically faced, and which many still encounter today.",
    "TechRadar spoke to creator Little Marvin and three of the series\u2019 lead actors to learn more.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "TechRadar writers are known for their frequently-excellent ideas \u2013 and none were better than our Computing Editor\u2019s decision to leave the PS5 queue behind and build his own console.",
    "So, how did it go? \u201cAlong the way I had a lot of fun [...] I also almost lost my mind several times,\u201d seems to be the general gist.",

    "Fitbit is investigating whether some of its existing fitness trackers can be used to measure blood pressure, and is asking its users to help out.",

    "CD Projekt Red finally released the gargantuan 1.2 patch for Cyberpunk 2077, and while it probably has things like \"bug fixes\" and \"content,\" it also enables ray tracing on supported AMD graphics cards.",
    "We weren't exactly expecting AMD to come out of nowhere and topple Nvidia's lead in the realm of graphics cards \u2013 we also weren't prepared, however, for just how far it has to catch up.",
