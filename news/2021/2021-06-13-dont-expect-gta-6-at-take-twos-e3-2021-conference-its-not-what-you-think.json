    "Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive, is confirmed to be making an appearance at E3 2021, but don't expect the publisher to be giving us a look at GTA 6 - or any other game in fact.",
    "As part of the ESA's E3 schedule, Take-Two Interactive is set to host a panel on June 14 at 10:15am PT / 1:15pm ET / 6:15pm BST (or June 15 at 3:15am AEST).",
    "But this panel won't revolve around the publisher's upcoming games, instead, it's an interactive panel on \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" featuring Jim Huntley, Interactive Media & Games\u2019 Professor and Head of Marketing for USC Games.",
    "While it's great to see a AAA publisher like Take-Two Interactive holding a panel such as this, GTA fans will no doubt be disappointed that they won't get any GTA 6 news - or even details on the GTS 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series X.",
    "We're not expecting Rockstar Games to make an appearance at any of the other E3 2021 showcases, so it looks like we'll be waiting a while longer for more GTA news."
