    "Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has migrated its internal financial operations from Oracle to SAP software, reportedly owing to Oracle\u2019s refusal to certify its database for use in Google\u2019s cloud computing platform..",
    "The timing of the move comes on the same day Oracle lost its landmark Android lawsuit against Google.",
    "An unnamed source told CNBC that the move to SAP stems from Oracle being adamant about not getting its database certified on Google Cloud, which hampered its adoption, particularly among large companies.",
    "Reportedly the lack of certification for Oracle forced Google to focus on deploying SAP\u2019s database software in the cloud.",
    "However, that has nothing to do with the transition to SAP according to Google. In a statement to ZDNet, Google Spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda noted that Google Cloud actively enables Oracle's customers to run their Oracle database workloads on Google Cloud through Google\u2019s bare metal solution.",
    "\"But that's entirely separate to our decision as an enterprise customer of financial software to transition our financial systems from Oracle to SAP,\" added Casta\u00f1eda.",
    "According to reports, Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison has proudly pointed to Google as a client in past earning calls. In a recent one he even listed dozens of companies and government agencies that have moved from SAP\u2019s ERP to Oracle\u2019s Fusion ERP.",
    "The process of migrating off of Oracle\u2019s financial software to SAP is said to complete by next month.",
