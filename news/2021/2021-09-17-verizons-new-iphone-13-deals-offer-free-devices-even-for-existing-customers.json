    "Both new and existing customers can bag themselves a free device via trade-in with today's new Verizon iPhone 13 deals - now available to pre-order.",
    "Yep, that's right - you don't need to sign up to an expensive new unlimited plan to score yourself up to $800 off an iPhone 13, $700 off an iPhone 13 Mini, or a whopping $1,000 off an iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, simply trade-in that old device.",
    "Normally, upgrade trade-in rebates at Verizon tend to range anywhere between the $400 to $500 mark so these are very, very generous savings indeed. It's likely Verizon is offering these to tempt over those users who are thinking of skipping this year's iPhone 13 deals - mostly because it's a fairly iterative upgrade over the iPhone 12.",
    "While your old device's value may vary depending on age, it's well worth checking in to see how much you'll get for it in a trade. It's highly likely you'll be able to get a full rebate here with an iPhone 12 and quite possibly an iPhone 11 too. Cracked screen and damaged devices are also eligible to trade too, although you won't get as much for them of course.",
    "If you're a new customer, Verizon will also score you an additional $500 in account credit if you port your number in from another carrier. While niche, this saving can be stacked on top of that trade-in rebate for an absolutely huge discount on both your device and plan payments.",
    "Can't decide if these new devices are for you? Check out our main iPhone 13 page for everything you need to know.",
    "Want to see what's available on other devices? See our main Verizon deals page for the latest on the iPhone 12, iPhone 11, and leading Samsung devices."
