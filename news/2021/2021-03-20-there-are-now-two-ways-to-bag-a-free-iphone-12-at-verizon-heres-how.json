    "Verizon deals have just been refreshed over at big red's site yielding not one, but two ways to get yourself a brand new iPhone 12 for absolutely free... relatively speaking.",
    "As you'd expect, both iPhone 12 deals come with trade-offs, but if you're looking to commit and take the plunge, the rewards are very, very compelling here.",
    "First up is Verizon's new $250 switching bonus - a new addition to the site - which, while not covering the cost of the entire device itself, can be stacked on top of the existing $750 maximum rebate for trading in. In a nutshell, if you're thinking about coming over from another carrier and happen to have an older device that's ready to hand over, you'll easily be looking at a free iPhone 12, plus potentially some leftover change for those bills too.",
    "The second of two free iPhone 12 deals at Verizon is the carrier's 'buy-one get-one free' promotion, which will score you an additional device for free when you purchase the first with a new unlimited plan. While you'll still be paying for one device here, if you're planning on going with two lines you'll be scoring that second device for absolutely no cost - a great deal.",
    "Note: so far we've been talking about iPhone 12 deals on the standard device, but if you're a fan of smaller - or larger - devices, then the good news is these promotions are also available on the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and even the iPhone 12 Pro Max as well. Of course, on the more expensive devices that trade-in rebate will cover less of the total cost of the device, but it does make that free additional phone all that much sweeter if you choose to go down that route instead.",
