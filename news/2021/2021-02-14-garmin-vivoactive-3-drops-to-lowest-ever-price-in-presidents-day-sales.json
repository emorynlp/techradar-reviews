    "Garmin smartwatch deals have slowed considerably since the January rush died down, but thanks to Best Buy's Presidents' Day sale there's one last minute discount that's offering particularly stunning value this weekend.",
    "The Garmin Vivoactive 3 originally launched at a pretty hefty $249.99 way back in 2017. While its features still hold up incredibly well today, its price tag has since tumbled all the way down to the record low of this weekend's smartwatch deals. You'll find it for just $99.99 at Best Buy right now.",
    "Over the course of the last year, we have seen this model sitting comfortably at a $149.99 sales price, but with that extra $50 off you're getting excellent value in an all-rounder with plenty of fitness and smartphone features.",
    "However, if you're looking for something more substantial - particularly for hiking - we'd recommend checking out this $270 discount on the premium Garmin Fenix 5X Plus as well. That saving drops the all-in-one, durable device down to $329.99 from its $599.99 MSRP.",
    "You'll find plenty more smartwatch deals further down the page as well, and you can check out all the latest Presidents' Day sales in our dedicated guide.",
    "You'll find all the latest Garmin smartwatch prices across the range right here on TechRadar. Of course, you can head straight to our roundup of the best Apple Watch deals if you're looking for that perfect iOS companion, or check out the latest Fitbit sales as well."
