    "Spoilers follow for Loki episodes 1 and 2.",
    "Loki on Disney Plus isn\u2019t hanging around with its big character reveals.",
    "Episode 2 of Marvel\u2019s latest TV show has only just been released but, unlike WandaVision or Falcon and the Winter Soldier, we aren\u2019t being made to wait for surprise character introductions.",
    "We already knew that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) would run into another Loki \u2018time variant\u2019. Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) stated as much in episode 1\u2019s final scene \u2013 but we didn\u2019t expect the identity of this other Loki \u2018time variant\u2019 to be revealed so soon.",
    "We imagine you have questions about this character, so we\u2019re here to help. Below, we\u2019ll dive into their comic book history and which actor portrays them in the series. We also look at what their introduction may mean for the show moving forward and why this character may not actually be who we think it is.",
    "We\u2019re entering major spoiler territory for Loki episode 2 from this point on. If you haven\u2019t watched it all the way through yet, turn back now.",
    "After tracking down the \u2018variant\u2019 to a world-ending event in 2050, Loki, Mobius and a TVA squad split up to cover more ground and locate them.",
    "Loki pairs up with Hunter B-15 (Wunmi Mosaku) and the duo soon encounter a single male, who is inexplicably shopping for plants as a massive storm rages outside.",
    "When Hunter B-15 moves closer to interrogate him further, however, the male grabs B-15\u2019s arm and seemingly transfers his consciousness into her.",
    "Yep, the person hiding inside the man (who transfers themselves into Hunter B-15) is none other than the Loki \u2018variant\u2019.",
    "The two versions of Loki verbally lock horns (all the while the Loki \u2018variant\u2019 continues to transfer themselves into other human vessels, to keep things interesting) before their plan is revealed.",
    "After stealing enough of the TVA\u2019s time reset charges \u2013 the devices that destroy offshoot branches from the sacred timeline \u2013 the Loki \u2018variant\u2019 plans to activate them all at once. Creating a massive surge in Nexus events, multiple timelines will branch off from the sacred timeline, cause reality to break down and presumably lead to a new multiversal war, as alluded to in episode 1.",
    "Before setting their scheme in motion, though, the Loki \u2018variant\u2019 finally reveals who they are \u2013 Lady Loki. Yes, you read that right: a female version of Loki.",
    "Lady Loki\u2019s reset charges activate, they travel to different dimensions in time and cause multiple branches to branch off from the sacred timeline. Lady Loki leaves through her own time travel doorway and, despite Mobius\u2019 last-ditch attempts to stop him, Loki follows his namesake through the portal, presumably to get to the bottom of who they really are.",
    "Sophia Di Martino. The British actress, who has appeared in TV shows including Silent Witness, was rumored to be playing Lady Loki in Marvel\u2019s latest series, and now we have confirmation that she is.",
    "As Loki\u2019s TV show was being filmed, leaked on-set images appeared to show Di Martino in a very Loki-like costume. At the time, we speculated that this was who Di Martino would be in the series, and we\u2019re glad to see we were right.",
    "Lady Loki is a fairly new addition to Marvel Comics. Created for a 2008 Thor comic issue run by J. Michael Stracynski, Lady Loki is, well, Loki reborn in female form.",
    "Lady Loki emerged following Marvel Comics\u2019 version of Ragnarok, and went on to be the primary version of Loki through several other comic storylines including Dark Reign, New Avengers and Original Sin.",
    "As it turns out, Lady Loki hadn\u2019t replaced the male Loki that comic readers had known since his first appearance in October 1962\u2019s Journey into Mystery #85 comic. Lady Loki is Loki and, instead of being one of his many tricks, Lady Loki is one of many of the character\u2019s personae.",
    "This, in turn, led to the revelation that Loki is genderfluid. Lady Loki, then, retains the personality, mischievous ways, abilities and other traits that Loki has \u2013 the only difference is that this iteration of the character is female instead of male.",
    "It\u2019s a part of the character that has been adopted in the MCU, too. As episode 1\u2019s end titles sequence (and the official Loki Twitter account) revealed, the TVA has a file on Loki that confirms the character is genderfluid.",
    "Given episode 2\u2019s events, we can safely assume that Loki will follow Lady Loki across multiple realities (as we\u2019ve seen in the trailers) to discover the reason behind their universe-ending plan.",
    "Our guess is that the TVA betrayed Lady Loki and she\u2019s exacting revenge by destroying the so-called sacred timeline.",
    "After all, there\u2019s something shady about the TVA. Maybe they offered Lady Loki a similar deal to the one that Mobius gave Loki (an audience with the Time Keepers) and then reneged on that agreement once they had used Lady Loki for whatever they needed.",
    "If that is the case \u2013 and this is purely speculation on our part \u2013 we could see a tug of war, between Lady Loki and the TVA, play out for Loki\u2019s loyalty.",
    "Loki will be aware that, if he crosses the TVA, he\u2019ll lose the opportunity to potentially speak with the Time Keepers. There\u2019s also the fact that the TVA will delete him from existence so, theoretically, it\u2019s in his best interests to remain loyal to them.",
    "However, Loki is a schemer \u2013 so Lady Loki, by definition, should be, too. The latter could conceivably persuade Hiddleston\u2019s Loki to join her cause instead, enlist his help in causing multiversal mayhem and they could rule the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse (MCM) together in some way.",
    "Loki\u2019s trailer appeared to show the pair having a (potentially pleasant) chat on an unknown planet. Of course, we don\u2019t know when this conversation will take place in Loki\u2019s TV show but, for all intents and purposes, it seems to be pretty civil. If it is, this could be when Loki joins forces with Lady Loki to take on the TVA.",
    "Alternatively, it may be that Di Martino's character isn't, in fact, Lady Loki at all.",
    "According to episode 2's end credits, Di Martino is playing a character called Sylvie \u2013 and this individual is completely different from Lady Loki in Marvel comics.",
    "How do we know Di Martino's character is called Sylvie? Take a look at the Castellana dubbed voice actors' roster right at the end of episode 2. You'll see someone else (Elisa Beuter) voicing Di Martino's character, who is referred to as Sylvie:",
    "Hang on, how do we know Beuter is the voice actor dub for Di Martino? Take a look at the German language dub image below, and you'll see Sonja Spuhl voices a character called 'the variant'. This has to be the same character as Sylvie, as both characters are second only to Loki in their cast order importance:",
    "If Di Martino's character is called Sylvie, there's only one Marvel comic character that this can be referencing: Sylvie Lushton, aka Enchantress.",
    "In the comics, Sylvie is an average teenage girl living in Oklahoma until the Asgardians move their Asgard home to the same state. Not long after, Sylvie wakes up with magical powers and adopts the pseudonym Enchantress \u2013 a character who is as much of an anti-hero/villain as Loki.",
    "As it turns out, Sylvie obtains her powers from Loki, including sorcery, teleportation and telekinesis. Judging by the first two episodes of Loki, we've seen Di Martino's character use similar abilities to possess people and, well make her hands glow green.",
    "It's highly plausible, then, that this is Enchantress and not Lady Loki as we first suspected. As far as we're aware, Enchantress doesn't wear a crown with two horns (a la Loki) in the comics, but Di Martino is sporting such a head accessory in Loki episode 2.",
    "This certainly muddies the waters as to who Di Martino is actually playing. Whatever happens, or whoever Di Martino is portraying, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the rest of Loki\u2019s TV series plays out. There are bound to be more twists along the way and we can\u2019t wait to see what occurs."
