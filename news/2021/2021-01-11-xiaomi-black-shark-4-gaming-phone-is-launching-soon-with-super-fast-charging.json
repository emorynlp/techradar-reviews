    "One of the next big phone launches could be the Black Shark 4, as the upcoming gaming phone from the Xiaomi sub-brand has been confirmed, with a few details on the handset teased too.",
    "This comes from Black Shark CEO Luo Yuzhou, who posted on Weibo (the Chinese social media platform) teasing the upcoming phone with a poster. As well as telling us the Black Shark 4 is 'coming soon', some specs of the phone are revealed.",
    "The most important thing the poster does is confirm the name as the 'Black Shark 4' - although it's the successor to the Black Shark 3, so such a name seems obvious, Chinese companies sometimes skip the number 'four' due to its pronunciation being similar to 'death' in Mandarin (many buildings skip fourth floors too).",
    "The Black Shark 4 will come with super-fast 120W charging and a battery size of 4,500mAh, and according to the poster, this charging speed will power the phone from empty to full in under 15 minutes.",
    "That's incredibly fast charging, a spec few phones match and none beat. As with other gaming phones with fast charging, it's likely we'll see this powering achieved with multiple USB-C ports to plug in the device, though technically it's possible with just one.",
    "We don't know anything more about the Xiaomi Black Shark 4 just yet, and the poster doesn't detail a release date. Yuhzou's Weibo post mentions 'Black Shark products', which could be a reference to a Pro model, or gaming accessories, or just a machine translating error.",
    "The Xiaomi Black Shark 3 launched in March 2020, so we're expecting to see the Black Shark 4 around March 2021 - this tease seems a bit early in that case, but maybe it'll come along sooner."
