    "We\u2019ve finally got our first look at Cate Blanchett as Lilith in the upcoming Borderlands movie\u2026 sort of.",
    "Co-star Jamie Lee Curtis shared an image on Twitter showing a silhouette of Blanchett in costume, describing her character as the \u201clegendary heroine, psycho blasting, vault hunting vixen with a bad attitude.\u201d",
    "The post was soon followed up by a similar tweet from the official Borderlands Twitter account, which quoted Lilith\u2019s famous line: \u201cwith me around, you might actually get somewhere.\"",
    "Here's a picture of Lilith as she appears in game form, if that helps make a comparison with the silhouette:",
    "The image marks the first time we\u2019ve seen an actor in costume behind the scenes of the upcoming adaptation of the popular video game series, following the release of several images teasing the movie\u2019s production.",
    "Most of those existing teasers have come from 13-year-old Ariana Greenblatt, set to play Tiny Tina, who has been filling her Twitter timeline with images and videos from the set \u2013 including those featuring Kevin Hart and Olivier Richters, who have signed on to play Roland and Krom, respectively.",
    "Joining Greenblatt alongside Blanchett and co. is Curtis as Dr. Patricia Tannis, Edgar Ramirez as Atlas and the voice of Jack Black as Claptrap. Casting has also been confirmed for the likes of Moxxi, Sir Hammerlock and Marcus \u2013 so we\u2019re anticipating faithful adaptations of the game\u2019s most iconic characters.",
    "As per behind-the-scenes teasers, filming is underway in Budapest, with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm. Craig Mazin, writer of HBO\u2019s Chernobyl, has penned the script. Mazin is also working on The Last of Us TV show with Neil Druckmann, so he's no stranger to the challenges posed by adapting such revered source material.",
    "Given the inevitable roadblocks posed by Covid-19 restrictions, there\u2019s been no word yet on the movie\u2019s release \u2013 though a date in 2023 is the most likely scenario.",
    "As with its release date, we\u2019re still not 100% sure on which games (if any) the Borderlands movie will draw from.",
    "Judging by the characters confirmed to appear, though, we\u2019re anticipating some sort of re-telling of the first game in the series, published by 2K Games on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC back in 2009.",
    "That means we expect to see, in some form, the likes of Roland and Lilith battling the Atlas Corporation on the planet Pandora for possession of otherwordly (and probably shiny) treasures.",
    "Given the success of recent video game adaptations, too \u2013 we\u2019re thinking Mortal Kombat and The Witcher \u2013 there\u2019s every chance the Borderlands movie will successfully mimic the tone of the explosive looter-shooter series."
