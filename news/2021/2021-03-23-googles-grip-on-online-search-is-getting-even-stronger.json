  "article": [
    "A majority of Google users don\u2019t click through to any of their search results, indicating that they find their answers on Google itself, and leading to a loss of traffic for other web properties, according to a new analysis.",
    "SimilarWeb\u2019s analysis of over five trillion Google searches in the twelve months of 2020 reveals that 64.82% of them ended on Google\u2019s search engine results page (SERP), known as zero-click searches.",
    "The figure is particularly alarming, when combined with the fact that Google can earn revenue from its SERP, which doesn\u2019t display original information but rather just fetches it from other publishers, who are losing revenue since the visitors get everything they want to know from the SERP itself.",
    "Dubbed \u201cclick cannibalization\u201d by Rand Fishkin, founder of research specialist SparkToro, over 77% of the zero-click searches come from mobile devices.",
    "According to Search Engine Land, the impact of zero-click searches isn\u2019t evenly distributed. For instance, businesses that operate in the same spaces Google may be losing a greater share of traffic than other businesses.",
    "Combine these results with Google\u2019s plans to kill off website cookies, which some fear might give it an unfair advantage over other advertisers, and you can see that search is no longer a level playing field.",
    "Then there\u2019s Google\u2019s plan to introduce the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) API, which it promotes as a means to enhance user privacy. Skeptics however argue that FLoC will only enable Google to further extend its monopoly over user data, driving other competing online advertisers out of the market.",
