    "The search for a new James Bond actor won\u2019t begin until at least 2022, long-time 007 producer Barbara Broccoli has confirmed.",
    "Speaking to BBC Radio 4 ahead of No Time to Die\u2019s international release on September 30, Broccoli stressed that no decision had yet been made on the matter, and talks surrounding Daniel Craig\u2019s successor wouldn\u2019t take place any time before next year.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not thinking about it at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want Daniel to have his time of celebration. Next year we\u2019ll start thinking about the future.\u201d She added that Craig has \u201cbeen such a great Bond. Those are big shoes to fill.\u201d",
    "Broccoli\u2019s comments pour cold water on rumors that a new James Bond casting might be announced ahead of, or just after, No Time to Die\u2019s long-awaited release.",
    "Craig, who took over from Piers Brosnan for 2006\u2019s Casino Royale, has been in the role for 15 years, making him the longest-serving Bond in the history of the franchise (by length of time served, rather than films starred in).",
    "On finding a replacement for Craig, Broccoli said: \u201cI can\u2019t even [think if it\u2019s] possible,\u201d adding that she and her studio, Eon Productions, were \u201cvery, very lucky\u201d to persuade the actor to join the franchise.",
    "\u201cWe could see he was reluctant to do it, because he knew it would change his life, which it obviously has. It\u2019s changed his life, but it hasn\u2019t changed him,\u201d Broccoli told BBC Radio 4.",
    "\u201cWhat he\u2019s enabled us to do with the franchise is really explore the emotional life of Bond and go into the person and complexity and conflicts that happen within the Bond character.\u201d",
    "Speculation surrounding Daniel Craig\u2019s replacement has been rife ever since the actor teased his departure from the role after 2015\u2019s Spectre.",
    "In fact, in expectation of renewed furore ahead of No Time to Die\u2019s release, we at TechRadar put together our own list of 10 stars who could take over as Bond, which includes a mix of long-touted names like Tom Hardy and Idris Elba alongside newcomers like Bridgerton\u2019s Reg\u00e9-Jean Page.",
    "Then there are the larger questions of Bond\u2019s future identity to consider, chiefly whether we might see a 007 of different ethnicity, or even a female incarnation of the character.",
    "The latter doesn\u2019t seem all that likely, though, given Craig\u2019s own thoughts on a woman playing Bond. \u201cThere should simply be better parts for women and actors of color,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cWhy should a woman play James Bond when there should be a part just as good as James Bond, but for a woman?\u201d",
    "Broccoli seems to share the same sentiment. Back in 2020, the producer said she believes \u201cJames Bond can be of any color, but he is male,\u201d adding that \u201cwe should be creating new characters for women \u2013 strong female characters\u2026 I\u2019m not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that\u201d.",
    "It doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll see a female Bond any time soon, then, but there\u2019s little doubt that the search for Craig\u2019s replacement in 2022 will bring with it fresh controversy.",
    "Our guess? The smart money\u2019s on Richard Madden."
