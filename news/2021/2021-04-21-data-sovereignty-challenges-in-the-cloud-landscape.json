    "There are continuous developments in the tech space, which can make choosing cloud computing and cloud storage solutions and vendors an overwhelming experience. (Need I mention Scott Brinker\u2019s famous martech map, which saw a growth of 13.6% in martech solutions alone in 2020).",
    "So it\u2019s no wonder that some decision-makers feel like flipping the research aside and crowning one solitary cloud provider to reign over their global domain.",
    "Rather than by choice, some decision-makers have felt they\u2019ve had to do this due to a lack of clear options. Consolidation is trending, particularly among large cloud providers, who are either buying up or wiping out smaller local offerings. A monopoly in this space would certainly see customers locked into dependencies, and cause a wave of anti-competitiveness across the market.",
    "However, for me, one of the greatest threats of this consolidation is data sovereignty, which is a throbbing, unrelenting headache for businesses looking to operate and comply with legislation across borders.",
    "Increased data usage comes with increased legislation \u2013 and what this entails differs between regions. Data is subject to the legislation of whatever country it resides in, and this can bring a lot of complex considerations into the mix. It may mean the laws you need to adhere to are different to those that apply to the country you\u2019re based in, and are therefore less familiar.",
    "It\u2019s also problematic when we consider that data within the cloud isn\u2019t static \u2013 it\u2019s continuously moving between users spread across the world, often through the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This means data will have to adhere to multiple regional legislations at the same time.",
    "The real spanner in the works is that these national and international data laws aren\u2019t always compatible with one another, in some cases they\u2019re even contradictory. As a result, it\u2019s very easy to get tangled in a web of data protection infringements. In some countries, like the US, this could well end in a million-dollar lawsuit.",
    "It\u2019s the penalties of not knowing the nuances of data regions that\u2019s beginning to push businesses away from consolidated providers and towards smaller localized providers. By accumulating a number of localized providers, a business can ensure their approach to data management is refined enough to comply with the different data legislations around the world.",
    "The greater emphasis on data within businesses has also heightened the attention data privacy is receiving from the public. Big milestones in the legal world, such as Europe\u2019s GDPR, have no doubt cemented this. But of course, this has created more customer expectations and greater accountability around how businesses manage their data.",
    "This is an additional pressure on top of the immense difficulties in getting data management to align with regional legislation. However, despite the challenge, it\u2019s always best to operate in the light.",
    "Be transparent with your customers on where their data is and who can access it. It\u2019s inevitable that customers will expect to know more about where their data is, and this is likely to mark an increased demand for domestic data storage as opposed to overseas.",
    "Customer awareness isn\u2019t something you can prevent, if anything, it should be embraced. Prepare your systems with formal processes that can handle Freedom of Information Act requests. And regularly assess the risks to your data and ensure you have experienced lawyers that can draft your privacy policies.",
    "There may have been a time when your business didn\u2019t have that much data, so it didn\u2019t take long to manage. But data is reproducing at lightning speed. Big data vaults means there\u2019s more to organize, which of course makes more room for mistakes. As data grows it\u2019s only going to demand more of your time.",
    "Consider everything your business comes into contact with that requires data. It\u2019s time to up your management efforts if you\u2019re going to stay hot on the legislation. In a lot of cases, as we\u2019ve mentioned, this will mean partnering with localized providers that can navigate nuanced legislation depending on the whereabouts of your data.",
    "There are so many challenges in the data and cloud industry that can\u2019t be solved through one fell swoop. Asking one cloud-provider to solve all of these issues is a bit like asking a GP to carry out an X-ray or heart surgery. They have the medical knowledge, but they don\u2019t have the same level of experience or specialty. Instead, you\u2019d use multiple doctors, with each one\u2019s expertise aligned to the job at hand.",
    "It\u2019s this same concept that\u2019s driving the need for a cloud-native approach. Rather than having a single sovereign, have an entire republic of cloud providers \u2013 each one specialized in their field.",
    "Having this set-up means a business can access data centers that aren\u2019t covered by their primary cloud provider. It also provides a cost- and resource-saving through reduced prices and specialized offerings which just aren\u2019t available with larger vendors.",
    "A multi-vendor approach also mitigates risk by spreading it out \u2013 something especially useful as the market remains in such a turbulent position. The EU seems to share this sentiment, urging businesses to partner with local cloud infrastructure to gain better protection for both themselves and their consumers.",
    "Of course, taking a multi-vendor approach will come with its own set of challenges. For example, one key area will be careful consideration of your API management to ensure data remains connected.",
    "However, as I see it, data sovereignty has the potential to jeopardize not only the safety of a business, but the safety of its customers. Protecting customers and future proofing the business is the priority, and this means dethroning one primary vendor, and creating a republic that can ensure every aspect of a business is covered."
