    "It\u2019s a marriage made in heaven: the visual effects driven spectacle of Disney Plus blockbusters \u2013 Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Frozen \u2013 with a picture quality that packs four times more pixels on your screen than HD TV. It can only be Disney Plus in 4K.",
    "Disney Plus currently offers over 100 titles in 4K, from iconic classics (The Lion King, X-Men) to modern favorites and Original series. And, as 4K becomes an integral feature of smart TVs, supported by myriad media streaming devices, we\u2019ll only see the amount of Disney Plus 4K content increase.",
    "Below we\u2019ll explain what\u2019s required to get the best viewing experience from Disney Plus, which devices are able to stream Disney Plus 4K, and the type of content you can expect to dazzle your eyeballs.",
    "Yes! And no...There are about 900 films and 300 TV series available to stream. While the majority of them are only available in HD, there are 100-odd titles ready to stream in glorious 4K UHD (Ultra High Definition).",
    "That\u2019s a tenth of the Disney Plus catalogue. A lean amount, perhaps. But it includes the content most befitting of enhanced picture quality, with 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) bringing four times more pixels to the screen than a HD (1920 x 1080) TV.",
    "Everything Pixar related is ready to roll in 4K, from Toy Story to the award-winning Soul. Then there\u2019s the intergalactic mayhem of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in addition to all Disney Original series like The Mandalorian and the entire Star Wars saga \u2013 with the razor-sharp detail of 4K making a galaxy far, far away feel that much closer.",
    "With a quick search under Movies for \u201cUltra HD and HDR\u201d content, you\u2019ll find dozens of other titles in 4K too, like Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book, teen rom-com 10 Things I Hate About You, and Yuletide classic The Muppet Christmas Carol.",
    "To stream in 4K, you\u2019ll need a subscription \u2013 check out the Disney Plus price guide here \u2013 and, as we explain in more detail below, a compatible smart TV with the Disney Plus app or a connected media streaming device.",
    "And, if you're in the market for one, you can also check out our current top ten list of the best 4K TVs for 2021.",
    "Luckily you shouldn\u2019t even have to, because, if your hardware is capable of playing 4K Ultra HD \u2013 and if the film or TV series is available in 4K \u2013 Disney Plus will automatically start streaming in the highest resolution possible. That\u2019s the magic of Disney right there!",
    "But, if your Disney Plus settings aren\u2019t updating correctly, or you just want to prevent yourself from unwittingly consuming huge amounts of data, you can manually adjust your video playback settings, as below:",
    "As already mentioned, there are over 100 Disney Plus 4K titles but no definitive list of them all. If you\u2019re not sure whether your favorites can be played in this format, simply click on the title and take a peek under the \u2018Details\u2019 tab. It should state \u20184K Ultra HD\u2019 if so, along with other compatible viewing and audio options, like HDR (High Dynamic Range) and Dolby Atmos.",
    "In addition to needing a 4K Ultra HD or HDR device, TV, or display, you\u2019ll also require a high-speed internet connection of at least 25Mb, as you\u2019ll be downloading large amounts of data and don't want to endure frequent buffering.",
    "Finally, Disney Plus advises your HDMI cables support high-bandwidth digital content, and that external displays support HDCP 2.2 (High-definition Digital Content Protection).",
    "The below come with 4K capability, including Disney Plus on Apple TV, although for some devices (e.g., Amazon Fire TV, Roku) you may want to check which specific models are compatible.",
    "Disney Plus isn't currently compatible with Nintendo devices. Plus, if you don\u2019t have a 4K TV, you won\u2019t be able to stream Disney Plus 4K but are likely to be limited to 1080p HD resolution. For full details on how to get the streaming service on media streaming devices, why not check out our specific guides including Disney Plus on PS4 and Disney Plus on Roku.",
    "Here you\u2019ll find our verdict on the Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple TV 4K, and Roku Streaming Stick+, all of which are ready to stream high-octane Marvel action and Pixar masterpieces in 4K on Disney Plus."
