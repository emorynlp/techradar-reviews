    "The big news in streaming this week is incredibly obvious: the long-awaited Friends reunion is here. Whether you\u2019re a fan of the hit 90s sitcom or not, it\u2019s hard to deny the cultural impact of a show which kept audiences young and old hooked for 236 episodes over 10 years. It figures, then, that episode 237 has got people going a little crazy.",
    "Except, it\u2019s not really an episode. 'The One Where They Get Back Together' is a glorified talk show interview made weirder by the casual appearances of David Beckham and Kit Harrington \u2013 but more on that later.",
    "For the rest of us, fear not, as there\u2019s plenty more movies and TV shows hitting the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus this weekend. Below, we round up eight of the biggest highlights \u2013 from brand new Disney adventures to gripping crime docs.",
    "Alas, we\u2019ll start with the big one. Friends: The Reunion sees all six stars of the hit 90s sitcom \u2013 Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer \u2013 return to the show\u2019s original Warner Bros. soundstage for a \u201creal-life, unscripted celebration\u201d after 17 years.",
    "Several supporting characters from the original show also return for The One Where They Get Back Together, alongside an exhaustive and seemingly random assortment of celebrity guests, including BTS and Justin Bieber. It isn\u2019t the new scripted episode fans might have hoped for, but Friends: The Reunion guns for nostalgia and hits exactly that.",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max in the US, and Sky in the UK",
    "As well as hitting theaters, Cruella is also dropping on Disney Plus via Premier Access for those willing to spend a little extra ($30/\u00a320) to see it at home.",
    "Emma Stone stars in this origin tale of Cruella de Vil, the infamous dog-napper who first terrorized the spotted pooches of 101 Dalmatians in 1961. From what we can tell, there\u2019s a fair few shades of Joker in this one, not least its \u201970s backdrop and less-than-conventional protagonist.",
    "Early reception has been positive, with particular praise directed towards both Stone and Emma Thompson, who stars \u2013 weirdly \u2013 as the movie\u2019s antagonist. Given the additional cost, more casual onlookers might want to wait until it rolls out to all Disney Plus subscribers.",
    "Now available to stream on Disney Plus via Premier Access",
    "Borat Supplemental Reportings Retrieved from Floor of Stable Containing Editing Machine (and breath\u2026) continues the misadventures of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s larger-than-life Kazakh through a series of documentary shorts.",
    "It\u2019s split into three parts, which we\u2019d tell you about if they didn\u2019t also have excessively long names. Basically, there\u2019s never-before-seen footage of the 2020 sequel movie, plus several new skits featuring expectedly barmy conspiracy theorists, medical experts and, of course, members of the public.",
    "Great success!",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video",
    "If you\u2019re looking for some doom and gloom this weekend, Nail Bomber: Manhunt arrives on Netflix to tell the story of how one right-wing extremist held London to ransom for 13 days in 1999. It's thought that 150 people suffered injuries at the hands of David Copeland, who targeted minority groups using heinous nail bombs.",
    "If you\u2019ve got true crime fatigue, though, don\u2019t despair \u2013 critics have described this one as a refreshing take on the genre, and an insightful look at how a city came together to take action against a mindless killer.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "Amazon is really rolling out the red carpet of late. Panic is the streamer\u2019s latest high-octane drama series, based on the bestselling novel by Lauren Oliver. It follows the plight of a group of teenagers in a small Texas town who compete in a series of dangerous challenges to win a supposedly life-changing prize.",
    "Oliver herself directs, so expect a faithful adaptation of the source material. We get strong Hunger Games-meets-Spring Breakers vibes from this one, with a little bit of The Purge thrown in for good measure. So, if you want to see college kids get buried alive or ushered off the edge of a cliff, Panic might be for you.",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video",
    "Part 2 of Lucifer\u2019s fifth season arrives on Netflix this weekend, with eight new episodes ready to pick up where the show left off in August last year.",
    "For those not in-the-know, Tom Ellis plays Lucifer, a human embodiment of the Devil based on the DC Comics character created by Neil Gaiman. In the conclusion to season 5, the creator himself, God (played by Dennis Haysbert), finally comes to Los Angeles to join Lucifer, so expect hands (or wings?) to be thrown.",
    "Although the fifth season was initially reported to be the last, the series has been renewed for a sixth and final outing, due to air in 2022.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "The third and final season of The Kominsky Method also hits Netflix this weekend, with Michael Douglas\u2019 Sandy now faced with the trauma of a difficult loss, a daunting financial obligation and an important reunion.",
    "Former series regular Alan Arkin will not appear in this final season, but Kathleen Turner \u2013 who starred alongside Douglas in Romancing the Stone nearly four decades ago \u2013 joins the cast as Ruth, Sandy\u2019s ex-wife, for all six episodes.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "Joining Friends: The Reunion on HBO Max this weekend (albeit with less fanfare) is Oslo, a HBO original based on the award-winning play of the same name by J.T. Rogers.",
    "It dramatizes the back-channel negotiations among a group of Israelis, Palestinians and Norwegians leading up to the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords, with Ruth Wilson (His Dark Materials) and Andrew Scott (Fleabag) leading its cast. Reviews have been mixed, but for those unaware of its twisty story, Oslo might be worth the watch.",
    "Available to stream from Saturday on HBO Max"
