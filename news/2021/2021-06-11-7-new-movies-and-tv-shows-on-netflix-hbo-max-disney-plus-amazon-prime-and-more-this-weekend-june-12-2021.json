    "And just like that, another Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) adventure blasts its way onto Disney Plus. This week, though, Kevin Feige and co. have refrained from more of the paint-by-numbers action \u00e0 la The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and opted for a decidedly unique take on the superhero genre.",
    "Yes, the first episode of Loki has arrived to join a stellar lineup of new content dropping on the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max this weekend. But as well as big-budget comic book shows, there\u2019s big-budget musical movies, medium-budget crime series and even tiny-budget, fly-on-the-wall farming documentaries.",
    "The point being, there\u2019s a lot to sink your teeth into over the next few days. Below, we\u2019ll walk you through seven of the biggest highlights \u2013 from mind-bending thrillers to returning heist dramas.",
    "Marvel\u2019s latest original adventure, Loki, follows the exploits of the titular God of Mischief after his Tesseract-assisted escape in Avengers: Endgame. Told in six parts, the show takes proceedings away from Earth and into various new dimensions as Loki encounters the Time Variance Authority, an organization with a mission to keep the MCU\u2019s different timelines in working order.",
    "Episode 1 is out now, and has been near-unanimously praised by fans and critics alike for its shaking up of the well-trodden superhero formula, and taking it into more of a Terry Gilliam's Brazil-infused workplace comedy. As ever, Loki is a charismatic and highly watchable villain, and the series breaks new ground by playing with the time travel mechanics first introduced in the last Avengers movie.",
    "New episodes will arrive every Wednesday until July 14, and stay tuned to TechRadar for all the latest Loki reviews, explainers and theories you could need.",
    "Now available to stream on Disney Plus",
    "A feature-film adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Tony Award-winning musical, In the Heights takes audiences to the toe-tapping, break-dancing neighborhood of New York's Washington Heights.",
    "Directed by Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 Jon M. Chu, the movie sets Miranda\u2019s original music and lyrics to vibrant set-pieces in the vein of La La Land and West Side Story, with critics praising its party-like atmosphere and refreshing positivity amid the doom and gloom of recent times.",
    "In the Heights will run on HBO Max for one month, alongside its theatrical release, and you can only get it at the $14.99 tier of the service \u2013 not the ad-supported one. In the UK, this one is only available in cinemas.",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max in the US",
    "It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen Mark Wahlberg on the big screen, hasn\u2019t it? Infinite, the story of one man\u2019s struggle to understand memories of a life he never had, was originally headed for a theatrical release in September, but now arrives as a Paramount Plus exclusive movie. It's not had stellar reviews, on the whole.",
    "Here, Wahlberg \u2013 who replaced Chris Evans in the lead role \u2013 stars alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor and Dylan O\u2019Brien in a sci-fi thriller that looks to have more than a few shades of Christopher Nolan to it. It\u2019s also an adaptation of a novel, The Reincarnationist Papers, by D. Eric Maikranz, and is directed by Antoine Fuqua (The Equalizer, Training Day) \u2013 so expect bullets and brawn.",
    "Those in the US not yet subscribed to Paramount Plus can enjoy a 7-day free trial.",
    "Now available to stream on Paramount Plus in the US",
    "One of Netflix\u2019s most popular original series, Lupin returns for a second season this weekend. \u201cPart Deux\u201d of the French crime drama once again follows the escapades of Omar Sy\u2019s Assane Diop, picking up where season 1\u2019s cliffhanger ending left off.",
    "With Assane\u2019s son, Raoul, abducted by the dastardly Pellegrini, Lupin sets out for revenge \u2013 but he must also now navigate the pressures of being the most wanted man in France.",
    "Season 3 \u2013 \u201cPart Trois\u201d \u2013 of the popular French-speaking show has also been confirmed, though we don\u2019t expect it to arrive until at least 2022. Just enjoy season 2 first, OK?",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "The UK\u2019s foremost potty-mouthed motorhead, Jeremy Clarkson, swaps The Grand Tour and Who Wants To Be a Millionaire for life on a provincial farm in Amazon Prime\u2019s aptly-titled Clarkson\u2019s Farm.",
    "In this series, we follow the presenter\u2019s haphazard attempts to run his own 1000-acre farm in Oxfordshire, England, as he encounters the stark \u2013 and smelly \u2013 realities of seed sowing, sheep shearing and s**t shoveling.",
    "In an interesting twist, the whole endeavor has been praised by almost every major outlet in the UK, with most professing it \u201csurprisingly fun\u201d. Whatever you think of Clarkson, then, this one could be worth a watch for the laughs alone.",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video",
    "In Awake, chaos ensues after a global event wipes out all electronics and takes away humankind\u2019s ability to sleep. Gina Rodriguez (Annihilation) stars as Jill, an ex-soldier who may hold the key to a cure.",
    "Granted, that doesn\u2019t sound like the most original premise, but sense-stealing thrillers like Bird Box and A Quiet Place have been roaring successes in recent years. That said, critics haven\u2019t been kind to this one so far \u2013 Awake currently scores a measly 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, while one outlet labelled it a \u201creal snooze.\u201d",
    "Maybe just sleep, instead?",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "Another new HBO Original series, Starstruck follows Jessie (Rose Matafeo), a London-living millennial juggling two dead-end jobs and navigating the pressures of becoming romantically involved with a famous film star (Nikesh Patel).",
    "It\u2019s been described as Notting Hill in reverse, which is an apt summary of not only Starstruck\u2019s plot, but sense of humor. Think of it as Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary, then, with more than a few hints of Fleabag thrown in for good measure. Minnie Driver and Russell Tovey also star.",
    "Given the critical reception so far, this one could be a gem.",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max"
