    "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap for Nintendo Switch will release on April 30, the Pok\u00e9mon Company has announced.",
    "A sequel to Pok\u00e9mon Snap, a classic Nintendo 64 game which released in 1999, soon gamers of all ages will be able to find out what all the fuss was about.",
    "Players will journey through the picturesque Lental region, capturing their favourite Pok\u00e9mon through the eye of the camera lens, and there are over 200 pocket monsters to snap. You\u2019ll need to build up your Pok\u00e9mon Photodex by observing wild Pok\u00e9mon in their natural habitat, so be prepared to shoot photos on land, air and sea.",
    "Getting the right shot will take a careful eye, as some Pok\u00e9mon will be found patrolling in packs, while others will be all on their lonesome. Your reaction speed will likely be tested, too, as some fleet-footed or flying Pok\u00e9mon won\u2019t stay in frame for long.",
    "Of course, you can make capturing that perfect Pikachu picture a little easier. Players can interact with the various Pok\u00e9mon they encounter by throwing Fluffruit, a delicious resource found throughout the Lental region. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to rely on a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s grumbling stomach to draw them out into particular situations.",
    "The better pictures you take in New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, the higher your score will be. It\u2019s important, then, to line up your shot, ensure your subjects are in frame, and while it won't earn you any extra points, it helps if they look adorable too.",
    "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap joins the likes of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury as one of the most anticipated Nintendo Switch releases this year. We're also expecting to see Breath of the Wild 2 in 2021, but Nintendo has been awfully quiet about how the game has been progressing since its initial reveal.",
    "Nintendo is also set to release a new Nintendo Switch Mario Red and Blue Edition console, which launches alongside Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury on February 12, though there's still no word on the long-rumored Nintendo Switch 2.",
    "For those who have been waiting decades for a sequel to Pok\u00e9mon Snap on Nintendo 64, the unique point and shoot gameplay that New Pok\u00e9mon Snap looks set to provide is likely to be well-received. Maybe we'll get a Pok\u00e9mon Snap VR game one day?"
