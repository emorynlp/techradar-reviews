    "Apple\u2019s AirTag trackers have proved to be a hit with iPhone users, though if you\u2019ve tried to put one in your wallet you might be disappointed with how bulky it is. Modder Andrew Ngai decided to take matters into his own hands, and has created the first AirTag card.",
    "Over on his YouTube channel, Ngai explained how he managed to pull off this alteration. If you have some patience it doesn\u2019t seem too difficult to do yourself either, just remember that taking your AirTag apart could void whatever warranty you have.",
    "But if you want to take that risk for a design that better suits your wallet tracking needs, then Ngai\u2019s video lays out everything you need to do. You\u2019ll need access to a 3D printer and some electrical tools though, so make sure you watch all the way through to avoid getting stuck with a busted AirTag.",
    "We expect to see Apple make different AirTag designs eventually, and a slimmer card-like option could be one we'll see within the next couple of years (rival Tile already has a card-shaped design itself). We\u2019d also like to see an AirTag case that uses adhesive to let you attach it to more products than the current version can.",
    "We wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see AirTag tech wind up in Apple\u2019s other products either, like the Apple AirPods. While there is already some integration with Find My and AirPods it\u2019s got a limited range and doesn\u2019t work if the earphones are in their case. AirTag integration might mean you'd finally be able to find your AirPods no matter where you lose them.",
    "These new versions will likely depend on the success of AirTags. While they seem to be all the rage right now, we\u2019ll have to see if they have staying power that warrants Apple developing new designs."
