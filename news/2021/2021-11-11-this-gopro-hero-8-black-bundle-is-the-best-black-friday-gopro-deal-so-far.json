    "We've long suspected that the GoPro Hero 8 Black might appear among this year's best Black Friday deals \u2013 and Walmart has just obliged with an early Black Friday offer on a bundle that includes three batteries and a Dual Battery Charger.",
    "This GoPro Hero 8 Black bundle is just $249 and effectively gives you all of those battery extras for free \u2013 it costs the same as the lowest current price for the GoPro Hero 8 Black. Considering the batteries and charger cost around $60 separately, it's a bit of a steal in the early Walmart Black Friday deals.",
    "The Hero 8 Black may not be GoPro's newest action camera \u2013 that title goes to the Hero 10 Black, which arrived in September \u2013 but it is still one of the most powerful 4K action cameras you can buy. In this fine GoPro Black Friday deal, it's also one of the best-value models around, as spare batteries are a near-essential action cam accessory that always come in handy.",
    "The Hero 8 Black is capable of shooting excellent 4K/60p video, which is bolstered by impressive HyperSmooth 2.0 stabilization and 1080p live-streaming powers. The Hero 8 Black was also the first GoPro to include handy built-in mounting fingers \u2013 which means you don't need a fiddly case to attach it to mounts \u2013 and it was also the first to provide compatibility with GoPro's Mod accessories, too.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "The main two features that are missing on the Hero 8 Black, compared to its newer siblings, are 5K video resolution and a front-facing screen. While these are nice-to-haves, particularly for vloggers, they're far from essential for everyone \u2013 and many people will find the Hero 8 Black offers more than enough for their adventuring needs.",
    "It's capable of shooting 4K/60p video, a frame-rate that gives you leeway for creating slo-mo cut scenes, and brings improvements to bit-rates and raw photo output that make it a cut above the older Hero 7 Black. That compatibility with GoPro's Mod accessories further boosts its versatility and future-proofing, as it gives you the option of adding an external microphone, front-facing screen or LED Light Mod once you're further into your filmmaking journey.",
    "This $275 deal is also cheaper than buying the Hero 8 Black (with only one battery and a microSD card) directly from GoPro with a Subscription. Without a Subscription, the action cam costs $299, so you're both saving money and getting useful free accessories with Walmart's time-limited deal.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the GoPro Hero 8 Black from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
