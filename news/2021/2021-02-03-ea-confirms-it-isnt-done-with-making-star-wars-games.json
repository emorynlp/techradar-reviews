    "EA Games' exclusive license to make Star Wars games may be set to end, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to stop making them.",
    "In January 2021, Ubisoft and LucasFilm Games announced that they\u2019re working on a new open world Star Wars game, effectively confirming the approaching end of EA\u2019s long-running exclusive license to develop games based on the Star Wars franchise.",
    "In a recent earnings call (via Eurogamer), EA\u2019s CEO Andrew Wilson reiterated the company\u2019s position that the end of this exclusive license won't mean the end of Star Wars games from EA.",
    "\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think you should imagine that the fact that some other people will build some Star Wars games is going to change our commitment to that IP or our ability to build the appropriate number of games,\u201d Wilson said, adding \u201cYou should expect us to continue to invest in our Star Wars relationship. It\u2019s been very profitable\u2026 and we\u2019re excited by what we\u2019ll be able to do in the future. But you shouldn\u2019t read this as necessarily us building the less titles.\u201d",
    "Wilson added that EA will \u201ccontinue to invest\u201d in the franchises its created \u201cas well as some new experiences across platforms for the future.\u201d",
    "Given it was also revealed in the call that the publisher\u2019s portfolio of Star Wars titles have sold in the millions and made it \u201cover $3bn in net bookings\u201d, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that EA would want to continue making Star Wars games.",
    "Wilson\u2019s words serve as a reiteration and elaboration on EA\u2019s previous statement that it\u2019s planning to produce more Star Wars games, in which it said \u201cWe are proud of our long-standing collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, which will continue for years to come\", adding \"We love Star Wars, and we look forward to creating more exciting experiences for players to enjoy.\u201d",
    "It seems, then, that the future holds a lot more Star Wars games which can only be a good thing, right? Right?"
