  "article": [
    "The Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) is Google\u2019s proposed mechanism to protect individuals from being identified by unscrupulous internet marketers, without taking away all the advantages of targeted advertising.",
    "However, the idea of lumping users into a cohort hasn\u2019t gone down well with privacy advocates. In fact, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) believes that FLoC is Google\u2019s attempt to create a replacement for the third-party cookie.",
    "As Google begins to roll out and test FLoC in limited markets around the world, TechRadar Pro spoke to with Gowthaman \u201cG\u2019man\u201d Ragothaman, CEO of Aqilliz, to understand if FLoC really is as bad as it is made out to be.",
    "Singapore-based Aqilliz uses a blockchain-based solution to address some of the same issues as Google FLoC without running afoul of privacy laws such as Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)."
