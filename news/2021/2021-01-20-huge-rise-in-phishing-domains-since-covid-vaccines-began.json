    "Cyberattackers are continuing to leverage the COVID-19 pandemic in their exploits, with new research indicating that the number of phishing campaigns centered on the vaccine roll-out has risen significantly of late.",
    "The Real-Time Anti-Phishing protection system developed by cybersecurity firm Webroot has found an increase in the number of malicious URLs using subjects like vaccines, COVID cures, and travel.",
    "These terms, which are particularly important to people in the current climate, are being utilized in order to encourage unsuspecting victims to click on suspicious links and open illegitimate emails.",
    "According to Webroot\u2019s analysis, the use of the word \u201cvaccine\u201d in suspicious domain names increased by 94.8% between December 8 last year and January 6, 2021, when compared to the previous 30 days. In addition, this period also showed an increase of 336% when compared with March 2020.",
    "In total, Webroot found more than 4,500 new suspicious domains that contained a reference to \u201cCOVID-19,\u201d \u201cCorona,\u201d \u201cvaccine,\u201d \u201ccure COVID,\u201d and other related terms. Of these, 934 domains included the word \u201cvaccine,\u201d while a further 611 contained a misspelling of \u201cvaccine.\u201d",
    "\u201cAs 2021 brings the first mass vaccination programs to fight COVID-19, we\u2019re already seeing cybercriminals exploiting the publicity and anticipation surrounding these to target businesses and consumers in phishing and domain spoofing attacks,\u201d Nick Emanuel, Senior Director of Product at Webroot, said. \u201cScams using keywords based on emotive subjects concerning medical safety and the pandemic are always going to be more effective, especially when they\u2019re in the public interest.\u201d",
    "Webroot\u2019s findings should come as no surprise, as it has long been observed that cyberattackers are attempting to use the pandemic to their advantage. Google recorded a record number of phishing attempts in 2020, while earlier this week the FBI issued a warning to businesses over a rise in vishing attacks."
