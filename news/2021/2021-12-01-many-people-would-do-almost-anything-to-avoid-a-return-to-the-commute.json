    "Modern workers hate commuting so much that many say they\u2019d do almost anything else instead, a report from RingCentral has found, claiming many would rather have their in-laws stay for the weekend or even clean toilets, than return to the office full time.",
    "To say employees prefer working remotely would apparently be an understatement, with RingCentral\u2019s report confirming two-thirds (66%) want just that. Should they be forced to return to the office in a full-time capacity, a quarter (25%) said they would look for a new job elsewhere.",
    "And many really are looking for new jobs. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 791,000 UK workers (2.6% of the country\u2019s entire workforce) swapped jobs in Q2 2021. This is also the highest total since March 2019, and before that, the highest in a decade.",
    "Of all the workers that are driving this \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d trend, the majority are relatively young. Roughly a third (32%) of 21-24-year-olds said to be planning to leave their current employer, while an additional 27% said they\u2019ll do it within the next six months.",
    "A third of millennials said they\u2019d seek out a new position if their current bosses force them to return to the office in a bigger capacity.",
    "While the loathing towards commute may be driving the desire for remote and hybrid working, RingCentral also uncovered another major cause - social anxiety. It was said that more than half (52%) of employees now have new colleagues they\u2019ve never met in their life, and 47% of them have expressed anxiety about meeting them face-to-face.",
    "They seem to be particularly worried about Covid-19, as the majority (75%) believe those who return to the office should be vaccinated.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to flippantly say that workers should \u2018get off their Pelotons\u2019 and return to the office, but for many individuals, the introduction of a hybrid working model has been a lifeline,\u201d said Steve Rafferty, Country Manager, UK and Ireland, RingCentral.",
    "\u201cGiving people flexibility to manage work around other commitments helps to boost work-life balance, and supports those who may have challenges such as mental health concerns. What\u2019s more, the last 18 months have proven that with the right collaboration tools, it is possible not only to build highly productive teams, but also meaningful human connections with colleagues to generate positive working relationships. One way or another, the data is clear: if businesses want to retain their staff they need to offer an environment that caters to modern needs.\u201d"
