    "We\u2019re just hours away from the full announcement of the Google Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro, but if you were hoping the Pixel Watch might make an appearance too then you\u2019re probably going to be out of luck.",
    "According to Jon Prosser (a leaker with a generally solid but far from perfect track record) it won\u2019t be in attendance, but he claims that it\u2019s still happening, just that it\u2019s been delayed until the first quarter of 2022 (so sometime between January and March).",
    "This isn\u2019t at all surprising, as while we\u2019ve been hearing rumors about the Google Pixel Watch for years, including claims that it could land at today\u2019s event, we still don\u2019t have a super clear picture of it, and we\u2019d expect to by now if it was going to launch this soon.",
    "That said, we\u2019d still take this claim of a delay with a pinch of salt. Prosser has been wrong before, and even if the Pixel Watch isn\u2019t fully unveiled today, there\u2019s always a chance that it could be teased \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t sound like Prosser thinks even that will happen.",
    "Hopefully whenever the Google Pixel Watch does launch it will be worth the wait. It should be the much-needed showcase device for Wear OS, something which the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 briefly sounded like it might be, but wasn\u2019t quite due to some features being made exclusive to Samsung phone owners.",
    "While the likely lack of a Pixel Watch today is disappointing (if unsurprising) we shouldn\u2019t be short of Google announcements.",
    "As well as the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro \u2013 which look set to be the most exciting Pixel phones in years \u2013 we\u2019re also expecting the full launch of Android 12, and there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll also see the Google Pixel Fold and Google Pixel Buds (2021).",
    "There are also compelling rumors of a Pixel Pass, which could bundle together various subscription services along with a yearly handset upgrade.",
    "Admittedly, we\u2019re not super optimistic that the Pixel Fold will show up, but if all the other stuff does then this could be a packed event.",
