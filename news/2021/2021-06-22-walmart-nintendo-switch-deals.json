    "If you're on the hunt for Nintendo Switch deals on top titles right now, you may be surprised to learn they aren't confined to Prime Day deals - there are, in fact, awesome options elsewhere.",
    "Right now, Walmart is offering up its lowest ever prices for Nintendo Switch deals on a number of leading titles, including The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, Luigi's Mansion 3, Super Mario Odyssey, and Fire Emblem: Three Houses.",
    "Currently, all four titles are going for $39.88, with discounts ranging from $10 to $20 depending on the title's original retail price. As we all know, Nintendo Switch deals on games don't actually tend to come up that often since they really hold their value even years after release. We're not seeing the prices being beat by Prime Day Nintendo Switch deals either... although you never know what Amazon may have up its sleeve. Not in the US? Scroll down for the best Nintendo Switch deals in your region.",
    "We've rounded up the full price breakdowns alongside a little bit of info about each game just down below. We've also included the best prices on other leading titles at the bottom of the page also if these sales don't catch your eye.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Nintendo Switch games from around the web right here, with offers available in your region.",
    "See all the latest Nintendo Switch deals and sales near you if you're visiting from outside the US."
