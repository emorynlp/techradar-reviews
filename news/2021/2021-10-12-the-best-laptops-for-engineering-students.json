    "Students searching for the best laptops for engineering need a lot of power. But, they need a few other things as well. Most matriculating minds on their way back to school need to find that sweet spot between performance and price, and should look at laptops ideal for college. Engineering students, however, need powerful graphics cards, as well as other capable innards, to be able to fully utilize programs like CAD and CAM, not to mention handle computational tasks that require a lot of computing power.",
    "All that power needs to come in a reasonably priced package that also has great battery life and is lightweight. While they might not compare pricewise to cheap laptops, they need to be within a college student\u2019s budget. Additionally, the best engineering laptops should be able to last the whole day on a single charge as well as be easy enough to lug around from class to class.",
    "We\u2019ve done the hard work for you and gathered the best laptops for engineering students here, some of which are under $1,000, just in time for back to school season. Since we've tested these notebooks, rest assured that you\u2019re getting quality, regardless of your pick.",
    "The Dell XPS 15 is, without a doubt, one of the best laptops for engineering students to hit the streets this year.",
