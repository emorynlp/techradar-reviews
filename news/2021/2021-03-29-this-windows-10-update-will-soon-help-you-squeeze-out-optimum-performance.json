    "Toggling one or more of these options will allow Microsoft access to your data in order to \"create personalized experiences\", which could include suggestions for tools and services to download from the Windows Store.",
    "There's no indication that this Windows 10 optimisation will extend to hardware as well as software, meaning that issues such as RAM-hogging applications and battery usage may continue.",

    "Choosing what exactly you'll be using your device for should allow Microsoft to make sure it doesn't flood you with annoying or unnecessary suggestions, as well as making sure certain apps such as video conferencing or presentation software are a bit more visible to first-time users.",
