    "If you\u2019re looking for a new vacuum cleaner in this year\u2019s Prime Day deals, don\u2019t buy the latest models. This might seem like strange advice, but hear us out because some of the very best vacuum cleaners aren\u2019t the ones that came out five minutes ago.",
    "Right now, you can save $75 on the iRobot Roomba 692 Robot Vacuum at Amazon, now $189.99 down from $274.99. This isn\u2019t the latest model from iRobot, but it\u2019s a fantastic option if you need a powerful robot vacuum cleaner and you don\u2019t want to spend a fortune.",
    "Likewise, the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Turbo is also reduced to an impressive $169.99, down from $209.99 at Amazon. This model provides strong suction power and a great range of tools, and you can grab it at this low price today.",
    "Prime Day is the perfect time to save on a fantastic vacuum cleaner because it\u2019s likely that some of the highest-rated models that have been available for over a year or so, will see big price cuts as manufacturers bring out newer models.",
    "Not in the US? Keep scrolling to find unmissable deals in your region.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a robot vacuum cleaner, many models now come with the ability to be programmed for software updates so that they don\u2019t date quite as quickly, so opting for a slightly older model isn\u2019t a bad idea.",
    "Aside from that, choosing a vacuum can come down to personal preference. Vacuum cleaners have come such a long way in recent years that chunky and heavy upright vacuums with clumsy floor heads are a thing of the past.",
    "Even models that are three or four years old have brilliant steering, easy-to-empty dust cups, and for cordless models, long battery run times. If you\u2019re loyal to a certain vacuum brand, it\u2019s well worth looking at previous models as it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll see impressive discounts this Prime Day.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for vacuum cleaners from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
