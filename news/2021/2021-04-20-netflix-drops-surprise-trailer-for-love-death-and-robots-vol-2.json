    "In a surprise reveal, Netflix has announced the return of its excellent animated anthology series Love, Death & Robots with a wild trailer for the show's second volume.",
    "With a creative team that includes directors Tim Miller (Deadpool, Terminator: Dark Fate) and David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network), Love, Death & Robots is a collection of animated shorts which span a variety of genres, such as science fiction, horror and fantasy.",
    "Although the shorts are animated, Love, Death & Robots is strictly an adults only affair, with copious amounts of sex and violence throughout \u2013 hardly surprising when you consider the project started out as an adaptation of the illustrated Heavy Metal magazine.",
    "While it's hard to discern much about Love, Death & Robots Vol. 2 from the frantic trailer above, its YouTube page promises \"Naked giants, Christmas demons, and robots-gone-wild,\" which sounds pretty great to us.",
    "Keen-eyed observers will also spot a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance from Creed actor Michael B. Jordan (pictured above), albeit in computer-animated form.",
    "Thankfully, fans won't have to wait much longer to get a second helping of Love, Death & Robots, with Volume 2 set to arrive next month on May 14. Additionally, the trailer also reveals that a third volume is on the way, with a tentative release date of 2022."
