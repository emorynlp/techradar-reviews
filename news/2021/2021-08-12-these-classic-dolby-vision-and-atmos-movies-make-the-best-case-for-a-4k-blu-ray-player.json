  "article": [
    "The Criterion Channel, an online streaming service for classic films over the ages, is set to release its first ever slate of 4K Blu-ray movies this year \u2013 with iconic flicks from David Lynch, Orson Welles and Jane Campion, among others.",
    "These six films will get the 4K Blu-ray treatment for the first time, with each title releasing with a 4K Blu-ray, HD alternative, as well as a host of special features. Some titles \u201cwill be presented in Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos,\u201d though we\u2019re yet to hear which ones in particular.",
    "The films include the classic Citizen Kane (Orson Welles), Menace II Society (Allen and Albert Hughes), The Piano (Jane Campion), Muholland Dr. (David Lynch), The Red Shoes (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger), and A Hard Day\u2019s Night (Richard Lester).",
    "With Dolby Vision offering an even more carefully-calibrated picture over regular HDR, and Atmos widening the possibilities of three-dimensional sound \u2013 if you have the right equipment for these formats, that is \u2013 there's little doubt that this is the best way to experience these films without being in an actual cinema.",
    "A blog post for the announcement informs us that more details are coming later in August for the first release, \u201cwith others to follow in subsequent months.\u201d",
    "While release times aren\u2019t fully clear, it does mean that you have time to start considering a 4K Blu-ray player for your home theater system \u2013 giving as it does a number of advantages over the world of online streaming.",
    "It might be surprising that these films haven\u2019t come to 4K Blu-rays before \u2013 if distributors aren\u2019t committing these films to high-res discs, what are they doing with their time?",
    "Most or all of these flicks will have come to HD Blu-rays before, and while 4K resolution is now a prevailing standard for new content and new 4K TVs, it hasn\u2019t been that way for a very long time.",
    "The first ever 4K Blu-rays were released in 2016 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, in a slate that included The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Salt, Hancock, Chappie, Pineapple Express, and The Smurfs 2. And while new Marvel movies may line up with a 4K Blu-ray shortly after a theatrical release, less commercial (read: older) films don\u2019t always get the same treatment as fast.",
    "But the best case for 4K Blu-rays is still getting to watch iconic films in the highest quality possible \u2013 and that means getting a 4K Blu-ray player. Any of you with a new PS5 or Xbox Series X will have one included in the disc drive (PS5 Digital Edition and Xbox Series S notwithstanding), anyhow, but standalone models like the Panasonic DP-UB9000 also ensure a lag-free experience and broad format support for the likes of Dolby Vision and HDR10+.",
    "These \u2018offline\u2019 solutions mean you\u2019re not at the mercy of internet bandwidth, buffering, or service outages \u2013 though as streaming improves, and we get more used to watching Netflix shows on our laptops or phones, the argument for 4K Blu-ray players may be getting weaker.",
    "If you\u2019re yet to jump in, then, you may want to buy a model before production for 4K Blu-ray players dries up even further."
