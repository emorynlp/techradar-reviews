    "I love handheld gaming. As much as I have to concede the superior picture quality of a good gaming TV and high-powered console, I almost always find myself lapsing into a more casual setup \u2013 lying on the sofa, tucked up in bed, or lounging on a windowsill like a Jane Austen heroine with a penchant for roguelikes and action RPGs.",
    "This penchant for the casual has meant that the upcoming Playdate handheld console has fully captured my attention, offering a sleek, modernized take on the GameBoy with a bright yellow aesthetic, a host of indie 1-Bit games, and a bewildering crank mechanism like nothing else on the market. There\u2019s even an optional speaker accessory with a pencil holder, turning the Playdate into a cute and quirky deskside companion in a way that bulkier gaming machines simply couldn\u2019t achieve.",
    "But the main draw of Playdate is in what it acts as a platform for, with a wave of custom-made indie games having been created for the unique handheld, acting as a palette cleanser in a sea of mainstream titles and AAA franchises with near-identical controllers or mouse-and-keyboard inputs. Ever wanted to play a zine? That\u2019s what the Playdate feels like.",
    "However, Playdate is having to share the limelight with a number of other handheld console announcements this year \u2013 all of which are sure to get more attention and more gamers\u2019 cash.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED is set to bring a serious picture upgrade to the hybrid console when it releases in October this year, improving its handheld experience with a larger seven-inch OLED panel and more stable kickstand, even if there aren\u2019t any upgrades for those who tend to keep their Switch docked for use with their television.",
    "Valve's Steam Deck begins shipping in December, with a similar form factor to the Switch, but with much more power and the vast expanses of Steam\u2019s PC game marketplace to recommend it.",
    "Both of these consoles are exciting in their own right, and the key question for most handheld gamers in the coming year will be which to opt for. In my case, though, only the Playdate is likely to get my cash.",
    "I\u2019ve had a Nintendo Switch for the past two years, and as keen as I\u2019d be to improve the handheld experience \u2013 indeed, that\u2019s what I begged Nintendo for earlier in the year \u2013 the chance for a wholly different console with its own unique inputs and suite of exclusive indie games is too good to pass up.",
    "These indie games will certainly be relatively short affairs \u2013 no 100-hour RPGs here \u2013 but when the publisher behind Firewatch and Untitled Goose Game makes a gaming console, you pay attention.",
    "Panic has a reputation for putting out both quality narratives and brilliant silliness, and the upcoming season of Playdate games (with two releasing each week in the two months after the console launch) looks set to continue that legacy. It even includes a title called Mars After Midnight from the developer behind Return of the Obra Dinn, a critically-acclaimed 1-bit mystery game, so it\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t just a platform for first-draft or otherwise-discarded game ideas.",
    "Crucially, though, the PlayDate console will finally be available to pre-order from July 29 \u2013 retailing for $179 (around \u00a3125 / AU$230) at launch. The first 20,000 preorders should ship in late 2021, with remaining orders being fulfilled in 2022.",
    "That\u2019s only slightly less than the price of a Nintendo Switch Lite, but around half what you\u2019d pay for the Nintendo Switch OLED (which will retail for $349.99 / \u00a3309.99 / AU$539) and far less than any of the upcoming Steam Deck models (which start at $399 / \u00a3349 for the basic version and cap at almost twice that amount).",
    "Given I already have a mainline Nintendo Switch, the Playdate allows me to get a brand new, secondary console for half the price of a mid-cycle Switch OLED upgrade. And, as I\u2019m not much of a PC gamer, I don\u2019t have a bulging Steam library just waiting to be ported onto a portable device. I would be starting effectively from scratch, and no doubt paying through the nose to get the Steam Deck hardware as well as a smattering of quality PC games. Not so with the Playdate, which bundles its games in for free with that $179 price tag.",
    "It\u2019s easy to dismiss the Playdate as a hipster console \u2013 a quirky, overly-yellow side piece that can\u2019t offer the vast capabilities of more mainline gaming machines. But if you\u2019re after something different, and don\u2019t feel the urgency to buy a premium Switch or portable gaming PC \u2013 especially if you have an existing Switch model or desktop gaming PC in your life already \u2013 it could offer a refreshing tonic to your regular gaming staples. It\u2019s certainly the only console I\u2019m excited to buy in the coming year."
