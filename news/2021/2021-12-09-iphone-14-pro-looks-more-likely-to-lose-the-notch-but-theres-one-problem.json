  "article": [
    "Some of us here at TechRadar have been railing against the notch for years, and it seems that Apple might finally be getting on board, as there\u2019s growing evidence that at least some of the iPhone 14 range will have a punch-hole camera instead.",
    "The latest leak in that direction comes from The Elec, which claims to have learned that both the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max will have a punch-hole selfie camera.",
    "The site adds that the standard iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Max will be stuck with a notch still, and that the two Pro models will \u2013 like their predecessors \u2013 have 120Hz refresh rate screens.",
    "LG Display is reportedly in the running to provide some of those screens \u2013 taking orders away from Samsung Display \u2013 but it sounds like that\u2019s yet to be confirmed.",
    "In fact, none of this is confirmed yet, but 120Hz refresh rates on the Pro models seems all but guaranteed given that the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max have 120Hz screens. The bigger question is whether the iPhone 14 Max will as well or not.",
    "As for punch-hole cameras, that would be a big shift for Apple so we\u2019re less sure of that, but a number of leaks have now pointed in that direction, so there\u2019s a good chance that\u2019s accurate too.",
    "One reason that Apple has stuck with a notch for so long is the company\u2019s Face ID tech. This is housed in the notch, and there\u2019s more to it than just a single camera lens, with various sensors and other tech also involved.",
    "So Apple presumably won\u2019t be able to house all of that in a punch-hole (unless it\u2019s a very big punch-hole), meaning that it needs to find another home for these things if it\u2019s to get rid of the notch.",
    "The Elec\u2019s story doesn\u2019t shed any light on what that home would be, but previous leaks have suggested Apple might move the Face ID tech under the display.",
    "That though could prove quite challenging. We\u2019ve started seeing under-display cameras on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, and their performance isn\u2019t great. Face ID isn\u2019t quite the same as a normal camera and may not be as hard to get right, but it\u2019s probably not easy either.",
    "So hopefully Apple has achieved this, but if we don\u2019t end up getting a punch-hole camera on any iPhone 14 models, then Face ID is probably to blame.",
