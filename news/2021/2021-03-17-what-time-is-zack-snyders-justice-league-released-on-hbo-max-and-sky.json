    "Zack Snyder's Justice League has finally released \u2013 and if you're reading this, you're no doubt fascinated to watch it, whether you're part of the fanbase that campaigned to have the revised four-hour film released on HBO Max, or if you're just watching it so you can later complain about how long it is on social media.",
    "Either way, the wait is almost over \u2013 territories like the US, UK and Australia can all watch Zack Snyder's Justice League simultaneously on its release date of March 18, 2021. The new cut follows the same plot as 2017's theatrical release, which sees the alien warrior Steppenwolf coming to Earth in search of powerful items called Mother Boxes, while Batman and Wonder Woman attempt to form a team to stop the alien invasion and save Earth. Can they do it without Clark Kent, who died at the end of Batman v Superman?",
    "We've seen the film at TechRadar, and it's a largely grim affair with around two mostly dull hours of exposition before the story actually kicks into gear. Still, it is a more tonally consistent film than the original cut, and it's a genuinely fascinating artifact that shows the differences editing and artistic sensibilities can make to a finished movie. That said, it's a shame the end result couldn't be more entertaining \u2013 even if you do get a much better final battle in this version.",
    "You can now watch Zack Snyder's Justice League on HBO Max in the US, Sky/Now TV in the UK and Binge/Foxtel in Australia. Here's when it dropped.",
    "HBO Max confirmed to us that Zack Snyder's Justice League would release on March 18 at 12.01am PDT/3.01am EDT, which means you can watch it now. If you're US-based, then, get ready to stay up super late to watch it on HBO Max.",
    "Zack Snyder's Justice League released simultaneously in the UK as it landed in the US. Sky Cinema Premiere started showing it at 7.02AM GMT on Thursday, March 18 \u2013 the film is available to stream on-demand on Sky and Now TV (via the Sky Cinema Pass) at the exact same time.",
    "Zack Snyder's Justice League landed in Australia on 6pm AEDT on Thursday, March 18, and is available to watch on the Binge and Foxtel Now streaming services. Unfortunately, Zack Snyder's Justice League is not be available to stream at the full 4K resolution in Australia, as both Binge and Foxtel Now max out at 1080p."
