    "Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson and I probably don\u2019t have much in common. He\u2019s a muscled ex-wrestler, while I\u2019m an average-bodied writer. He\u2019s a charismatic and energetic celebrity, while I\u2019ve never been caught looking good on camera. He can act; I can\u2019t.",
    "However, I was presented with the opportunity to get one step closer to him when JBL and Under Armour unveiled their UA Project Rock Over-Ear Training Headphones, a collaboration between the audio brand, the sportswear brand and the geologically named celebrity.",
    "Now, I'd hazard a guess that the units received weren't Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson\u2019s personal headphones \u2013 the plastic wrap on the box implies they aren\u2019t. However, I haven\u2019t seen any conclusive evidence that he hasn\u2019t worn these before \u2013 but presumably the man\u2019s good taste has trickled into these headphones\u2019 design and audio capabilities anyway.",
    "As part of my fortnightly running column, I\u2019ve been testing various bits of exercise tech, and so the Project Rock cans seemed a perfect choice\u2013 they\u2019re literally called \u2018Training Headphones\u2019, after all. Since the TechRadar offices re-opened following the pandemic, my workout motivation has been flagging. I was in need of a gadget to get me back on track.",
    "More important, The Rock often refers to \u2018Beast mode\u2019, which is all about \u2018pushing yourself to your limits\u2019. Well, I treat my limits like I treat that cute coffee shop from which I live across \u2013 I keep meaning to go, but haven\u2019t had a chance just yet. So my thinking was that these headphones would help me.",
    "I\u2019ve already written about these sturdy over-ear headphones being super-useful for outdoor workouts \u2013 but going in 'Beast mode' presumably isn\u2019t about doing what you can, it\u2019s about doing what you can\u2019t. Going on runs now and then is definitely something I can do, it\u2019s literally what this entire column is about.",
    "No, to find 'Beast mode' I needed to try harder, something that can prove quite difficult when you\u2019re more versed in \u2018feast mode\u2019. After running around my local park a few times in the headphones, I certainly didn\u2019t feel like I was nearing 'Beast mode'.",
    "I needed to hit Johnson\u2019s level of workout, or as close to it as I could get, so I dug out some cheap home gym gear I bought for another of these workout columns: a pull-up bar, some resistance bands and an ab roller, to be precise.",
    "This kit has seen action now and then, but my first course of action was to put together a routine to use it all \u2013 and then start following said routine daily, alongside heading out on frequent runs. To make the most of the cans, I really needed to Rock them.",
    "I spent several days tugging on bands, pulling up on bars, rolling some\u2026 abs? Eventually, I was comfortably following a 30-minute routine that easily fit into my day.",
    "But there\u2019s that word, \u2018comfort\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s not the point! That\u2019s not 'Beast mode'! I needed to try harder.",
    "I couldn't just emulate The Rock in 'Beast mode', I needed to emulate him in spirit, too.",
    "My first port of call was Spotify \u2013 these are headphones, after all \u2013 and made a playlist of songs from movies starring The Rock. This turned out to be a terrible idea, since the Venn diagram of \u2018films starring Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson\u2019 and \u2018movies with soundtracks that are great to work out to\u2019 has little overlap.",
    "So I did an entire run \u2013 about 10km \u2013 listening solely to See You Again. It\u2019s a good song, but the closest I got to \u2018Beast mode\u2019 was almost turning feral at the endless repetitions. That was a poor idea.",
    "The headphones have a Project Rock EQ mode that boosts the bass and sound quality, which made the heavier parts of See You Again even more thumping \u2013 but given that half the song is just piano and high-pitched singing, I probably would have appreciated the changes more so with a different song.",
    "When I got home, I paired the cans to my iPad and started going through my workout routine while I watched Mr Johnson on Netflix: Journey 2: The Mysterious Island was a natural choice, as a fan of Jules Verne myself.",
    "Seeing the muscled legend ride on bees and beat up electric eels made me really conscious of my own body. I could barely pull myself up on the bar, let alone pull Josh Hutcherson through a CGI jungle (and puberty).",
    "But I have the wonderful ability to zone out of tasks when I\u2019m watching a movie, and this made it easy to continue through several sets of each exercise without noticing. Suddenly, I was resisting the resistance band's pull and doing sets of squats without falling apart.",
    "By the time the film was over, while I hadn\u2019t quite found 'Beast mode', I had lost \u2018Tom mode\u2019, which is probably the next best thing. I\u2019m not sure this is thanks to, or the fault of, the Project Rock headphones. I reckon it's mainly down to my determination to look a little bit more like Dwayne Johnson, and less like that blob ghost from Ghostbusters.",
    "But maybe that\u2019s the point of branded tech \u2013 it\u2019s neither literally nor figuratively going to turn you into your icon, but it will at least encourage you to try.",
    "I now do a workout each time I'm watching a movie at home \u2013 this happens quite frequently, given I aim to watch 25 movies a month \u2013 and my \u2018Beast mode\u2019 exercises let me work out without noticing. Sure, this is unlikely to help in my quest to run or walk the distance of Route 66 in two years, but it's certainly making me fitter, which is the whole point."
