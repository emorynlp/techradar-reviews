  "article": [
    "There\u2019s no denying that modern businesses have more needs \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 for enterprise applications than ever before.",
    "But often, developers (and everyone else) in IT are already maxed out, with little or no time and priority for such programming requests.",
    "Happily\u2014and not a moment too soon\u2014low-code development platforms are giving businesses creative ways to solve many of these pressing application needs. By letting employees who understand the business problems use these low-code tools to act as \"citizen developers,\" organizations can meet the growing demand for business applications.",
    "With the right training and platform, citizen developers can create low-code applications that solve their day-to-day challenges. (Developers in IT may also use low-code tools at times, of course.)",
    "For example, a PR intern at ServiceNow, with no prior coding experience created an app to streamline the company's internal press release request/approval process. She did this in about three weeks \u2014 including learning how to use ServiceNow's App Engine \u2014 without interfering with her other activities.",
    "This means that more useful applications are being created without adding more IT headcount, or the time to find and hire them \u2014 or adding to existing IT backlogs.",
    "From the point of view of employees, customers, and others who use them, these low-code tools use a visually based interface to create apps that look like the other office productivity applications already on employees' desktops and notebook computers, tablets, and smartphones.",
    "The main difference lies in how they were developed. With low-code apps:",
    "According to Microsoft's Charles Lamanna, \u201cOver 500 million new apps will be built during the next five years, which is more than all the apps built in the last 40 years.\u201d And most of those, says Simon Bisson in this white paper, will need to be low-code.",
    "One thing that makes low-code so effective is that it puts the power of problem-solving in the hands of those who best understand the issue. Because citizen developers are closest to the problem, they often have the most innovative insight into how it can be solved.",
    "Equally, empowered citizen developers can spot new opportunities for an app that can streamline a manual process and save the employee or customer time. For example, changes in business processes caused by many more employees working from home could impact workflow traditionally done using paper and spreadsheets.",
    "\"When you think about all of the business processes that are still handled through spreadsheets, email, and other manual processes, you quickly realize that low-code is a huge opportunity,\u201d says Josh Kahn, ServiceNow\u2019s senior vice president of creator workflow products. Ideal workflow tasks for low-coding include assigning, submitting requests, tracking, and creating tasks.",
    "And, Kahn points out, \u201cThere are very complicated, very high-value processes that are still manual today.\u201d",
    "Here are some examples of low-code solutions created by non-IT citizen developers using ServiceNow\u2019s low-code tools and platform:",
    "While low-code platforms let employees who aren't part of IT develop new apps, IT does remain strongly involved, \u201cguardrailing\u201d the citizen developers and their apps to ensure these new apps are doing what they\u2019re supposed to while meeting security, compliance, and other IT concerns.",
    "IT\u2019s involvement ensures non-technical employees can safely create the applications they need to be more productive, while IT is freed up to work on the bigger, hairier enterprise applications they were trained for. It\u2019s a win for everyone\u2014including the business."
