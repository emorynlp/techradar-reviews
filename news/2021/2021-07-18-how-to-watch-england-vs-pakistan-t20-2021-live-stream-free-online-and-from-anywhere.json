    "With The Hundred just around the corner, we're in key T20 territory in the British Isles right now. And like the upcoming domestic cricket competition, you can watch England vs Pakistan today on free-to-air television and live stream online. With this guide we'll explain how, including a way to see it if you happen to be abroad this weekend.",
    "You have to say that the ODI series between England and Pakistan that preceded the current T20 trio was a bit of a weird one. After a Covid-induced panic ahead of the first game, England effectively fielded a second string XI (albeit with the mighty Ben Stokes at the helm).",
    "And yet they still came out as 3-0 victors. The third and final game was the best of the trilogy, with the home side chasing down 331 with two overs remaining. If nothing else, Pakistan can at least take some positives from captain Babar Azam's magnificent 150-odd knock.",
    "And in the first game of this series on Friday night at Trent Bridge, Azam continued that fine form with a knock that propelled the visitors to a massive 232 in their twenty overs and a win by 31 runs.",
    "To see if the hosts can bounce back today at Headingly, you can follow our guide for all the details you need to find a 2021 England vs Pakistan T20 cricket live stream and watch all the action from the ODI cricket series online from anywhere - including those crucial free options.",
    "In Pakistan, Australia or the US? We've got you covered below with your official broadcasting options.",
    "But if you're out of the country and are still desperate to tune into certain matches, you'll quickly find that online access is geo-blocked. In order to get around that (and assuming it complies with the Ts&Cs of the broadcaster in question), you can download and use a VPN.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream cricket from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, for example, just head to BBC iPlayer and stream like you were back at home"
