  "summary": "Here\u2019s what\u2019s dropping on streamers this weekend",
  "article": [
    "It\u2019s throwback season on streamers this weekend. Jungle Cruise arrives on Disney Plus to whisk audiences back to the old-timey adventure flicks of the 80s (that themselves were evoking serials from decades before that), while Amazon Prime\u2019s The Pursuit of Love switches up the period drama formula by merging the electric rock of the 90s with a conventional 20s setting.",
    "There\u2019s some contemporary drama, too, in the shape of The Grand Tour\u2019s four-wheeled hijinks, but a pair of documentaries on John DeLorean and the Harlem Cultural Festival keep proceedings firmly in the rear view mirror.",
    "That\u2019s not to say this week\u2019s arrivals are any less interesting, of course, and below we\u2019ve rounded up the best movies and TV shows coming to the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and HBO Max over the next few days.",
    "Ever been to Disneyland? If so, you\u2019re probably familiar with the Jungle Cruise, a riverboat ride that sends punters down a stream full of animatronic animals and lost explorers. Well, Disney decided to turn that ride into a feature film \u2013 as it did with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise \u2013 and the result is the imaginatively-named Jungle Cruise.",
    "Starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, the movie follows a doctor and boat captain on their search for an ancient tree with healing powers. If that doesn\u2019t sound like the most engaging premise, that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t \u2013 but a great cast and high production values mean Jungle Cruise is still a fun adventure.",
    "You\u2019ll have to fork out to watch it, though. As with Black Widow before it, Jungle Cruise will cost $29.99 / \u00a319.99 / AU$34.99 via Disney Plus\u2019 Premier Access service.",
    "Click here if you want to go straight to the Jungle Cruise page on Disney Plus.",
    "Now available to stream on Disney Plus via Premier Access",
    "What is it with Britain and its obsession with period dramas? Well, if they\u2019re all as good as The Pursuit of Love, long may that obsession continue.",
    "A three-part miniseries originally commissioned for the BBC, this adaptation of Nancy Mitford's 1945 novel tells the tale of two cousins who take very different paths in search of their ideal husbands. Actress Emily Mortimer directs for the first time, while Lily James, Dominic West, Emily Beecham, Dolly Well and Andrew Scott all star in what has been described as a scathing satire of the British upper class.",
    "Scott\u2019s performance, in particular, has been praised for its humor and a scene-stealing dance sequence \u2013 so Fleabag fans, take note.",
    "UK viewers can already watch this one on BBC iPlayer, rather than Amazon Prime Video.",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video US",
    "Speaking of satirizing the upper class, The Prince arrives on HBO Max as an animated lampooning of the British Royal Family. In this show, seven-year-old Prince George spills the beans on his parents, grandparents and Buckingham Palace\u2019s residents and staff.",
    "Family Guy\u2019s Gary Janetti leads the voice cast as George, alongside an oddly stellar lineup which includes Orlando Bloom, Alan Cumming, Sophie Turner, Tom Hollander and Dan Stevens.",
    "Interestingly, this one has come rather out of the blue \u2013 HBO didn\u2019t announce it would begin streaming today until\u2026 yesterday, and given some of the backlash the show has received so far (check out some of the YouTube comments on the trailer above, we don't need to litigate them here), that was probably a wise executive decision.",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max in the US",
    "The latest episode of The Grand Tour Presents has arrived, and follows the customary vehicular antics of trusty trio of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond as they embark on an adventure through the Scottish Highlands.",
    "Called Lochdown, the special was filmed in 2020 amid the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which limited the show\u2019s ability to shoot abroad. It therefore replaced original plans to film in Russia, and marks the third episode in The Grand Tour\u2019s fourth season, after the release of A Massive Hunt in December 2020.",
    "Don\u2019t expect a dampened experience, though. Lochdown sees the hosts drive classic American cars from Edinburgh to the Hebrides on a Route 66-style road trip, which May has described as \u201cthe most beautiful drive [they\u2019ve] ever done.\u201d",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video",
    "Thanks to the Back to the Future franchise, everyone knows the cultural impact of the DMC DeLorean \u2013 but what about the man behind the name?",
    "This new Netflix docuseries charts the rise and fall of automaker John DeLorean, combining interviews and exclusive footage to paint a dark portrait of a man who made it all the way to the top, before it all came crashing down.",
    "Netflix rarely misses with its expos\u00e9 documentaries, so expect the usual helping of jaw-dropping moments from this one.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "You\u2019ve heard of Love Island. You\u2019ve heard of Too Hot to Handle. And now, as if we were short on shows matchmaking photoshopped singles, FBoy Island arrives to reinvent the formula.",
    "Basically, this show mixes up The Bachelor format by letting three women decide whether their suitor is a nice guy or a f*** boy. We haven\u2019t seen it, we probably won\u2019t see it, so that\u2019s about all we can tell you in good faith.",
    "Oh, and Nikki Glaser hosts? Whether that\u2019s a push or a pull, we\u2019ll leave to you...",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max in the US",
    "Now, we included this one in a similar round-up last month, but music documentary Summer of Soul has since arrived on Disney Plus in the UK as well as Hulu in the US, so we thought it was worth another mention.",
    "Directed by American musician Questlove, Summer of Soul charts the impact of 1969\u2019s Harlem Cultural Festival, which saw the likes of Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone and B.B. King grace the stage in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a summer of soul.",
    "Reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this one, especially after it scooped both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Expect heaps of previously unseen footage and a healthy dose of feel-good nostalgia.",
    "Now available to stream on Disney Plus UK via Star"
