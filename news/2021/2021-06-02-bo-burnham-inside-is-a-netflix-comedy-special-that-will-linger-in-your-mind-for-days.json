  "article": [
    "It\u2019s been five years since Bo Burnham graced the stage in a stand-up capacity. Save for a couple of movie roles, as well as writing and directing his feature debut (the critically acclaimed Eighth Grade), the multi-talented US comedian has been on a self-imposed exile from public life since his last tour, 2016\u2019s Make Happy, ended.",
    "Burnham\u2019s fans understood why. Suffering from onstage panic attacks, amid a downturn in his overall mental health, Burnham stepped away from the limelight and many people wondered if he\u2019d perform live again.",
    "As it happens, he would, but not in the manner we\u2019d have expected. Inside is Burnham\u2019s first comedy special for half a decade \u2013 and it\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen or experienced before.",
    "Filmed at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, Inside follows Burnham\u2019s year-long journey \u2013 within the confines of a single room \u2013 as he creates, and ultimately fights to finish, his latest project.",
    "Deprived of a crew due to lockdown restrictions, Burnham wrote, performed, directed, shot and edited the 90-minute comedy-drama \u2013 and it\u2019s clear from the outset that every part of it exudes his multifaceted talents.",
    "Burnham\u2019s clever use of camera angles, scope of shot, edits, transitions and various lighting effects often makes Inside feel like a fever dream. Throw in continuous shifts between Burnham performing songs and stand-up material, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re simultaneously watching a documentary and stage act.",
    "And, really, you are. In trademark style, Burnham meshes hilarious songs (\u2018White Woman\u2019s Instagram\u2019, \u2018Sexting\u2019 and \u2018FaceTiming with my Mom\u2019, in particular, are cleverly produced), with a docu-style presentation of his life in lockdown that provides a fly-on-the-wall glimpse into his world.",
    "In that sense, Inside harkens back to Burnham\u2019s humble beginnings as a YouTuber, albeit now one with the figurative weight of the world on his shoulders.",
    "That world-weariness ironically shines through Inside\u2019s multiple musical numbers. Fans will instantly recognize the signature synthpop and R\u2019n\u2019B inspired melodies that Burnham builds his songs around, but it\u2019s his lyrical deconstruction of serious topics \u2013 including self-worth, elitism, living in the digital age, relationships, capitalism, mental health and suicide \u2013 that makes Burnham stand apart from his contemporaries.",
    "As weighty as Inside\u2019s subjects are, though, Burnham delivers each track in typically riotous and sometimes farcical fashion.",
    "From the subversive Sesame Street-esque \u2018That is how the World Works\u2019 (complete with a sock puppet that has plenty to say about geopolitics) to \u2018Welcome to the Internet\u2019, a musically explosive exploration of how our lives are dictated by the internet, each song is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that\u2019ll have you laughing one minute and experiencing an existential crisis the next.",
    "It\u2019s this frequent subversion of expectations that makes Inside much more than an audiovisual spectacle. Beneath the bright lights and upbeat tempo of Burnham\u2019s songs, Inside is a pretty dark and bleak dive into the psyche of one of the past decade\u2019s most popular artists.",
    "Make no mistake, this isn\u2019t an ordinary comedy special, and Burnham warns us as much at the start. Even so, Inside isn\u2019t merely a continuation of Make Happy\u2019s unexpected ending (where Burnham dissects the performer-audience relationship in such honest detail) \u2013 it\u2019s an extension of it.",
    "Whether by design (or as a stressful byproduct of his latest creation), Burnham becomes increasingly dishevelled \u2013 physically and mentally \u2013 as Inside progresses. Throughout, there\u2019s a growing perception that a battle rages on inside as he struggles with his solitary confinement, and you feel increasingly anguished as Burnham gradually loses his grip on reality.",
    "It makes for unnerving and ominous viewing, particularly during Inside\u2019s final act, but, perhaps surprisingly, it\u2019s a necessity to see Burnham in this state.",
    "It\u2019s the comedian at his most vulnerable, and it\u2019s as if Inside is a physically thematic representation of Burnham\u2019s own headspace. The single room he resides in symbolizes his mind, while the scattered instruments, clothes and recording equipment signify the cluttered, messy and overwhelming thoughts he has to deal with on a daily basis.",
    "As much as Inside is an introspective examination on Burnham\u2019s part, it\u2019s also highly relatable. Collectively, we\u2019ve wrestled with our own problems throughout the pandemic and its various national lockdowns so, while Burnham is the individual leading us through this at-times deeply personal piece of theater, it\u2019s hard not to see yourself in Burnham\u2019s place. It\u2019s a cleverly subliminal bait and switch, and one you may not even notice is happening for much of Inside\u2019s runtime.",
    "Inside is a dazzling and electric one-man show that\u2019s both culturally relevant and thematically resonant. It\u2019s hilarious, poignant and strangely uplifting in equal measure, and the sheer number of subtextual layers within means that repeat viewings (if you\u2019re able to handle it) are necessary to dig into its minutiae.",
    "Burnham\u2019s amalgamation of different artforms isn\u2019t novel, but the manner in which he structures Inside feels like a game changer. It feels unique in its approach, content and subjectivity, and it\u2019ll leave you pondering many questions about your own life once the end credits roll.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m being a little pretentious; it\u2019s an instinct that I have where I need everything I write to have some deeper meaning,\u201d Burnham muses at one point.",
    "Maybe so, but there\u2019s no denying that Inside is a powerfully poetic piece of art that you\u2019ll be thinking about for days and weeks on end.",
    "Bo Burnham: Inside is available to stream now on Netflix."
