    "Supernatural\u2019s Jared Padalecki plays Cordell Walker, taking on the iconic role made famous by TV tough guy Chuck Norris in the 1990s. It remains true to the spirit of the original show, but this reboot tackles contemporary issues while telling the story of a man attempting to move on after his wife\u2019s tragic death.",
    "The dust has barely settled when season 2 kicks off. Walker\u2019s partner Micki Ramirez (Lindsey Morgan) has accepted a dangerous assignment, going undercover with the Del Rio crime syndicate to find out who killed Texas DPA Stan Morrison. Meanwhile, a figure from Walker\u2019s past brings back memories of a tragedy involving the Davidson family, of events that occurred on his ranch almost thirty years ago.",
    "Returning cast members include The X-Files\u2019 Mitch Pileggi, Cody Bell, Jeff Pierre, and Keegan Allen as Walker\u2019s brother, while Odette Annable has been promoted to series regular as Geri Broussard \u2013 an old friend of Walker's and a potential love interest this season.",

    "If you\u2019re abroad when Walker season 2 airs, you\u2019ll likely be unable to watch the show due to annoying regional restrictions. Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution to the common digital annoyance of geo-blocking.",
    "Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream the returning series online no matter where you are. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Walker season 2 from anywhere",
    "Unfortunately, Walker won\u2019t be riding into the UK anytime soon. Channel 4 usually airs content from The CW, but so far neither season 1 or 2 have been picked up for broadcast or streaming in the UK.",
    "The only option is to use a fantastic VPN as described above, then set your location back to your country of residence where the show is broadcasting, and go from there."
