  "summary": "Despite inflated prices, AMD\u2019s CPUs are selling like hotcakes on Amazon",
  "article": [
    "It looks like AMD is on a major hot streak with its new Ryzen 5000 series processors, with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X topping the Amazon CPU sales charts \u2013 and that could spell big trouble for Intel.",
    "While this is just one retailer, it is Amazon, and due to its sheer size, it gives us a good idea of just how well AMD\u2019s processors are selling.",
    "The news gets worse for Intel, in fact, as the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is number one, despite selling for $800 (around \u00a3575 / AU$1,030), well above the $549 (about \u00a3420, AU$760) recommended retail price. That shows just how in demand AMD\u2019s 12-core processor is.",
    "There\u2019s even more bad news for Intel, as at the time of writing. The Amazon CPU best sellers list is dominated by AMD chips \u2013 the entire top six are all processors from Team Red, and only three of the top 10 are Intel processors.",
    "According to the list, Intel\u2019s most popular CPU on Amazon right now is the Intel Core i7-10700K, a 10th gen 8-core processor, which sells for $319.95 (around \u00a3230 / AU$410).",
    "Meanwhile, the second-best selling CPU on Amazon is the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, an 8-core chip that costs $308.91 (around \u00a3220, AU$400).",
    "Amazon\u2019s best sellers lists are constantly changing, so we may see AMD\u2019s domination slip, but the fact that its processors are doing so well in one of the biggest retailers in the world is an incredible achievement, and a big turnaround from Intel\u2019s historic dominance.",
    "It also follows similar reports from other (admittedly smaller) retailers, which show AMD\u2019s CPUs being much more popular \u2013 and this points to an overall trend which could be quite concerning for Intel.",
    "So, what can Team Blue do? It\u2019s clear that AMD is winning mindshare at the moment \u2013 the fact that people are willing to spend well over the RRP for the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X shows just how hot AMD\u2019s products are right now.",
    "The best way to do that is to release processors that attack AMD on all fronts \u2013 both performance-wise and price-wise.",
    "The problem here is that Intel has just released 11th generation Rocket Lake processors, like the Intel Core i9-11900K, but they have so far failed to set the world alight, feeling like a stop-gap release before the much more exciting 12th-generation Alder Lake-S processors, which are rumored to launch around September 2021.",
    "The pressure will be on these processors to really wow people (and early rumors do suggest something special), and convince them to switch back to Intel.",
