    "Cheap Chromebook deals can save you even more cash on already-affordable machines. Often that means you'll be able to pick up a budget device for under $200 / \u00a3200, though sales can offer bigger discounts on more mid-range models. At these prices, though, it's easy to get tripped up with a super-cheap machine that, in reality, doesn't offer great value for money.",
    "That's where we come in. We're rounding up all the best cheap Chromebook deals right here and also showing you which ones are worth their salt. We're running through all their key specs, how you should expect to use these machines, and who should take advantage of the great Chromebook prices on offer.",
    "We're also bringing you the lowest prices from all around the web, which means you can easily pick up the best Chromebook deal around without having to crawl through every retailer site.",
    "So, whether you're looking for an everyday machine for browsing the web (in which case aim to spend between $200 and $350), or something with more power for a streamlined, browser based approach to work (which might set you back $400 and up), we're showing you just which models fit the bill perfectly. We're also tracking all the best cheap laptop deals right here on TechRadar if you do want to run Windows.",
    "This is where you should begin your search for a Chromebook. At 14 inches in screen size and inside an robust frame, the HP Chromebook 14 offers a fine middle ground for the indecisive shopper. With standardized parts inside, this Chromebook can do essentially all its closest rivals can and then some, with its microSD card reader and slew of ports \u2013 unlike similarly-priced, tinier Chromebooks.",
    "Plus, you'll find a fantastic tactile keyboard and vivid display on here as well - which is surprising as these are usually the first corners to be cut when manufacturers are trying to bring the price down this low. We see Chromebook deals regularly including this model as well, so you'll find an excellent price if you're shopping at the right time.",

    "With the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet, you'll be getting a Chromebook that strikes a perfect balance between the portability of a tablet and the functionality of a laptop, all for a terrific bargain price.",
    "What impresses most of all is the substantial battery life \u2013 the Lenovo Duet was able to last upwards of 22 hours in our testing. That'll get you through a full day of bouncing between lectures, speeding through some work and the odd bit of fun on the side \u2013 and then still have some juice leftover.",
    "There are questions about the finicky nature of the keyboard and the trackpad, but these can be easily remedied with a separate keyboard and mouse of your own. Looking past that, it's a great bit of kit if you're a student on a budget, especially when you compare it to similar models that sport a FHD touchscreen and up to 128GB of storage for all your files.",

    "It\u2019s almost as if Dell hand-crafted this Chromebook to get work done in the classroom. It\u2019s got an indicator light on the lid that teachers can use as if the student raised his or her hand to answer (or ask) a question. And, it\u2019s rubberized in many places to better survive drops and dents. It\u2019s an awfully mobile laptop, too, making it sensible for work at almost any class level, or if you just want a lightweight web browser and email machine. In the education sector, a Chromebook price can be one of the most important factors so you'll be safe in the knowledge that this Dell 11 is efficient as well.",
    "Chromebook deals on this model usually pitch it at the same price as the HP 14 and Acer 15, however if you're looking for a kids laptop for school you'll want to take a look at this sturdy contender.",
    "Read our full review: Dell Chromebook 11",
    "While it sits at the same price point as the smaller 14-inch HP and 11-inch Dell above, this Acer Chromebook offers up a full-sized 15.6-inch display. That's a big deal if you're looking to get more done that as you'll easily be able to view multiple windows at the same time. You're also getting the option of slightly beefier components here, though not at entry level.",
    "So, if you're going to get a lot of work done on your new Chromebook, this might be the model to go for. There's plenty of room to breathe in the design and a little more power under the hood as well.",
    "It doesn\u2019t do much that\u2019s exclusive to its larger size so much that it simply does those things more. For many, that\u2019s a selling point worth trying to find the best deal over, and this just so happens to be the best one.",

    "Acer tends to run the show in our Chromebook roundups, and for good reason: it makes great Chromebooks. If you want the look and near-feel of a MacBook Air, but with the Chromebook price tag this is the model for you. The 14 looks and feels like Apple\u2019s famous notebook on the outside, but of course can\u2019t truly feel like using one with how little it costs.",

    "Looking to spend a little more to pick up a suite of extra features? The Asus Chromebook Flip offers up an excellent 2-in-1 laptop design that can easily switch into more of a tablet experience for an MSRP of between $400 and $600. That puts it firmly in the mid-range category of Chromebook deals, sitting above the everyday offers in both price and features but well below the Google Pixelbook Go prices below.",
    "The Google Pixelbook Go is one of the most well known premium Chromebooks out there. It does have the price tag to match, but it's nowhere near the $1,000/\u00a31,000 tag on its predecessor. The 8th generation of processors to choose from and the substantial SSD sizes on offer mean you'll be zipping through tasks on an ultra portable laptop with a great full HD screen.",
    "Plus, the Go can manage all that and still stay alive for 12 hours at a time, which is pretty good going when you consider the power stored inside this sleek shell. It might not be the cheap and cheerful machine you were expecting to pick up, but it's certainly worth a look if you're going to be using your Chromebook for anything strenuous.",
    "You'll find all the latest Chromebook deals on the models listed above right here. Our price comparison chart below brings together all the cheapest prices from around the web so you always know you're getting the best discounts.",
    "The cheapest Chromebooks can sometimes be guilty of skimping on their specs. To find the best Chromebook price, therefore, it's important to keep your needs in mind when it comes to processor quality and storage solutions. There are definitely deals that take both power and cost efficiency into account, so it's important to keep an eye out for anything with an SSD capable of storing and managing updates (if you're not running ChromeOS) and RAM above the 2GB baseline that often appears in searches.",
    "The cheapest Chromebook deals are already pretty good for the price, and tend to be aimed at those who don't want to blow all their cash on a single gadget purchase. You're not picking up bags of storage at the lowest end of the price spectrum, but with Chrome OS removing the need for updates (these laptops don't run on Windows), you won't need as much space as you would on a conventional laptop. Plus, everything will run through your web browser on a Chromebook, which means you need even less storage.",
    "The models above all carry decent processors for the cash, so you'll be sorted for an acceptable speed considering how little you're spending on your laptop here. However, it's worth checking out display quality and keyboard textures, as this is where manufacturers tend to cut corners in order to squeeze into these cheap Chromebook prices.",
    "TechRadar is scouring every retailer and rounding up all the top deals over the Black Friday period, and we\u2019ve put all the best Black Friday deals and Cyber Monday deals in easy-to-navigate articles to help you find the bargains you\u2019re looking for.",
    "If you're looking for a more substantial machine for speedy multitasking or high performance software, why not check out our best cheap laptop deals of the week. There's also some excellent gaming laptop deals to be had as well!"
