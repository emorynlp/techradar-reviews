  "article": [
    "Hello\u2026 You. These two words send shivers down any fan of Netflix's stalker series \u2013 whenever Joe Goldberg (played by Penn Badgley) says it, you know there\u2019s trouble ahead. And boy, did he say it a lot in season 3. You tackles a whole host of themes from violence to murder, mental health, and even parenthood \u2013 albeit in anything but a traditional way.",
    "With the most recent season continuing to tick up the body count, You showed us anything but a life of happily ever after for Joe and Love (Victoria Pedretti).",
    "Season 3 started with a bad omen when Joe said, \u201cno more bad things ever again, I promise\u2026\u201d and viewers held their breath as they were thrown through a season full of jealousy, couples counselling, young Joe flashbacks, and a whole lot of mummy issues.",
    "Fortunately for us (though less so for his future victims), season 3 didn\u2019t mark the end of Joe\u2019s story, and now we await season 4. So, here\u2019s everything we know so far about what's coming up, based on season 3's ending and what the show's creators and cast have said about the series' future. Spoilers follow.",
    "In October 2021, Netflix revealed that You had been officially renewed for a fourth season:",
    "While there\u2019s no sign of an official release date yet, given how recently season 3 hit the streamer, we\u2019ll be sure to keep this page updated as and when we hear any news.",
    "If we were to make an educated guess, though, pandemic aside, we\u2019ve been treated to a new season of You on almost every year so far. Season 1 hit our screens in 2018, season 2 in 2019, season 3 in 2021, and with a fast renewal on season 4, we could be looking at late 2022. Early 2023 is also a possibility, but we can't imagine you'll be waiting longer than that.",
    "So far, while there isn\u2019t a full-length trailer out, we have been treated to a short teaser that was released to announce season 4\u2019s renewal by Netflix. The teaser hints at the return of some of Joe\u2019s past \u2018Yous\u2019 in eerie flashback fashion.",
    "If you\u2019re not up-to-date on You, then you\u2019re in for a shock when we talk about who we think will be back for season 4.",
    "We lost some pretty big characters in season 3. Most importantly though, we lost Love, which means no more Victoria Pedretti next year.",
    "Love didn\u2019t go down without racking up some more victims in season 3. Her jealousy saw her quickly take out the neighbour, Natalie Engler (Michaela McManus), murder anti-vaxxer Gil (Mackenzie Astin), and encounter some near-misses with neighbor-turned-lover Theo and Madre Linda\u2019s famous blogger, Sherry, not to mention her fitness-obsessed husband, Cary.",
    "The only confirmed character we have for You season 4 so far is Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley), but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t guess over some others.",
    "With Joe leaving Madre Linda behind, we also concluded the lives of those he left in suburbia. All but one one, that is: Marienne (Tati Gabrielle) and Joe\u2019s latest try at \u2018The One\u2019, who he vows to find.",
    "There were also mentions of Ellie Alves (Jenna Ortega) as Joe secretly sent her money he made from fixing rare books, something he does obsessively, alongside stalking. And showrunner Sera Gamble hinted at the return of old characters in future seasons to THR back in 2019. \u201cEllie is still in Joe\u2019s life. He\u2019s sending her money. She hates him, but he is sending her money. So that door remains open for us. And as you saw in season 2, I mean Beck was dead and she came back. One of my favorite things to do is bring back a dead person to haunt you. So the door is wide open for everybody\u2019s favorite characters.\u201d",
    "By 2021, however, showrunner Sera Gamble explained to EOnline that scheduling conflicts for Ortega have so far ruled out a return for Ellie in the show.",
    "Joe also left his and Love\u2019s son, Henry \u2018Forty\u2019 Quinn-Goldberg, with Marienne\u2019s best friend and librarian colleague Dante and his husband Lansing. Whether this storyline will be returned to, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but it sounds like Gamble is actively considering how this choice will change the character. \"I think it will shape him from this moment forward. And even his exact plan of when and if he would return for his son is something that we will...if we get to the writers room...come together and talk about for hours and hours and hours between snacks.\"",
    "The teaser trailer (seen above) also hints at the return of old 'Yous', with Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), Candace Stone (Ambyr Childers), and Love Quinn-Goldberg (Victoria Pedretti) all making appearances. We'll update this page when we have a full list of returning cast members for You season 4.",
    "Each season so far has been 10 episodes long, so we\u2019re expecting more of the same with You season 4.",
    "When it comes to the plot, we were left on a cliffhanger as Joe \u2013 now Nick \u2013 left a caf\u00e9 and walked along a street with the Eiffel Tower behind him. So, he\u2019s in Paris this time. But what does that mean for the stalker and murderer?",
    "We know that Marienne escaped Love and went on the run with her daughter, Juliette, and that Joe mused in the final episode that he would search the world and find her. Gamble confirmed to EOnline that searching for Marienne would form the focus of Joe's trip to Paris. \"What's a completely different kind of environment to put him in? And then also, what haven't we done that could potentially get him into lots of trouble?\"",
    "We also know that Glamma Dottie is a dynamic, hard-hitting character that may not take too kindly to the demise of her daughter, Love, following twin brother Forty\u2019s death in season 2. That said, Gamble has indicated she's in crisis right now, and not necessarily being \"calculating and strategic\" \u2013 though she's still around as a narrative possibility to encounter Joe in future, of course.",
    "Joe Goldberg himself, aka Penn Badgley, spoke to Collider about what could be next for Joe, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like, does a person like Joe deserve to die? Yes. But does anyone deserve to kill him? I really think this is the question.\u201d",
    "Concrete plot details for You season 4 will have to wait, then, but the last shot of season 3 at least gives us the vague shape of the next run of episodes.",
    "You is based on the thriller book series by Caroline Kepnes, and while there\u2019s a whole list of differences between the TV adaptation and the books, she did reveal in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that there\u2019s more to come with an untitled, fourth book in the works. \u201cSo now that I\u2019m writing the next one and, by nature, the end of it makes me want to keep going. So I\u2019m going with that feeling, as long as it feels alive to me, as long as publishers want to publish it and readers want more. For me, he\u2019s got a lot of living to do, unfortunately, and fortunately.\u201d",
    "With that in mind, season 4 might not be the end for Joe. No end date has been set for the series yet \u2013 but it sounds like the author isn't short on ideas for where the character goes next, which might help shape future seasons."
