    "Serbia and Germany battle it out for a place in the semi-finals of the ATP Cup, where a very strong Russia team lies in wait.

Follow our guide for how to watch a Djokovic vs Zverev live stream and catch all the 2021 ATP Cup tennis online from anywhere.",
    "Djokovic and Zverev aren't exactly tennis' best-loved personalities, but there's no doubting their credentials on the court.",
    "17-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic needs no introduction, but facing him is a young man who has long been tipped for the top, even if deeply concerning off-court allegations have cast a shadow over him.",
    "Zverev is expected to kick on this year, having reached his first Grand Slam semi-final and his first Grand Slam final in 2020, and a strong showing from the 23-year-old today would be a huge statement of intent.",
    "Though Djokovic is undoubtedly the favourite, world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov managed to give him a run for his money on Monday, though the Serb ultimately proved too strong and ran out the 7-5, 7-5 winner.",
    "Zverev's singles victory came against the same opponent, a nail-bitingly close 6-7, 6-3, 7-6 comeback win that would have tasted all the sweeter, with Shapovalov having beaten the German at last year's tournament.",
