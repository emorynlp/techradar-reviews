    "The Sony WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds could be revealed as early as next week, if the wording of Sony\u2019s upcoming YouTube livestream \u2013 titled \u201cSony Announcement for Music Lovers June 2021\u201d \u2013 is to be taken literally.",
    "Spotted by GSM Arena, the livestream is taking place on June 8 at 12pm ET, 9am PT and 5pm BST. The slogan on the livestream\u2019s placeholder thumbnail reads: \u201cTruly silent. Tailored 4 you,\u201d potentially hinting at a reveal for the WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds.",
    "It\u2019s of course important to note that the Sony WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds haven\u2019t been officially confirmed, and the reveal and release date are at this point speculative. However, recent leaks may have revealed the specs and design of the WF-1000XM4. As such, a full reveal may be imminent and potentially in Sony\u2019s upcoming livestream.",
    "Much like the superb Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds, the rumored WF-1000XM4 buds are suspected to feature active noise cancelling if the leaks are accurate. However, the WF-1000MX4 could go one step further, potentially being powered by the new Sony V1 processor which should better help to counteract external noise.",
    "The WF-1000XM4 leaks also make mention of the price point, suspected to be around $340 / \u00a3240 / AU$440. That\u2019s a tad more expensive than the WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds at launch, but that\u2019s to be expected given the extra power the WF-1000XM4 supposedly packs.",
    "Whether we\u2019ll see the Sony WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds on June 8, or a bit later, we\u2019re still expecting another best-in-class showcase from the tech giant. Of course, we\u2019ll keep you updated if and when the Sony WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds are announced."
