  "article": [
    "The Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl remakes are due to release in November 2021 under the new titles of Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Shining Pearl. The upcoming games are the fourth set in Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s long-running remake line, following Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen (2004), Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver (2010) and, most recently, Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (2014).",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will be recreations of the original fourth generation releases, Diamond and Pearl, taking players back to a revamped Sinnoh region. The usual format of catching and training Pok\u00e9mon to work your way through the region\u2019s gyms applies as it always has up to that point and beyond.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were first announced during the February 2021 Pok\u00e9mon Presents showcase video, part of the wider Pok\u00e9mon 25th anniversary celebrations, alongside Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus, a prequel set in the Hisui (which will eventually become Sinnoh) region that will release worldwide on January 28, 2022.",
    "Excited about Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and want to know more? Read on to find out everything we know about the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon remakes.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will release on November 19, 2021 for Nintendo Switch.",
    "Before that, on November 5, 2021, Pok\u00e9mon fans will be able to purchase a special edition Nintendo Switch Lite that bears the designs of Dialga and Palkia, which are Diamond and Pearl's flagship legendary Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Pre-orders for the console are currently available in the UK where it\u2019s priced at \u00a3199.99 for the console on its own while a package that includes either Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl is priced at \u00a3249.99.",
    "Team Galactic October trailer",
    "In a trailer released in October 2021, we get a better look at the villains of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Team Galactic, as well as the Gym Leaders Candice and Volkner. The trailer also confirms bonuses for players who pick up the game early: a \u201cPlatinum Style Outfit\u201d and an egg for the Pok\u00e9mon Manaphy. These have to be redeemed by February 21. Take a look for yourself below:",
    "September 28, 2021 trailer This trailer showcases some new features for Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, including the brand new Pok\u00e9tch, an in-game digital watch that looks to be a one-stop access point for all the most useful shortcuts, including using HM moves and checking on your party. It's even got a step counter like Pok\u00e9mon Heart Gold / Soul Silver's physical Pok\u00e9walker.",
    "Poffins are also returning. These cute snacks could be made and used to enhance your Pok\u00e9mon's stats. Here, it looks a lot like the curry cooking minigame from Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, and cooking with your Pok\u00e9mon can apparently result in the creation of high-level Poffins.",
    "Official trailer Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were first shown off during the February 2021 Pok\u00e9mon Presents showcase, announced alongside a trailer demonstrating the game\u2019s art style and gameplay primarily.",
    "The game\u2019s aesthetic in the overworld very much mimics that of the original Nintendo DS release, with deformed \u201cchibi\u201d style characters navigating basic 3D environments. Things change in battle, though, as characters take on more realistic proportions alongside the full-sized Pok\u00e9mon models.",
    "As such, the Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl remakes look to be quite faithful to the originals, albeit with a high-definition 3D overhaul to the graphics while throwing in some fairly impressive lighting effects. Some cinematic battle animations were also shown off in the trailer, and look to be at least somewhat of an improvement over Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\u2019s efforts, where the animations were criticized for being reused and underwhelming for the first HD mainline Pok\u00e9mon title.",
    "If you played the original Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl games on Nintendo DS, then you should know what to expect in terms of gameplay. The core Pok\u00e9mon series gameplay appears to be largely unchanged, maintaining exploration of the overworld, turn-based combat and a focus on catching as many Pok\u00e9mon as you can to fill out your Pok\u00e9dex as an extra completionist objective.",
    "Based on recent previews of the game, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl look like they're going to be fairly faithful, if slightly safe, remakes that bring forth a lot of nostalgia. The updated art style makes for a cuter, more cosy game but it seems like the core experience will be familiar for those that loved the originals.",
    "It seems the aim of the Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl remakes is a fairly faithful recreation but with some much-needed quality of life improvements. Indeed, improvements from newer releases like auto-save, character customization, improvements to HMs and being able to access your Pok\u00e9mon Box from anywhere have all been noted. More contentiously, EXP Share will also be present in the remakes but it appears players won't be able to turn it off (as in Sword and Shield) which isn't likely to please everyone.",
    "Of course, not everything is identical. There have been some changes to the Underground tunnels, which proved popular in the original releases for eschewing Pok\u00e9mon battling and catching entirely for a more casual resource gathering affair. It also let players create Secret Bases, a customizable home away from home, of sorts. Known as the Grand Underground, this area has been updated with a new addition called \"Hideaways\" which add a whole new dimension with support for online play and new opportunities to catch Pok\u00e9mon in different biomes.",
    "Contests have also been slightly revamped to make them more interesting, with more cutomization and a new rhythm game element.",
    "Grand Underground, Secret Bases confirmed The Grand Underground and Secret Base features are returning in the Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl remakes. The former is a sprawling underground dungeon, featuring rooms filled with Pok\u00e9mon to catch.",
    "The latter acts as your home away from home, and can be customized with furniture, statues and more.",
    "Tying into this is a brand new feature to the remakes known as Pok\u00e9mon Hideaways. These special rooms contain Pok\u00e9mon based on the statues you've placed in your Secret Base. In addition, unique Pok\u00e9mon may spawn here that you won't be able to catch anywhere else.",
    "Character customization Something missing from the previous remakes, Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, was the ability to alter your trainer's appearance that debuted to a warm reception in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y.",
    "Thankfully, the feature is returning in Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, where players will be able to dress up their trainers to their liking.",
    "Pok\u00e9ball customization Another feature that's being expanded upon is the ability to customize your Pok\u00e9balls with stickers, emblems and more. This time, your unique Pok\u00e9balls will also be able to make an entrance with various flashy effects based on the designs you affix to them.",
    "Mega Evolutions could return The biggest rumor doing the rounds currently for Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is the potential inclusion of Mega Evolutions. These were first introduced in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y on the Nintendo 3DS, and allows certain Pok\u00e9mon to temporarily transform into super-powered versions of themselves.",
    "Mega Evolutions have often been criticized for trivializing the already low difficulty of recent Pok\u00e9mon games, as the stats of Mega-evolved forms can typically weather the toughest of attacks, even when the move used against them is super effective. If Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl do feature Mega Evolutions, we hope the feature is handled with care and a greater focus on balancing them properly.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Platinum content included? Speculation from fans also seems to indicate that content from Pok\u00e9mon Platinum - the more feature-complete follow-up to Diamond and Pearl - will be present in the remakes. This is largely evidenced by a character that appears in the Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl trailer that was added in the Platinum follow-up, as pointed out on Twitter.",
    "If Pok\u00e9mon Platinum content is indeed present, then, that would mean a number of extra features will make it into Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, including the minigame-centric Wi-Fi Plaza (which we imagine will be renamed in the remake) and the aforementioned Battle Frontier."
