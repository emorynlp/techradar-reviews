    "It\u2019s been a long time coming, but Netflix has finally begun rolling out support for Apple\u2019s Spatial Audio technology on the streamer\u2019s iOS app.",
    "That means users watching on iPhone or iPad with either the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max can now benefit from immersive 3D surround sound, which works by recalibrating audio based on your head position.",
    "Before being officially confirmed by Netflix, the feature was first spotted by Reddit users, and is now slowly appearing on Netflix apps worldwide \u2013 though you\u2019ll need an iPhone 7 or later (or a recent iPad) with iOS 14 for Spatial Audio to become available on your device.",
    "When it does become available, you\u2019ll be able to toggle Spatial Audio via your device\u2019s Control Center. It\u2019s also worth ensuring your Netflix app is updated to the latest available version.",
    "The move comes after Netflix confirmed in February that it was neither testing Spatial Audio support nor had any plans to do so in the near future. At the time, the streamer was only testing \u201cmulti-channel support for built-in speakers.\u201d",
    "Those official assertions didn\u2019t quite line up with rumors we\u2019d heard, though, one of which suggested Netflix had been testing the feature since December 2020.",
    "Still, we\u2019re happy to see that Spatial Audio has finally arrived on Netflix for iOS, bringing the streamer in line with rival platforms already offering the feature \u2013 including Disney Plus, HBO Max, and (unsurprisingly) Apple TV Plus.",
    "Netflix already supports Dolby Atmos which, of course, extends to far more devices than the Apple-specific Spatial Audio, but it makes sense for the streamer to finally offer the tech to AirPods Pro and Max users who want to make the most of their headphones or true wireless earbuds.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean both audio options are identical, though. Like Dolby Atmos, Apple\u2019s Spatial Audio tech applies directional audio filters to 5.1 and 7.1 content, placing sound in a 3D sphere to generate the illusion of surround sound. However, Spatial Audio takes this one step further by using the built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes inside Apple\u2019s earbuds and headphones to track the position of the user\u2019s head in relation to their iPhone or iPad.",
    "Essentially, then, when you watch films on an iOS device, the sound will always be placed correctly based on the action on-screen \u2013 turning your head or shifting the position of your device won\u2019t interrupt the immersive feel of the audio.",
    "Of course, Spatial Audio isn\u2019t going to rival the sound you get from a real cinema, but it\u2019s great that Netflix has finally given some Apple users the option to enhance their home viewing experience."
