    "The extension of the platform to mobile is part of the company's wider plan to deliver a complete system to help business owners succeed online.",
    "The new Wix mobile app gives restaurant owners an additional sales channel and the ability to engage seamlessly with customers.",
    "Explaining the rationale behind the launch, Ronny Elkayam, Wix SVP of Mobile, App Market & Strategic Products, told TechRadar Pro the company had identified demand for better communication channels between restaurants and customers, particularly through mobile.",
    "\u201cBy expanding the Wix Restaurant offering to mobile, we\u2019re empowering restaurant owners to get in touch with their customers directly with no middle man, completely commission free,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cDine by Wix gives restaurants a competitive edge, providing a direct sales channel to customers, ultimately leading to increased loyalty and repeat sales. We look forward to continuing to add value to restaurant businesses built on Wix.\u201d",
