  "article": [
    "Update: So, it looks like the rumours were true \u2013 Sky is officially launching its own TV with no dish, QLED technology and Dolby Atmos built in \u2013 read everything you need to know about Sky Glass.",
    "Original story continues below.",
    "Broadcaster Sky already makes the best set top box and TV interface on the market, and sources now point to the company being on the verge of unveiling its own Sky smart TV too.",
    "Having dominated the paid-for satellite TV market in the UK and Europe for three decades, if the rumors are true it\u2019ll be the first time the company has put together not just the set top boxes and content that lives on your television, but the display hardware to show it off in your living room too.",
    "Sky has always offered a premium, luxurious service when it comes to its subscription packages, and while they don\u2019t come cheaply, they\u2019re worth every penny for those that want access to the latest blockbuster Hollywood releases, live sports coverage from across the globe, prestige TV box sets and an ever-growing list of catch up and app-based TV content from the likes of Netflix, Amazon and Disney.",
    "So what would make a Sky smart TV special? It\u2019s almost a given that the company will include its subscription TV packages as part of any sale, making for a TV set that is sold more like a contract mobile phone than a traditional television. But there\u2019s lots to speculate over \u2013 and lots to look forward to \u2013 if Sky decides to work on these six things we want to see on a Sky Q smart TV.",
    "If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. The Sky Q interface is the best set top box software out there. Through a combination of great search tools (including smart voice recognition capabilities) and algorithmic recommendations, you\u2019re easily able to find exactly what you want to watch at any time of day. Sky\u2019s glass-like interface panes can be better at knowing what you\u2019re into than you are, always capable of determining your tastes \u2013 and even what you\u2019re more likely going to want to watch at different hours of the day. With detailed editorial descriptions of content, an easy-to-explore guide, side-by-side apps, sensibly laid out menu options and an intuitive recording library, Sky would be foolish to equip its TV with anything other than the Sky Q interface.",
    "One thing that Sky Q interface is missing though is user profiles. If you\u2019re in a household of several family members, those aforementioned recommendations can get a bit muddled as multiple people feed data into Sky\u2019s algorithm. A Sky Q smart TV would benefit from the option of individual user profiles, letting high-level users separate out recordings, favourite channels and recommendations between family members, while the casual user can just stick with a single global profile.",
    "One of Sky Q\u2019s top selling points is its huge catalogue of 4K Ultra HD content. While Sky may want to keep costs low by putting together a mid-range smart TV set, I think it\u2019d be doing its library of excellent films and TV shows a disservice to not put them out on a television with some top-drawer home cinema tech. Sky already offers up content in HDR with Dolby Atmos sound \u2013 I\u2019d like to see the set step up to the plate with Dolby Vision support in tow too, a looking glass into the very best that cinema has to offer. If it pushes the price up, I think it\u2019s still a smart idea \u2013 after all, you have to have a fair bit of disposable income to afford a Sky TV package in the first place. At the very least, I\u2019d like to see a range of TVs offered up by Sky, with one model offering a top-tier checklist of cutting-edge TV technologies built in.",
    "If we\u2019re talking about high-end TV features, here\u2019s hoping the Sky Q smart TV offers HDMI 2.1 ports. These are increasingly vital to gamers with the latest PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles, as they\u2019re required to hit 120Hz refresh rates on a display with variable refresh rate tech activated, keeping gameplay buttery smooth. Oh, and don\u2019t scrimp on the amount of HDMI ports either \u2013 four feels like the bare minimum these days.",
    "Though a Sky smart TV might be the first time the company has dabbled in television set tech, it\u2019s previously partnered on Sky TV audio accessories to great effect with premium audio manufacturer Devialet. The Sky Soundbox was an impressive accompaniment to the company's set top boxes, and we\u2019d love to see Sky partner with Devialet again here on the audio front for the smart TV. And if Sky\u2019s already supporting Dolby Atmos in its TV library, let's get those speakers doing some virtualized overhead surround sound, too.",
    "Sky Q still has one achilles heel \u2013 its live TV is reliant on a consistent satellite signal that can be negatively affected by adverse weather and poor dish placement. However, for years the company has been working on offering the complete Sky Q service entirely over the internet, making for a more flexible (and in some cases, reliable) package. It\u2019d be great if the Sky smart TV could offer a mixture of both satellite and over-the-internet delivery systems for its live broadcasts, with perhaps the broadband connection acting as built-in redundancy for any satellite issues that from time to time occur."
