    "A recent survey circulated around the Battlefield community could offer some hints at what EA and DICE have planned for Battlefield 6 (now confirmed to be Battlefield 2042) in terms of new and returning features.",
    "The survey, shared by YouTuber Lossy (via VGC), asks Battlefield fans a series of questions, gauging their interest - from \u201cnot at all interested\u201d to \u201cextremely interested\u201d - in seeing a variety of features in the next Battlefield game.",
    "Some of the features mentioned in the questions include a free-to-play game mode; map updates, such as the \u201cexisting map changing part of its components\u201d; a Battle Pass with a \u201cprogression system to unlock cosmetic content in a free and a premium line\u201d; and a Guild/Clan system allowing players to \u201cinvite or join a group of up to 100 people to help connect and play with them through features like Clan chat, Clan challenges, Clan stats etc.)\u201d.",
    "A free-to-play mode is probably one of the more interesting features mentioned in the survey, especially as leaker TheLongSensation (AKA Tom Henderson) has previously claimed that DICE has had a Battlefield Battle Royale in the works at some stage, suggesting the studio wants to create their own version of Activision\u2019s successful free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone.",
    "Unfortunately, a survey isn\u2019t really any kind of definitive confirmation of what we\u2019ll see in Battlefield 6 when it launches and while it\u2019s possible the responses to these questions could help EA and DICE shape plans for the future, Battlefield 6 is still something of a mystery.",
    "We\u2019re hoping, however, that we don\u2019t have too much longer to wait to get some official information on Battlefield 6, as a recent report has pointed to a May reveal.",
    "GamesBeat\u2019s Jeff Grubb told a fan who asked when the game would be revealed that \u201cThings are still fluid, they haven\u2019t announced anything publicly yet, but my understanding is that they\u2019re [EA] probably looking at May\u201d, adding that this was no guarantee. May does, however, line up with EA\u2019s previous confirmation that Battlefield 6 will be revealed \u201cin the Spring\u201d.",
    "Battlefield 6 doesn\u2019t have a firm release date just yet but it\u2019s expected to launch later this year on consoles and PC."
