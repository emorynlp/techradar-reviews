    "Stalker 2, the long-awaited sequel to the open world shooter which is set to launch in April 2022, has had its system requirements revealed \u2013 and they\u2019re relatively hefty in some respects.",
    "While some elements of the PC spec are not so demanding, there are a couple of minimum requirements which will raise some eyebrows, mainly on the GPU and storage front. Let\u2019s look at those requirements in full first:",
    "Minimum requirements",
    "Recommended requirements",
    "As mentioned, the minimum spec calling for at least a GTX 1060 (6GB) graphics card \u2013 or Radeon RX 580 \u2013 seems fairly steep (remember, this is the bare minimum GPU you can use, and so isn\u2019t going to provide that great a result). With the recommended spec, you\u2019ll need to have an RTX 2070 Super or RX 5700 XT, no less.",
    "Also, an SSD is a requirement, so those gamers still using a hard drive will be out of luck. Doubling up the pain here is the installation size being 150GB, a whopping chunk of space that smaller SSDs could struggle with (for those gamers who bought a small and more affordable model).",
    "That said, this isn\u2019t so surprising, as we\u2019ve seen some pretty huge install sizes in recent history \u2013 for example, Red Dead Redemption 2 also took up 150GB of drive space, then there\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which eats up over 200GB these days.",
    "Stalker 2 isn\u2019t the only contemporary game to be asking for an SSD, either, as it joins the likes of Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla and Marvel\u2019s Avengers, to pick a couple of examples that recommend an SSD.",
    "Stalker 2\u2019s spec insists on an SSD as a minimum requirement, though, making it compulsory. That\u2019s in much the same vein as World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, which specifies an SSD in the minimum requirements, though says a hard disk is usable, while noting \u201cdepending on the performance of the drive, player experience may be impacted on HDD [hard disk drive]\u201d. We suspect it\u2019s the same case with Stalker 2, just that the caveat has been dispensed with.",
    "The minimum requirement calls for 8GB of RAM, but like many games now, the recommended spec is 16GB.",
    "As mentioned, Stalker 2 is due to debut next year on April 28, and has been in the works for a long, long time. In fact, the sequel was expected to arrive in 2012 originally, and a few years back we heard about a fresh release timeframe of 2021 \u2013 although that has obviously slid slightly now. There\u2019s no guarantee that it might not slide a bit further, too, but better that than release a buggy game.",
