    "Amazon Prime Day 2021 is upon us and many people will be laser-focused on identifying the best possible deals. But it\u2019s not just consumers that will be out in force.",
    "As with any major event, Amazon Prime Day provides fertile ground for cybercriminals hoping to scam people out of their personal information and hard-earned cash. Analysis from multiple security companies suggests the threat level could be particularly high this year.",
    "According to Check Point Software, upwards of 2,300 new Amazon-related domains have been registered in the last 30 days, representing a 10% increase on the previous Amazon Prime Day. The majority (80%) of these websites are classified as potentially dangerous, while 46% were found to host malware or phishing mechanisms.",
    "There are a number of strategies scammers can use to attract punters to these dangerous addresses. For example, they could pose as a member of the Amazon customer service team, or send out an email promoting a time- or stock-limited flash deal. Criminals have also been known to insert themselves further down the e-commerce chain, masquerading as payment providers and delivery companies.",
    "Although consumers will likely be subjected to a barrage of phishing attacks on Amazon Prime Day, there is plenty that can be done to avoid falling victim to scammers. And the responsibility doesn\u2019t just fall on shoppers; retailers have a responsibility to protect customers too.",
    "Here\u2019s what the security experts have to say:",
    "Dan DeMichele, VP Product at LastPass by LogMeIn \u201cAs everyone begins tracking down the best deals, threat actors are making plans to exploit any slip-ups in our online behaviour. Security risks linger even after making the initial purchase, for example in phishing emails disguised as post-purchase correspondence, from receipts and tracking numbers to requests for feedback. To stay safe against cybercriminals, consumers should be on the look-out for suspicious behaviour \u2013 double checking URLs and making sure the padlock symbol on your browser is present are good places to start.\u201d",
    "Tom Kendrick, EMEA Security Evangelist at Check Point \u201cI strongly urge Prime Day shoppers this year to be extra cautious, to watch for misspellings, and to share only the bare minimum. I would triple check emails that appear to be from Amazon next week, including delivery notifications. If you\u2019re unsure of the status of a delivery, go directly to the Amazon website.\u201d",
    "Jake Moore, Cybersecurity Specialist at ESET \u201cScammers are attracted to special online events like moths to a flame. There is the potential that customers will see an sizable increase in calls, emails and texts attempting to entice people into parting with their cash.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt is important that people never part with their Amazon password and that their account is secured with two-factor authentication. If there is ever a warning there may be a problem with your account it is advised to go direct to the app installed on your phone rather than clicking on links in emails or text messages.\u201d",
    "Armorblox threat research team \u201cMany legitimate sales and offers during Prime Day leverage the \u2018hyperbolic discounting\u2019 effect by offering products on discounts that are almost too good to be true. Scammers exploit this same cognitive bias by sending email announcements that are actually too good to be true (i.e. they are scams).\u201d",
    "Todd Moore, VP Encryption Solutions at Thales \u201cWhile we all want the latest and greatest deals, shoppers need to be vigilant about the purchases they make online. Customers may be savvy when it comes to threats like phishing and fraudulent landing pages, but many don\u2019t know that their personal information is still at risk from the threat of cyberattacks long after a package arrives on their doorstep.\u201d",
    "\u201cConsumers do have a duty to ensure they are using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect their details, but the brunt of responsibility falls on retailers to implement end-to-end encryption of sensitive payment data.\"",
