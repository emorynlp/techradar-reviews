    "No matter where you\u2019re from or what culture you\u2019re a part of, music is something we all have in common. It tells our stories and brings us together in ways nothing else can.",
    "Headphones are increasingly becoming the most popular way for us to listen to music mainly because they\u2019re so convenient, but also because we can almost just tune the world out for a minute and sink into some of our favorite tunes.",
    "AKG has been exploring and engineering sound for over 70 years and are definitely one the biggest names in designing and producing professional-grade audio products.",
    "The AKG 300 series headphones are one of the latest endeavors from AKG and they are tuned to the AKG Reference Response Curve. In short - they sound absolutely amazing.",
    "In more technical terms, AKG\u2019s Reference Response Curve has to do with attempting to make the sound you hear sound as natural as possible, without any coloration or distortion, exactly the way the artist wanted you to hear it. Typically other frequency response curves are determined by the manufacturer of the headphones in order for you to hear a more stylized sound profile, for instance, exaggerated bass.",
    "AKG\u2019s goal is to produce headphones with as neutral a frequency curve as possible. This proved to be a bit of a challenge for headphones due to one very simple reason: you wear them on your head, and everyones\u2019 head and ears are shaped differently",
    "When listening to speakers or studio monitors, the sound is coming at your ears from the front so essentially the sound has to curve to make it inside your ear. When you listen to headphones, the sound is entering your ear directly, without having to maneuver it\u2019s way around your ear. This actually affects how the music sounds to you.",
    "The engineers as AKG spent over 5 years trying to take that same, neutral, natural frequency curve and apply it to headphones. The result is the AKG Reference Response Curve and the K371s are tuned to that curve.",
    "The K371s are just the latest in the K300 series with the K361s still offering an incredible listening experience for a great price. They share the same closed back design of the K371s which means they\u2019re much more durable and portable than open back headphones.",
    "The K300 series is also designed to be a more universal set of headphones that are great for studio recording, mixing, podcasting, listening, and - great for our new work from home environment - video conferencing. Due to their design and portability, they are easy to travel with and both the K371 and K361 headphones are available with Bluetooth if you want some extra connectivity.",
    "When you think of high-quality, studio-level headphones, you typically think of a high price to go along with them. One of the most impressive features of the K300s is their price. You can get the K361s directly from AKG for around $100 and the K371s are only about $50 more.",
    "At that price, it\u2019s really hard to go wrong with any of the K300 series headphones."
