  "article": [
    "The Umbrella Academy season 3's release isn't too far away now. Well, we're certainly hoping so, anyway. The next instalment in Netflix's adaptation of Gerard Way and Gabriel B\u00e1's comics is due to arrive in 2022 but, with principal photography completed in late August, we suspect that the show's crew are deep into post-production at this stage.",
    "The show has caught up with Way and B\u00e1's comics by this point, so there are two directions that The Umbrella Academy's third season could go in. It could deviate from Way and B\u00e1's plans for future entries in the graphic novels (like Game of Thrones did once it surpassed George R.R. Martin's source material). Alternatively, it could stick to the blueprint that The Umbrella Academy's creators have for a fourth volume and any future books that they're working on.",
    "But we digress. If you're curious about more details for The Umbrella Academy season 3, we've got you covered. Below, you'll find out when its expected release date is, what the comics can tease about the next entry's potential plot, new cast members, when the trailer could drop and more.",
    "We're entering spoiler territory for the first two seasons and the comics, too, so bear this in mind if you haven't caught up with seasons 1 and 2 yet.",
    "We don't have an official release date for season 3 yet. What we do know, however, is that it will arrive in 2022. According to a brief teaser trailer on the series' official Netflix page, which you can view here, The Umbrella Academy season 3 is set to land sometime next year.",
    "Production wrapped on season 3 (after 170 days, as revealed by showrunner Steve Blackman) in late August, so work is sure to have started on the series' lengthy post-production phase. Additionally, in a video posted on The Umbrella Academy's official Twitter account, the series' main actors also revealed that they had finished shooting the show's latest chapter:",
    "If we had to guess, we'd say that a proper teaser trailer shouldn't arrive before the end of 2021. It's a bit late at this point, so we suspect that a teaser trailer may arrive in early 2022. If one does, we expect The Umbrella Academy season 3 to land on Netflix before mid-2022.",
    "Unsurprisingly, no. Filming only wrapped a few months ago, so we wouldn't expect a major trailer for many months yet. We'll update this section when we hear more.",
    "With two world-ending apocalypses already averted, there\u2019s a good chance that preventing some kind of Armageddon will be on the agenda again. It would be a refreshing change of pace if it didn't but, considering that there's always an apocalyptic threat in the comics, expect another one in season 3.",
    "That's looking even more likely, too, when you consider the episode titles, which you can read about further down this page.",
    "What we do know is that The Umbrella Academy will butt heads with an similarly powerful group of individuals. The final scene of season 2 introduced us to The Sparrow Academy, an alternate reality ensemble with their own set of abilities.",
    "The Sparrow Academy were introduced in the final pages of The Umbrella Academy's most recent graphic novel volume \u2013 Hotel Oblivion \u2013 so they aren't an original superhero group that's been developed for the show. Even so, it's still great to see them make their live-action debut in the TV adaptation.",
    "Per season 3's brief teaser in our 'release date' section above, we know that we'll be checking into the Hotel Oblivion, too. For the uninitiated, this is a hotel-style space prison where the galaxy's worst supervillains have been incarcerated by The Umbrella Academy and other superheroes. Expect to some new bad guys, then, when season 3 rolls around. We go into more detail on who we'd like to see in a section further down this page, so scroll ahead if you can't wait to find out more.",
    "Some of the show's stars \u2013 Elliot Page, Tom Hopper and Emmy Raver-Lampman \u2013 have also teased the \"delightful surprises\" that are coming in season 3. Naturally, the trio didn't give anything significant away, but it seems like The Sparrow Academy will have something to do with those intriguing plot teases:",
    "We'll dive into how The Sparrow Academy could factor into season 3 in the comics section below but, for now, let's briefly recap the end of season 2.",
    "Having spent the first season in their native 2019 before time traveling to the 1960s in season 2, the Hargreeves now find themselves in a parallel dimension. And their lives aren\u2019t about to get any easier.",
    "In this reality, Sir Reginald Hargreeves \u2013 the surrogate dad whose death begrudgingly brought the siblings back together in season 1 \u2013 is alive. It doesn\u2019t take long for his famously cold style of parenting to re-emerge, as he reveals that the familiar-looking house \u201cisn\u2019t your home\u201d. It is, in fact, the headquarters of The Sparrow Academy.",
    "Normally, The Sparrow Academy's floating green cube member would grab Luther and company's attention (more on this in a bit). However, to the group's surprise, Ben Hargreeves \u2013 the family's deceased brother who gave his life (again) to save Diego, Allison, Klaus, and Vanya in season 2 \u2013 is revealed to be The Sparrows' vice-captain.",
    "It isn't the lovable Ben that fans are used to either; rather an impertinent narcissist who only looks out for himself. Justin H. Min, who portrays Ben, has revealed that he didn't expect to return after season 2. Given that Ben isn't part of the Sparrows in the comics, it was a surprising turn of events for Min and viewers:",
    "Finally, we could get a couple of new flashback scenes to when The Umbrella Academy's members were children. Ethan Hwang, who has portrayed a young Ben Hargreeves in the past two seasons, posted an Instagram photograph that showed him reuniting with Min:",
    "Sure, the duo could just be hanging out, but it's too much of a coincidence (in our opinion) that they've met up while filming on season 3 is ongoing. If young Ben is returning, it presents us with two possible explanations.",
    "The first is that we're getting flashbacks to Ben's childhood as an Umbrella Academy member, either on an individual basis or as part of the group. Could we find out how he died? It's something that would answer some longstanding questions we have about the fan favorite.",
    "If that isn't the case, we could see a young Ben as part of the Sparrow Academy. This would allow us to see how the Sparrows' version of Ben grew up and why he's the antithesis of the Ben we knew from seasons 1 and 2.",
    "The titles for each of season 3's episodes were revealed by showrunner Steve Blackman during Day 2 of Netflix Geeked Week in June:",
    "Fans of the comics (ourselves included) know what some of those titles are referencing. As for us, we took a deep dive into the comics to see what they could tease about season 3's titles, and you can read that article here.",
    "The series' seven main cast members will be back for season 3:",
    "Colm Feore (Sir Reginald Hargreeves) should be back as the surrogate father of both superhero groups. Adam Godley (Pogo the chimpanzee) and Jordan Claire Robbins (Grace Hargreeves/Mom) may also return as alternate-dimension forms of their Umbrella Academy counterparts but, again, we're yet to see an announcement on their returns.",
    "Ritu Arya will be back as Lila Pitts, too. The Humans and Last Christmas actress, who first appeared in season 2, confirmed that she's back via her Instagram story on season 3's filming end date. So we're sure to get more on-off relationship stuff with Diego and Lila.",
    "Spoilers for The Umbrella Academy comic book volume 3: Hotel Oblivion.",
    "This is where things get interesting. Hotel Oblivion's ending only gives us one real name and one moniker, with the latter being the group's leader aka Number One. In the comics, the only other Sparrow Academy name we learn about is Carla, who takes Vanya to meet the group before they rescue The Umbrella Academy from being defeated by numerous supervillains.",
    "Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Carla will feature in season 3 \u2013 unless her reveal is being held back \u2013 as Netflix has already confirmed The Sparrow Academy's cast and their names. Here is who you can expect to see as the new superhero group:",
    "According to Netflix (as reported by IGN), The Sparrow Academy members will differ from some from their Umbrella Academy counterparts.",
    "Marcus is said to be a born leader who is \"as smart as he is strong\", while Ben is a \"Machiavellian tactician\" who is focused on usurping Marcus as leader. Fei is a misanthrope who, despite her tough exterior, longs for friends, and Alphonso is a pizza-loving, beer-swilling humorous individual who bears physical and mental scars from years of fighting crime.",
    "Sloane is a \"romantic\" who \"feels a higher cosmic being\" calling to her, while Jayme is a lone-wolf who enjoys giving out \"fear-inducing snarls\" at anyone she deems below her. We'll also be getting Christopher/Number Seven, who is the group's existential dread-inducing psykronium cube, but there's no word yet on who will be voicing this team member.",
    "Blackman recently posted a video of one of the Sparrows in action, too. In footage that appears to show David's Jayme flying into, and then levitating in, the air using a harness and some well placed blue screen technology. Does it give us an indication of her powers? Here's hoping.",
    "Blackman has also teased a storyboard image of the Sparrow Academy members on Instagram. This sketch doesn't give anything away, as you'd expect, but it's cool nonetheless:",
    "Spoilers for The Umbrella Academy comic books and season 2 on Netflix.",
    "The Umbrella Academy has built up an intriguingly complex mythology, and that means there are plenty of questions that viewers need answering.",
    "Fans of the TV series still don't know why 43 children were unexpectedly born on October 1, 1989, to mothers who weren\u2019t pregnant when the day began. Or even what happened to most of those kids. Way and B\u00e1's comics reveal how this came to be in the opening pages of volume one \u2013 Apocalypse Suite \u2013 but, in case this revelation comes to light in the show, we won't divulge it just yet.",
    "In the comics, 13 of that number are known as The Umbrella and Sparrow Academy members. However, the show also introduced Lila as a potential 14th who we haven't seen in the graphic novels yet.",
    "That means that there are still 29 or 30 \u2013 depending on the medium of your choice \u2013 who are yet to be revealed. The problem now, of course, is that the TV series could move ahead of the comics (like Game of Thrones did) and unveil those individuals, or plot points that may come to the comics in the future. Either way, we might see more superheroes (or supervillains) emerge as part of season 3.",
    "Then there\u2019s questions over season 2's other big reveal. Since he removed his human mask, we now know that Sir Reginald Hargreeves is an alien. Again, the comics reveal his true identity in Apocalypse Suite's first few pages, and this one we can spoil due to the finale's revelation.",
    "In the comics, Sir Reginald is a world-renowned scientist, entrepreneur, inventor, and Olympic gold medalist. Oh, and a space alien. His true form hasn't been revealed in the graphic novels yet, but it's nailed on that the TV series will show that at this point.",
    "Harlan, Missy's kid who is shown to have telekinetic powers at the end of season 2, is also a major mystery. If \u2013 and it's a big if \u2013 he has an alternate version in The Sparrow Academy's universe, he could end up being a friend or foe to them and The Umbrella Academy.",
    "There's also the fact that we don't know who the villain is for season 3. With The Commission under new, friendlier leadership following The Handler's supposed death in season 2, it's unlikely that they'll be the bad guys again.",
    "How about, then, if season 3 starts introducing the comics' supervillains into its TV adaptation? It's possible that The Sparrow Academy are dealing with a threat far bigger than any that The Umbrella Academy has \u2013 you know, discounting two apocalypses \u2013 which means the Sparrows would need the latter's help.",
    "What could that threat be? Well, any number of the superpowered bad guys in the comics. Doctor Terminal, The Perseus Corporation or even a fellow superhero like The Scientific Man would be major adversaries for the teams. Something of that ilk that would require them to eventually set their differences aside and team up would make for a pleasing season 3 plot line."
