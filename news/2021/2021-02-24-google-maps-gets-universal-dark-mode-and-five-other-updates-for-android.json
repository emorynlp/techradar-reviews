    "Six Google apps are getting free updates that improve their features, security, and accessibility. Some of these are belated, like Google Maps getting universal Dark Mode across the whole app, while others integrate perks available in other services, like using Messages to schedule a text in advance.",
    "The six apps getting updates are: Google Maps, Messages, TalkBack, Password Checkup, Google Assistant, and Android Auto.",
    "There doesn\u2019t seem to be a particular rhyme or reason for these apps to get improvements, according to Google\u2019s blog post, but we aren\u2019t complaining \u2013 just keep in mind that they\u2019re not coming to all versions of Android, with different minimum versions for each update (we\u2019ll disclose these thresholds below). Also these updates will be rolling out to Android phones \u2018soon,\u2019 so they could reach your devices in days, weeks, or longer \u2013 but they\u2019re coming.",
    "Let\u2019s go through each app update one at a time.",
    "Google Maps had Dark Mode, but it only kicked in while actively navigating to a destination. Now, every screen of the app will follow the easy-on-the-eyes Dark Mode visual pattern.",
    "Once your Google Maps has been updated, you can turn it on for your entire phone by heading to Settings > Theme and pick Always In Dark Theme. As far as we can tell, this is coming to Google Maps in every version of Android.",
    "This one\u2019s pretty easy. Once your Messages app has been updated, you can compose it as normal and then long-press the \u2018Send\u2019 button to open up a menu where you can select the date and time you wish it to be sent.",
    "This feature is available for Messages app owners running Android 7 and above.",
    "Google\u2019s screen reader app, TalkBack, has been overhauled with input from blind and low-vision communities to be more intuitive, flexible, and responsive. There are more voice and gesture controls, a unified menu, a new reading control menu that allows you to customize gestures, and more.",
    "These updates seem to be coming to all versions of TalkBack \u2013 just download the latest version, which is available now.",
    "A Password Checkup update will tell you if login credentials you\u2019ve used have been compromised \u2013 and now, the feature can scan across all your apps.",
    "If you use Google\u2019s Password Manager to Autofill usernames and passwords in apps or online in Chrome, Password Checkup can help by scanning every credential you use against publicly-available lists of passwords that have been compromised \u2013 that is, known to be stolen and potentially involved in mass leaks.",
    "If Password Checkup detects you\u2019ve used one of these passwords, it\u2019ll alert you via popup to change it. This feature is available to Android 9 users and later. Unsure if you\u2019ve activated Autofill? Head to Settings > System > Languages & Input > Advanced to tap Autofill Service, though that may not be the path to selecting Autofill on your Android phone \u2013 in that case, use your Search function to find \u2018Autofill,\u2019 as CNET recommends.",
    "A new update for Google Assistant will have it respond even while the screen is off and the device locked \u2013 if so, it will display cards with text that\u2019s larger and easier to read from farther away, making it less of a chore to check Assistant\u2019s responses to your inquiries.",
    "To toggle the feature on, head to Settings > Google Assistant and tap Lock Screen Personal Results. This is presumably available to all Android versions.",
    "Android Auto\u2019s update adds shortcuts to the launch screen that will give quick access to your contacts, Google Assistant, weather, and more. Cars with wider touchscreens can use a split-screen feature to use Android Auto alongside Google Maps and media controls. You can also add a privacy screen that controls when Android Auto appears on your display.",
    "The update also adds voice-controlled games, like Jeopardy and other trivia-like titles.",
    "Finally, the update now allows users to choose from a selection of wallpapers, including those with \u2018car-inspired backgrounds,\u2019 as the update puts it. The new features should be available in the coming days to users running Android 6.0 or above."
