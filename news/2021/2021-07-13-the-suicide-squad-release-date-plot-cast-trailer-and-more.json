  "article": [
    "The Suicide Squad is preparing to undertake another life or death mission in Warner Bros\u2019 DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Yep, Harley Quinn, Rick Flag and company are ready to wage war under the command of Amanda Waller \u2013 albeit against their will.",
    "James Gunn\u2019s R-rated supervillain movie arrives in theaters and on HBO Max in early August (or late July depending on where you live) and, if its two trailers are anything to go on, it may be the best superhero flick that Warner Bros. has made for quite a while.",
    "With its launch date rapidly approaching, we\u2019ve collected every piece of information on The Suicide Squad together for your convenience. We\u2019re nice like that \u2013 unlike the various superpowered criminals in The Suicide Squad\u2019s lineup.",
    "Below, you\u2019ll find everything worth knowing about the film, including its release date, trailer, all-star cast, plot details, whether it's a sequel to the 2016 Suicide Squad movie and more.",
    "The Suicide Squad will release simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max on Friday, August 5. It was originally supposed to arrive on August 6, but the date was moved up 24 hours to coincide with James Gunn's birthday.",
    "However, this date only applies to US audiences, as viewers in some territories will be able to see it earlier.",
    "It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that The Suicide Squad will only be available on HBO Max for 31 days \u2013 and only subscribers at the ad-free $14.99 monthly tier will be able to stream it. It\u2019ll leave the service after September 6 so, if you choose to watch it at home instead of on the big screen, ensure you do so within a month of its launch.",
    "UK film fans will be able to catch it in cinemas a week earlier from Friday, July 30 as HBO Max isn\u2019t currently available on British shores.",
    "We also know what the movie's runtime is now, too. Taking to Twitter (as he regularly does to interact with his fanbase), Gunn revealed that The Suicide Squad would be two hours and 12 minutes long.",
    "With The Suicide Squad set to be released very soon, Warner Bros. is ramping up marketing for its R-rated supervillain flick.",
    "A new trailer for the movie landed online on Tuesday, June 22 and provided a more in-depth look at some of the characters, action and humor that will be on show when The Suicide Squad is released.",
    "The first trailer for James Gunn\u2019s Suicide Squad arrived on March 26 \u2013 and it was worth the wait.",
    "Looking (and feeling) like an R-rated version of another James Gunn movie series in Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad will be full of foul language, violence, sexual references and character deaths (more on these later).",
    "It\u2019s Warner Bros\u2019 most mature superhero movie yet and, if the online reaction to the trailer is to be believed, audiences are ready for more of these kinds of adult-skewing DCEU projects.",
    "You can watch the red band trailer here, or check out the 'Rebellion' trailer below:",
    "We aren\u2019t messing around when we say that The Suicide Squad\u2019s cast is absolutely stacked. There are plenty of big names in this movie, and we\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll get the screen time necessary to showcase their undoubted talents:",
    "Waititi has also been cast in another undisclosed role, while Agee will also portray Belle Reve warden John Economos, alongside other actors in supporting roles.",
    "These include Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo as General Mateo Su\u00e1rez, Juan Diego Botto as Corto Maltese\u2019s dictator Silvio Luna, Storm Reid as Bloodsport\u2019s daughter Tyla, Jennifer Holland as Waller\u2019s assistant Emilia Harcourt, and Suicide Squad comic writer John Ostrander as Doctor Fitzgibbon.",
    "One actor who we won\u2019t see in The Suicide Squad is Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star was eager to join Gunn for the DCEU movie but, due to scheduling conflicts with Zack Snyder\u2019s Army of the Dead (per Entertainment Weekly) he had to pass on being involved.",
    "It\u2019s complicated. Back in April 2019, The Suicide Squad producer Peter Safran told ComicBook.com that The Suicide Squad wasn\u2019t a continuation of the 2016 film.",
    "Fast-forward to an October 2020 Empire piece, however, and Gunn revealed that The Suicide Squad is \u201cits own thing\u201d \u2013 not quite a sequel, but not exactly a reboot.",
    "The return of Robbie, Courtney, Kinnaman and Davis (in their respective roles) for The Suicide Squad muddies the water further, too. If this quartet are reprising their characters from David Ayer\u2019s 2016 flick, shouldn\u2019t Gunn\u2019s movie be labeled a sequel?",
    "In that respect, it should be \u2013 but, as Gunn explained via Twitter, you don\u2019t have to watch 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad in order to follow The Suicide Squad\u2019s events, so it can\u2019t be a straight sequel.",
    "Actor John Cena has further complicated matters since Gunn's tweet. Speaking to Observer about the upcoming movie, Cena said that it wasn't a prequel or a sequel.",
    "\u201cThe Suicide Squad is neither a sequel nor reboot,\" Cena confusingly stated. \"The Suicide Squad is the Suicide Squad from the brain of one of the most amazingly twisted creative minds in James Gunn that I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.\u201d",
    "Is The Suicide Squad a follow-up to 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad then? We say \u2018technically not\u2019 but, given all of the above, it\u2019s easy to see why there\u2019s so much confusion around this fact.",
    "Given the above information, one thing we don\u2019t expect to see (or hear) is callbacks to David Ayer\u2019s Suicide Squad. If we don\u2019t have to watch that flick to understand The Suicide Squad, we don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be many overt references to the 2016 installment.",
    "With that out of the way, here\u2019s The Suicide Squad\u2019s official synopsis (per the movie\u2019s official website):",
    "\u201cWelcome to Hell \u2013 a.k.a Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out \u2013 even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X.",
    "\u201cToday\u2019s do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons\u2026 then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. Trekking through a jungle teaming with militant adversaries and guerilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave, and Amanda Waller\u2019s government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement.",
    "\u201cAnd, as always, one wrong move and they\u2019re dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a team mate, or Waller herself). If anyone\u2019s laying down bets, the smart money is against them \u2013 all of them.\u201d",
    "With so many characters in The Suicide Squad, it\u2019s inevitable that most of them will be bumped off.",
    "That\u2019s not to say that Harley Quinn, Bloodsport and Peacemaker are immune, either. Gunn has previously revealed that he had free rein to kill any supervillain that he wanted (per Total Film) and that each actor knew whether their character would live or die before The Suicide Squad\u2019s production began.",
    "It\u2019ll be fascinating to see who Gunn kills off in The Suicide Squad, then, and we suspect that a few of those deaths will come at the hands of the movie\u2019s main villain \u2013 Starro.",
    "Who is Starro? To put it simply, it\u2019s a huge, cosmic starfish-esque monster who has plans for world domination.",
    "In DC Comics, Starro has many abilities (including flight, superhuman strength and regeneration), but its most famous power is its army of mind controllable starfish. If one of these alien molluscs attaches itself to a host lifeform, Starro is able to control them in any way it sees fit.",
    "That, inevitably, spells trouble for The Suicide Squad. What happens if one (or more) of them become possessed by this hulking monstrosity? They may turn on each other and ultimately jeopardise the mission.",
    "Speaking to Den of Geek, Gunn also teased the possibility of more than one villain in The Suicide Squad, so Starro may not be the only major threat to Rick Flag\u2019s gang of convicts.",
    "As for why the Suicide Squad are being dropped onto South American-based island Corto Maltese, they\u2019re tasked with destroying Jotunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory where political prisoners are held and experimented on.",
    "We suspect that these experiments will have ties to Starro\u2019s mind-control abilities \u2013 after all, we see Starro break out from an underground facility in the movie\u2019s trailer. It\u2019s possible that Corto Maltese\u2019s army are using it to conduct its own mind control experiments, and the Suicide Squad end up accidentally releasing Starro from his prison.",
    "One non-Starro tease, which Gunn revealed recently, explains why Bloodsport is in prison, too. According to the director, Elba's character had a run-in with Superman, although Gunn hinted that Bloodsport wasn't exactly the villain during their exchange:",
    "Finally, you should stay in your seat once the credits begin to roll. Gunn has also confirmed that there will be a post-credits scene to enjoy once audiences have sat through the credits (to appreciate the many, hardworking individuals who helped to make the film):",
    "Yes. A Peacemaker TV series is currently in development for HBO Max. Cena will reprise his role for the show, which will explore the character\u2019s origins. Gunn has written the eight-episode series and will direct several of them.",
    "Other cast members include Steve Agee as John Economos (the same role he\u2019ll play in The Suicide Squad), Danielle Brooks (Orange is the New Black) as Leota Adebeyo, Robert Patrick (Terminator 2) as Auggie Smith and Freddit Stroma (Harry Potter) as Adrian Chase/The Vigilante.",
    "Filming is set to end on June 9 ahead of the series premiering on HBO Max in January 2022.",
    "Peacemaker may not be the only spin-off that Gunn develops, though. Responding to a fan on Twitter in January, Gunn said that he\u2019d be interested in pursuing other projects around The Suicide Squad\u2019s lineup, but declined to say who exactly.",
    "We suspect so. The Suicide Squad is basically an R-rated Guardians of the Galaxy and, given how popular that Marvel series is, it\u2019s highly likely that Gunn and Warner Bros. are onto a winner with this DCEU movie.",
    "There\u2019s clearly an audience for R-rated DC movies. The movie\u2019s first red band trailer received over 150 million views on YouTube one week after release, which broke the record set by another mature Warner Bros. film in Mortal Kombat.",
    "If that\u2019s any indication, plenty of people are excited to take in a funny, action-packed R-rated DCEU movie with an all-star cast, and with a proven big name writer-director behind it. We certainly are, too, so we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if The Suicide Squad becomes a major hit as the box office recovers from the pandemic \u2013 even with its simultaneous HBO Max release."
