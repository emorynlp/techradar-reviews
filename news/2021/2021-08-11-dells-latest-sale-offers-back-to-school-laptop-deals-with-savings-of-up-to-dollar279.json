    "We've spotted four excellent laptop deals over at the Dell site today that we think are exceptional choices if you're eyeing up a machine for going back to school or college later this year.",
    "To begin with, we've got a pair of new 15.6-inch Dell Inspiron 15 3000's for $303.79 (was $518.99), and $509.59 (was $788.99) respectively. Both machines are rocking rather eye-watering savings in the $200 (and up) range, as well as the latest 11th gen Intel Core processors. Simply put, you'll get great performance out of both of these laptops for the vast majority of work or school applications, although the more expensive option does feature a Core i5, 12GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD - really high-end specs that will handle nearly anything aside from gaming.",
    "Those two choices above are our top picks for today's back to school laptop deals, although we've also included two excellent alternative machines to check out - specifically a Dell XPS for $783.99 (was $949.99) and a Dell G5 gaming laptop for $832.99 (was $1,198). Both these machines are a bit pricier, a bit more niche, but still fantastic choices in their own regard. You can check out full specs and details just below.",
    "It's worth noting that some of these laptop deals from Dell are available in extremely limited numbers. In fact, some have already sold over 50% of their allotted stock so it's probably not wise to wait around too much longer if you're interested. If you're visiting from outside the US then you'll also find today's best back to school laptop deals in your region just below.",
