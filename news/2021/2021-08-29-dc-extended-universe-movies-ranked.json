    "Thanks to the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, interlinking superhero franchises are all the rage right now. Their closest competitor is Warner Bros\u2019 DC Extended Universe, but in reality it\u2019s not that close. There have been more lows than highs for Superman and company on the big screen in recent times, and it\u2019s undeniable that the DCEU is a lot messier than it should be 11 films in.",
    "The upcoming Flash movie \u2013 which will reportedly be adapting elements from the popular Flashpoint comic book arc that reset the universe \u2013 may help remedy that. But with The Suicide Squad having recently landed in theaters, now is as good a time as any to look back on the bad, the good, and the great of DC\u2019s live action offerings over the past eight years.",
    "The jury is still out on whether or not we\u2019ll get to see David Ayer\u2019s purported cut of Suicide Squad (though it seems unlikely). But the movie that was released in 2016 was a terrible, badly edited mess. The reason for the squad assembling in the first place is nonsensical, the villains-become-family arc is unearned, and the performances by Jared Leto as The Joker and Cara Delevigne as The Enchantress are among the worst in the genre.",
    "The lone saving grace is in the casting of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, two characters who show up in the sequel. But not even they, along with the charisma machine that is Will Smith, can save this one.",
    "The biggest problem with 2017\u2019s Justice League is that it\u2019s the product of two different visions colliding. When Zack Snyder left the project due to personal tragedy, WB brought in Joss Whedon to finish the project. The results weren\u2019t pretty, from humor that felt forced and at times inappropriate to visuals that looked flat-out ugly.",
    "The audience were left unsatisfied, and it\u2019s become clearer and clearer in recent times that the actors who worked on the movie weren\u2019t happy either, with Cyborg actor Ray Fisher accusing Whedon of \"gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable\" conduct. Gal Gadot shared her own story about the experience, too. The first live action team-up of DC\u2019s most iconic heroes deserved much better.",
    "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is what you get when the writers and director don\u2019t understand what makes their titular characters special. Doubling down on the broody Superman established in Man of Steel is bad enough. But turning Batman into a killing machine is a choice so incompatible with the character that it breaks the world of the film (why would Commissioner Gordon still light the Bat-signal if Gotham\u2019s famous vigilante was dropping bodies? He should be hunting him down).",
    "One of the few bright spots in all the doom and gloom is the introduction of Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman, who makes a fun splash in the final battle against Doomsday.",
    "The first 20 minutes of Wonder Woman 1984 \u2013 in which we see a young Diana compete in a Themyscirian Olympics, and then watch as Gal Gadot\u2019s lasso-wielding heroine take down a group of robbers in 1984 \u2013 are incredible. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bit middling. With the hunt for a MacGuffin, two villains, and the return of Steve Trevor (under icky circumstances that are never really examined), there are ultimately too many spinning plates for this sequel to satisfyingly service.",
    "Still, there is plenty to like here. Chris Pine and Gadot remain a charming double act, and Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig both acquit themselves well as Maxwell Lord and Barbara Minerva/Cheetah respectively. And as heavy-handed and cheesy as it is, the earnestness of the movie is hard to dislike.",
    "Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League benefits from a unified vision that the 2017 cut didn\u2019t have. For one thing, character decisions make more sense and the chemistry between the team is more pronounced. For another, the beefed up Cyborg storyline is complex and emotional.",
    "But some of the problems when it comes to Snyder\u2019s vision for these characters still remain, and there\u2019s at least 20 minutes of unnecessary footage that could and should have been excised from this four-hour cut. No one needs to hear an extended Icelandic ballad in a Justice League movie.",
    "There is so much about Man of Steel that works. Superman\u2019s first flight sequence is an all-timer, and his suit looks great. Hans Zimmer\u2019s score is markedly different from John Williams\u2019 standard setting work in the 1970s, but no less stunning. We can even get on board with the 20 minute prologue in which Russell Crowe\u2019s Jor-El rides a lizard with dragonfly wings. But this counts for little if you don\u2019t get the core tenets of Kal-El right.",
    "And even before the Man of Steel snaps Zod\u2019s neck in the final battle, there are signs that the filmmakers behind this interpretation of Superman weren\u2019t nailing the simple things (for one thing, if your name isn\u2019t Lois Lane, you\u2019re probably not getting saved in this movie). It\u2019s a shame, because with the right script Henry Cavill could have really done something special with this character. But he, and we, are still waiting for it.",
    "How to stop people thinking that Aquaman is a joke? Step 1: Cast Jason Momoa. The once and former Khal Drogo brings his unique energy to the role, and it works a treat. Whether he\u2019s taking down villains on a submarine or bouncing off of Amber Heard\u2019s Mera, he\u2019s always fun to watch. Step 2 is hiring James Wan.",
    "When Aquaman leans into its fantasy elements, the visuals are often spectacular. The film loses points for not utilizing Yahya Abdul-Mateen II\u2019s Black Manta enough, and a few more for some really strange soundtrack choices that feel like they belong in another movie. But overall, we\u2019re definitely laughing with the King of the Seas rather than at him. Bring on Aquaman 2.",
    "In its best moments, Shazam! has an excellent balance of humor and heart. The central conflict of blood family vs. foster family is given the right amount of weight, and the film gets a lot of mileage out of the idea that a teenager can transform into a muscle-clad superhero with just one word.",
    "David F. Sandberg\u2019s movie can also lay claim to having the best joke in the entirety of the DCEU to date, in which Mark Strong\u2019s villain try to monologue to a hero who can\u2019t hear him. At times it feels a bit too lighthearted, with jokes that undercut genuine emotion at the wrong times. But with fun performances, a great message, and an exciting setup for the sequel, this film set the stage for characters I can\u2019t wait to see more of.",
    "After the back-to-back-to-back disappointments of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Suicide Squad, the DCEU desperately needed a win, and thanks to director Patty Jenkins they got it with Wonder Woman.",
    "The No Man\u2019s Land sequence \u2013 in which Diana strides confidently across the battlefield deflecting bullets while Rupert Gregson-Williams\u2019 score soars \u2013 is still the best 2 minutes of the DCEU to date. Add that to a beautifully visualised first act that focuses on the warrior women of Themyscira and the instantly winning chemistry between Gadot and Pine\u2019s Steve Trevor, and only some third act problems hold it back from a higher placing on this list.",
    "There are no such third act issues with Birds of Prey \u2013 in fact, it might be the best thing about a movie, a riotous action sequence in which a hair clip is exchanged mid-battle proving to be one of many highlights. There\u2019s lots to like before that inevitable throw-down too, much of it do to Margot Robbie\u2019s pitch-perfect performance of Harley Quinn.",
    "Freed from Jared Leto and The Joker, she truly makes the character her own with this movie, from Quinn\u2019s mannerisms to her attitude. Throw in a fantastic Daniel Pemberton score and a supporting cast who do a lot with a little (Mary Elizabeth Winstead is especially fun here as The Huntress), and you have one of the DCEU\u2019s best films.",
    "The Suicide Squad debacle of 2016 didn\u2019t exactly have people hankering for more movies focused on Task Force X. That all changed when James Gunn got hired to write and direct a sequel.",
    "Having made two movies about the MCU\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy, Gunn had form when it came to making us fall in love with a group of rogues, and he proves it again here. There\u2019s just the right balance of humor, character, and action, with multiple third act payoffs and a body count that remembers what the title of the movie is. Put simply\u2026 he understood the assignment."
