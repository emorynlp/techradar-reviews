  "article": [
    "Spoiler alert: it's going to have OLED but no 4K gameplay in sight ...the Nintendo Switch OLED is finally official, costing $349 and landing this October.",
    "Original article continues below:",
    "It\u2019s so close we can almost taste it \u2013 if licking Nintendo consoles is your thing, that is. The Nintendo Switch Pro, the expected mid-gen successor to the world-beating Nintendo Switch, has been churning around the rumor mill for more than a year now, and it finally seems as if it may see the light of day.",
    "Whispers had suggested that it may have been revealed by Nintendo as early as last week, but it never materialized. But with the big E3 2021 games show and Summer Games Fest about to take place, and third-party game developers likely keen to show off their new-and-improved Nintendo titles, it\u2019s surely only a matter of time before Nintendo lifts the covers off its new hardware.",
    "As you\u2019ll know having read our Nintendo Switch Pro news and rumors hub, there\u2019s lots that seems set in stone for Nintendo\u2019s new machine. But there are a few burning questions we\u2019d love to have answered. This is what we\u2019re dying to know about the Nintendo Switch Pro.",
    "This is an important one. The original Nintendo Switch was already looking a little ropey when it came to max resolution support, given that the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X were offering 4K support soon after the Nintendo Switch\u2019s reveal. Now, with the PS5 and Xbox Series X making 4K resolution the standard, the Nintendo Switch is looking positively decrepit.",
    "Could improved internals, or a smarter dock, let the Nintendo Switch Pro target a 4K resolution? Here\u2019s hoping \u2013 Nvidia, which makes the Nintendo Switch\u2019s existing internal graphics wizardry, has made great strides with AI upscaling of lower-resolution games using its DLSS technology. Were it to be employed in the Nintendo Switch Pro, we could see the console hit high resolutions without the performance hit that native resolution output causes \u2013 which would be great for the lower-powered handheld mode.",
    "And while we\u2019re on the subject of visual fidelity, how about an update to that handheld Nintendo Switch screen? Now, to be clear, we\u2019re less concerned with getting a resolution bump in handheld mode \u2013 nice as it would be \u2013 as it\u2019d likely require significant battery and internal spec boosts in order to reliably achieve it. When added cost is factored in, it might not be worth the trade.",
    "But a richer, more colorful and contrasty OLED screen, more capable of avoiding sunlight glare and with improved viewing angles, would be the sort of upgrade to make us sit up and pay attention \u2013 especially if Nintendo introduces a Switch Lite Pro, too.",
    "It\u2019s one of the key gripes with the existing Nintendo Switch; hooking up wireless headphones to the console, whether docked or in handheld mode, is a pain. There\u2019s the 3.5mm jack for on-the-go play, but if you want to go wireless while out and about or when playing with the docked mode activated, you\u2019re limited to a few select wireless headsets or forking out for a Bluetooth receiver to add to the Switch.",
    "We\u2019re hoping the Nintendo Switch Pro will introduce native Bluetooth headset support to the console, letting us pair some of the best true wireless earbuds and Bluetooth earphones up to Nintendo\u2019s new play thing.",
    "A new Nintendo Switch Pro will certainly bring with it exclusive features to games made for it, be they improved visuals, faster loading times or some other advancement that new hardware allows for. We\u2019d also expect the console to be backwards compatible with the excellent existing Switch library of games. But will it cause a rift, a split, in what existing Nintendo Switch players can play on their machines?",
    "If Nintendo\u2019s new hardware is super powerful, for instance, we may see some developers target the capabilities of the new console, and drop support for the older Nintendo Switch models. Could Breath of the Wild 2 become a Nintendo Switch Pro exclusive?",
    "It\u2019s unlikely, given the huge number of existing customers that developers would be missing out on. But Nintendo does have history here \u2013 when the New Nintendo 3DS launched, games like Xenoblade Chronicles 3D and Fire Emblem Warriors would only run on that specific version of the handheld hardware.",
    "Nintendo Switch Online is the weakest of all the major game subscription offerings. There\u2019s no built-in chat functionality, adding friends to your list of gaming pals requires dusty old friend codes and its list of bundled in games leaves a lot to be desired. Yes, Tetris 99 is a banger, and there\u2019s some good SNES games to be had, but there are some classics missing, and Nintendo hasn\u2019t really rivaled what PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass has to offer.",
    "A new console with improved networking capabilities would go a long way to getting fans hooked on a monthly subscription, perhaps with the odd free title thrown in. And could it finally see the likes of Game Boy Advance, N64 and GameCube games added to the vault? We can but dream."
