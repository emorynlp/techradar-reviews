    "Google and Lenovo could be working on an exciting new Chromebook \u2013 at least that\u2019s what new rumors are suggesting.",
    "While Google is primarily a software company, it\u2019s also made some of the best Chromebooks ever. The Pixelbook and Pixelbook Go are examples of just how good these Chrome OS-powered laptops can be, so many people have been eagerly awaiting the company\u2019s next release.",
    "It\u2019s been a long wait \u2013 the Pixelbook Go launched back in 2019, and while it still remains one of our favorite Chromebooks, it\u2019s also well overdue a successor.",
    "Lenovo is also behind some brilliant Chromebooks as well, including the fantastic Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook, so the idea that it may work with Google on a new Chromebook is certainly exciting.",
    "So, where are these rumors coming from? Chrome Unboxed has done some digging and found references in the Chromium Gerrit (which lists what people are working on in Chrome and Chrome OS) to a device known as \u2018Lindar\u2019.",
    "What\u2019s interesting is that references to Lindar mention lightbar support. This would be a strip of lights that shows a different color when the lid is closed depending on the battery level.",
    "This feature was last seen on Google\u2019s premium Pixelbook Chromebook back in 2015. The lightbar was also included on the Pixel C tablet, and an animated version of it displays when you use Google Assistant on a smartphone.",
    "It\u2019s closely associated with Google \u2013 especially premium devices \u2013 which suggests Lindar could be a high-end Google product.",
    "As Chrome Unboxed points out, there\u2019s also suggestions that Lindar will be based on the \u2018Volteer\u2019 baseboard, which means it will use the latest Intel Tiger Lake processors, again pointing at a powerful Chromebook device.",
    "So, what about Lenovo\u2019s involvement? In the Lindar commits, there are emails from the \u201c@lcfc.corp-partner.google.com\u201d domain. LCFC Electronics works closely with Lenovo to provide parts for its devices, so Chrome Unboxed has looked to see if LCFC makes products for anyone other than Lenovo \u2013 and it appears not.",
    "If the Lindar Chromebook is being made by LCFC Electronics, there\u2019s a good chance it will be for Lenovo.",
    "While the evidence is a bit thin at the moment \u2013 and remember this is all supposition until we hear anything official \u2013 it\u2019s not beyond the realms of believability.",
    "Google has teamed up with various manufacturers in the past for its Nexus lineup of phones and tablets, which are branded as Google devices.",
    "Google has also worked closely with HP to create the HP Chromebook 11, which really felt like a collaborative effort \u2013 it even had the same lightbar as the Pixelbook.",
    "We\u2019d love Google to get more involved with Chromebook hardware again, considering how good its previous attempts were, so hopefully we\u2019ll hear more about this mystery Lindar device soon."
