They help you show off what you care about, and can function as miniature phone stands too.",
    "PopSockets are removable accessories that you stick to the back of your phone to give you something easy to grip when you're holding it. You can also physically pop them down so they don't take up as much space, and don't get in the way when your phone is in your pocket.",

    "If you're a classy and sophisticated person you want your PopSocket to reflect that, and so your best option is to get a gem-encrusted PopSocket like this one.",
