    "After a much-disrupted season, professional badminton's World Tour Finals finally take place in Thailand this week. Originally scheduled to take place in China last month, Covid-19 forced a change in plans and the last three events of the 2020 season have instead been played in a bubble at the Impact Arena in Nonthaburiin this January. Read on to find how get a badminton live stream and watch the World Tour Finals online wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "Now taking place between January 27 and 31, the tournament sees the top eight players and pairs from each discipline (men's singles, women\u2019s singles, mixed doubles, women\u2019s doubles, men\u2019s doubles) battle it out for badminton's biggest paycheck of the season, with a share of a $1,500,000 prize pot up for grabs.",
    "The pandemic has unfortunately meant some of the sport\u2019s biggest names will be absent this year, with current men\u2019s world champ Momota Kento forced to withdraw having tested positive for the virus en route to Thailand. Now, Danish star Viktor Axelsen is being widely tipped to clinch the men\u2019s title, having won the last two Super 1000 tournament titles played in Thailand leading up to the World Tour Finals.",
    "Currently on an unbeaten streak of 28 matches, a win in Thailand would mark an incredible turnaround for the Dane, having spent a huge chunk of the season on the sidelines following major ankle surgery.",
    "Also among those looking to make it three wins in a row in Thailand is the in-form Spanish star and reigning Olympic Women\u2019s champ Carolina Marin. Still chasing the first World Tour Finals title of her career, she beat top seed Tai Tsu Ying twice in back-to-back Super 1000 finals earlier this month",
