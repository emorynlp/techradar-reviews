    "Polar has unveiled two new version of its Grit X sports watch, with tougher materials that also shave a few valuable grams off the weight, plus improved navigation tools for runs, hikes and bike rides off the beaten path.",
    "When we reviewed the original Polar Grit X back in June 2020, we were impressed by its understated but sturdy design. The new Polar Grit X Pro takes that even furtherm with a sapphire glass lens (like that used on top-end Garmin watches), and a premium rubber strap.",
    "It comes in three colorways (Nordic Copper, Black DLC, and Arctic Gold), is water-resistant to 100m, and is rated for temperatures between 50C and -20C.",
    "The Polar Grit X Pro Titanium trades the original watch's stainless steel case for aircraft-grade titanium, which is not only extra tough, but also shaves a few valuable grams off the overall weight. It's available in black, silver, and red colorways.",
    "Both watches have new turn-by-turn navigation courtesy of Komoot, plus new route and elevation profiles. If you already own a Polar Grit X, don't worry \u2013 you'll also get these tools with a software update very soon.",
    "The Polar Grit X Pro is available now direct from Polar and third-party retailers for $499.90 / \u00a3439 (about AU$700), and the Polar Grit X Pro Titan costs $599.95 / \u00a3519 (about AU$830).",
    "If that's too steep, you can pick up the original Polar Grit X for a special discount right now. Outdoor sports fans in the US can grab the watch for $341.99 at Walmart, while those in the UK can pick it up for \u00a3303.99 on Amazon. Both are a hefty saving on the original price, and may be better than this year's Black Friday deals.",
    "If you're not in the US or UK, scroll down a little further for the best Polar Grit X deals near you.",
    "There are new looks for two of Polar's other sports watches, too. The entry-level Polar Unite now comes in red and teal, and the Polar Vantage V2 is available with a bright red band (something the company says was widely requested by its users).",
    "For anyone who wants to wear their sports watch 24/7 but sometimes needs a more formal look, Polar revealed the Polar Vantage V2 Shift Edition. This has a new quick release mechanism that allows you to switch between different 22mm bands more easily, and is available by itself or in a bundle with both perforated leather and premium rubber straps.",
    "The Polar Vantage V2 Red starts at $499.95 / \u00a3449 (about AU$700), and the Polar Vantage V2 Shift costs $549.95 / \u00a3489 (about AU$760). If you already own a Vantage V2, you can upgrade it to a Shift with a special bundle starting at $49.95 / \u00a343.40 (about AU$70)."
