  "article": [
    "Intel has a new CEO, as you probably noticed, and Pat Gelsinger has firmly set out his stall to begin with \u2013 with Apple apparently very much in his sights.",
    "As Apple Insider reports, Gelsinger told Intel staff: \u201cWe have to deliver better products to the PC ecosystem than any possible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino makes. We have to be that good, in the future.\u201d",
    "The reference to Apple as a \u2018lifestyle company\u2019 is a telling one, and the statement can certainly be read as an indication that Gelsinger is serious about shaking things up at Intel.",
    "In recent times Apple has made big waves with its M1 chip which has been very well-received and is quite a remarkable piece of engineering. The M1 will replace all Intel chips in MacBooks over a two-year transitional period \u2013 which has already begun \u2013 so in that respect it\u2019s no doubt a doubly sore point for Intel.",
    "Perhaps above all, the M1 has been heralded as seriously innovative, and it\u2019s in that department that Intel needs to shine again.",
    "Intel does have something up its sleeve, though, in terms of a big change in the form of Alder Lake. These 12th-gen CPUs \u2013 which will arrive later in 2021, or that\u2019s the plan, to follow next-gen Rocket Lake desktop processors \u2013 do things very differently, employing a model of two different core types (full power ones, accompanied by low-power \u2018little\u2019 cores to run the show much more power-efficiently in less demanding scenarios).",
    "If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because this is the way that ARM\u2019s big.LITTLE architecture is built. And the M1, of course, is an ARM-based chip (of Apple\u2019s own design). Indeed, ARM\u2019s CEO has recently been arguing that ARM silicon is on the verge of making a challenge to the dominant PC powers (namely Intel and AMD).",
    "At any rate, Intel has already promised that Alder Lake will be a \u2018significant\u2019 breakthrough. Although if Intel is looking towards Cupertino, Apple won\u2019t be standing still either \u2013 and big things are already expected of the M1\u2019s successor, going by the rumor mill.",
    "Gelsinger was VMware\u2019s chief executive and will replace Intel\u2019s CEO Bob Swan when he steps down in mid-February.",
