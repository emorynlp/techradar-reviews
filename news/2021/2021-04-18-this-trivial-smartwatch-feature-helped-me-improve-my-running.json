    "I just hit my personal best for my standard running route, knocking about two-and-a-half minutes off the typical 45-minute, 8km workout. I was pretty pleased about this, since I\u2019d struggled to consistently beat the course in under 45 minutes.",
    "\u2018Outdoor running, 4/12/2021, 12:36, 8.05km\u2019 said my smartwatch. I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting it to throw a party, invite celebrity guests, bust out the champagne \u2013 but this seemed an awfully utilitarian response. Oh well, it\u2019s only a smartwatch; keep calm and carry on.",
    "But I\u2019ve long-wondered whether the way in which a smartwatch logs our workout can affect our future workouts?",
    "I\u2019m currently taking part in a challenge to run the distance of America\u2019s Route 66 in two years \u2013 find out all about the journey here \u2013 and in my columns, I\u2019m exploring the way technology (and other things) can help or hinder the experience.",
    "I\u2019ve actually been wanting to write about the language of wearables for a while now, and it\u2019s as a result of my penchant for Honor wearables. You see, devices from the company often shower you with praise on completing a task.",
    "\u2018Longest run\u2019, \u2018Fastest 5k time\u2019, \u2018Fewest times tripped over pavement and fell on face\u2019. When you finish a run with an Honor smartwatch, you\u2019ll see various medals, awards and accolades pop up. These are often quite particular, which makes it feel like it would be impossible not to get at least one achievement (although the pavement one is a joke).",
    "At first I found it a little condescending, but that quickly changed. When I started using other wearables, as I invariably do for my job (testing such items means you have to keep picking up and trying new ones, and shelving old ones), I missed these silly little medals.",
    "But why? For that, we\u2019ve got to look to positive reinforcement.",
    "I first learned about reinforcement years ago, when studying child language acquisition (don\u2019t ask).",
    "To cut many, many lessons short (you\u2019d thank me if you\u2019d sat in them yourself), reinforcement is the process by which reactions to our behavior can influence future behavior. Positive reinforcement is when the knowledge of a potential reward encourages us to do something, negative reinforcement is when the removal of something negative encourages our behaviour instead.",
    "For example, positive reinforcement could take the form of you baking your tech writer a cake when they\u2019ve written a good article \u2013 it will encourage them to write many more great articles. Negative reinforcement is when you\u2019re an awful baker and you bake your tech writer a cake when they\u2019ve written a poor article \u2013 the writer will be encouraged to write better to avoid your crummy concoctions.",
    "While a ping of \u2018congratulations\u2019 on a smartwatch doesn\u2019t quite match the delivery on your desk of a scrumptious cheesecake (note to Ed: preferably strawberry or caramel; definitely not lemon), it\u2019s nevertheless a reward that hits hard in that post-run endorphin rush, making you feel good about your workout.",
    "Receiving a nice word or remark can make your day, whether it\u2019s from a person or your smartwatch (obviously, the former is better). And the more I\u2019ve received congratulations and virtual pats on the back from my smartwatches, I found myself running faster and further.",
    "In part this was so I could continue receiving those medals and achievements, but also simply because I felt better about running. The positive reinforcement through a message on-screen was great, but its effects lasted far longer, because it improved my attitude to my workouts.",
    "But now, accompanied by another smartwatch, I\u2019ll run until my legs are burning, just for an \u2018Outdoor running, 4/12/2021, 12:36, 8.05km\u2019. Even pet cats are capable of showing more support than that.",
    "Clearly, a super-positive smartwatch isn\u2019t necessary for hitting personal bests \u2013 after all, I reached my new time without one \u2013 but it\u2019s always nice to have your achievements recognized, however slight they are.",
    "Perhaps being dependent on a smartwatch to make you feel positive isn\u2019t such a good thing, though. The best thing would be to feel good regardless of how you run \u2013 and to just bake your own cheesecakes.",
    "But when you\u2019re running the distance of Route 66, you can\u2019t rely on such wholesome sentiments; I need to find extreme measures to hit my weekly goal\u2026 such as making ice-cream with leftover tech. These columns come out fortnightly, and I\u2019ve still have more than 2,000 miles left to run, so you can expect more like this soon."
