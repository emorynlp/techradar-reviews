    "Soul isn\u2019t a movie you would associate with Apocalypse Now. Sure, Pixar\u2019s most recent animated feature and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s psychological war epic have both tasted Oscars glory, but that\u2019s where the similarities ended. Until now, that is.",
    "22 vs Earth, Pixar\u2019s latest short film, is a Soul prequel that ironically owes its funniest moments and subtle references to the dark, mature overtones of the Vietnam War-based flick.",
    "Ahead of its April 30 release on Disney Plus, TechRadar sat down with director Kevin Nolting to discuss how the short\u2019s best jokes reference Coppola's masterpiece, the process of crafting a prequel to Soul and whether it features any Pixar Easter eggs.",
    "Set before Pixar\u2019s Soul, 22 vs Earth reunites us with Tina Fey\u2019s 22, a cynical-yet-witty soul, as she refuses to complete her life badge and travel to Earth to be physically born. Enlisting the help of five other hapless souls, 22 attempts to incite a rebellion that will stop any more souls \u2018graduating\u2019 from the Great Before - the realm where souls find their passions - at the behest of this world\u2019s counselors.",
    "Post-feature film related shorts have become a regular occurrence for Pixar. Since 2002 Monsters Inc. short Mike\u2019s New Car, the studio has produced 15 short spin-offs for movies including Toy Story, Up and Cars.",
    "22 vs Earth, then, is the 16th entry in this back catalog - but its creation wasn\u2019t a certainty. To date, 23 Pixar movies have been released, but that figure clearly doesn\u2019t align with the studio\u2019s number of offshoot shorts. As Nolting explains, each short\u2019s development hinges on crafting the ideal plot for the right character and, on this occasion, exploring 22\u2019s backstory seemed like a logical fit.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s always planned to do a short like this after a feature,\u201d Nolting says. \u201cWe used to put them on our DVDs as a bonus [and] the idea for this developed throughout the making of the movie. [In Soul], we explored Joe, met his family and learned a lot about his background. With 22, we had her in this time and place when she met Joe, but what brought her there? There were lots of aspects of 22 we could\u2019ve explored, but this one seemed the funniest one to do.\u201d",
    "22 vs Earth\u2019s release on Disney Plus comes just four months after Soul landed on the streaming platform. Given that only 16 weeks have passed since the movie launched, and the pandemic potentially slowing down the short\u2019s production as Pixar staff continue to work remotely, some viewers may find it surprising to see 22 vs Earth arrive so soon after Soul\u2019s release. Nolting, though, reveals that work on shorts takes place immediately after production wraps on Pixar\u2019s features - something that was particularly handy this time due to the complex nature of specific animations.",
    "\u201cI feel bad as we work long hours,\u201d Nolting admits. \u201c[But] as the departments wrap, we're grabbing people and asking them to help on the short for a few more weeks because the work\u2019s fresh in their minds. The Great Before is technically complicated, so we had to have the people who worked on the movie [return for 22 vs Earth]. The learning curve is too high on the lighting and the shading of the world, and the animation of the counsellors, especially, there's just a handful of people who could\u2019ve done that. It's the only way we could have gotten this done.\u201d",
    "22 vs Earth is only five minutes long, but it packs a lot of humor into its brief runtime. Its funniest scene has 22 put her new friends through an educational boot camp concerning her plan before she reveals what the group\u2019s official name is - The Apocalypse.",
    "We won\u2019t ruin the acronym-inspired reason behind that moniker, but it owes its inclusion to Nolting\u2019s favorite TV shows and movies, as well as 22 vs Earth writer Josh Cooley\u2019s inventiveness.",
    "\u201cOriginally, the group was going to be called Chaos,\u201d Nolting explains. \u201cOne of my favourite TV shows was Get Smart, and [protagonist] Agent 86, played by Don Adams, was always battling chaos. I just felt like it was too much of a connection to that. As we were talking about the story, [story artist] Hyein Park came up with Apocalypse - coincidentally Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite movies - and then Josh wrote the hilarious acronym.\u201d",
    "Nolting\u2019s Apocalypse Now appreciation extends beyond 22\u2019s rebellious gang. The veteran Pixar film editor, whose credits include the award-winning Inside Out and Soul, confirms that there are two other Apocalypse Now visual-related secrets for film aficionados to seek out, but declined to tease what they were.",
    "As for Pixar Easter eggs, such as the studio\u2019s trademark Pizza Planet truck, Nolting declined to comment. There are callbacks to Soul dotted throughout, but eagle-eyed Pixar fans will have to pour over every scene themselves if they want to find any surprise inclusions.",
    "Despite producing 13 new projects across movies, Disney Plus TV shows and short films over the past four years, Pixar shows no signs of slowing down. The studio\u2019s next feature - Luca - launches on Disney Plus in June, while work continues on 2022 movies Turning Red and Toy Story spin-off Lightyear.",
    "22 vs Earth may be Nolting\u2019s directorial debut, but. Luca, Turning Red or Lightyear won\u2019t be helmed by the former live-action movie editor. With Nolting returning to his first love of film editing, this might be the only time that an R-rated war movie inspires a Pixar production. The studio\u2019s upcoming slate, though, should benefit from Nolting\u2019s expertise as an editor - knowledge that will continue to be hugely beneficial to the studio for Luca and beyond.",
    "\u201cDirecting an animated movie is a four-to-seven year period,\u201d Nolting says. \u201cBy the time you conceive a movie, pitch it and get everything else done, it\u2019s a long process. I think, at my age, it\u2019s not realistic for me. I enjoyed working on 22 vs Earth, but I love editing so I think that\u2019s the path I\u2019ll stay on.\u201d",
    "22 vs Earth launches exclusively on Disney Plus on Friday, April 30."
