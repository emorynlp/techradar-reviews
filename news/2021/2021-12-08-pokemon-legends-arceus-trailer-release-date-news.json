  "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus is taking us back to the past",
  "article": [
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is the highly-anticipated Pok\u00e9mon game that marks a new direction for the series, revealed during February 2021's Pok\u00e9mon Presents live stream. Since this first reveal, we've learned a good deal more about the game ahead of its fast-approaching January 2022 release date.",
    "Announced alongside Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Shining Pearl (remakes of the revered Nintendo DS titles), it looks like Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is going to be a game that breaks new ground for the series, with a historical setting and some new mechanics.",
    "Confirmed for Nintendo Switch, Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus will act as a prequel to the main series, taking players to a much older version of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\u2019s Sinnoh region (known here as the Hisui region), where Pok\u00e9mon roamed freely, and they'll be charged with completing one of the region's first Pok\u00e9dexes.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is scheduled to launch worldwide on January 28 2022 but, in the meantime, we've gathered together everything we know about the game right here for your perusal.",
    "[Update: It looks like Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus could be in a playable state. Read on to find out more.]",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus will release on January 28, 2022, for Nintendo Switch. The Pok\u00e9mon Company revealed the new Pok\u00e9mon game's release date with a tweet back in May, 2021. Pre-orders are live now.",
    "New Hisuian Pok\u00e9mon forms",
    "A brand new trailer for the game released in October shows two new Hisuian Pok\u00e9mon forms: Zorua and Zoroark. Zorua is a Ghost/Normal type, known as the \u201cSpiteful Fox Pok\u00e9mon\u201d.",
    "According to an official description, Zorua \u201cmigrated to the Hisui region after being driven from other lands by humans, who shunned the Pok\u00e9mon for manifesting uncanny illusions. But the Zorua perished, unable to survive the harsh Hisuian environment and strife with other Pok\u00e9mon. Their lingering souls were reborn in this Ghost-type form through the power of their malice toward humans and Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d",
    "Zoroark is also a Ghost/Normal type known as the \u201cBaneful Fox Pok\u00e9mon\u201d. It\u2019s described as \u201cferociously hostile and aggressive toward people and other Pok\u00e9mon\u201d. \u200b\u200bThe \u201cspiteful power emitted from Hisuian Zoroark\u2019s long, writhing fur projects terrifying illusions\u2014and can also inflict physical harm upon foes, damaging their bodies from both inside and out. And the illusions that Zoroark projects have expressions of such utter malice toward every last thing upon this world that those who see them are said to be driven mad by the terror.\u201d",
    "Mysterious footage",
    "An October trailer for Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus takes a creepier approach than we're used to, showing a Pok\u00e9mon professor exploring the wild just as players will before appearing to come under attack from what appears to be a wild Zoroark.",
    "Frenzied Nobles trailer",
    "Released on September 28, 2021, this Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus trailer shows off new gameplay features, such as being able to ride Pok\u00e9mon in the wild across land, air and bodies of water. You can even pull off trick shots with Pok\u00e9balls while riding to catch wild Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "New characters, known as Wardens, are introduced. It's unclear as to how these characters will impact the game, but they seem integral to elements of the story.",
    "A new Pok\u00e9mon named Cleavor will appear as what the game is calling a 'frenzied noble'. These Noble Pok\u00e9mon act as boss fights, and it seems like the player trainer will have to calm them down through battle in order to catch them.",
    "Finally, character customization has been confirmed, and players are able to dress their trainer in period-appropriate attire, as well as change up their hairstyles back in the hub area of Jubilife Village.",
    "Gameplay trailer Debuting at the August 18, 2021 Pok\u00e9mon Presents livestream, this trailer gave us a more in-depth glimpse at what we can expect from Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus. We got a better look at exploration, and how wild Pok\u00e9mon can interact with the playable trainer.",
    "Reveal trailer Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus was arguably the biggest news from the Pok\u00e9mon Presents showcase, where it debuted alongside a trailer showing off some early in-engine gameplay.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus returns players to the Sinnoh region, albeit in a time long before the events of any mainline Pok\u00e9mon game. So old, in fact, that the region is being referred to as Hisui. The game evokes a historical Japanese setting, evident in its artwork, landscapes and character designs.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus looks quite unlike any other effort we\u2019ve seen so far in the series, and looks to expand on open-world elements found in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. Those games featured a pretty scaled back open-world element, the Wild Area, which felt a little tacked on, like a separate entity to the rest of the game world.",
    "In Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus, it appears that the scope of the open world is greater than previous entries in the series. It won't be Breath of the Wild open by any means but there will be multiple open areas to explore rather than just one. Trailers so far have introduced us to the hub town of Jubilife Village, as well as the Galaxy Expedition team, from where you'll prepare for your expeditions. According to The Pok\u00e9mon Company, \"Jubilife Village will serve as the base for surveying missions. After receiving an assignment or a request and preparing for their next excursion, players will set out from the village to study one of the various open areas of the Hisui region.\"",
    "Stealth-like elements are likely to play a role in Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus. In the trailers, we see the player character not only throw Pok\u00e9balls from great distances, but also perform a dodge roll and hide in tall grass. The recent showcase confirmed that not all Pok\u00e9mon will react to your presence in the same way, and many will be hostile towards you.",
    "Curiously, players won\u2019t have to enter a battle in order to catch Pok\u00e9mon. This is now done more fluidly via the open setting, where players can attempt to sneak up on Pok\u00e9mon, then aim and throw Pok\u00e9balls at them for a catch. Whether or not we can still catch Pok\u00e9mon via battles remains to be seen, though.",
    "Speaking of battling, that element of the series is retained in Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus, featuring the familiar turn-based gameplay. Animations seem to be more theatrical and improved across the board, perhaps in response to a criticism often leveled at Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield where battle animations were somewhat tepid.",
    "By throwing Pok\u00e9balls containing your partner Pok\u00e9mon near a wild one, you're able to seamlessly transition into battle, according to the game's website. This might make the game take an approach similar to that seen in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series, and definitely has our interest piqued.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon games usually get you going with one \u2018starter\u2019 Pok\u00e9mon at the outset of your journey, and that\u2019s no different in Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus. What is different, though, is that the three Pok\u00e9mon on offer this time are all from separate generations. They are Cyndaquil (Gen 2), Oshawott (Gen 5) and Rowlet (Gen 7), representing the usual Fire, Water and Grass types respectively.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus will task players with filling one of the region's first Pok\u00e9dexes so it's natural to wonder which Pok\u00e9mon we're going to be chasing down in the game. There's no comprehensive official list just yet but thanks to our friends at GamesRadar, we do have a list of the twenty Pok\u00e9mon that appeared in the game's announcement trailer as well as some more that have since been confirmed.",
    "That's quite a few so far. Given the game is set in the Sinnoh region, it's not entirely surprising that there are a lot of Generation 4 Pok\u00e9mon in that list and it seems reasonable to assume that their evolutionary forms will also probably be present in the game.",
    "We expect that in the run-up to the game's release, Nintendo and Game Freak will confirm more of the Pok\u00e9mon that we can expect to see in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus so we'll keep updating this list as and when they're revealed.",
    "Seems to be in a playable state?",
    "It looks like Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus is in a playable state, if long-time Nintendo fan Christina Aguilera is to be believed. In an interview with Elle, Aguilera discussed a recent campaign she\u2019s done with Nintendo for the Switch and revealed that while filming, her \"daughter was able to fall in love with a new game. We had a brief moment to [try out] Pokemon Legends: Arceus.\" Aguilera went on to say, \"It's so gorgeous, the graphics and the setting that you get to explore in, so she was loving that so much, she wouldn't give me a turn.\" That\u2019s a pretty ringing endorsement.",
    "This doesn\u2019t, of course, mean the game is ready to ship to players. As Aguilera pointed out, they only got to try it, rather than keep it. But it does suggest Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is close to being ready.",
    "Bonuses for players who have played previous games",
    "Pok\u00e9mon fans who have played previous games in the series will benefit from bonuses when they pick up Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus.",
    "According to the game\u2019s official site, \"if you have play records from the Pokemon Sword or Pokemon Shield game, you'll be able to take on a research request in Pokemon Legends: Arceus in which you'll have a chance to add the mythical Pokemon Shaymin to your team.\" The quest won\u2019t be available until after the game\u2019s end credits but, hey, it gives you something more to do after you finish the main story.",
    "The site says you\u2019ll also be able to claim a Shaymin Kimono Set. This can be found in-game by speaking to the clothier after you join the Galaxy Expedition Team which, apparently, should take about one hour of playtime.",
    "There\u2019s also bonuses for those with save data from Let's Go Pikachu or Let's Go Eevee on their system. These players will get either a Pikachu or Eevee mask, to be unlocked from the clothier at the same point in the game.",
    "Confirming the gameplay loop",
    "The Pok\u00e9mon Company has shed a little more light on the gameplay loop players can expect in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus. It appears that the game is not a full open world experience a la Breath of the Wild as it originally seemed and operates more on the basis of the player exploring individual hub areas. In a statement to Kotaku, The Pok\u00e9mon Company said, \u201cIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Jubilife Village will serve as the base for surveying missions. After receiving an assignment or a request and preparing for their next excursion, players will set out from the village to study one of the various open areas of the Hisui region.",
    "\u201cAfter they finish the survey work, players will need to return once more to prepare for their next task. We look forward to sharing more information about exploring the Hisui region soon.\u201d",
    "Boss fights Revealed during the August 18 Pok\u00e9mon Presents livestream, some Pok\u00e9mon in the Hisui region will be more hostile than others. Especially strong Pok\u00e9mon bore a red aura around their eyes, and would even attack the trainer directly. It seems like these encounters will be treated as boss fights, or harder fights at the very least. We expect to come across a lot of them in an effort to complete our Pok\u00e9dex.",
    "Base camp and regions You'll start any expedition by choosing a general area on the overworld map. From there, you'll begin your journey at a base camp, where you can stock up on items from your inventory, or even buy and craft more of them.",
    "You'll also return to the base camp should you black out while exploring. This can happen if wild Pok\u00e9mon hurt you too much, which means trainers will have to tread a lot more carefully than usual.",
    "New Pok\u00e9mon and variants confirmed Just because Hisui will eventually become the Sinnoh region doesn't mean we won't be seeing any new Pok\u00e9mon. In fact, the August 18 Pok\u00e9mon Presents livestream confirmed just that. New Pok\u00e9mon Wyrdeer and Basculegion will be joining the roster, and we imagine more new critters will follow.",
    "Region-specific variants are also confirmed to be returning with the announcement of Hisuian Braviary and Growlithe. Previous games in the series have done this to great success, such as with Alolan Vulpix and Galarian Ponyta, so we're glad to see the feature returning.",
    "E3 2021 Unfortunately, we didn't hear more about Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus at Nintendo's E3 2021 showcase but we're hoping to hear more about Arceus in the coming months.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus has been compared to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and while we now know it won't be quite as open as that game, it does appear to taking a slightly different approach from what we've seen from the series before.",
    "We're hoping that the hub-like approach that's been mentioned provides some new and interesting ways to play and explore in the world of Pok\u00e9mon, feeling simultaneously more diverse and more cohesive than the Wild Area of Sword and Shield.",
    "If Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield got one thing right, it was its eclectic bunch of superbly written characters. We\u2019d love to see this trend continue in Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus, especially when the historical setting could provide all sorts of fun characters and archetypes.",
    "Earlier we mentioned that recent Pok\u00e9mon games\u2019 animation quality has been lacking, particularly when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon battles. That\u2019s because the same animations have been consistently reused since the first true 3D entry in the mainline series, Pok\u00e9mon X and Y.",
    "While we know it\u2019s important to many fans that the National Dex (the complete roster of Pok\u00e9mon across all generations) be represented again in some way, we think it could be equally beneficial to feature a scaled-back roster of Pok\u00e9mon with a greater variety of revamped animations.",
    "Touching a bit more on that, it\u2019s possible that given the time period in which Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus takes place, it\u2019s possible that certain Pok\u00e9mon might not even exist yet. This makes Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus a prime testing ground for Game Freak to really wow us with improvements to animation quality across the board, particularly if there are fewer Pok\u00e9mon overall to work with."
