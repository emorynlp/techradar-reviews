    "The official Steam Link client is at long last available for Mac users through the Mac App Store, after it released on the iPhone App Store in 2019, allowing you to stream pretty much any Steam game in your library from another device to your Mac.",
    "Steam Link will only let you play games you own, like GeForce Now. Unlike that service, though, Steam Link will only let you stream games from devices on the same Wi-Fi network \u2014 so you're just mirroring your PC that\u2019s running nearby, rather than streaming from the cloud.",
    "It may not be as useful as using Steam Link on your TV or phone, but if you\u2019ve ever wanted to pull off high-power gaming on your MacBook Air, you finally can \u2014 you\u2019ll just need to add a few extra steps.",
    "To set up Steam Link on Mac you\u2019ll need a Steam account, a controller, and a Mac running macOS High Sierra 10.13 or later. You\u2019ll also need a separate computer running Steam on the same Wi-Fi network as your Mac \u2014 a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection is recommended. Then it\u2019s just a matter of connecting it all.",
    "The process shouldn\u2019t be too hard, and the onscreen instructions will guide you along the way too.",
