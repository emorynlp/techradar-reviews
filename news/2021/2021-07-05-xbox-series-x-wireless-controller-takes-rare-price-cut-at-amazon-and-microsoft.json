  "article": [
    "The Xbox Series X wireless controller (also compatible with previous systems) hasn't seen too many discounts over the last few months. The cheapest Carbon Black model, in fact, hasn't seen a price close to $50 since the end of January. However, both Microsoft and Amazon are changing that today, with a selection of Xbox controller deals that are offering both rare savings and, in some cases, record low prices.",
    "That Carbon Black Xbox Series X controller is now available for $49.99, but such a $10 discount is proving popular. We've already seen it run out of stock at Amazon, so Microsoft is your best place to be right now.",
    "If you're after something a little more colorful, the newer (and slightly more expensive) Pulse Red, Shock Blue, and Electric Volt colorways are dropping back down to their lowest recorded prices today. While a $5 discount at Amazon doesn't seem like much, we've never seen these gamepads go below the resulting $59 figure, and such savings only first appeared at the start of June.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Xbox controller deals in your region.",
    "While the Xbox Series X controller was originally launched for the next generation it is still compatible with older Xbox One systems as well as the Xbox Series S. Plus, you'll still be able to take advantage of the new Share button which makes taking screenshots and video clips quick and easy.",
    "The new controller also benefits from a hybrid d-pad inspired by the more premium version included on the Xbox Elite Controller 2, additional textures on trigger buttons and super fast, low latency connectivity with the Xbox Series X console as well.",
    "If you're still trying to find an Xbox Series X restock we're bringing you all the latest updates on store availability right here. Or, take a look at the latest Xbox Game Pass prices and cheap Xbox game deals for more accessories and discounts."
