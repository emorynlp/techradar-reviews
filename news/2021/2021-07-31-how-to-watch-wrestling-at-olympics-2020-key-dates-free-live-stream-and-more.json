    "Wrestling is considered the world's oldest sport, so it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s been a staple part of the Olympic Games since 708 BC. Follow our guide below as we explain how to watch an Olympics wrestling live stream wherever you are right now.",
    "The Greco-Roman style joined the Games at Athens in 1896, with freestyle wrestling introduced eight years later at the St. Louis Games. Women's freestyle also joined the program in 2004.",
    "The aim of both wrestling styles is simple: athletes must attempt to push both shoulders of their opponent down onto the mat, without using equipment or grabbing clothing. For all events, an elimination system will determine the two finalists for the gold medal match\u2014though all wrestlers who lose to a finalist are entitled to a second chance in the repechage.",
    "The Russian Federation currently holds the most medals with 172 in total, followed by the US (133), Japan (69), and Turkey (63). In Tokyo, 96 men and 96 women will compete in these events, but who will wrestle their way to gold? Tune in to watch wrestling at Olympics 2020 to find out\u2014below, we discuss how to live stream Olympics events along with some key 2021 dates you don\u2019t want to miss.",
    "The free, online Olympics Channel looks set to have highlights and other programming. But if you want more in-depth coverage, you'll need to look at domestic broadcasters. Those living in the UK have the benefit of the BBC's free-to-air coverage for example, with 350+ hours being made available for free on BBC iPlayer.",
    "It's a similar story in the likes of Australia (Channel 7 and the very thorough 7plus online), Ireland (RTE), France (TF1) and, Germany (ARD and ZDF). We have further information about worldwide Olympics streams below.",
    "You should be able to find an Olympic Games stream (whether paid or free) in whatever country you happen to be in. But you may find that: a) your usual domestic coverage is geo-blocked when overseas; or b) that your place of work or college has blocked the ability to watch online where you are.",
    "There's a really easy way to solve those issues, thankfully. By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer, phone or tablet into thinking that it's somewhere completely different. That way you can enjoy your usual coverage without having to find an illegal stream.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK or US, just head to BBC iPlayer or on the Peacock TV service respectively",
    "It won't come as a surprise that the Olympics is being shown in most corners of the globe - although with varying levels of coverage and without free broadcasters in some countries.",
    "If you're not in any of the countries mentioned above, then we'd suggest taking a look at the dedicated Wikipedia page of all of the world's Olympic Games channels."
