    "Capcom has released a new trailer for Resident Evil Village, giving us our first look at the game running on a last-generation console.",
    "The trailer, courtesy of IGN\u2019s First Look, shows around five minutes of Resident Evil Village gameplay footage on a PS4 Pro and, actually, it\u2019s looking pretty good. Up until now, we\u2019ve only seen footage of the game running on the latest hardware and you can see the new trailer for yourself below:",
    "This reveal comes after Capcom\u2019s surprise announcement earlier this year (via GamesRadar) that Resident Evil Village will be coming to PS4 and Xbox One as well as the previously confirmed Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC, with free next-gen upgrades within console families.",
    "Given it\u2019s been somewhat challenging to get a hold of the new PS5 and Xbox Series X thanks to stock shortages, a look at the game running on a last-generation console is likely going to be welcome for those who haven't been able to upgrade to the latest systems.",
    "It\u2019s hard to glean just how well the PS4 Pro version holds up against the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions from five minutes of trailer footage alone, and we\u2019d expect that more in-depth comparisons after the game\u2019s launch will highlight the biggest differences between the last and current-gen versions.",
    "Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that while the PS4 Pro is a last-gen console, it\u2019s still a hardware upgrade on the baseline PS4 and Xbox One consoles that many are likely to still be playing on, so we wouldn\u2019t say these visuals are what you should expect across the board on last-gen systems.",
    "There\u2019s really not long to wait until Resident Evil Village\u2019s release now \u2013 the game will launch on all systems on May 7 2021. Before then, though, we\u2019re expecting another showcase for the game in April, when a second demo is also expected to be detailed. An exact date for this showcase hasn\u2019t been revealed just yet but since it\u2019s already April we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have to wait too much longer for that."
