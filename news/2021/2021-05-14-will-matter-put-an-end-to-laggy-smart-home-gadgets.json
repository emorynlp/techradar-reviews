    "How often have you tried to add one of the best smart lights, smart plugs or other devices to your smart home, only to find that it doesn\u2019t work as seamlessly as you\u2019d hoped \u2013 such as not switching off with the rest of devices in a group?",
    "Laggy smart home automations are certainly one of the biggest challenges when it comes to smart homes, but a new standard designed to make smart home devices work seamlessly together could be the answer.",
    "Apple, Amazon, Google and SmartThings are just some of the 180 brands supporting Matter \u2013 an IP-based connectivity protocol that was initially started in 2019 under the moniker Project Connected Home over IP (CHIP) and is designed to standardize how smart home devices communicate and work together.",
    "Any smart home device that adheres to the protocol, which currently covers Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Thread smart home technology to connect to the internet, will be easier to set up too. Devices that support Matter can be added to a smart home by using a simple code rather than requiring several steps that differ depending upon the manufacturer of the device. The first Matter-compatible devices are expected to be made available in late 2021 and will also feature Matter branding on the packaging \u2013 making it clear the device is compatible with the standard.",
    "There\u2019s no denying smart home gadgets can make your life easier, whether it\u2019s ensuring your home is warm and cosy when you return from work, or being able to turn your lights or electrical appliances off if you forgot to do it before you left the house. But it\u2019s extremely frustrating when things don\u2019t work as they should. According to research by product support software firm iQor, 22% of consumers will refuse to use or return a connected device that has regular problems when it comes to working properly. So in our eyes, smart home standards that make devices work together seamlessly, is very welcome."
