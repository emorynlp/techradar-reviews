    "Shortly after the announcement that twenty Bethesda games are now available on Xbox Game Pass, it\u2019s been confirmed that five of these games will also receive a frame rate boost on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.",
    "Speaking to Larry Hryb, on the Official Xbox podcast, Xbox Comms manager Jeff Rubenstein said (as spotted by Wario64 on Twitter) that The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Special Edition, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Dishonored: Definitive Edition, and Prey will all benefit from FPS Boost, which means their frame rates could jump up to nearly 60 FPS.",
    "FPS Boost, announced by Xbox earlier this year, is part of a drive to help older games, as well as the latest games, benefit from the latest Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S hardware. Developed by the Xbox backwards compatibility team, FPS Boost \u201cemploys a variety of new methods for nearly doubling (and in a few instances, quadrupling) the original frame rate on select titles.\u201d",
    "Late last year, before FPS Boost was given a name, Xbox uploaded a backward compatibility frame rate technical demo in which Fallout 4 was shown going from 30FPS to 60FPS, giving a good idea of the difference this feature can make.",
    "It should be noted that FPS Boost on these games isn't available just yet and an exact date wasn\u2019t revealed during the podcast. When Microsoft does add this support, you\u2019ll have the option to toggle the feature on and off, if you ever feel like you might want to play them in their original state again.",
    "This is the latest announcement in what\u2019s been a big week for Microsoft and Bethesda, following the completion of Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks.",
    "The acquisition looks set to be a significant boost for Xbox Game Pass as during a \u201cBethesda Joins Xbox\u201d roundtable held on March 11, Phil Spencer leaned into future exclusivity, telling Xbox players, \u201cIf you\u2019re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists. That\u2019s our goal, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this, that\u2019s the root of this partnership that we\u2019re building.\u201d",
