    "Mild spoilers for season 5 of Rick and Morty follow.",
    "Successful science fiction comedies aren\u2019t quite as rare as some would have you believe. One thing pretty much all the good ones have in common, however, is plenty of brains to match the laughs \u2013 aim too low and you could find yourself taking a dip in a Hot Tub Time Machine.",
    "Like Red Dwarf and Futurama before it, Rick and Morty would still function as solid sci-fi if every one of the gags was surgically removed. Sure, at times the Adult Swim show wheels out some of the crudest, stupidest jokes on TV, but they\u2019re underpinned by at least as many grade-A, big ideas as you\u2019d encounter in Star Trek \u2013 even in the glory days of The Next Generation, when Jean-Luc Picard and his crew threw around high-concept technobabble as if the fate of the universe depended on it.",
    "Where many sci-fi series will base an entire episode around a single premise, many of Rick and Morty\u2019s half-hours feature A-, B- and even C-plots of awe-inspiring ingenuity. Indeed, it\u2019s so ideas intensive that it\u2019s easy to see why only 49 episodes have aired since the show\u2019s 2013 debut \u2013 an average of just seven stories a year.",
    "While the glacial release schedule is great for quality control, it makes it somewhat harder for a viewer to keep track of the show\u2019s continuity. From the beginning, Rick and Morty has followed an \u2018adventure-of-the-week\u2019 format, but as it\u2019s evolved, its backstory has become more and more complex, with supporting characters recurring, old plotlines revisited, and in-jokes more integral to the show\u2019s DNA.",
    "That\u2019s great when you\u2019re following the continuous narrative of a Game of Thrones or a Breaking Bad, but more challenging when every episode throws up a different story \u2013 like Doctor Who and The X-Files, Rick and Morty is a show caught in the crossfire between its continuity and self-contained stories.",
    "Rick and Morty brings an extra (albeit adventurous) complication into the mix by embracing multiverses, populated by numerous versions of all the lead characters. When told across a single episode, Rick and Morty\u2019s adventures through multiple timelines are ingenious and exhilarating, but when the plotlines stretch out across years, you start to need a crib sheet to keep up. (This could be a cautionary tale for Marvel, now that Loki has brought the multiverse into play.)",
    "Rick and Morty season 5, however, feels like a breath of fresh air because it\u2019s re-emphasized what the show does best \u2013 brilliant standalone adventures, and some of the best comedy writing on TV.",
    "Maybe that\u2019s because, nearly eight years into its run, the show is no longer the anarchic new kid on the block, meaning the creative team aren\u2019t feeling quite so much pressure to ride the wave of the zeitgeist. Or maybe the writers have simply been given a directive to have more fun.",
    "If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s one of the smartest moves the show has ever made. After all, classic season 3 episode \u2018Pickle Rick\u2019 isn\u2019t a fan favorite because it enhances the show\u2019s canon \u2013 it\u2019s loved because it\u2019s a weird, ingenious, hilarious piece of storytelling. It\u2019s an ethos that\u2019s been a guiding force in season 5, where Rick and Morty has captured the beats of a perfectly calibrated sci-fi sitcom in which everyone \u2013 yes, even Jerry \u2013 plays their part to perfection.",
    "The latest season has felt like a showreel of everything that makes Rick and Morty tick when it's firing on all cylinders. As well as introducing Mr Nimbus \u2013 a wonderfully bizarre, Aquaman-inspired ruler of the oceans \u2013 season opener \u2018Mort Dinner Rick Andre\u2019 treated us to a glorious subplot where a dimension-hopping journey to mature some wine turns Morty into the nemesis of an entire civilization \u2013 and sentences Jessica, the object of his affections, to eons as a prisoner on an alien world.",
    "Then, \u2018Mortiplicity\u2019 echoed season 2 classic \u2018Total Rickall\u2019 with its perfect execution of an ingenious premise, as Rick, Morty and the Smith family negotiate legions of increasingly weird decoy Sanchez/Smith families.",
    "We\u2019ve also been given spot-on-but-twisted spoofs of Captain Planet, Transformers, Voltron and Hellraiser along the way, with only the giant sperm plot of the icky \u2018Rickdependence Spray\u2019 feeling like a significant misstep. What a shame that the episode\u2019s giant incest baby \u2013 one of the show\u2019s crudest plotlines \u2013 should be the main recurring gag of the season.",
    "While it\u2019s been fun to catch up with the likes of Birdperson and Space Beth \u2013 and laugh at a casual reference to Pickle Rick \u2013 Rick and Morty season 5 has soared because because you haven\u2019t needed to be a superfan to enjoy it. Aside from rare exceptions like Arrested Development, TV comedy tends to work best when standalone plots take precedence over arc stories.",
    "If creating all-new characters and plotlines takes more time, then so be it. Rick and Morty has never been prolific, and there\u2019s no reason to break the habit of its lifetime \u2013 even if it means we have to wait a decade for all of the 70 episodes Adult Swim commissioned back in 2018 to make it to the screen.",
    "Rick and Morty airs on Adult Swim in the US, and on E4/All 4 in the UK. The two-part season 5 finale airs on September 5."
