    "More Google Pixel 5a details have been revealed via purported FCC filings, which mention three models and a few features we weren\u2019t sure would make it to Google\u2019s affordable phone.",
    "The Pixel 5a features? Sub-6GHz 5G, NFC, Bluetooth LE, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, according to Droid Life. Sadly, there\u2019s nothing too exciting to glean from the filings, but some of these features (notably 5G) weren\u2019t available in the standard Pixel 4a \u2013 so perhaps Google is committing to only releasing one model of its lauded mid-range phone, instead of both a 5G and a cheaper LTE-only version.",
    "The supposed FCC filings cover a trio of model numbers, two of which (G4S1M and GR0M2) have been seen before in a May report by Droid Life \u2013 but this is the first we\u2019re seeing them mentioned by the FCC. The other one, G1F8F, is new.",
    "G1F8F may be nearly identical, hardware-wise, to the others, according to a screenshot of the flings tweeted by @Cstark_27. The phone models seem to be identical side from some networking differences, like disabled CDMA and some enabled LTE bands:",
    "The new A4RG1F8F number does indeed show up in the FCC application database with around 60 entries, all submitted on April 26, though don\u2019t expect to unearth more interesting information than what\u2019s already been found.",
    "We\u2019re already well past Google IO 2021, which was the time of year the original Google Pixel 3a had launched. Last year\u2019s Google Pixel 4a was revealed in August 2020 after delays, and we\u2019re expecting the Pixel 5a to follow its lead with an August 2021 release \u2013 especially after multiple rumors supporting it.",
    "We\u2019ve heard enough about the phone to at least get an idea of what the Pixel 5a will feature: it could pack a Snapdragon 780G chipset (successor to the Google Pixel 4a 5G\u2019s Snapdragon 765 silicon), though it may also use the same chipset as its predecessor instead. As for its design, we\u2019re not expecting it to deviate much from the Pixel 4a\u2019s look and feel, according to early leaks and renders.",
    "With less than a month until the supposed Pixel 5a launch date, we hope to see and hear more about Google\u2019s next mid-range phone soon.",
