    "While everyone\u2019s eyes were on Samsung Unpacked, OnePlus coyly dropped its own tease of a phone we weren\u2019t sure existed, suggesting the OnePlus 9T might be coming this year after all.",
    "OnePlus tweeted an artsy image of a OnePlus 9 nestled in tea and, with the brand\u2019s signature cheeky humor, added \u201cDon't read too much into it.\u201d",
    "In any other year, this wouldn\u2019t be too surprising \u2013 around September or October, OnePlus typically releases a \u2018T\u2019 version of that year\u2019s flagship with a few refinements, so it\u2019s about time for a OnePlus 9T tease. Or it would be if a leak hadn\u2019t claimed the 9T might be canceled.",
    "The OnePlus 9T wouldn\u2019t be the first phone canceled in 2021 \u2013 a Samsung executive confirmed that the Samsung Note 21 wouldn\u2019t be coming out. While we didn\u2019t get an exact reason, Samsung CEO DJ Koh said earlier in the year that \u201cit could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year so it might be difficult to release Note model in 2H,\u201d suggesting the market would be too crowded with other Samsung flagships.",
    "There\u2019s also a question of the global chip shortage\u2019s impact on tech industries, which led to delays for last year\u2019s phones like the Google Pixel 4a and some of the iPhone 12 range and, rumor has it, pushed back the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE\u2019s release.",
    "In any case, the OnePlus 9T would be a welcome sight if it\u2019s released later in the year, suggesting to whatever degree that the smartphone industry is trucking on despite continued lockdowns and chip shortages. Of course, it\u2019s another question entirely how the 9T will land given the just-launched (and cheaper) Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 along with the upcoming Google Pixel 6 powered by its in-house Tensor chipset."
