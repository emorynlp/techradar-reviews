    "If you\u2019re looking to get your hands on the overclocking tool, you'll have to be extra careful right now. MSI has warned that the webpage has become the latest target of scammers, who are using the address 'afterburner-msi.space' to offer users a fake version of its overclocking software for download.",
    "The site was taken down after the web hosting provider was alerted and the domain name information shows that the site was live for almost one month.",
    "Clicking the link could have caused serious damage to your PC, as the fake webpage may have hosted software which could contain a virus, trojan, keylogger, or other type of malicious program that has been disguised to look like MSI Afterburner.",
    "\u201cMSI is informing the public of a malicious software being disguised as the official MSI Afterburner software,\u201d the company said .",
    "\u201cThe malicious software is being unlawfully hosted on a suspicious website impersonating as MSI\u2019s official website with the domain name [afterburner-msi DOT space]. MSI has no relation with this website or the aforementioned domain.\"",
