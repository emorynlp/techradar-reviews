    "Some recent job postings on Guerilla Games\u2019 website are sparking our imaginations that we could see some form of multiplayer coming to the Horizon world.",
    "The job posting for a senior social systems designer (spotted by VGC) mentions features that\u2019ll allow players to form \u201cguild-like groups\u201d to \u201cexplore the world together and design features and systems that promote health and fun experiences for our player community\u201d.",
    "The other job posting on the site is for a senior games writer that\u2019s looking for people who have extensive knowledge of stories and narrative design in open-world RPG games, online games, and MMORPGs.",
    "It\u2019s unclear whether these new job postings could be for Horizon or something totally different, like a new IP. But VGC previously reported that a co-op mode was originally planned for Horizon Zero Dawn, but to everyone\u2019s dismay, was scrapped so Guerilla Games could focus on other areas of the first game.",
    "Guerilla Games\u2019 next highly anticipated title, Horizon Forbidden West, arrives exclusively on PS4 and PS5 on February 18, 2022.",
    "In the last few years we\u2019ve gotten a number of fantastic single-player experiences on PS4 and, more recently, on PS5. Titles that come to mind are God of War from Santa Monica Studios, the Uncharted games from Naughty Dog, and the Horizon series from Guerilla Games.",
    "But, if these job postings are anything to go by, Sony might be chasing more multiplayer experiences from its developers.",
    "The recent Ghost of Tsushima: Legends is probably one the best free DLC\u2019s ever released, providing a fun-but-challenging multiplayer mode for Ghost of Tsushima owners. Just this week, Naughty Dog has confirmed they\u2019re working on a Last of Us 2 multiplayer project, delighting fans of the multiplayer mode from the first Last of Us game. The evidence suggests that developers are trying to put more multiplayer experiences in these traditionally single-player-only games.",
    "That said, we\u2019ll be looking forward to seeing what Guerilla Games has in store for gamers in the future, whether it\u2019ll be a multiplayer add-on, or a standalone multiplayer game. Either way, we\u2019re excited for it."
