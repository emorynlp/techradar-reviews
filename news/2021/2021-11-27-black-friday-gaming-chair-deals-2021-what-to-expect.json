    "Black Friday may have now come to a close, but the sales are still in full swing - even if most of the gaming chairs we've seen have been on sale all week. With so many deals live, however, finding the best gaming chair picks is no small feat \u2013 especially with fresh Cyber Monday deals waiting in the wings on November 29.",
    "Luckily for you, we've assembled a list of all of the best gaming chair deals that are still live for Black Friday 2021 to help you complete your PC battle station. From SecretLab to Razer and Corsair, we're tracking all of the best brands on this page.",
    "So far, most of the gaming chair deals we've seen offer savings in the tens, rather than hundreds of dollars and pounds, but there are a few standouts worth shouting about. We're seeing some good Black Friday deals still available when you shop directly at Secretlab and Anda Seat, with a handful of offers coming up across the web on other brands like Noblechairs and Razer as well as more budget-friendly options like AutoFull.",

    "If you're researching your prospective shopping list, it can be difficult to work out where to start. However, there are a number of features that you should be looking at to work out whether a gaming chair is right for you. From materials to seat size, there's plenty to work through here, but having a strong idea of what you want to get out of this year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday gaming chair deals will yield the best results.",
    "Working out exactly what you need from your new seat will help you find the best Black Friday gaming chair deal for you. That means researching the options available and keeping a list of features that you won't be able to live without as well as specs that you could drop for a significantly lower price point.",
    "That means considering the materials, adjustments, back style, additional cushions, height, weight allowance, and size of your perfect gaming chair and finding out what you can get for your cash today. From there, keeping an eye on prices in the lead-up to Black Friday gaming chair deals will be essential, as having this background knowledge will allow you to quickly spot a worthwhile deal once the pressure is on.",
    "Once you've found a deal, it's crucial to price check against other retailers. Things get pretty heated during the Black Friday weekend, and while bigger stores automatically price match their competitors, it's worth checking if you can find a cheaper price elsewhere or if other retailers are offering additional free gifts on top.",
    "The SecretLab Titan is almost always in the top 5 when it comes to picking the best gaming chair. It's not hard to see why. The racing seat-style design is far more subtle compared to other manufacturers so you can get away with using it as an office chair, too. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth with this one.",
    "The Corsair T3 Rush lacks that over-the-top gamer design that can put off many from a purchase. In fact, it basically looks like any other computer chair out there. It's certainly a more premium one, though, and that comes through in just how comfortable it is. That's all thanks to the breathable soft fabric exterior, memory foam lumbar support and extremely customizable backrest position.",
    "This is Razer's first foray into the world of gaming chairs we're suitably impressed with it. It shies away from the RGB lighting displays of its other gaming peripherals and instead focuses on delivering a high-quality gaming throne with a solid and comfortable build that rounds out your Razer-filled set-up quite nicely."
