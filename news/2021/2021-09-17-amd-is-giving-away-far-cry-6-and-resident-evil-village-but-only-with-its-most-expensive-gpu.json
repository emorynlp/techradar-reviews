  "article": [
    "AMD has expanded its offer to give away free copies of Far Cry 6 and Resident Evil Village to include its flagship GPU, the Radeon RX 6900 XT.",
    "Previously, this \u2018Raise the Game\u2019 bundle was only available to people who bought both a Ryzen CPU along with an RX 6000 GPU together in a qualifying system. However, now those buying just an AMD graphics card can grab both of these high-profile games for free, at least if they purchase an RX 6900 XT as mentioned.",
    "There is a slight caveat, namely that buyers of both a CPU and GPU also get a three-month trial of Xbox Game Pass, whereas that additional incentive doesn\u2019t apply with the 6900 XT offer. Just something to bear in mind.",
    "The bundle is now available with any RX 6900 XT card, including third-party or reference models, as Tom\u2019s Hardware reports, and the offer runs from now until December 31, 2021. It is, however, only available to buyers in the US and Western Europe at participating retailers.",
    "Those two games are great freebies, of course \u2013 well, Far Cry 6 isn\u2019t out just yet, but it\u2019s looking very promising for PC gamers when it emerges on October 7 \u2013 so it\u2019s good to see AMD extend this offer to the buyers of standalone graphics cards.",
    "That said, it's slightly disappointing that the only GPU which applies is the most expensive Big Navi product, as it\u2019s truly eye-wateringly expensive (a quick scan of online retailers indicates current pricing starting at around $1,700 in the US, or \u00a31,500 in the UK, for those models which are actually in stock, of course).",
    "It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that Far Cry 6 comes complete with a major boost from AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution, and according to the firm\u2019s own testing, frame rate leaps of over 40% are possible with FSR tech. Pretty cool indeed, and with the power of the 6900 XT, the game should run very impressively."
