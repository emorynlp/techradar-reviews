    "Part of Apple\u2019s global appeal has always been the sense of luxury generated by its minimalist stores \u2013 and the tech giant is about to open its most impressive to date.",
    "On May 27, Apple will open the doors to its first store in the centre of Rome, Apple Via del Corso, which reinvents the 19th-century Palazzo Marignoli to take customers back in time as they browse for the latest iPhone.",
    "The impressive new store sits on the city's most famous shopping street, and boasts an adjacent large garden courtyard lined with native Camphora trees. To be honest, the whole thing looks like something out of a James Bond set.",
    "To restore the integrity of the palace and maintain its original aesthetic, Apple worked with architects and local restoration teams to reimagine the entirety of the palazzo's two floors, which are connected by a grand marble staircase.",
    "Restored artworks line the walls and ceilings, and large glass windows mean the entire store is lit by natural light during the day. To enter, visitors will pass through a vaulted colonnade leading to the sprawling ground floor, while the central staircase \u2013 which is absolutely huge, by the way \u2013 leads up to a series of traditional palazzo rooms.",
    "And there\u2019s also a ballroom, obviously. Here, Apple will host Today at Apple sessions for the first time in Rome, inviting artists across the fields of music, art, design and content creation to events centered around creativity.",
    "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to begin a new chapter in Rome with the opening of Apple Via del Corso,\u201d said Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Retail. \u201cThe new store represents a celebration of the unique history and art of Roman culture.\u201d",
    "Apple\u2019s Via del Corso isn\u2019t the first time the company has impressed us with its eye for architectural design.",
    "Apple operates more than 500 retail stores in 25 countries, with each location generating more revenue per square foot than any other retailer (in the US, at least). Many of them are located in historic buildings, like the Palazzo Marignoli, which adds a unique sense of theater to customers\u2019 shopping experience.",
    "The tech giant reportedly paid $2.5 million to renovate space in New York's iconic Grand Central Terminal, for example, not to mention the company\u2019s flagship Berlin store, which sits inside a giant limestone opera house.",
    "The point being, Apple doesn\u2019t do low-key when it comes to its stores \u2013 and its latest Rome venture is no exception."
