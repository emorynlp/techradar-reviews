    "The new KB5005463 update doesn't mention PC Health Check in its title, but may upset some users who prefer to stay on Windows 10 until all the initial issues with Microsoft's new software are ironed out.",
    "Microsoft says that users are able to simply uninstall PC Health Check using the Windows Settings app, however some users have complained that this is trickier than it sounds - namly because the tool keeps being reinstalled whenever a subsequent Windows update is released.",
    "PC Health Check doesn't appear too intrusive an addition to a Windows 10 PC, but users may want to disable it if they don't want to be reminded about Windows 11 - for example, if they are using an admin-controlled work device.",
    "Microsoft does advise giving your computer a Windows 11 health check before updating to its newest operating system, which was released earlier this year following months of anticipation.",

Similarly, if your device runs on AMD\u2019s A-series and FX-series, along with Ryzen 1000 and most Ryzen 2000 processors, it will not be able to run Windows 11.",
