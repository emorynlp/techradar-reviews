    "If Pok\u00e9mon Go wasn\u2019t violent enough for you, The Witcher: Monster Slayer might be the next AR game you need. We don\u2019t have an official release date for the full game yet, but early access on Android is about to begin, with registration open now if you\u2019re after an invite.",
    "Registering for The Witcher: Monster Slayer can be done really easily on the game\u2019s official website. Click through and you\u2019ll be asked to give the email address for your Google account, your phone\u2019s brand, and its model. Unfortunately, if you\u2019re under 16 or are on iPhone you won\u2019t be able to take part, though we expect an iOS beta to come at some point.",
    "At the end of April, the first batch of players will be selected and given an invite, allowing them to roam the world, picking up quests and hunting iconic monsters from the Witcher series.",
    "Details have been a little scarce for this AR mobile game, but if you\u2019ve played the likes of Pok\u00e9mon Go, Minecraft Earth, or Harry Potter Wizards Unite, you\u2019ll have a vague idea of what to expect. Loading up The Witcher: Monster Slayer will show you a real-world map marked with digital monsters and quest-givers that you can tap on to interact with.",
    "Based on the gameplay video, you\u2019ll have to fight monsters using a sword, Witcher signs (spell-like attacks), and bombs. Quests look a bit more involved, requiring you to not just fight a monster but hunt it down by investigating different scenes.",
    "The gameplay trailer is seven months old, so it\u2019s possible some design changes have been made \u2013 though we\u2019ll know more when The Witcher: Monster Slayer begins its early access launch in the near future. If we\u2019re lucky enough to get an invite we\u2019ll be sure to share what we think of the game with you."
