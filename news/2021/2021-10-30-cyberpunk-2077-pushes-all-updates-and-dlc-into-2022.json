  "category": "gaming",

  "summary": "Updating the roadmap",
  "article": [
    "Cyberpunk 2077 appears to be facing further delays after an update to the game\u2019s post-launch roadmap shows that all \u201cupdates, improvements, and free DLCs\u201d can now be expected in 2022, rather than towards the end of 2021 as was originally shown.",
    "The updated roadmap, published in late October on the Cyberpunk 2077 website, shows that the release plan for 2021 now ends with Patch 1.31, which was released back in September of this year. The game\u2019s free next-gen update is scheduled for Q1 2022 and all other \u201cupdates, improvements, and free DLCs\u201d appear alongside that period and beyond.",
    "A specific reason for the change hasn\u2019t been given but it does come only a couple of weeks after CD Projekt Red announced that the game\u2019s next-gen upgrades for Xbox Series X and PS5 have been pushed to Q1 2022, alongside the next-gen upgrade for The Witcher 3 getting pushed to Q2 2022. These delays were implemented as a result of \u201crecommendations supplied by teams supervising both games\u201d and a desire to \u201cmake it right\u201d.",
    "With all of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s major updates and improvements now scheduled for 2022, there\u2019s a real sense that the studio is putting its head down for the rest of this year in preparation for a \"new year, new me, fresh start\" approach as we go into 2022.",
    "We\u2019re now approaching a year since Cyberpunk 2077 launched in December 2020 and given the difficulties around that launch and the many months that have followed, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that CD Projekt Red is looking to take its time and get this next stage of development just right. True next-gen releases, if they come out well, could go some way to breathing new life into the game on consoles and it\u2019s possible that, for the moment, the studio is prioritizing this long-term goal over more immediate free DLC and fixes.",
    "Delaying a game to make it right is generally the right approach, though part of the problem in Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s case is that the game is no stranger to delays and they didn\u2019t necessarily directly translate into a vastly improved experience for players, particularly on last-gen consoles. After multiple patches to improve its performance the game recently returned to the PlayStation Store but its listing still advises that \u201cPurchase for use on PS4 systems is not recommended\u201d.",
    "Still, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, 2020 and 2021 have hardly been the smoothest years for development studios and delays are common at the moment. CD Projekt Red\u2019s commitment to improving the game is reiterated in a Q&A under the updated roadmap, where the developer notes, \u201cOur plans for supporting Cyberpunk 2077 in the long-term are unchanged, and we will continue to introduce updates and patches to give all players across all consoles and PCs a better experience with the game.\u201d",
    "It looks like we\u2019ll have to wait until 2022 and the release of all the game\u2019s forthcoming improvements, DLC and next-gen updates before we get a better sense of what the future holds for Cyberpunk 2077."
