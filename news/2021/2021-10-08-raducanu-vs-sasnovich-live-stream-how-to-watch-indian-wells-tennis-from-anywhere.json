Read on as we explain how to watch a Raducanu vs Sasnovich live stream wherever you are right now - including a clever way to watch it absolutely FREE in the UK.",
    "Raducanu's incredible US Open triumph has propelled her to superstardom, and she's now a household name and the face of WTA tennis. The 18-year-old, now ranked 22nd in the world, is the only qualifier to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open Era.",
    "But that means she's also got a target on her back, and Sasnovich - the world No. 40 - will be keen to show people that she's not just here to make up the numbers.",
    "The most notable recent scalp on the 27-year-old Belarusian's books was Serena Williams at Wimbledon, when the American retired with an ankle injury, but there's nothing like a big-name opponent to make you raise your game.",
    "Read on for your guide to live stream Raducanu vs Sasnovich at Indian Wells from wherever you are in the world.",
    "If you're abroad during Indian Wells, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred tennis live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",

    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to Amazon Prime Video"
