  "summary": "Prices are double the MSRP according to a report, with \u2018nearly no hope\u2019 that they will fall",
  "article": [
    "The graphics card market continues to look like a very bleak place, with pricing creeping up (again) with Nvidia GPUs, and overall, would-be buyers are still looking at paying almost double the recommended price for a card \u2013 with any remaining hope of Black Friday deals fading rapidly as a result and upcoming Cyber Monday deals. However, we have just rounded up the best RTX 3080 laptop Black Friday deals that we've found so far.",
    "When we say a card, we mean a modern one, of course, so that\u2019s an RTX 3000 family GPU or an AMD 6000 series, although the newest models \u2013 namely the RX 6600 (and 6600 XT) plus RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti \u2013 aren\u2019t included in the figures as compiled regularly by 3D Center, based on major German retailers.",
    "The good news, such as it is, is that pricing on AMD graphics cards did actually ease slightly in the latest report issued for November (on November 21, to be precise), with Team Red\u2019s GPUs dipping from 201% over the recommended price to 190%, apparently due to improved shipping levels for the RX 6800 in Germany. Thanks to better availability of the 6800, the price on that particular AMD model has been drifting downwards.",
    "190% is still almost double, of course, but it is at least the first time we\u2019ve seen a drop in pricing going by 3D Center\u2019s figures since August 8, when both AMD and Nvidia cards embarked on an upward trajectory.",
    "As mentioned, the situation has just got even worse for Nvidia graphics cards, as the average price level crept up to 195% over MSRP compared to 188% at the end of October.",
    "So, while we\u2019ve seen a slight improvement over the last few weeks for AMD, pricing still remains almost double \u2013 195% and 190% of MSRP for Nvidia and AMD respectively \u2013 and given recent upward movement, it looks unlikely that the broad situation will change.",
    "Indeed, considering other swirling from the rumor mill \u2013 which as 3D Center points out, includes YouTube leaker Moore\u2019s Law is Dead claiming that Nvidia GPUs will see \u2018poor availability\u2019 towards the end of 2021 \u2013 and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s own admission that GPU stock shortages will last through until 2023, it\u2019s very much a vibe of doom with a couple of side orders of gloom.",
    "3D Center\u2019s conclusion is that \u201cthere is nearly no hope that the graphics card price situation will change any time soon\u201d in terms of this overpricing, and we\u2019ve got to say that we can\u2019t disagree with that assessment.",
    "At least the appearance of more RX 6800 cards is something of a bright spot on the rocky GPU landscape, but we suspect it\u2019s a blip running against the overall trend. Certainly the Nvidia side of the equation looks very wobbly, which is perhaps why Team Green is potentially planning to rerelease the RTX 2060, that old Turing workhorse \u2013 but with double the VRAM \u2013 to at least give an option to punters looking for something solid enough for 1080p duties.",
    "It\u2019s better than nothing, for sure, but with Black Friday imminent, the hopes of getting a good deal on an Nvidia graphics card now look even more against the odds, sadly. We may just see the odd cutting-edge GPU which is close to MSRP, or maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 a little under it, but the chances are that any such offers will be extremely scarce. After all, there\u2019s just no incentive to engage in any real price cutting, as GPUs are flying off the shelves even with high price tags, because demand is so far outstripping supply.",
    "And certainly with more popular models like the RTX 3080, the chances seem vanishingly slim, particularly given this latest report. Naturally, whatever price cuts do manifest themselves, we\u2019ll keep you apprised of any graphics card bargains in our roundup of the best Black Friday deals.",
    "And as we\u2019ve argued before, what we might see are some compelling bundle deals involving GPUs which could work out as good value if you need all the included hardware, and indeed buying a whole new PC \u2013 assuming you need one \u2013 could also be a passable route to grabbing yourself a decent value top-end graphics card.",
