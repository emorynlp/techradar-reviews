    "Update: After contacting Apple, we heard back from the company that these important Siri features will be reinstated with the iOS 15.2 update, which is great news.",
    "Original story follows...",
    "Apple is still yet to reinstate functionality which was removed in iOS 15, where Siri could perform various tasks such as checking and playing voicemails.",
    "The commands in question are valuable on the accessibility front, with the visually impaired or legally blind \u2013 or indeed other Apple device owners \u2013 are able to use them to keep on top of their voicemail as mentioned, or to instruct Siri to send an email, check recent calls, or call history.",
    "MacRumors highlighted the functionality which went missing back in September, just after iOS 15 was released, and the site reminds us that these features haven\u2019t been restored to Siri, despite growing complaints around this.",
    "One reader told MacRumors: \u201cFor many fully blind people (like my blind mom) this makes their phone almost unusable, because they can\u2019t ask Siri who has called, and they can\u2019t ask Siri if they have voicemail. (Their official \u2018workaround\u2019 for voicemail, in fact, is calling the old-school carrier voicemail number, to check your voicemail over the phone.)\u201d",
    "Another message on Apple\u2019s support forum reads: \u201cMy cousin who is legally blind is also experiencing this issue. He uses the read missed call and open voicemail when doctors call and leave messages. It allows him the opportunity to hear who called and he can call back. It has been a wonderful feature for him and I\u2019m hoping that a fix will happen so that he can be able to use the feature again.\u201d",
    "There are also complaints on Reddit like this: \u201cMy dad is blind and uses Siri to operate a lot of his iPhone. This week we\u2019ve noticed when he asks Siri to play voicemail or missed calls she says she can\u2019t help with that.\u201d",
    "We've reached out to Apple for comment and will update this story once we hear back.",
    "It\u2019s unclear whether Apple intentionally removed the support for these features with iOS 15 \u2013 and if so, why that was done \u2013 or if it\u2019s wrapped up in some bug \u2013 and if it\u2019s the latter, whether a fix is coming soon. But whatever the case, this represents a worrying step backwards in terms of accessibility for iOS devices, to say the least.",
    "While Apple itself hasn\u2019t commented directly, as MacRumors notes \u2013 we\u2019ve also reached out to the company to try and ascertain what\u2019s going on here, and will update this story if we hear back \u2013 one message on the Apple help forum claims to have had a reply from the Accessibility Support team. They were advised to again contact Accessibility Support and \u201chave your Apple ID added to the official engineering issue as an \u2018affected user\u2019 so that you receive the mass emails about the status of this fix\u201d.",
    "Further advice was to submit feedback on the missing features, as the more of that feedback which is gathered \u201cdoes affect engineering\u2019s prioritization of this issue\u201d.",
    "There may be hope yet, then, for some kind of return of these capabilities to Siri in the near future. Fingers crossed."
