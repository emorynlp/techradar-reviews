    "Spoilers for the first three episodes of Loki follow. Watch them first before reading this.",
    "With the vast majority of the story set on the alien world of Lamentis-1, \u2018Lamentis\u2019 is an entirely reasonable title for this third instalment of Loki. Even so, you can\u2019t escape the feeling that \u2018When Loki Met Loki\u2026\u2019 would have worked much, much better.",
    "After the exposition-heavy season opener and the detective show homage of episode 2, Loki shapeshifts once more with a two-hander between the god of mischief and the female Variant who\u2019s been wreaking havoc across the space-time continuum. Having gone to all the effort of establishing Agent Mobius, Hunter B-15 and the rest of the Time Variance Authority, it\u2019s surprising that the Loki TV show should choose to give them a week off so soon, but it\u2019s a decision that makes sense for the wider story.",
    "Seeing Loki verbally spar with this alternative version of himself is something we\u2019ve been desperate to see since he followed her into a portal in that Roxxcart supermarket \u2013 and besides, it\u2019s not as if the TVA is short of things to do in the wake of the Variant\u2019s massive temporal incursions last week.",
    "Of course, with all those time agents on her tail, TVA headquarters should be the last place on the Variant\u2019s travel itinerary, but \u2013 even though the nuts and bolts of her grand plan remain a mystery \u2013 an audience with the elusive Time-Keepers is clearly top of her agenda. It doesn\u2019t take her long to give a compelling response to Mobius\u2019s ongoing quest to identify the best Loki. Mere seconds after realizing her magic doesn\u2019t work in those dingy beige corridors, she\u2019s grabbing TVA weapons and vaporising Minutemen with a ruthless efficiency the original Loki is yet to match. In fact, it\u2019s almost disappointing when Loki whisks the duo off to another world before the Variant gets to scrap with Ravonna Renslayer \u2013 everything we\u2019ve seen so far suggests it could be a true clash of the titans.",
    "As soon as Loki and the Variant \u2013 or Sylvie as she now prefers to be known \u2013 materialize on Lamentis-1, however, they really are on their own. The episode\u2019s plot couldn\u2019t be simpler, as the two Lokis realize they\u2019ll have to overcome their trust issues and work together to reactivate the TVA TemPad that can transport them home \u2013 before the moon is destroyed in an apocalypse that, history claims, nobody escapes alive.",
    "We\u2019ve got used to MCU TV shows jumping between multiple character arcs, but this episode never loses focus on its two leads. Although it features epic moon-scapes, some beautifully choreographed fight scenes and a clock ticking towards an impending armageddon, all the fireworks come in the talkier scenes \u2013 Loki even conjures up some magical fireworks to illustrate the point. If Marvel did intimate character pieces, they\u2019d probably look something like this.",
    "Sophia di Martino\u2019s Sylvie has had less than an hour of screentime so far, yet she\u2019s already starting to feel as integral to the Loki TV show as the (original) title character. She\u2019s charismatic, funny and always ready with a withering put-down, but crucially she never tries to be a caricature of Tom Hiddleston. Indeed, she\u2019s anything but a \u201cfaded photocopy\u201d of her more famous counterpart, even if they have rather more in common than they\u2019d probably care to admit. They\u2019re like a pair of squabbling siblings who just happen to have magical powers \u2013 for all their differences there\u2019s no denying they work well together, their contrasting tactics complementing each other magnificently.",
    "While \u2018Lamentis\u2019 only teases Sylvie\u2019s past \u2013 Loki points out that he\u2019s revealed much more about himself than vice versa \u2013 the hints at where their backstories have diverged are intriguing. Could it be that Loki\u2019s life of privilege has softened him, his partying existence ensuring that he\u2019s no longer a \u201cserious man\u201d? It seems reasonable to assume that a harder life could have sent her on a path where brute force is preferential to diplomacy. The fact that Sylvie barely knew her mother could also be pivotal.",
    "The question is, can they trust each other? Loki clearly wants to believe they\u2019re allies, but it\u2019s just as likely this is a marriage of convenience for Sylvie. Her motives remain ambiguous and, at this point, the jury\u2019s out on whether taking down the \u201comniscient fascists\u201d of the TVA is a good or a bad thing \u2013 especially as the Authority is seemingly conscripting its workforce from history.",
    "With the \u201cark\u201d that would have been their last route off Lamentis now destroyed, the episode ends on something of a downer, but things may not be quite as bad as they seem. Considering the episode goes to such lengths to explain how Sylvie\u2019s powers of enchantment work \u2013 including a flashback to Hunter C-20\u2019s margarita-fuelled interrogation \u2013 it\u2019s strange that we don\u2019t see her demonstrating more mind control in the episode.",
    "Unless, of course, the whole jaunt to Lamentis is just an illusion created by Sylvie to extract some useful information from Loki\u2019s mind. We\u2019ll have to wait until next week to find out if this episode is canon, or simply an expertly constructed figment of Sylvie\u2019s imagination\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "Like the constantly morphing letters of the show\u2019s titles, Loki remains impossible to pin down \u2013 and is all the better for it. With its brilliantly jarring mix of planetary apocalypse and two people cautiously getting to know each other, \u2018Lamentis\u2019 is simultaneously bigger and smaller than its predecessors \u2013 a character-driven stage play set against an epic sci-fi backdrop.",
    "But most importantly, the episode establishes Sophia Di Martino\u2019s Loki Variant as a key player in the MCU. Just as the original Loki stole the first Thor movie from under the nose of his hammer-wielding brother, Sylvie almost threatens to do the same here, as the pair\u2019s wonderful chemistry ensures a talk-driven episode never gets boring.",
    "Who\u2019s the best Loki? It looks like Agent Mobius will have to wait to find out\u2026",
    "New episodes of Loki debut on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
