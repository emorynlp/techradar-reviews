    "Valve\u2019s Steam Controller was a quirky device that tried to combine the accuracy of a mouse with the functionality of a traditional game controller. And while it never really achieved that lofty goal, the studio behind Half-Life: Alyx probably didn\u2019t predict that the Steam Controller would cost them $4 million in damages.",
    "Valve has been ordered to pay the princely sum to SCUF Gaming (thanks, VGC), after a jury found it had infringed a patent related to the Steam Controller\u2019s clickable back paddles. The patent for controller paddles (or back buttons as they\u2019re also called) belongs to SCUF parent company Ironburg Inventions, who said that \u201cValve did know that its conduct involved an unreasonable risk of infringement, but it simply proceeded to infringe anyway.\u201d",
    "Ironburg said it had previously warned Valve that it would be infringing its patent in 2014, when the first prototype of the Steam Controller was shown at CES. However, those warnings were not heeded.",
    "Speaking to a jury last week (via Law 360), Ironburg\u2019s lawyer said that \u201cValve\u2019s intentional disregard of its infringement is at the heart of this case\u201d and went on to compare Valve\u2019s actions with \u201cthe classic David and Goliath story: Goliath does what Goliath wants to do\u201d.",
    "US District Judge Thomas Zilly agreed with Ironburg Inventions, and found that all seven of its claims were infringed upon by Valve. Valve\u2019s defense was that the Steam Controller\u2019s paddles were demonstrably different from those patented by Ironburg, however, this was deemed not to be the case.",
    "If you\u2019re wondering how Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 hasn\u2019t fallen foul of the same judgment from the courts, well, it\u2019s because Microsoft licensed the patent from Ironburg Inventions. It\u2019s likely that Sony\u2019s DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment does the same.",
    "The Steam Controller was one of the first controllers to use haptic feedback, which could simulate the feel of spinning a trackball. The technology has since been adopted by both Nintendo and Sony in the Joy-Con and DualSense controller, but its functionality focuses more on simulating onscreen effects like rainfall or footsteps.",
    "Valve\u2019s Steam Controller was initially marketed alongside Steam Machines, and was supposed to help bridge the problem of needing a mouse when using a PC in the living room. While the Steam Machines were quickly discontinued due to a lack of interest, the Steam Controller managed to last four years until it was discontinued in 2019."
