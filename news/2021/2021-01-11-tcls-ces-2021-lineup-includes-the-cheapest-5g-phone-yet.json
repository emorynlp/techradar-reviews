    "TCL made a splash when it debuted a trio of phones at last year's CES 2020 \u2013 the first it released under its own brand, with surprisingly good specs and value for a first effort. Now, it\u2019s following up with two new handsets at CES 2021, including one of the cheapest 5G handsets we\u2019ve seen.",
    "The TCL 20 5G packs mid-range specs at a budget price, opting for a little less power than its TCL 10 5G predecessor in order to come in notably cheaper, and the new phone is one of the cheapest 5G-capable devices on the market. It packs a 6.67-inch LCD Full HD display, Snapdragon 695G chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 4,500mAh battery, and a triple rear camera (48MP main, ultra-wide, and depth sensor).",
    "The TCL 20 SE is 4G LTE-only, but specs-wise, it\u2019s a contender for our best cheap smartphones list if it works well. It has a 5,000mAh battery with reverse charging and quad speakers.",
    "This is only part of an expected five phones TCL will announce in the weeks to come that will make up some (but perhaps not all) of the brand\u2019s 2021 mobile device lineup.",
    "Last year, TCL announced three phones at CES 2020 and trickled out more over the following months for a total of seven by year\u2019s end \u2013 not an outrageous number (Samsung released six flagships and ten A-series mid-range and budget phones, for instance), but a lot for the brand\u2019s first year. We could see more come out later in 2021.",
    "We've yet to hear price or release date information for either the TCL 20 5G or the TCL 20 SE, but the company has confirmed to us the phones will be available in the UK and US.",
    "TCL is known for its TVs, and it\u2019s certainly announcing its latest 5-series and 6-series models to come out in 2021. But on the mobile side, it\u2019s expanding on its breakout year\u2019s lineup with plenty of new devices \u2013 and more than just phones.",
    "TCL has three tablets it\u2019s introducing, including the affordable TCL 5G tablet, one of the first 5G-connecting tablets on the market. Also in the mix is the TCL NXTPAPER tablet, which uses the titular technology introduced in September to deliver an electronic paper-like color display with longer battery life that\u2019s easier on the eyes; though it\u2019s not backlit and requires environmental lighting to see in low-lit areas, TCL is including a light in the box. Finally, the TCL Tab 10s is an affordable refinement of its existing Tab 10 slate in both WiFi-only and 4G LTE models.",
    "TCL, known for its high-quality displays, is also introducing a product without a screen: the Move PetTracker, a GPS tracker with fun and flexible cases and a 14-day battery life. While it can track anything, it\u2019s mainly aimed at consumers who want to monitor and geofence their pets.",
    "Finally, TCL touched on a couple devices that aren\u2019t ready for the market but, they assured TechRadar, are still in development. The first is the TCL Rollable, a rollable phone we\u2019ve been hearing rumors about, which TCL expects will be a more consumer-friendly format than foldable phones, given how much easier it is to stretch out a screen than fold it in half. While we didn't hear about it at TCL's CES presentation on Monday, sources told CNET that the Rollable we know \u2013 which extends from the sides \u2013 is nearly market-ready and could arrive this year.",
    "This being CES, TCL had other rollable device concepts it did show off during a presentation \u2013 including the vertically-extending phone above. The tech is still in its early stages: they have the rolling screen working, but not in a market-ready slim phone format, as this tweeted footage of a CES 2021 floor model shows.",
    "TCL also showed off a larger 17-inch 'Printed Flexible OLED Scrolling Display' concept that unfurled like a scroll \u2013 and yes, there was an official tweet of a floor model showing off this tech, too, though it's also not ready for market.",
    "The last concept TCL confirmed was still in the works, Project Archery, are VR glasses that deliberately don\u2019t close off peripheral vision in order to decrease discombobulating motion sickness \u2013 and allow them to be less clunky than encompassing headsets. TCL thinks these will be well-suited for the couch or the commute \u2013 though we\u2019ll have to see if Project Archery ever gets its full release."
