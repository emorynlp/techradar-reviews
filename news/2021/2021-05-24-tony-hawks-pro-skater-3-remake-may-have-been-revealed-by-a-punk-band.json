    "If you were hoping that Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1+2 would be the start of a revival for the series, then you just might be in luck, as a potential third entry in the rebooted skateboarding franchise may have just been leaked by an unlikely source.",
    "Reported by VGC, CKY drummer Jess Margera may have alluded to the next game in the long-running Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater franchise. Appearing on the Behind Closed Doors podcast, Margera vaguely alluded to CKY\u2019s music being featured on \u201cthe new one coming out too.\u201d",
    "While Margera\u2019s phrasing certainly isn\u2019t confirmation of anything, it\u2019s worth noting that CKY did have a song featured on 2001\u2019s Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3. Following that logic, it\u2019s possible that Activision Blizzard might want to keep the incredible reception of Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1+2 going with a remake of the much-loved third entry in the skateboarding series.",
    "Released in 2020, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1+2 completely reimagined the PS1 classics from the ground up. Developed by Vicarious Visions, the team painstakingly recreated Neversoft\u2019s (the original games\u2019 development team) physics engine to allow the remakes to feel as faithful as possible. And it paid off, as THPS 1+2 garnered universal acclaim upon release.",
    "The question remains as to who would be developing a prospective Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 remake, if one is indeed on the way. Vicarious Visions, developer of the recent Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater remakes, has since been reworked into a Blizzard support studio.",
    "Not to mention that according to insiders, most development studios at Activision Blizzard are now working on the Call of Duty franchise. That includes Toys for Bob, developers of the fantastic Crash Bandicoot 4 and 2018\u2019s Spyro Reignited Trilogy."
