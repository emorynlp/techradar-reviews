  "article": [
    "Nvidia has pushed out a fresh version of GeForce Experience which comes with support for the new \u2018WhisperMode\u2019 that allows laptops equipped with Nvidia\u2019s latest Ampere-based mobile GPUs to run as quietly as you want them (or at least more quietly).",
    "GeForce Experience version 3.21 brings in WhisperMode 2.0, which gives owners of gaming notebooks with GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards the ability to alter the noise level that their portable makes.",
    "Nvidia observes that you can \u201cpick your desired acoustic level\u201d, and that the new mode\u2019s AI-driven algorithms will then manage the GPU along with CPU and overall system temperatures to ensure that a certain fan speed (ie noise level) can be achieved.",
    "Naturally, that could mean if you want quieter running that performance is reined in, but at any rate, it\u2019s pretty cool (pun not intended) to get the choice, and Nvidia promises to \u201cdeliver great acoustics and the best possible performance\u201d.",
    "If you missed the launch of Nvidia\u2019s new mobile GPUs back at CES 2021, we can quickly get you up to speed with exactly how the new RTX 3000 laptop cards stack up in comparison to their desktop siblings.",
    "So, what else is new with this update for GeForce Experience? As you might expect, Nvidia has provided a bunch of optimal settings for new games \u2013 58 of them in total \u2013 and that includes Cyberpunk 2077 and FIFA 21.",
    "Nvidia has also added Freestyle and Ansel support for some 38 games with the latest Game Ready Driver, which again includes Cyberpunk 2077 and FIFA 21, as well as Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla and Call of Duty: Black Ops \u2013 Cold War.",
    "There are some bug fixes here too, including a solve for an issue whereby ShadowPlay videos looked darker on YouTube, and a cure for a gremlin which meant that screen grabs weren\u2019t being successfully captured with some DX12 games. Plus there are some security updates thrown in for good measure, which never hurts.",
