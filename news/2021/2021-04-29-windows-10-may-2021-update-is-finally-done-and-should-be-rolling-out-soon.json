  "category": "computing",
  "updated": "2021-04-29T10:30:15Z",

  "summary": "21H1 is just a minor update, though, like the one before it",
  "article": [
    "Windows 10\u2019s next (imminent) feature update has officially been christened as the May 2021 Update, and is almost ready to begin rolling out.",
    "We knew that the 21H1 update, as it has been previously known, would be coming very soon, so this is no great surprise \u2013 and the first big update of the year landing in May is pretty commonplace (we\u2019ve had a \u2018May Update\u2019 for the last two years running).",
    "Microsoft announced that it believes that build 19043.928 is the final version \u2013 barring any last-minute hiccups \u2013 and that it is now preparing the Windows 10 May 2021 Update to be unleashed on the public at some point next month.",
    "The software giant noted that the May 2021 Update will first be pushed out to testers in the Release Preview channel, although these folks will need to search for and select the download under Windows Update (it\u2019ll need to be manual triggered, in other words, and won\u2019t automatically come to their PC).",
    "As you are likely aware, the May 2021 Update is just a minor upgrade, and it\u2019s the second time in a row that Microsoft has run with one of these (in an unprecedented move).",
    "Even as a minor update, it will bring some changes to Windows 10, naturally, and they include improving Windows Hello with multi-camera support and some security tweaks. However, there\u2019s not a huge amount of stuff here, and nothing really all that interesting for the average user.",
    "A previous rumor indicated that the May 2021 Update would be finished in April, and rolled out in May, and this has proved to be bang on the money (well, barring any last gasp disasters as mentioned)."
