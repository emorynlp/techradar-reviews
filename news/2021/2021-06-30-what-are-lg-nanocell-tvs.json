    "What are LG NanoCell TVs? You might be familiar with LG\u2019s OLED TV range \u2013 the LG C1, LG G1, and more. But the NanoCell televisions that sit alongside them often get less headline attention, and we want to fix that.",
    "These so-called \u2018NanoCell\u2019 screens make up LG\u2019s mid-range and upper entry-level LCD TVs \u2013 the best LG TVs that don\u2019t feature OLED panels, basically. The unspoken aim here is to offer an alternative to Samsung\u2019s excellent QLED TVs, while designating the top tier of LG\u2019s LCD panel televisions.",
    "Recently, LG\u2019s Mini LED TV range of 'QNED' screens has started to roll out worldwide. This brings the company's exciting new combination of NanoCell LCD and Mini LED backlighting to the world for the first time.",
    "But what is LG NanoCell TV tech? How does it compare to Samsung QLED? And should you consider buying an LG NanoCell TV? Read on for everything you need to know below.",
    "Fewer local dimming zones mean you\u2019ll see blooming around bright objects. It will be particularly noticeable if you watch a film with subtitles, to the extent you\u2019ll probably want to turn the feature off when watching foreign language movies.",
    "These contrast issues are why the most attractive LG TVs with NanoCell are not its \u2018NANO\u2019 TVs at all, but its new-for-2021 QNED screens. This range combines a NanoCell layer with a Quantum Dot color enhancer and miniLED panel.",
    "Mini LED panel tech is the most interesting thing to happen to LCD TVs in some time. It sees the LEDs in the backlight shrink, so that many, many more can fit into the display.",
    "LG says the top-end 86-inch QNED set will have around 30,000 backlight LEDs, split into a little under 2500 zones. That\u2019s close to 80 times more zones than the LG NANO90.",
    "However, don\u2019t name your TV fund \u2018QNED\u2019 just yet. These sets are likely to use IPS panels still, and we don\u2019t know quite how effective a massively increased number of dimming zones will be at improving this panel technology\u2019s limited contrast.",
