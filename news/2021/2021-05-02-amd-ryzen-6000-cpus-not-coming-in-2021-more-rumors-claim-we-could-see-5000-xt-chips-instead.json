  "article": [
    "Earlier this week, we heard a rumor that Ryzen 6000 processors based on Zen 3+ won\u2019t be coming in 2021, and there\u2019s now been a further flurry of speculation that AMD will instead be relying on Ryzen 5000 XT CPUs to provide buyers with new options later this year.",
    "The original source for this that we reported on was YouTube leaker RedGamingTech, but now a whole bunch of folks seem to be on board the rumor bandwagon in this case, including fellow YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, who highlighted some other rumors on Twitter, as did Wccftech which spotted all this, including the following tweet from ExecutableFix.",
    "The gist of all this recent spinning from the rumor mill is that Ryzen 6000 CPUs codenamed \u2018Warhol\u2019, based on Zen 3+ (a refinement of the current Zen 3 architecture for Ryzen 5000 processors), have disappeared off AMD\u2019s recent roadmap for 2021, and no one is hearing about them anymore \u2013 so the theory is they\u2019ve been canceled. Instead, Ryzen 6000 is supposedly now arriving in 2022 as Zen 4 chips.",
    "Remember that it is just a theory, and even the rumor mill underlines this, but what the fresh speculation does is point to an alternative, in that rather than leaving a big hole in Team Red\u2019s line-up for 2021, AMD is planning on releasing 5000 XT versions of current processors (which as you\u2019ll no doubt recall, has been done before with XT chips for the Ryzen 3000 range).",
    "Moore\u2019s Law is Dead further points out the possibility that in fact, \u2018Warhol\u2019 may refer solely to next-gen APUs built on an enhanced version of Zen 3 (not Zen 3+), stating that several of his sources at AMD have said that they haven\u2019t heard a Zen 3+ refresh for Ryzen desktop CPUs is in the cards at all (and indeed running with Zen 3+ was never actually AMD\u2019s plan, anyway).",
    "There are somewhat mixed messages around the rumors about Zen 3+, then, but the overall gist is that it doesn\u2019t seem likely there will be a Zen 3+ refresh in the form of Ryzen 6000 this year, and instead we\u2019ll get Ryzen 5000 XT models \u2013 still a refresh, but a more minor one.",
    "That said, the previous rumor indicated that the gains from Zen 3+ weren\u2019t huge anyway (but still obviously more than an XT refresh would be).",
    "According to Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, we may also still see \u2018Warhol\u2019 emerge in the form of a new APU, but he sounds pretty doubtful about that, even, and as ExectuableFix points out in the above tweet, AMD \u2018Phoenix\u2019 \u2013 Ryzen 7000 APUs (Zen 4) \u2013 have already been spotted in other rumors, with no sign of \u2018Warhol\u2019 now."
