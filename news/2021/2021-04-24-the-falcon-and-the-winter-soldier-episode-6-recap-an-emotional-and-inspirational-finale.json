    "Spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follow.",
    "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s title may have been misleading.",
    "Despite all the efforts made to ensure Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes were equal players \u2013 even going as far as swapping around who gets first billing in the closing credits every week \u2013 this series finale leaves you in little doubt where the show\u2019s focus lies.",
    "With Bucky\u2019s journey to redemption largely sidelined \u2013 and somewhat over-simplified \u2013 it becomes clear the show was an origin story for the new Captain America all along. In fact, the series\u2019 biggest legacy is elevating a popular supporting Avenger into one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s most important heroes.",
    "From day one, the key themes of the series have been the importance of symbols, and what people do when presented with a platform to make a difference. It\u2019s appropriate, then, that Marvel Studios \u2013 creator of the most lucrative movie franchise in history \u2013 should use their own position of strength to deal with some serious real-world issues.",
    "From the moment Sam Wilson swoops into action in his new-look Captain America uniform \u2013 it was worth waiting to find out what was in that Wakandan case, after all \u2013 it\u2019s an episode packed with punch-the-air moments. And even though its messages sometimes lack dramatic subtlety \u2013 such as Sam carrying Karli\u2019s body, his wings spread like an angel \u2013 there\u2019s no denying that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier isn\u2019t just a superhero action show. Marvel\u2019s latest offering has become important TV.",
    "Sam Wilson may not be Earth\u2019s mightiest \u2013 no Super-Soldier Serum is running through his veins \u2013 but he makes the most of everything he has in his arsenal. A weaponized shield mixed with a state-of-the-art flying suit \u2013 not to mention a friendly drone sidekick \u2013 make for a powerful combination. As he swoops through New York with new-found purpose, it\u2019s easy to see why the assembled crowds are giving him such a rousing ovation.",
    "Yet Sam\u2019s real trump cards are a sense of decency and the courage to say the right thing. Even the noble Steve Rogers would struggle to make a speech with enough power to sway a bunch of politicians eager to return the world to the pre-Blip status quo. In a franchise where superheroes are frequently blamed for breaking things \u2013 see Captain America: Civil War, WandaVision \u2013 it\u2019s refreshing to see a hero raising some uncomfortable truths, while also trying to bring people together with words, not action. In fact, Anthony Mackie\u2019s performance is so convincing that it\u2019s a shame he\u2019s saddled with the occasional clunker of dialogue, such as a tired clich\u00e9 about French terrorist Batroc eating baguettes and French fries.",
    "If there\u2019s a downside to the increased focus on Sam Wilson it\u2019s that the other characters are generally underserved. John Walker\u2019s appearance as the self-appointed alternative Cap fails to deliver on the threat suggested by last week\u2019s mid-credits tease, and his (partial?) redemption never feels earned. Sharon Carter, meanwhile, has an uncanny knack of popping up exactly where she\u2019s needed. And in a franchise where we\u2019ve learned to expect the unexpected, the confirmation that she\u2019s the Power Broker is way too obvious to be anything but disappointing.",
    "Even the Winter Soldier is relegated to the shadows. While the character is probably happy to keep things that way, it feels unsatisfactory in a show that bears his name. Bucky Barnes is one of the most tragic characters in the MCU, a good man forced to do terrible things against his will. On many occasions the show\u2019s alluded to the fact his HYDRA past has left deep emotional scars, but his journey to redemption feels like an afterthought. Is sending his notebook to his psychiatrist with all the names crossed out enough to stop the nightmares? It all seems a little too neat.",
    "But the prize for the least satisfying story arc goes to Karli Morgenthau. Having started out as a genuinely complex antagonist, she completes her descent into one-dimensional zealot territory in \u2018One World, One People\u2019. Where Karli\u2019s egalitarian motives once made her sympathetic, her \u2018at all costs\u2019 mentality \u2013 setting fire to vans of hostages, not caring who lives or dies \u2013 ensures she\u2019s just another clich\u00e9d MCU villain. Her one-way journey to the dark side also pushes the credulity of Sam\u2019s refusal to fight back against her. Surely even an idealist like him must reach a point where the benefit of the doubt is no longer a given?",
    "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s failure to give all its characters satisfactory arcs has arguably been its biggest failing. Its extra storytelling time should be a point of difference with the MCU\u2019s movies, but where WandaVision fully embraced its TV format to make something that would never have worked on the big screen, the latest show feels more like a six-part movie with intermissions \u2013 indeed, from a narrative point of view, the two final episodes would have worked much better watched in one go.",
    "That said, this episode\u2019s action sequence \u2013 particularly Sam\u2019s aerobatics \u2013 prove once again that the most spectacular set-pieces are no longer confined to the big screen. When TV is delivering superhero spectacle like this, theater owners must have legitimate concerns about whether audiences will come back as Covid-19 restrictions relax.",
    "The positive for cinemas is that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier leaves the MCU in such a good place, with the Power Broker and Valentina Allegra de Fontaine pulling strings behind the scenes, and the sense that the world might be moving on from the \u2018Blip\u2019. Who would have believed when John Walker stood over a dead Flag Smasher that the show could have such an unashamedly happy ending? Now we know for sure that the shield \u2013 or, more importantly, the person who wields it \u2013 is important after all.",
    "Verdict:",
    "While it\u2019s disappointing to see Bucky Barnes relegated to the status of supporting player, Sam Wilson\u2019s epic debut as Captain America makes sure you barely notice. As superhero origin stories go, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has been among the most complex and nuanced \u2013 and all the more satisfying for it.",
    "Still, you can\u2019t avoid the feeling that the show could have been tighter, several of its narrative threads better handled. Ultimately it\u2019s fitting that a show that\u2019s flirted with inconsistency throughout should just miss the mark with its finale.",
    "Every episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is now available on Disney Plus."
