    "When you start to think about how these situations can play out in detail, from tourists paying with different card types and currency, to loyal customers paying with a mix of cash, store credit, or gift voucher, a simple sale gets a little trickier to process.",
    "A POS system is designed exactly for this complexity. They are equipped to deal with all customer needs at the point of sale, from sending email gift receipts to reminding you of current promotions to boost sales.",

    "Point of sale systems are sometimes used to refer to the cash register, or even called a POS cash register. The reality is that they're much more than the old fashioned cash register. In today\u2019s world, modern digital POS systems give your business an edge, and let you check out customers from wherever your business is based.",
    "Continues below...",

    "Combination POS systems",
    "Some POS systems combine hardware (such as a server computer) and software in a single unit, whereas others separate the two by connecting a \u2018dumb\u2019 terminal to a server located either on-premise or in another building.
