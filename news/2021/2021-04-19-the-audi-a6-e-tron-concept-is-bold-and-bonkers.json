    "Audi has laid down a marker for its bright electric future with the announcement of the A6 e-tron concept car at the Shanghai Auto Show 2021.",
    "The fully electric, four-door Sportback EV is being designed using the company\u2019s completely new EV technology, Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which is being co-developed by Porsche and is expected to underpin several new luxury models from the German manufacturers \u2013 including the electric Porsche Macan and Audi Q6 e-tron.",
    "Audi says this new electric architecture will allow the A6 e-tron to sprint faster and last longer than its A6 hybrid counterpart, and marks a promising glimpse of the company\u2019s future production EVs.",
    "For starters, the A6 e-tron is said to boast the ability to charge its 100 kWh battery from 5% to 80% in less than 25 minutes thanks to 270 kW fast charging \u2013 that\u2019s not groundbreaking speed, but it's made more impressive when you learn that the highest spec model will sport a range of nearly 435 miles.",
    "For comparison, the entry-level Q4 e-Tron \u2013 the cheapest EV set to enter Audi\u2019s lineup \u2013 features a 52kWh battery and a modest 216-mile range (which is similar to the xDrive40 variant of the BMW iX). Of course, the A6 e-tron will likely sit at the more expensive end of the company\u2019s electric offerings, but these figures nonetheless offer a taste of what Audi\u2019s new PPE platform can bring to the table.",
    "The A6 e-tron will be no slouch when it comes to on-the-road performance, either. The most powerful models will sprint from 0-62mph (0-100kph) in less than four seconds, which would be even faster than Audi\u2019s e-tron GT quattro \u2013 currently the brand\u2019s quickest EV.",
    "There\u2019s no denying that Audi\u2019s latest concept looks like a vehicle plucked straight from the streets of a sci-fi set, and it\u2019s one packed with equally-futuristic interior and exterior tech.",
    "The A6 e-tron will feature the brand\u2019s new camera-based virtual exterior mirrors, which made their first appearance on the e-tron Sportback earlier this year. The headlights, too, will be suitably futuristic, with digital Matrix LED and OLED technology allowing the driver to switch between multiple light signatures on-the-go.",
    "Not only will these headlights dynamically respond to traffic around them, but they'll also be able to project a smartphone-controlled, Audi-branded video game onto a nearby wall to be played by the car's occupants. Yes, really. You can see it in action here.",
    "In addition to tech we\u2019ve already seen on recently-announced Audi EV models, though \u2013 the virtual mirrors and Matrix headlights are old news now \u2013 the Audi A6 e-tron will take its gadget-loaded design one step further through an unlikely source; its paintwork.",
    "The car will adopt \u201cHeliosilver\u201d paint, which will not only give the A6 e-tron a technoid-looking aesthetic, but also offer tangible technical benefits to reduce energy consumption. Audi says the paint can reflect a significant percentage of the thermal radiation in sunlight, thus reducing the amount of energy that enters the car\u2019s body and, above all, its interior. Occupants therefore won\u2019t need to use air conditioning to maintain comfort, and so the car\u2019s CO2 footprint will be dramatically reduced.",
    "It\u2019s clear, then, that the Audi A6 e-tron offers an exciting forecast for the future of luxury-grade EVs. By 2025, Audi plans to produce 30 electrified models \u2013 20 of which will be pure electric \u2013 and expects these to account for around 40% of sales worldwide.",
    "Of course, this particular car only represents a concept model at this stage \u2013 so there's no guarantee a final offering will contain all the tech listed above \u2013 but if half of Audi's planned EVs end up at least looking as good as the A6 e-tron, there\u2019s reason for optimism."
