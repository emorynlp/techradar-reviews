  "article": [
    "Despite being enamored with the PS5 at launch, my enthusiasm for the system has slowly begun to wane. The PlayStation 5 is an accomplished console with some fantastic features, but one ugly truth is starting to become abundantly clear: the PS5 can\u2019t compete with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X when it comes to value. And it\u2019s why I\u2019ve found myself playing on Xbox Series X far more than PS5.",
    "Even before Microsoft\u2019s flagship console was released, I stated that the Xbox Series X was already better value than the PS5. And honestly, that gap has widened considerably almost five months since the consoles released, to the point where it\u2019s making Sony\u2019s tried and trusted strategy look horribly outdated.",
    "It\u2019s worth reiterating, but Microsoft really doesn\u2019t care if you buy an Xbox Series X. With Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the company has created a revenue stream that\u2019s available across Xbox consoles, PC, Android phones, and soon, iOS devices and browsers. It means there are practically no more barriers to entry anymore, and anyone who is interested in Xbox or playing games in general can do so \u2013 even those who only own a PS5 or Nintendo Switch will probably have access to a PC or smartphone.",
    "Unlike Microsoft, then, Sony has to sell you a PS5 if it wants to make money. It can\u2019t monetize users who don\u2019t own its hardware \u2013 outside of PC players subscribing to PS Now to stream PS4, PS3 and PS2 games via the cloud or picking up the odd PS4 port \u2013 and historically, platform holders don\u2019t tend to make any profit on hardware until many years into a console generation. It\u2019s traditionally software sales, add-ons, subscriptions and even accessories that provide the biggest yields.",
    "On the face of it, though, selling consumers a PS5 clearly isn\u2019t a problem for Sony. It\u2019s done an admirable job at shifting millions of PlayStation 5 consoles thanks to the innovative DualSense controller, an alluring first-party lineup of titles, and competitive pricing. It helps that the PS4 was also a phenomenal success story for Sony, which will have generated a lot of goodwill and loyal customers in the process.",
    "But once Sony sells you a PS5, it needs to turn that hardware loss into a profit. It\u2019s no surprise that Sony\u2019s hottest commodities \u2013 its first-party lineup \u2013 now cost $70 / \u00a370, and that it continues to sign exclusivity deals with third-party publishers like Square Enix for blockbuster games like Final Fantasy 16. It\u2019s also tried to make PlayStation Plus more appealing by including 20 games for free for PS5 owners, and PS Now thankfully added the option to download games \u2013 though its library still pales in comparison to Xbox Game Pass, and there are no PS5 titles available. Microsoft\u2019s service has 37 Xbox Series X/S optimized titles for comparison\u2019s sake, a number which will continue to grow.",
    "Microsoft, meanwhile, is in a completely different position. It simply wants to attract more Xbox Game Pass subscribers to drive its bottom line. If it manages to sell hardware, it\u2019s a massive bonus and obviously a lucrative one, but it\u2019s no longer solely reliant on needing consumers to do so.",
    "While a company\u2019s profit and loss chart doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest, these differing strategies are starting to ultimately affect the consumer, and it\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s approach that is paying dividends for gamers, and myself, who simply want to play more titles.",
    "Much like how Netflix has changed the film and television industry, Xbox Game Pass has delivered the same type of seismic shift for video games. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s the key reason why I turn on my Xbox Series X almost every night: there\u2019s always something to play that\u2019s either passed me by, just been added or recently optimized for Microsoft\u2019s current-gen consoles.",
    "If you didn\u2019t know already, Microsoft\u2019s subscription service lets you access hundreds of games for a monthly fee of $9.99 / \u00a37.99 / AU$10.95. Any game that\u2019s on Xbox Game Pass can also be bought at a 20% discount if you\u2019d prefer to own it forever, and downloadable content is discounted by 10%. Subscribers also get access to every Xbox Game Studios title on day one, which includes the likes of Gears 5, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 4 and upcoming games like Halo Infinite, Everwild and Forza Motorsport. Pretty great, right?",
    "That in itself might be enough for some people to subscribe, but Microsoft has managed to sweeten the deal even further in recent months by securing an increasing number of noteworthy third-party titles. Outriders and the previously PlayStation exclusive baseball sim MLB: The Show 21 are both available on Xbox Game Pass day one, and Octopath Traveler, one of the best Nintendo Switch games, dropped on the service at launch. If you want to play Outriders or MLB: The Show 21 on PS5, you\u2019re looking at $60 and $70 respectively.",
    "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft\u2019s highest Game Pass tier which costs $14.99 / \u00a310.99 / AU$15.95 a month, ups the stakes even further \u2013 almost to an unfathomable degree. With an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you get all of the above, along with access to Xbox Game Pass on PC, Xbox Live (required if you want to play online), Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta), perks for various titles and EA Play. If you\u2019re someone who just loves to play games, particularly across multiple platforms, it\u2019s a simply phenomenal value proposition that can\u2019t be beat.",
    "To get an equivalent experience on PS5, you\u2019d need to pay $9.99 a month for PS Plus, $9.99 for PS Now and $4.99 a month for EA Play. That\u2019s $24.97 a month in total, and you don\u2019t get access to cloud gaming on Android devices or the option to download and play PS4 or PS5 titles on PC.",
    "That\u2019s already $9.98 more a month, then, but where PS5 gamers really get hit hard is when a game like MLB: The Show 21 comes out or a big PlayStation exclusive. You\u2019ll need to pay a further $70 / \u00a370 on top of your existing $24.97 monthly fee \u2013 a price which Sony believes gamers are willing to pay for its first-party titles. That\u2019s $94.97 altogether or 84% more compared to the flat fee of $14.99 that Xbox gamers will have to pay if an Xbox Game Studios title, like Halo Infinite, releases the same month. And remember, you're still getting less for your money in the first place.",
    "As someone who basically only spends their disposable income on video games (I really should buy some more clothes one day), this price differential is simply too significant to ignore. And it\u2019s for this reason that I\u2019ve found myself gravitating back towards the Xbox Series X after initially being wooed by Sony\u2019s new console. There are simply more games to play right now, and I don\u2019t need to break open my wallet to experience the majority of them.",
    "As good as the PS5 is, it\u2019s really starting to feel like a luxury purchase. I can\u2019t help but ask \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d whenever I boot up the PS5. I want to be playing new games on it, and PS Plus has thankfully delivered some hits like Control: Ultimate Edition, Oddworld: Soulstorm and Destruction All-Stars (a game which was originally set to cost $70 at launch).",
    "But it\u2019s Microsoft who is constantly giving me reasons to turn on its console. Xbox Game Pass is the key driver in all of this, but features like FPS Boost also help make me feel like I\u2019m getting more bang for my buck. Xbox also has a clever reward system in place that encourages you to play and complete quests to earn Microsoft Reward points. You can then redeem these by either entering competitions or simply getting Xbox credit. You\u2019re essentially being paid to play.",
    "Sony, it seems, is happy to sit back until its next big title comes out. But that simply isn\u2019t enough to warrant owning a $499 / \u00a3449 console when the competition is bending over backwards to please its install base. Even when Sony does show its more generous side with its Play At Home initiative, the titles on offer are often games PlayStation owners will have undoubtedly played before or many years old.",
    "Giving away one of its exclusive games seems counterintuitive: if you own a PlayStation, how many users didn\u2019t play Ratchet & Clank, Horizon: Zero Dawn or Uncharted 4? Not many I\u2019d argue, as it\u2019s the reason so many bought a PlayStation 4 in the first place.",
    "Sony needs to do more then. PlayStation Plus continues to be a valuable service, and is currently the only means of getting PS5 games without paying full price. But PlayStation Now is still a wholly unattractive proposition, and remarkably, more expensive than Xbox Game Pass in the UK (\u00a38.99 for PS Now, \u00a37.99 for Xbox Game Pass). Sony doesn\u2019t make its first-party games available on PS Now, either, and if they do ever appear, it\u2019s often months if not years later. PS Now only gives subscribers access to PS4, PS2 and PS3 games, the latter of which can only be streamed.",
    "It's unlikely that Sony would ever put it's prized assets on PlayStation Plus day one, but imagine if there was a PlayStation Plus Platinum tier that at least included PS Now and EA Play? That would at least keep Sony somewhat competitive against Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.",
    "It\u2019s time for Sony to do more to satisfy users who have made the decision to pick up a PS5, and not just try to tempt new users in or away from the competition with one or two high profile games. Even Nintendo \u2013 a company that is notoriously tight-fisted when it comes to discounts and sales \u2013 has a reward system in place for users who buy games digitally, but Sony, at least in Europe, has nothing of the sort.",
    "As it stands, the PS5 really feels like it\u2019s only aimed at the payers \u2013 not the players Sony supposedly cares so much about."
