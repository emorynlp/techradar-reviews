    "Bayonetta 3 is easily one of the most-anticipated upcoming Nintendo Switch games right now \u2013 and after what seemed like an eternity, we finally saw gameplay of the third entry in the series during the house of Mario's September 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation.",
    "It's been over three years since the game was announced at The Game Awards 2017, so the reveal almost felt merciful at this point. Thankfully, though, it was worth the wait, as the Umbra Witch Bayonetta looks just as beautiful and deadly as before, with more than a few new tricks up her sleeves along with a brand-new hairstyle.",
    "The PlatinumGames-developed title has been bereft of any meaningful updates since it was first revealed at the 2017 Game Awards. And even then, all we had was a teaser and a logo. It's hardly the only big Nintendo game in this position, either, with Metroid Prime 4 similarly revealed with little to no other information for the time being.",
    "The first two games in the series, from lauded Japanese game studio PlatinumGames, are considered some of the finest action titles ever created, with the titular witch becoming an iconic and icy-cool star for those that enjoy high-speed beat-em-ups. Unfortunately, Bayonetta 3 didn't make an appearance at Nintendo's E3 2021 showcase so it's relief to see the title is alive and well and is due to release sometime in 2022.",
    "Bayonetta 3 doesn't have a firm release date right now, but we do know it's due to arrive sometime in 2022. Information about the game has been practically none existent since its announcement in 2017, with PlatinumGames' director Hideki Kamiya saying that fans should \"reset and forget\" until the game is shown off again.",
    "Luckily, our first gameplay reveal of Bayonetta 3 was bookended with a 2022 release date, and the game looks far along enough in development that we're confident it won't slip to 2023.",
    "If you're looking for a place to watch all the Bayonetta 3 trailers, we're rounded them all up for your viewing pleasure.",
    "First Look at Bayonetta 3 Gameplay \u2013 Nintendo Switch We finally saw Bayonetta 3 gameplay at the September 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation. The Umbra Witch returns to battle gigantic foes and uses her signature Witch Time powers to dodge attacks and deliver devastating combos. Check it out below.",
    "Bayonetta 3 Official Teaser Trailer - The Game Awards 2017",
    "The reveal trailer for Bayonetta 3 was first shared at the Game Awards 2017. It's just a quick teaser with no gameplay, showing Bayonetta herself frantically fighting someone or something and possibly losing. The teaser also showed off the logo for the game, as well as the confirmation it's being developed by PlatinumGames for the Nintendo Switch.",
    "Like the past Bayonetta games, this will be an action-filled hack-and-slash game where you play as Bayonetta herself, utilizing her stylish gunplay to take down hordes of angels and demons. Magic items and unique weapons shake things up, as does the ability to use Torture Attacks to punish foes for extra rewards.",
    "As has become customary, the sadistically seductive witch has a brand-new look in Bayonetta 3. The short bob that she rocked in Bayonetta 2 is now gone, replaced with beautiful long braids, which can, of course, transform into demonic creatures.",
    "Speaking of demons, Bayonetta will now be able to summon and control gigantic creatures during battles using her new Demon Masquerade ability. It means the game will play host to some larger-than-life battles and should mix up the formula quite a bit. We also saw Bayonetta briefly transform into some sort of spectacular butterfly to deliver a devastating combo, and perform multiple perfectly-timed dodges to activate Witch Time, which lets you deliver significant damage to enemies as time momentarily slows down.",
    "If you're a fan of Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2, it looks like the third entry in the series will deliver more of the same stylistic, and brutally violent action, which is ultimately a good thing.",
    "Bayonetta has an interesting history, first appearing on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, developed by PlatinumGames (the PS3 port was handled by Nex Entertainment) but published by Sega.",
    "The publisher then decided not to pursue a sequel, so Bayonetta 2 was only possible because Nintendo stepped in to publish the game and provided funding. In exchange, Bayonetta 2 was exclusive to the Wii U. Both Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 were later ported to the Nintendo Switch.",
    "As a result, Bayonetta 3 will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, since Nintendo has again stepped in to publish the game in return for exclusivity.",
    "Bayonetta 3 could come to other platforms Bayonetta 3 could come to other platforms in the future, but the decision ultimately lies with Nintendo according to PlatinumGames' executive director Hideki Kamiya.",
    "In a tweet (thanks, VG247), Kamiya-san said: \u201cWe are developing Bayonetta 3, as we did Bayonetta 2, with money we received from Nintendo. Since we\u2019re only developing, Nintendo has total say regarding the product.\u201d",
    "Kamiya-san went on to add: \u201cIt seems the probability of Bayonetta 2 and Bayonetta 3 getting ported to the PS4 and Xbox isn\u2019t zero,\u201d said Kamiya-san. \u201cBy the [same logic], the possibility that Mario and Zelda [will come to other platforms] is not zero.\u201d",
    "It seems unlikely that Bayonetta 3 will be anything but a Nintendo Switch exclusive, then, but at least the door hasn't completely been closed on the possibility."
