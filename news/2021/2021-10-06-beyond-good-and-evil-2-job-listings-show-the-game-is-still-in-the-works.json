    "A handful of job listings for Beyond Good and Evil 2 show that the game is still in active development at Ubisoft.",
    "Ubisoft has recently posted listings for a range of roles on the Beyond Good and Evil 2 team, which range from programmers and animators, to technical artists, to a development tester. The roles are based at a range of Ubisoft\u2019s studios in France, Germany and Spain.",
    "Overall, the job listings don\u2019t give a huge amount away about the specifics of Beyond Good and Evil 2, though a listing for a Technical Artist does provide a little tease by calling it \u201cone of the most innovative productions at Ubisoft\u201d with \"an entire Galaxy, where the gamer is free to explore unique planets (each with its own cities, ecosystem and culture)\". What these listings do, at least, confirm is that development on the game is still moving along.",
    "It\u2019s been a while since we last saw anything from Beyond Good and Evil 2; the last trailer drop and a look at some gameplay took place in 2018. Ubisoft\u2019s financial reports have been a slight source of news, with the most recent call in July 2021 (via PCGamer) confirming that development is \u201cprogressing well\u201d, while sidestepping an opportunity to commit to a fiscal 2024 release, deeming it \u201ctoo early to tell you at this stage.\u201c",
    "Thus far, then, Beyond Good and Evil 2 has received no release date or release window and it remains unclear when we\u2019ll see one announced.",
    "So, yeah, things have been pretty quiet on the Beyond Good and Evil 2 front. An update back in September 2020 suggested that we would see the game in action at some point in 2021 and it\u2019s kind of hard not to notice that 2021 is rapidly running out of months. Still, it\u2019s not necessarily the worst thing that the game still hasn\u2019t been shown. It seems likely that the silence just means the development team is keeping its head down and pushing forward with creating the game. These job listings certainly suggest that's the case.",
    "The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has caused significant disruption for development studios across the world. It\u2019s not hard, then, to imagine that the team behind Beyond Good and Evil 2 has faced disruptions of its own. That\u2019s not to mention the announcement of the departure of director Michel Ancel back in 2020, when it was confirmed that he hadn\u2019t been directly involved with the project for \u201csome time\u201d already.",
    "I attended a behind-closed-doors preview of the game all the way back at E3 2018 so I can at least confirm it\u2019s actually a real game that exists in some form, even if it kind of feels like a dream now. I didn\u2019t play a single bit of it for myself (it wasn\u2019t at that stage yet) but I did watch some developers take it for a spin in a very controlled demo. My overwhelming impression during the session was \u201cwell, that's ambitious\u201d. Certainly, it struck me as a big game with a lot of moving parts that will take some time to get right. After the trouble Cyberpunk 2077 has had, there\u2019s rightly a wariness around over-promising and under-delivering, so perhaps the quiet around Beyond Good and Evil 2 is for the best.",
    "The original Beyond Good and Evil was released in 2003\u2014that\u2019s 18 years ago\u2014and it\u2019s been 13 years since Beyond Good and Evil 2 was first teased at Ubidays in 2008. Given we\u2019ve waited this long, we can probably stand to wait a little longer. Admittedly, \u201ca little longer\u201d feels somewhat optimistic right now but, hey, good games take time, right?",
