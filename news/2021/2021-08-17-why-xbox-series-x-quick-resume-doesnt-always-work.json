    "If you own an Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S console, you\u2019ve most likely witnessed the benefits of the Quick Resume feature. If you\u2019re out of the loop, though, Quick Resume essentially allows the player to switch between multiple games on the console without closing them down. This lets you pick up a game you previously suspended exactly where you left off, without requiring a time-consuming relaunch.",
    "While a brilliantly convenient way to suspend and resume your games, Quick Resume isn\u2019t without its flaws, and I\u2019ve encountered more than a few situations where the feature didn\u2019t work at all.",
    "This is occasionally the case with games that are new to Xbox Series X or the Xbox Game Pass subscription service, such as Hades or Boyfriend Dungeon, with which I\u2019ve personally experienced a lack of Quick Resume functionality.",
    "Now though, thanks to Xbox director of project management, Jason Ronald, we have a much better idea as to why Quick Resume isn\u2019t always as seamless as we\u2019d like it to be.",
    "Replying to a fan\u2019s question on Twitter about why Quick Resume doesn\u2019t always work out of the box, Ronald said: \"The team has been putting a lot of effort into hardening Quick Resume and we put some titles through extra validation to make sure the experience is as intended before enabling it. Feeling good about the progress and you shouldn\u2019t see a delay for new titles soon.\"",
    "Suspend and resume features have been a standard on consoles for a few generations now, with early examples including the PS3\u2019s Home button (which suspended a game, but kept it open in the background) and even the Nintendo DS\u2019s sleep mode. Quick Resume feels like an evolution of suspend and resume, and it\u2019s far more robust in that it allows players to suspend and switch between multiple titles.",
    "Much like backwards compatibility with older Xbox generations, and Xbox Cloud Gaming, Quick Resume is yet another feature the company has gone the extra mile in implementing. And Quick Resume is especially useful if, say, you\u2019re tired from work and just want to dive into a game without sitting through initial load times or those unskippable developer splash screens.",
    "While Quick Resume does work as intended for the most part, it can be a tad frustrating to have come to rely on the feature, only to find out the game you\u2019re playing doesn\u2019t support it just yet. This can lead to loss of progress if you haven\u2019t saved in a while. But at least the Xbox Series X/S\u2019s lightning-quick SSD can get games up and running again in a short amount of time.",
    "I\u2019ve often been delighted by how well Quick Resume works overall, though, in places where it\u2019s implemented. I sometimes even forget the feature exists, only to be surprised when I load up Forza Horizon 4 and find that I\u2019m already in-game, bypassing that game\u2019s lengthy initial load times.",
    "There\u2019s room for improvement with Quick Resume, then, but it sounds like Xbox is at least working to have the feature ready for all games at launch. This will help to relieve the uncertainty from players like me who rely on Quick Resume often to get back into the action as quickly as possible."
