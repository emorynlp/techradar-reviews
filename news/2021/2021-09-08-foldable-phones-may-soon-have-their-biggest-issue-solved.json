    "Foldable phones have come a long way in the few years they\u2019ve been around, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 being a truly great handset. But they still face two significant issues: price, and the dreaded crease, the latter of which may soon be solved.",
    "LG Chem has unveiled a \u2018Real Folding Window\u2019 material which is designed for foldable screens. This would sit on top of the pixels, in much the same way as Samsung\u2019s Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) does on its current foldables.",
    "But while Samsung\u2019s solution is designed with strength in mind, LG\u2019s could apparently eliminate the crease in the screen where it folds.",
    "But it doesn\u2019t sound like the company has sacrificed durability to achieve this, as it claims that there might not even be a need for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on top \u2013 this is a material that\u2019s used on other foldables to protect the screen.",
    "So it sounds like LG Chem\u2019s Real Folding Window is the best of both worlds, with the company promising that it\u2019s as hard as glass but as flexible as plastic. And if this material really can eliminate creases in the center of foldable screens too, then it should be a huge step up from what we\u2019re seeing now.",
    "The crease in foldable phones is something that can largely be ignored or even forgotten about, fading into the background of your mind much like punch-hole cameras do after you\u2019ve used a phone with one for a while, but it\u2019s still not ideal. In fact it\u2019s quite a lot more noticeable than a punch-hole camera, as it runs down the length of the fold.",
    "So while it\u2019s something most people can live with, avoiding it could make a big difference to the attractiveness of the screen, and remove a potential source of distraction, which isn\u2019t something anyone wants with their expensive smartphone purchase.",
    "After that, it\u2019s really just the price that needs addressing, and Samsung already seems to be working on that, with prices gradually dropping.",
    "Of course, it remains to be seen how soon we\u2019ll see LG\u2019s tech in a foldable phone, especially as Samsung \u2013 the biggest player in the space \u2013 might be reluctant to switch from its own display tech, but hopefully this upgrade will happen sooner rather than later.",
