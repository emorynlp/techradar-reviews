  "article": [
    "Web hosting is a service that makes your site or web application accessible on the internet. It\u2019s also one of the most essential elements to consider when building a website.",
    "Web hosting is typically provided by web hosts, which are businesses that maintain, configure, and run physical servers that house websites.",
    "If you purchase a hosting plan from a web hosting service provider, it means that you rent their server space to store your website data, such as HTML and CSS files, media content, and other documents.",
    "While web hosting might seem like a difficult topic to tackle, this article will help you better grasp its concepts and intricacies.",
    "We\u2019ll start by taking a closer look at how web hosting works. Then, we\u2019ll overview some common types of web hosting and a few aspects to look for in a web hosting service.",
    "As mentioned earlier, web hosting is offered by web hosts that rent out their computing servers. These companies also provide the software, services, and connectivity needed for a website to go live.",
    "A server is a computer that stores and makes your web files available on the world wide web.",
    "Although it\u2019s possible to use any computer connected to the internet as a server, the configuration process can be complicated for most users. That\u2019s why many website owners and businesses prefer to use a web host's server space instead of having an in-house dedicated server.",
    "Just purchasing website hosting is not enough to make your site accessible to visitors, however. For people to find your website, you\u2019ll need to acquire a domain name.",
    "Domain hosting is a service that hosts and manages domain names. It\u2019s provided by domain hosts, also known as domain name registrars.",
    "A domain name itself is the address of your website. Users type a website\u2019s domain name in the address bar of their web browser to visit that site.",
    "A domain host uses domain name system (DNS) records to connect your domain with your site\u2019s internet protocol (IP) address \u2013 a unique address assigned to a physical server, which usually looks like this: 168.221.236.204.",
    "IP addresses help computers identify each other online, but it\u2019s challenging for humans to remember and use these numbers to access a website. Thanks to DNS, people can load a site on their browser without knowing its associated IP address.",
    "Aside from acting as a website address, a domain name can also be a tool to support a site\u2019s branding \u2013 it\u2019s the first element that people see when visiting a website. Thus, it\u2019s crucial to spend some time picking a domain name that suits your project or business.",
    "Here are a few tips for choosing the right domain name for a website:",
    "It\u2019s also possible to buy a domain name from web hosts that also offer domain registration services, such as Hostinger, Bluehost, and GoDaddy. You can look up already existing domains using search tools provided by ICANN or WHOIS.",
    "Purchasing a domain name from your web hosting company lets you manage both services under one account. Thus, there is no need to worry about changing the nameserver settings for your domain.",
    "Web hosting companies are responsible for maintaining and keeping their servers running 24/7, ensuring great performance for the websites they host. For online business owners, having a site with outstanding uptime can help maximize sales and improve user experience.",
    "Additionally, using a web hosting service can improve a site\u2019s search engine optimization (SEO). The web host you choose can affect your site speed, one of the critical factors when search engines like Google rank web pages.",
    "Purchasing a web hosting plan is also more efficient than having an in-house dedicated server \u2013 website owners won\u2019t need to spend time maintaining physical hardware or spend money to hire a developer.",
    "Many web hosting providers also offer an intuitive control panel. This tool lets website owners easily control their site and hosting service, manage domain names, install applications, and upload website files.",
    "There are various types of hosting services available, including shared, VPS, cloud, reseller, WordPress, and dedicated hosting.",
    "Each hosting type caters to different needs and choosing one will depend on several factors such as the type of your site, technical knowledge, and budget.",
    "To find which hosting service is the best choice for your website, let\u2019s look at the overview of the most common hosting types.",
    "Shared Hosting",
    "Shared hosting is a type of hosting where a single computing server hosts numerous websites. This service is a popular option for starter websites since it usually offers cost-effective hosting solutions coupled and is relatively easy to use.",
    "The number of sites that a single shared server can host might range from dozens to hundreds. These websites share the same server resources, including disk space, random access memory (RAM), and central processing unit (CPU) power.",
    "Users will also share the same main directory \u2013 a folder that stores web content and other files \u2013 but they won\u2019t see each other's data since they have no root access to the server.",
    "Not having root access, however, means that a website owner will be restricted from performing specific tasks, such as modifying the server-wide configuration files or installing software they need for a particular project.",
    "A shared hosting solution usually provides many features, including a site builder, databases, FTP accounts, and other additional tools included by the web hosting provider.",
    "Also, shared web hosting providers will take care of your server configuration and handle server tasks like updating software and security tools. This helps you to focus on building and growing your site rather than maintaining it.",
    "This type of hosting is simple and straightforward to set up, so it won\u2019t take much time to get started.",
    "With this service, website owners can also install and host multiple sites on a single account, which is excellent for handling numerous site projects. However, the number of websites they can manage on each account will depend on the web hosting service provider and plan they choose.",
    "Here are some other reasons to consider a shared web hosting service:",
    "There are also a few negative aspects to consider before purchasing a shared hosting plan, such as:",
    "If you plan to build a blog or a small business website, you should consider choosing this hosting type. This service typically comes at affordable prices and is very beginner-friendly.",
    "VPS Hosting",
    "Virtual private server (VPS) hosting is a type of web hosting service that hosts several accounts on a single server but provides dedicated resources for each of the users.",
    "With a VPS, website owners can deploy their own operating system (OS) and software. This is because VPS hosting service providers use a hypervisor to install a virtual layer on top of their server\u2019s OS, splitting the server into multiple partitions.",
    "There are two types of VPS hosting \u2013 unmanaged and managed.",
    "Using an unmanaged VPS means you\u2019re responsible for configuring and maintaining the server yourself. You also need to perform various tasks such as monitoring security threats, installing and upgrading software, and backing up services.",
    "For instance, if you want to build a WordPress website, you also need to install server-side technologies like Apache or LiteSpeed.",
    "Since using unmanaged VPS requires users to run and maintain a server themselves, it\u2019s a good choice for web developers or website owners with a technical background.",
    "As for those with no technical knowledge, a managed VPS plan will be more beneficial \u2013 the web host will be the one who maintains and keeps the virtual server running.",
    "However, managed VPS plans usually cost higher than unmanaged VPS solutions.",
    "Regardless of the VPS hosting type, consider this service if you want a more reliable service than shared web hosting.",
    "With VPS hosting, website performance won\u2019t be affected by the activities of others on the same server. Since each account will have its own server space and storage allocated, users won\u2019t compete for computing power.",
    "These are other reasons why you should consider using a VPS:",
    "You should also consider these negatives before getting a VPS hosting plan:",
    "VPS hosting is an excellent service for those that require total control over their server environment and do not want to rely on other users.",
    "If you want to use a VPS but have no technical knowledge, consider hiring a developer to keep the website running smoothly.",
    "Cloud Hosting",
    "Cloud hosting is a type of hosting that utilizes multiple web servers to ensure maximum performance and uptime.",
    "Compared to the other types of web hosting plans, this service offers exceptional availability as it is capable of distributing web files across several virtual servers. Cloud web hosting also handles traffic surges much better by using the other web servers for untapped resources.",
    "Many cloud web hosting services include simple server management, allowing users to quickly scale and keep track of the hosting metrics such as data transfer, disk usage activity, and CPU utilization.",
    "There are more advantages to using cloud hosting, such as:",
    "There are also some negatives to consider with cloud web hosting:",
    "Cloud hosting is a suitable option for medium to large-sized businesses that demand high performance, bandwidth, and uptime.",
    "This service is also excellent for website owners who receive huge traffic volumes, which tend to slow down their websites.",
    "Before purchasing any of the hosting services, it\u2019s also essential to look for a web host that offers the best features for your site.",
    "Here are the key aspects to consider when choosing a website hosting provider:",
    "Speed",
    "Site speed can affect user experience \u2013 around 40% of visitors expect a website to load in no more than three seconds and leave the site if it takes longer than that.",
    "Make sure to choose hosting companies that offer fast servers, which can increase your website speed.",
    "Also, look for hosting service providers with data center locations close to your visitors since it will help make your web pages load faster for them. Check out tools such as GCP Ping to measure how distance impacts loading speed.",
    "Performance",
    "Pick a reliable web host that comes with an uptime guarantee, promising that the provider will keep your site accessible online for a certain percentage of time. Many companies in the web hosting industry offer 99.9% uptime.",
    "Also, look for a hosting option with uptime monitor tools that can alert website owners in the case of downtime.",
    "Security",
    "Site owners should choose a web host that provides the necessary security features to keep their websites safe.",
    "Keep in mind that the security tools needed will also depend on the type of your website. For example, if you create a WordPress site, it can be helpful to have a spam prevention tool to remove unwanted comments on your page.",
    "Make sure your hosting service provider offers SSL certificates to protect data and visitors\u2019 personal information.",
    "Add-ons",
    "Sometimes a website needs additional tools or services to improve its functionality.",
    "Thus, choose a web host that offers a wide range of add-ons such as antivirus software, email accounts, content delivery networks (CDN), or extra bandwidth and storage.",
    "Support",
    "For beginners who have no web development experience, opt for hosting service providers with 24/7 support. This allows website owners to get assistance from experts when a technical difficulty arises.",
    "A web host should also offer an extensive knowledge base or educational blog to help users learn about different web-related topics.",
    "Cost",
    "Remember that hosting is an ongoing cost, so it\u2019s essential to spend time researching a service that offers the best value for your money.",
    "If you\u2019re still unsure about purchasing a hosting service, try to find a web host that comes with a money-back guarantee. This gives you a chance to test the web host\u2019s performance and ask for a refund if you\u2019re dissatisfied with the service.",
    "The web hosting provider you choose should also offer room to grow, allowing you to upgrade to a plan with more resources without affecting your site performance.",
    "After getting to know several important aspects of web hosting services, let\u2019s look at some commonly asked questions about website hosting.",
    "Do I really need web hosting?",
    "You need web hosting to store your web files and make your website available on the internet. In addition to that, purchasing a dedicated server is expensive and impractical.",
    "Hosting your website on the web host\u2019s servers lets you focus on more important matters, like producing great content and driving traffic to your website.",
    "How much does web hosting cost?",
    "The prices of web hosting services depend on the provider and the type of hosting you choose.",
    "For instance, if you plan to create a blog, then a shared hosting plan should suffice. The average price of shared hosting plans ranges from $2 to $7/month.",
    "Which web hosting is best?",
    "The best web hosting for you relies on your budget, skill set, and the type of website you aim to build. For example, a large online store with thousands of visitors per month has different hosting needs than a portfolio website with less than a hundred visits.",
    "Let\u2019s see which web hosting is the best for you to get started with:",
    "Anyone who wants to build a website needs web hosting to store their website's files and make them accessible for visitors worldwide.",
    "There are different types of hosting to choose from, and the right option for your project relies on your budget and preferences.",
    "Here\u2019s a quick recap of the three common types of web hosting:",
    "Since there are so many web hosting service providers out there, make sure to look for a hosting company that comes with fast servers, an uptime guarantee, security tools, a variety of add-ons, 24/7 support, and reasonable prices.",
