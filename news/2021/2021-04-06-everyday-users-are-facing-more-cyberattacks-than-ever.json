    "The pandemic has made people afraid and uncertain about the future, and cybercriminals are happy to capitalize on that, new research has found.",
    "A report from Bitdefender is saying everyday consumers have never been this bombarded by malware and ransomware, with smart home devices, Android applications, and network-attached storage being among the most popular distribution mechanisms.",
    "Cybercriminals have been using the pandemic as a theme to deliver malicious code to targeted end-users over the past year, evolving their delivery mechanisms, social engineering skills, and building new exploits.",
    "Breaking down the report\u2019s key findings, Bitdefender said ransomware attacks grew 485% in 2020, compared to the year before. Almost two-thirds of those attacks happened in the first half of the year.",
    "Cybercriminals were also interested in IoT devices with proprietary operating systems - as while these devices made up hardly a third of all gadgets owned (34%), they are responsible for almost all (96%) detected vulnerabilities. Exploited flaws in smart TVs spiked by 335% year-on-year.",
    "Criminals were also abusing the spike in Zoom\u2019s popularity, as well as the overall popularity of Android, Bitdefender further stated. Most of the Android malware detected came from the Android.TrojanAgent, Android.Trojan.Downloader and Android.Trojan.Banker.",
    "Network-attached storage (NAS) was a leader in the number of vulnerabilities, spiking by 189% year-on-year. It owes its popularity among criminals, not to the mass use (it\u2019s not the most prevalent device in a home), but rather to the number of unpatched vulnerabilities at criminals\u2019 disposal.",
    "Finally, potentially unwanted applications (PUA) are apparently on the rise, and while these aren\u2019t inherently malicious, they can be abused for that purpose. Bitdefender claims there had been a 320% increase in reported PUA last year, compared to 2019."
