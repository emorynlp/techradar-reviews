    "Apple has released the latest firmware update for AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max, as well as the Beats Solo Pro, Powerbeats, and Powerbeats Pro.",
    "The latest update brings a number of performance enhancements and bug fixes, but also one feature that folks have been waiting for since Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference in June: Conversation Boost.",
    "Conversation Boost is a new feature for the AirPods Pro that dials up the volume of conversations happening in front of the user in transparency mode. While anyone can benefit, it effectively allows people who are hearing impaired to better understand what people are saying in a conversation.",
    "The accessibility feature is free, but you\u2019ll need to make sure that your buds have been updated to firmware version 3E751, which you can check on your phone\u2019s settings \u2013 look under Bluetooth and tap your connected AirPods Pro units to check what software version your earbuds have been upgraded to. Simply remaining connected to your iPhone should result in the latest version being automatically downloaded.",
    "Once you have the latest firmware installed on your AirPods Pro, head back into the settings and scroll down to \u2018Accessibility.\u2019 From there tap \u2018Audio/Visual\u2019 > \u2018Headphone Accomodations\u2019 > \u2018Transparency Mode\u2019 > \u2018Custom Transparency Mode\u2019.",
    "From this screen you\u2019ll be able to customize how strong you want the audio to be from either Slight, Medium or Strong options. Strong will really dial up the sound of conversations and the voices of people around you, while Slight only boosts them\u2026 well, slightly.",
    "To turn the feature off you can go back through the settings or simply turn it off via Control Center - both options should work fine.",
