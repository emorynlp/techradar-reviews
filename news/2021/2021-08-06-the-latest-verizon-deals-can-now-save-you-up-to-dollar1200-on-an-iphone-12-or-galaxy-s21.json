  "article": [
    "The latest Verizon deals have switched up recently to include what's probably the biggest saving yet from the carrier. Right now, if you're interested in a new iPhone 12 for example, you can combo together a maximum trade-in saving of up to $700 with an additional $500 new customer bonus for not only a free device but some leftover change too.",
    "And it's not only the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max (see here) which are available under these terms - discounts are also available on the Galaxy S21 series devices too. In fact, the maximum trade-in rebate for these devices is even higher with an additional $100 on top.",
    "This latest promotion replaces the very popular '5G upgrade' program from Verizon, which allowed existing customers to trade in for a saving of up to $800. Unfortunately, the latest deals aren't quite as generous for existing customers, but they are way, way better for those looking to make the switch.",
    "While the combination of a trade-in and switch is fairly hard to pull off for most, it's worth bearing in mind that these savings are both exclusive of one another so you don't have to do both to get a discount. Existing customers can also keep their line and upgrade for a saving of up $440 on these devices with a trade in - which now also includes the option to hand over devices with broken screens.",
    "If you're not looking to switch or trade then there are also plenty of other Verizon deals to check out this weekend, including a free iPhone 11 or Galaxy S20 FE. We've included details on these promotions just below.",
    "If you're interested in the latest iPhones but want to see what other carrier's are offering, head on over to our main best iPhone deals page for more. For Android devices, see this week's best cell phone deals for a rundown of the best prices on Samsung, Google, and OnePlus devices."
