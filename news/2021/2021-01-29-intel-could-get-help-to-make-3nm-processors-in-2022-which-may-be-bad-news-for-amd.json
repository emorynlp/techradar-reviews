  "article": [
    "We know that outsourcing will be part of the solution to Intel\u2019s chip production problems, and according to the rumor mill, the company is ready to make a big move, and reportedly has already struck a deal to enlist TSMC\u2019s help with its 3nm process.",
    "The word from a DigiTimes report \u2013 citing sources from the semiconductor industry \u2013 is that Intel\u2019s bread-and-butter CPU products will be mass produced by TSMC on 3nm in the second half of 2022, and that Intel will become TSMC\u2019s second biggest customer after Apple.",
    "However, bear in mind that DigiTimes is not always the most reliable source, and indeed RetiredEngineer, the leaker who flagged this up on Twitter (via Wccftech), freely admits that there are things that don\u2019t seem to add up in this report, and that it\u2019s hard to take at face value.",
    "So, let\u2019s carry several bags full of caution with us as we forge on and explore this rumor, which follows other recent speculation that Intel has plans to outsource Core i3 (low-end) chip production to TSMC on its 5nm process.",
    "The new theory is that the big order for 3nm production in the latter half of 2022 will see TSMC making the majority of Intel\u2019s core products, while Intel will be making a smaller proportion itself (yes \u2013 huge pinches of salt required).",
    "This will supposedly allow Intel to focus more on research and development, enabling it to work on and hone its own process advancement going forward. The expectation is that process delays and yield difficulties will be \u2018fully resolved\u2019 by this strategy.",
    "Indeed, the DigiTimes report concludes that AMD will \u201cface retaliation\u201d from an Intel which is \u201crelieved of [its] production crisis\u201d, and that a rejuvenated Intel in the future will be able to intensify pricing and marketing pressure \u2013 and AMD\u2019s hard-won market share gains could be \u201clost quickly\u201d.",
    "Again, apply your own salty condiments liberally, as that certainly feels like a pretty optimistic outlook for Intel given where it\u2019s standing right now in the CPU battle against AMD.",
    "Intel\u2019s incoming CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has already said that chip production will be a dual-track effort \u2013 using Intel\u2019s own manufacturing, alongside outsourcing \u2013 going forward, but that in 2023, the majority of chips will be made by Intel itself.",
    "That could fit with the above rumor, in terms of next year being the major period where outsourcing is at its strongest level, and production will be quickly reined back in during 2023; but of course this is all guesswork at this point.",
    "Others in the industry remain skeptical that Intel will outsource core products, or at least that if its main CPUs are built at a third-party fab, these will be lower-end models (as claimed by the Core i3 rumor we\u2019ve already mentioned)."
