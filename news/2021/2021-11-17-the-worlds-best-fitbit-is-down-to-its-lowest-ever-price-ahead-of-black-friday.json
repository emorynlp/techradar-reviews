    "Fitbit has officially launched its first Black Friday deals, and has knocked the Fitbit Luxe down to just $99.95. That's the cheapest we've ever seen this sleek fitness tracker, and Amazon has matched the price so you can make the most of free shipping if you have an Amazon Prime subscription. (Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "Fitbit is teasing more Black Friday deals in the days to come, but this looks likely to be one of the best. The Fitbit Luxe currently holds the number one spot in our guide to the best Fitbits of 2021 thanks to its excellent screen, attractive design, and impressive health tracking tools. Its heart rate monitoring is particularly good, proving just as accurate as a high-end sports watch in our tests.",
    "for your money. However, if you're looking for something else then keep an eye on our guide to this year's best Black Friday Fitbit deals, where we'll be rounding up all the biggest discounts on the full range of smartwatches and fitness trackers as soon as they land.",
    "When the Fitbit Luxe launched earlier this year, one of our biggest complaints was that its blood oxygen (SpO2) monitor wasn't yet enabled, but thanks to a recent software update it's now ready to use, making this one of the most well-rounded fitness trackers around. This is an impressive deal, and we'd be surprised if its price drops even further when November 26 rolls around.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Fitbit smartwatches and fitness trackers from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
