    "A Chinese draft economic blueprint last month called for Chinese legislators to allocate more budget to companies in seven identified areas including Artificial Intelligence (AI), and quantum computing, which it deemed pertained to \u201cnational security and overall development.\u201d",

    "Reacting to the addition of the supercomputing firms to the ban list, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, at a daily news conference in Beijing, said \u201cU.S. containment and suppression cannot hold back the march of China\u2019s scientific and technological development.\u201d",
    "Lijian added that the Chinese government will take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to protect the rights and interests of its companies.",
