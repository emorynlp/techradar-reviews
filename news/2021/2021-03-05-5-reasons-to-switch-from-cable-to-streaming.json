    "How many times a week do you find yourself asking that question in your household? According to data from an Ericsson study, on average, Americans can spend up to one hour a day just looking for something they want to watch. As more people are turning to streaming services to quickly get to the content that matters to them, that number has started to shrink.",
    "Part of the reason Americans have gained back their \u201cendless surfing\u201d time is due to streaming technology becoming more sophisticated. Streaming devices are no longer one-note fixtures in our home, but integrated services with multiple purposes. This technology is working harder than ever to help you find your favorites, discover new content, and so much more.",
    "We talked to Sandeep Gupta, VP and GM of Fire TV at Amazon to learn how streaming has evolved. He suggested five reasons streaming can help you do more, stay entertained and make life easier.",
    "When it comes to your favorite shows and content, no two viewers are alike. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to find a streaming service that allows you to create and set up profiles. This allows multiple users of the same device to set up their own preferences so they only see the content that meets their interests. \u201cWe believe that our devices should be helpful, proactive, and get smarter everyday based on the way you use them,\u201d said Sandeep. The more your device understands the type of content you prefer, learns about the shows you watch, the better recommendations your device will provide you. \u201cThese features help our customers eliminate \u2018endless scrolling,\u2019\u201d he added.",
    "As more networks, studios, and other entertainment companies introduce streaming content services, such as Disney+, HBO Max, Discovery+, etc., it will become increasingly important to help viewers find and watch what matters to them. Recently, Amazon redesigned their user interface on Fire TV. One of the primary reasons, added Gupta, was to help customers sift through the content on their devices in a more intuitive and discoverable way. Features such as Dynamic Row in the Fire TV user interface is a feature that helps make recommendations more personalized. Based on rankings and search, Dynamic Row organizes fresh content tailored to Amazon Fire TV customer\u2019s preferences, schedule and environment. And if all else fails, there\u2019s the Find option, which is a new destination on Fire TV to easily discover movies, TV shows, and more. All you need to do is search for your favorites or browse by popular genres (e.g. comedies, action), helpful categories (e.g. free, sports, live TV), or take a look through the Appstore.",
    "Another helpful feature in overcoming the endless scrolling that comes with today\u2019s content options is voice. While there are times when it\u2019s easiest to browse via remote, more and more customers are finding they want to cut through to the content they love. Fire TV offers the option to leverage Alexa voice capabilities to find exactly the show, movie or app you\u2019re looking for \u2013 allowing more time for enjoying what your streaming device has to offer, and less time scrolling through apps and content that\u2019s irrelevant.",
    "Whether you\u2019ve already cut the cord or are thinking of doing so, one of the biggest reasons people switch to streaming is the value. Signing contracts with cable providers locks you into packages they have created\u2014often times delivering content you may never watch, nor does it meet your interests. For the same cost of cable, or even less, you have the freedom to choose what services, apps, and content you want on your streaming device. \u201cValue and flexibility are the core reasons we see customers switching to Fire TV Sticks or Fire TV smart TVs,\u201d said Gupta. \u201cWe have multiple price points and a variety of streaming media devices and smart TVs options to meet budget needs and offer choice.\u201d",
    "More and more, consumers are turning to streaming for more than just watching their favorite movies and shows. Whether you want to get in shape, to perfect your sourdough starter, or to simply save money, streaming content can help you find helpful programming to meet your interests. Over the past year, cord cutting has accelerated. Streamers, like Amazon\u2019s customers, have given rise in popularity to the following content categories:",
    "\u201cProbably the most advantageous feature of streaming is the ability to connect with other Alexa-enabled devices.\u201d said Gupta. \u201cThe combination of Alexa and Fire TV is making smart homes and connected cars even more sophisticated as voice is an incredibly natural way to interact with those environments.\u201d In fact, streaming devices can be connected to other smart home devices to create a connected solution for security, communications, and controlling other devices around your home, such as thermostats, lighting and sound. It\u2019s even possible to remotely control your vehicle from the comfort of your home. Just by asking Alexa, you can remotely lock or unlock their doors, start or stop the engine, adjust the cabin temperature, and more.",
    "Whether you\u2019re looking to catch up on your favorite shows, use the TV in your living room to control the temperature or the lights, discover new interests, or anything else in between, streaming continues to evolve. Gupta concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s not just TV viewing anymore, it\u2019s a connected and intelligent smart-home experience that spans everything from finding movies or TV shows to watch, watching live sports, connecting to social media accounts.\u201d Streaming also offers less traditional \u201ctelevision\u201d duties like taking a fitness or cooking class, dimming the lights, turning on the home security system, and checking what\u2019s on your calendar for the next day. Gupta added, \u201cToday, streaming offers so much more than traditional television and yet we\u2019re just scratching the surface on what\u2019s to come.\u201d"
