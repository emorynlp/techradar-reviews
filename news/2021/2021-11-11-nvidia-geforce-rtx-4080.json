    "Leaks and speculation surrounding the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 are starting to stack up, which isn\u2019t surprising. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 is, after all, more than a year old, and in component years, it\u2019s fast approaching old age. That\u2019s not to mention that it\u2019s still incredibly hard to find, and at this point, we might as well just look to the newer Nvidia graphics card models.",
    "It\u2019s a good thing that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 is allegedly set to come out in 2022. Though when exactly, only time will tell \u2013 earlier rumors say we won't see the next graphics cards until October 2022, though newer ones say it might arrive alongside the 4070 and the 4090 as early as July 2022. It will also likely be based on Nvidia\u2019s Lovelace architecture, which is looking more and more like the direct follow-up to the Ampere design that the RTX 3080 is based on. And, if recent rumors are to be believed, it\u2019ll be twice as fast as its predecessor.",
    "We know that most of you cannot wait to see this next-generation graphics card in all its glory. It\u2019ll be months before you see it on the shelves, however. So tide you over, we\u2019re gathering everything we hear and learn about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 right here.",
    "We're obviously pretty far out from an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 release date right now, but we've seen a few rumors sprouting up about when we could potentially see the graphics card. The main one is from famed Twitter leaker @kopite7kimi, who suggested that Lovelace, the architecture the RTX 4080 will likely be based on, will be launching \"a little bit earlier\".",
    "This was in reference to earlier rumors that suggested the next-generation graphics architecture would be launching at the end of 2022. Couple that with another leaker suggesting that the next graphics card will be launching in October 2022, and it's starting to look like we may see the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 almost exactly two years after the launch of the RTX 3080.",
    "This would be on-track, as most graphics cards generations last about two years. The RTX 2080, for instance, launched September 2018, a little over two years after the May 2016 launch of the GTX 1080. And, of course the RTX 3080 launched in September 2020, which was almost two years on the dot. So, if Nvidia is going to keep up its regular cadence with its next GPUs, it will probably be September or October of next year.",
    "It almost feels silly at this point, but when we reviewed the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, we praised it for bringing such a huge improvement in performance at a lower price point than the RTX 2080 Super. Now, a year later, you can see how that turned out.",
    "While a lot of the price increases you see right now aren't Nvidia's fault, per se, we doubt Nvidia won't take advantage of the higher prices people are apparently willing to pay for upcoming graphics cards. It's still way too early to know how expensive Nvidia's next graphics cards will be, but we would be surprised if Nvidia didn't raise the price.",
    "This is all pure speculation on our part, but given that we haven't seen the RTX 3080 below $1,000 in the US since it launched a year ago, it wouldn't be too much of a leap to price the RTX 4080 around that price. Nvidia could still surprise us and launch the RTX 4080 at the RTX 3080's $699 (\u00a3649, about AU$950) price point, but we're definitely bracing ourselves for disappointment.",
    "Given that right now we don't have any hard details on what Nvidia Lovelace will be capable of, beyond that it will likely be based on a 5nm manufacturing process and have ray tracing, we thought it'd be best to think back on Ampere and come up with a wishlist of sorts about what we'd like to see in the next generation of graphics cards.",
    "An actual 8K graphics card While the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 was billed as the first 8K graphics card when it launched in September 2020, it still struggled quite a bit at that resolution, especially when you started turning up quality settings. Instead, to really get the full potential at 8K, you basically had to rely on DLSS which, to be fair, is better than it's ever been.",
    "With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, we'd love to see it be able to handle the latest games at 8K with high settings, without having to rely on DLSS to get it done. This might be kind of a pipe-dream, but we'd love to see it.",
    "More VRAM The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 has just 10GB of VRAM, and any GPU that's coming out in 2022 that's supposed to lead the pack simply needs to have more than this.",
    "And for the most part, it seems like Nvidia has figured this out halfway through this current generation, strapping 12GB on the RTX 3060 \u2013 which means its entry-level graphics card has more VRAM than its flagship. With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, we'd love to see at least 16GB of VRAM.",
    "More DLSS titles Now that AMD has released its FidelityFX Super Resolution tech, we're starting to see a ton of games adopting it, thanks to its open nature. But, DLSS still looks way better for those who are running Nvidia graphics cards. We'd love it if Nvidia was ready for the RTX 4080 launch with a whole suite of brand new AAA PC games that use the tech to really sell prospective users on the card.",
    "Better ray tracing performance This one is basically a given, but enabling ray tracing on any graphics card right now is a huge impact to performance. It's unrealistic to expect Nvidia to be able to release a GPU that can just handle RT effects like they're nothing \u2013 at least for now \u2013 but we'd love to see enough of an improvement that we don't have to pick between framerate or pretty graphics."
