    "An irresistible force meets... another irresistible force as undefeated super-bantamweight world champions Stephen Fulton Jr. and Brandon Figueroa put their freshly-acquired belts on the line in this fascinating unification bout. It's all or nothing for these two sensational boxers, so read on as we explain how to watch a Fulton vs Figueroa live stream today and catch all the boxing action online from anywhere in the world.",
    "Brandon \"The Heartbreaker\" Figueroa (22-0-1) is the younger of the two men but he's also the more experienced fighter, and has been more active than his opponent of late.",
    "Fulton was in attendance as the 24-year-old from Weslaco dished out the first defeat of Luis Nery's career in May, Figueroa dropping the former WBC champ in the seventh round with a brutal series of body blows.",
    "Stephen \"Cool Boy Steph\" Fulton (19-0) also had to win his WBO belt the hard way, by whipping previously undefeated Angelo Leo in January. The 27-year-old from Philly is arguably the more skillful fighter, but Figueroa's front-foot approach is always easy on the eye.",
    "It's going to be one of the fights of the year, so follow our guide below to watch a Fulton vs Figueroa live stream online from anywhere.",
    "Below, we've rounded up ways to watch today's boxing in various countries around the world. But if you're abroad and discover that your usual coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that does is showing the fight.",
    "The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Fulton vs Figueroa anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "Sadly there's no confirmed broadcaster for Fulton vs Figueroa in Australia at the time of writing. The only alternative is to use one of the best VPN service providers to tap into coverage from another nation, as described above.",
    "The software is generally ideal for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. But do bear in mind that most paid streaming services do require a credit card based in the country the service is from."
