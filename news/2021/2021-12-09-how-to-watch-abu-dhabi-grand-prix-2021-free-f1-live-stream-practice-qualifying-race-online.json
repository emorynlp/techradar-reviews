    "Do we even have to convince you to watch? The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is the decider of the greatest F1 title battle in recent years, and with Hamilton and Verstappen equal on points, whoever takes this one will take home the 2021 F1 Championship. How could you even imagine missing it? Here's our guide on how to watch an Abu Dhabi F1 live stream online from all over the world \u2013 and where you can watch the race absolutely free!",
    "After a scorching season with some supremely dramatic moments from Fernando Alonso, George Russell, Valtteri Bottas, Sergio Perez and, of course, Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, it's all come down to this \u2013 58 laps around Yas Marina in Abu Dhabi.",
    "And could it have ended any other way? With Hamilton's greatest rival in years with a track record of, shall we say, reckless manoeuvres, and a Sir Lewis ready to risk it all, this is a final GP to end all final GPs. From a clean, out-and-out victory to the dirtiest of tactics, anything's possible this Sunday.",
    "The biggest news for F1 fans in the UK and the Netherlands, though, is that the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will be free-to-air in both territories thanks to the fact that this weekend's nail-biting finale features sportsmen from their countries \u2013 and that's something we're more than pleased to hear.",
    "So, all you need to do is keep scrolling to find out how to get an F1 live stream and catch the deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix for free as it happens.",
    "It turns out that the deciding race of the season is also one of the simplest to watch, with a ton of free options all over the globe.",
    "UK - Channel 4 The free-to-air broadcaster is simultaneously broadcasting Sky Sport's coverage of the race free of charge, including commentary.",
    "Netherlands - Ziggo Sport Dutch F1 fans are also in luck, as Ziggo Sport is also broadcasting live for free. Although, like Channel 4 in the UK, it looks like only the race will be shown (no practice sessions or qualifying).",
    "French speakers in Canada will also be able to watch for free on RDS, and Swiss F1 fans can watch on the RTS Network.",
    "And if you're travelling abroad outside your country at the moment and wanted to tune in to your familiar Formula 1 coverage, you can use a VPN to do so as explained below - we rate ExpressVPN as the best provider out there, which has a great track record for unblocking geo-restricted streams.",
    "If you're abroad for this weekend's Abu Dhabi GP, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual Formula 1 coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you whizz around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred F1 live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a 2021 F1 live stream from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's stream - head to your home broadcaster's site or app and watch as if you were at home - so that's All 4 for UK F1 fans"
