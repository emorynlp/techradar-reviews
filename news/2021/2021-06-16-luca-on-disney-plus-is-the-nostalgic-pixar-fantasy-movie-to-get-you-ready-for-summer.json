  "article": [
    "Pixar movies have become a fan favorite staple of the yearly movie release schedule. Ever since Toy Story wowed audiences in November 1995 (thanks to its at-the-time revolutionary CG animation), the studio has released at least one feature film annually in all but six of the past 26 years.",
    "Such a turnaround could have led to a decline in quality \u2013 but not with Pixar. The Disney subsidiary has consistently churned out critically acclaimed movies, including Oscar-winning flicks like Finding Nemo and Inside Out, that have enthralled cinemagoers for nearly three decades.",
    "Luca, though, has more to deal with than simply living up to fan expectations. Pixar\u2019s latest animated feature is the first to be produced remotely (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and, as a result, some film aficionados might be concerned that Luca won\u2019t hit the heights of its predecessors.",
    "Thankfully, any potential fears are unfounded. Luca is a delightful, friendship-oriented adventure that\u2019s full of the signature charm, humor, emotional gut punches and innovative animation style that viewers have come to expect from a Pixar flick.",
    "Set on the Italian Riviera in the 1950s, Luca tells the story of Luca Paguro (Jacob Tremblay), a shy and lonely teenager who dreams of living an adventurous life.",
    "That is, until he meets the confident and free-spirited Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer). The duo soon become inseparable and embark on an impulsive trip to the fictional seaside town of Portorosso in search of the ultimate summer experience.",
    "Luca and Alberto, though, hide a dark secret \u2013 they\u2019re sea monsters (albeit ones who can transform into humans on land), who have been hunted by Portorosso\u2019s residents for generations.",
    "Forced to maintain their secret identities from townsfolk including Giulia Marcovaldo (Emma Berman), her fisherman father Massimo (Marco Barricelli) and local bully Ercole Visconti (Saverio Raimonde), it isn\u2019t long before Luca and Alberto find themselves out of their depth literally and metaphorically.",
    "From the outset, what\u2019s immediately apparent about Luca\u2019s plot is it\u2019s more lighthearted than other recent Pixar productions. That isn't to say that the studio's latest movie is still packed with plenty of moments that will tug at the heartstrings; it's just that they're not as heavy or pronounced here.",
    "Luca, then, isn\u2019t as mature or dark as Soul or Coco, which explored life, death and existence \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t need to be. With its summer setting, escapist tendency, and focus on Luca and Alberto\u2019s budding friendship, Luca acts as a nostalgic window to view our own childhood through. It captures the curiosity we had to try new things (and to go through with them despite being fearful) and the freedom of having no responsibilities.",
    "In that sense, Luca\u2019s story will really resonate with adult viewers, but there\u2019s also plenty to keep the kids entertained, too. Luca is packed with funny moments \u2013 Luca\u2019s deep sea dwelling uncle and Giulia\u2019s cat Macchiavelli bring the laughs whenever they\u2019re on screen \u2013 and, while the film\u2019s set pieces are par for the course, they\u2019re enjoyable enough that they\u2019ll retain any young viewer\u2019s focus.",
    "Stylistically, Luca has all the hallmarks of a Pixar movie (it\u2019s bright, colorful and beautifully animated), but what sets it apart from its predecessors is what inspired its aesthetic.",
    "Luca\u2019s painterly, manga-influenced characters and backgrounds are reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s back catalog, and you can see (and feel) how the legendary Japanese animator and director inspired the look of Pixar\u2019s latest flick.",
    "Subtle nods to Aardman Animation Studios (Wallace & Gromit, Chicken Run) and Wes Anderson (Isle of Dogs, Moonrise Kingdom) are also noticeable and, blended together with Miyazaki\u2019s influence and the golden era of Italian cinema from the 1950s \u2013 complete with an authentic, Italian-style score from Dan Romer \u2013 Luca\u2019s appearance feels unique yet recognizable. It\u2019s an art style that Pixar hasn\u2019t experimented with before, but it works and helps Luca to visually stand out among its Pixar peers.",
    "Speaking of \u2018standing out\u2019, Luca\u2019s young cast does just that. The chemistry between Tremblay\u2019s Luca and Grazer\u2019s Alberto feels natural and authentic, while Emma Berman sparkles in her first major movie role as outgoing bookworm Giulia.",
    "What\u2019s most impressive about Luca\u2019s teenage cast, though, is that all three (as well as the movie\u2019s adult actors) recorded their entire performances at home as a by-product of the pandemic.",
    "With no fellow voice actor to bounce off during the recording process, the biggest compliment you can pay to Luca\u2019s young acting trio is that this doesn\u2019t show in scenes they share together. Luca, Alberto and Giulia riff off one another so well that it\u2019s indiscernible, and you truly get the sense that all three actors were actually recording lines alongside each other at a studio.",
    "It\u2019s pleasing, too, that Pixar opted to cast Tremblay, Grazer and Berman as Luca\u2019s leads. It\u2019s been four years since a young actor led a Pixar film (Anthony Gonzalez in Coco) and it would have been easy for the studio to plump for more experienced actors to carry these roles, as it did in last year's Onward. As it is, Tremblay and the other actors help accentuate the kid-like charm and plot that Luca goes for.",
    "Luca is a charming love letter to Italy and the friendships that forge us. Through its wonderful coming-of-age fantasy story, Luca explores the power of childhood friendships, accepting who you are and, ultimately, what shapes us into the people that we are today.",
    "Designing and developing a movie during a global pandemic is (by all accounts) extremely difficult, so Pixar deserves huge credit for crafting another highly resonant, humorous and marvelously animated feature film. Better still that you can just stream it on Disney Plus without paying anything extra.",
    "It may not be as thematically dense as Soul, nor will it overthrow the likes of Toy Story, Monsters Inc or The Incredibles in many fans\u2019 top three Pixar lists.",
    "Luca, though, is the summer-infused fantasy movie about escapism and friendship that we need right now \u2013 and that's just enough.",
    "Luca launches exclusively on Disney Plus on Friday, June 18."
