    "The Google IO 2021 keynote is over, and we heard a lot about Android 12, Wear OS, Search, and other Google software products. You\u2019ve probably seen some of the big announcements, but here are 5 things you probably missed during the two-hour announcement event.",
    "Some of these new features are for widely-used software, like Google Maps, which is adding crosswalks and stoplights, suggesting restaurants in the map area similar to what a user has selected, and expanding Street View Live with street names and depth directions inside public transit centers. These features will be rolling out in the coming year, and we expect users to discover them on their own.",
    "But you may have missed announcements on other Google services, products, and software. Here are 5 things you missed from Google IO 2021:",
    "Google Search is getting smarter all the time, but at Google IO 2021, presenters identified several ways it\u2019s going to help users in the near and not-so-near future. One health-related feature lets users upload a trio of images of concerning parts of their skin, hair, or nail and Search, within a browser, will quickly analyze and scan the web to surface results for over 288 dermatological issues. This feature could come to Search by the end of 2021.",
    "While Google did highlight how Search is returning smarter query results thanks to its AI-assisting BERT tech today, other new features are deeper in development, like a multi-modal search that takes user queries and consults text, images, audio, and video to surface very contextually rich answers.",
    "As demonstrated in the presentation, users can search for \u2018a Google Maps route with pretty views of mountains\u2019 and Search will cross-reference possible routes with images located along the way; or in another example, users can ask for \u2018the part in this particular video with the lion in front of a sunset,\u2019 and voila, Search produced a timestamp satisfying that criteria.",
    "Android Auto has teased remote unlocking your car using your Android phone via NFC and ultra-wideband (UWB) for awhile, though it\u2019s only worked with a limited number of vehicle models. Now there\u2019s an addendum to that feature: users will be able to loan out Digital Car Keys to a trusted friend or family member to unlock a linked vehicle.",
    "Details are a little hazy, but this potentially allows someone to pick up your vehicle or grab something from it if you can\u2019t hand them keys yourself \u2013 like if you\u2019re out of town or forgot to hand off the keys. This feature is headed to Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones this fall (Q3 2021).",
    "It\u2019s no secret that Google hasn\u2019t updated Wear OS in awhile, so this batch of new features is certainly welcome \u2013 though we still have a lot of questions for how they\u2019ll be implemented. That\u2019s because a host of upgrades \u2013 30% faster app starting, better battery life, and smoother app transitions \u2013 seem to be tied to a partnership between Google and Samsung to combine \u2018the best\u2019 of both Wear OS and Tizen smartwatch operating systems.",
    "We do know that the Samsung Galaxy Watch will get access to the Play Store and Google Maps, and Tizen features will be available for all device-makers. Speaking of partnerships, Fitbit, which was acquired by Google in early 2021, will contribute its health tracking and fitness celebrating features to Wear OS. The company will also design new smartwatches that will be based on Wear OS.",
    "More broadly, there are a ton of back-end upgrades teased at a Wear OS developer session promising faster task switching, a function to return to the most-used app by double-tapping a smartwatch's function button, a Google Maps update that allows offline navigation, more robust health information shared across apps through APIs, easier ways for appmakers to build Tiles, expansion of Google Pay for Wear to more countries and metro areas, and even color-matching your other Android devices via Android 12\u2019s new cross-platform Material You synchronization.",
    "Google Photos can automatically edit your pictures to look \u2018better\u2019, but the AI algorithms for this didn\u2019t always take skin tone into account, leading to unflattering photos for people of color.",
    "To resolve this, Google says it teamed up with dozens of \u2018expert image makers\u2019 to improve its AI and make it more equitable instead of prioritizing lighter-skinned subjects. The auto-white balance and auto-exposure of your Google Photos should now better match your actual appearance.",
    "Google also claimed that it has drastically improved its algorithms for categorizing your photos. It uses what it calls \u2018Little Patterns\u2019 to note repeating objects, faces or other details between your photos, then groups them together into Memories for you to enjoy. And it computes this on your device, so you don\u2019t need to worry about Google analyzing your photos in the cloud.",
    "The other new photo technology is Cinematic Photos, which was introduced in December 2020 and which one Techradar writer called \u2018seriously problematic and creepy as hell\u2019. Google\u2019s AI will turn two of your photos into an animated gif, using machine learning to fill in the gaps with an impressive deepfake.",
    "Finally, Google added a Locked Folder to Google Photos where you can place photos that you don\u2019t want to see in your main feed or memories, but also don\u2019t want to delete. Access to the folder requires a fingerprint or PIN code or whichever authentication you use to unlock your phone.",
    "Apple made a big splash with its recently-released App Tracking Transparency tools, so Google took some time today to emphasize its own privacy features. Its new Privacy Dashboard is fairly similar in concept: it tells Android phone owners which apps accessed their location, camera or microphone in the last 24 hours complete with a timeline, so you can remove that access at any time.",
    "Google also wants to replace the password manager industry with its own service. You can now import your .csv file from other managers to move all your old passwords to Google, then have access to them across your Android apps or Chrome pages. You\u2019ll get automatic password alerts if your data becomes compromised from a known site breach; and then Chrome Quick Fix will take you directly to a form where you can change your password for the site almost instantly.",
    "Google also made it the default that any web and app activity associated with your Google account would be \u2018auto-deleted\u2019 after 18 months. You can even delete the last 15 minutes of your search history at any time.",
    "The other big privacy update is the Android Private Computing Core. It ensures that any personalized information on your phone is generated on your device using machine learning, so your data never goes to the cloud. Google used the examples of Smart Replies for texting, automated captions on your private videos, and a Now Playing feature on your lock screen."
