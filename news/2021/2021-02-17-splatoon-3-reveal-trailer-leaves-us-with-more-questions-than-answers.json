    "After a fairly slow build-up in one of its weirdest trailers yet, Nintendo announced that Splatoon 3 will be coming to Nintendo Switch in 2022.",
    "The trailer, which shows off some of the game\u2019s new customization features, starts with an inkling as it makes its way from the dusty wastelands to a wider city that looks, according to folks on Twitter, like Hong Kong.",
    "Chances are good the area will serve as the new hub world for the game \u2013 but it\u2019s not something we\u2019d bet our ink-rollers on at this point.",
    "Speaking of rollers, what we can glean from the trailer, though, is that there will be a few new weapons including a neat bow and arrow that we see in the hands of the inkling. There\u2019s also a new map \u2013 a desert with fish bones \u2013 that sort of alludes to an ocean-less future dystopia, but again, it\u2019s all anyone\u2019s guess based off this trailer.",
    "Considering we\u2019re just two months into 2021, next year is a long ways away \u2013 especially if you're Nintendo. The Big N has a few first-party titles between now and then like New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, Mario Golf: Super Rush and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD but the schedule looks a bit empty after that.",
    "That changed slightly thanks to today\u2019s Nintendo Direct, but it also delivered the bad news that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 still isn\u2019t ready to be shown off yet.",
    "There are some good third-party games coming in the next few months for Nintendo Switch owners like Monster Hunter: Rise and Apex Legends, but it's still looking pretty desolate all things considered.",
    "Hopefully we'll hear some Metroid Prime 4 or Breath of the Wild 2 news at E3 2021 but, if we don't, it could be a long 12 months for Nintendo Switch owners."
