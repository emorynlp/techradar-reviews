    "It\u2019s important at first to select social media platforms that are appropriate for your brand.",

    "Social media platforms make it easy to experiment with dozens of different ecommerce marketing tactics in one go \u2013 shoppable posts are a great example.",

    "You can also use Instagram as an intuitive online shopping tool.",
    "Upload your store\u2019s product catalog to your business account, and see how many potential customers you can reel in with this ecommerce marketing strategy:",
    "Similar to Instagram, the world\u2019s most popular social media platform also has a shop option for business page users. Why not maximize your ecommerce marketing opportunities?",
    "This is more than Facebook Marketplace, the one-stop destination for preloved goods from around your neighborhood. Instead, a Facebook shop is much more slick.",
    "Maxing out the number of selling platforms your business has is a cool ecommerce marketing strategy, as long as every touchpoint looks the part.",
    "On social media, you\u2019ll be competing with other ecommerce brands as well as trying to fit your products into the platform\u2019s confines.",
    "Luckily on Facebook, you\u2019ll get a headstart \u2013 your shop is customizable so you can create a layout that embodies your brand. After that, it\u2019s time to make the most of this resource:",
    "Here\u2019s an ecommerce marketing strategy that you might not even know is an ecommerce marketing strategy until you get your head in the game.",
    "Check out some of your favorite ecommerce brands and you\u2019re sure to come across examples of user-generated content on their social media profiles.",
    "This is where a brand reposts a photo, video, or review that shows a happy customer\u2019s real life experience with a product they have purchased and are using.",
    "For example, a glasses store might repost a selfie that one of their customers took wearing their new specs \u2013 and for good reason.",
    "User-generated content like this highlights the loyal customer and promotes credibility.",
    "You see the post and probably think that this brand is legitimate: there\u2019s an actual human who has successfully bought the brand\u2019s products. So how do you replicate that?",
    "This is a digital marketing method that has well and truly stood the test of time. Email is one of your brand\u2019s core marketing channels, so you need to use it wisely.",
    "One of the best aspects of running email marketing campaigns nowadays is that they can be automated and tracked with sophisticated email marketing software to help you optimize your results.",
    "This includes doing things like segmenting your mailing list to generate drip campaigns. Essentially, automating emails is great for testing and perfecting marketing strategies.",
    "That said, if you really want to win with your email campaigns, it\u2019s vital to produce engaging, interesting content that will drive ecommerce sales.",
    "After all, even though people sign up to your mailing list, they still need to open the email.",
    "So, for starters, you can optimize this ecommerce marketing channel with a newsletter that will engage your subscribers \u2013 here\u2019s how:",
    "Digital marketing is important at every stage of the user journey, not just right at the beginning. Sometimes, you have to try to pull back a lead as they\u2019re slipping away.",
    "Cart abandonment is a well-known sore point for ecommerce businesses. Right before they hit \u2018purchase\u2019 on a basket full of products, a potential customer leaves the store.",
    "That\u2019s why sending abandoned cart emails is one of the best marketing strategies out there for ecommerce stores. It acts to resolve any doubts and push through a transaction.",
    "Abandoned cart emails also help you as the business owner to understand potential pitfalls.",
    "Perhaps your shipping options are too limited, or the user doesn\u2019t think your site looks secure. Either way, here\u2019s how to put this ecommerce marketing tactic into action:",
    "Ecommerce businesses have plenty of perks, but often they lack some of the cool things that physical, local businesses get to enjoy like a shop window that passers by can stare into.",
    "The good old-fashioned shop window is the ultimate in traditional marketing techniques. People see your beautifully-styled wares, they\u2019ll stare at them longingly, and eventually buy them.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s a way to replicate that on ecommerce websites \u2013 enter the wish list.",
    "Much like a lot of your content marketing output, your store\u2019s wish list feature will live as a page on your website.",
    "On each product page, shoppers can add each product to a wish list by clicking on a heart icon if they\u2019re not yet ready to purchase. Their coveted items will be saved for future use.",
    "So how does this relate to ecommerce marketing? Here\u2019s how:",
    "You know by now that digital marketing doesn\u2019t begin and end with lead generation. In fact, the work goes on long after customer conversion.",
    "An ecommerce marketing tactic you shouldn\u2019t overlook is introducing a loyalty program.",
    "Retention rate is going to be important to you as an online store owner, and ensuring that your shop has a steady flow of repeat purchases is just as vital as finding new customers.",
    "Plus, customer loyalty is an incredible source of marketing for ecommerce stores. Think of all the people your most loyal customers can share your business with.",
    "Here are some ideas for capitalizing on happy customers with a loyalty program:",
    "Ever been asked if you want fries with your burger? And then asked if you want to upgrade from a medium to a large for only an extra $1? That\u2019s cross-selling and upselling.",
    "These sales techniques certainly aren\u2019t exclusive to fast food restaurants \u2013 you\u2019ll find them in plenty of ecommerce businesses, too.",
    "Upselling and cross-selling are useful marketing strategies as they help to promote additional products in the moment, as well as showing your business\u2019s capabilities.",
    "You can use sales enablement software to figure out how to upsell and cross-sell your products, but here are the key considerations for making this an effective marketing strategy:",
    "Be relevant - Cross-selling socks with a crate of beer is kind of weird, and less likely to generate the boost you need to either product than if you were to pair your crate of beer with a bag of chips, for example.",
    "Show value - Always remember the target audience in the scenario and make sure that you\u2019re presenting a valuable deal. Can they save money with an upsell? Will they get more with a cross-sell?",
    "Let\u2019s go back to one of the most lucrative ecommerce marketing channels right now: your social media account. Which influencers is your brand following?",
    "Embracing influencer marketing is totally accessible to smaller businesses as much as larger ones, and the premise is pretty simple.",
    "In short, your brand approaches an influencer \u2013 someone on a platform like Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, who has a large, loyal, and engaged audience.",
    "You then pay them to promote your products through reviews or by wearing and using them.",
    "Working with influencers is arguably a more credible way to utilize paid marketing as this is a human personality with the trust and confidence of their followers. Just remember:",
    "If you\u2019re a regular user of platforms like Instagram, you might have noticed that some of your favorite influencers use affiliate links in their content.",
    "Marketing with affiliate links is a different approach to influencer marketing, however.",
    "In this case, you pay commission to a third-party person or website which has referred traffic to your store, but only when a transaction has taken place.",
    "Affiliate marketing is an extremely measurable ecommerce marketing strategy, as you\u2019re tracking clicks, traffic, and the success rate of your affiliate partners.",
    "Much like the use of influencers, affiliate marketing plays to the (hopefully genuine) idea that your brand is trustworthy, credible, and desirable.",
    "Here\u2019s a couple of formats that your store might use for this ecommerce marketing move:",
    "A less well-used ecommerce marketing strategy, local marketing requires you to zoom in on specific neighborhoods or regions where you have a wide potential customer base.",
    "This is a great tactic for stores with a brick and mortar presence and a reliance on foot traffic.",
    "If you want to become known in your local area beyond traditional marketing, or you\u2019re ready to win over the hearts and wallets of your community with tailored deals, there\u2019s a lot you can do.",
    "For starters, work out the area that you want to be targeting. Are you looking near to a store, or perhaps close to your warehouse or office?",
    "Then, start pulling the levers to offer an enhanced service to local users \u2013 you should:",
    "Ecommerce marketers can\u2019t control what customers say about your business in reviews \u2013 or at least, they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 but this is a key part of your marketing mix.",
    "Using reviews as an ecommerce marketing tool has a ton of benefits. You\u2019re embracing great referral marketing opportunities, and boosting the credibility of your store.",
    "You\u2019re adding a sense of impartiality to your ecommerce platform, which is going to be important as new leads try to gain a sense of trust for your business.",
    "Plus, by facing reviews head-on, you\u2019re holding your brand accountable. Nobody wants to see an embarrassing, unresolved review of their own business on the internet.",
    "So how do you make reviews into an ecommerce marketing essential?",
    "Alongside every other ecommerce marketing technique, you should make sure that your ecommerce website is looking as good as it possibly can.",
    "A clear, aspirational layout with cool features or witty copy will go a long way towards making a lasting impression with future customers.",
    "Make sure to consistently check on your website to keep it fresh, innovative, and a strong part of your ecommerce marketing toolkit. Remember to:"
