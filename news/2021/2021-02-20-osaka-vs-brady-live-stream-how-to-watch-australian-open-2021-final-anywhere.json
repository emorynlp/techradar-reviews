    "Jennifer Brady's playing in a Grand Slam final for the first time of her career, but in order to get her hands on the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, she's going to have to find a way to beat Naomi Osaka, who looks every bit the best player in the world right now. It's the biggest tennis match of the year so far, so read on as we explain how to watch the Australian Open final online and get a Naomi Osaka vs Jennifer Brady live stream wherever you are today.",
    "Osaka has arguably been the standout player in Melbourne, her masterful 6-3, 6-4 semi-final victory over Serena Williams the highlight of a fortnight of excellence. Brady's route to the final has been somewhat low-key by comparison, with 25th seeded Karolina Muchova the highest-ranked player she's faced until now.",
    "This is the fourth time Osaka and Brady have faced each other on-court, but their last clash was a classic, with Osaka edging a 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 in the semi-final of last year's US Open. It was a brilliant performance from Brady, who's emerged from relative obscurity to establish herself as a real contender.",
    "But Osaka looks unbeatable right now, and has never lost a grand slam quarter-final, semi-final or final. But records are there to be broken, and Brady has a knack of surprising people.",
    "Don't miss a single point from Melbourne Park because it couldn't be easier to get an Australian Open live stream from anywhere. Watch all the drama unfold by following our Naomi Osaka vs Jennifer Brady live stream guide below to watch Australian Open final online right now.",
    "For broadcast and streaming details in tennis-mad countries like the UK, Australia, US, Canada and New Zealand, just scroll down the page - everything you need to know is there, including details of who is showing the tennis.",
    "But if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for sports fans all over the world. Fortunately, there's an easy solution."
