    "Update: In a post on Xbox Wire, Microsoft has confirmed that Outriders is indeed coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. The game will also be playable on Android phones and tablets via Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. You can read our original story below.",
    "Microsoft has teased that Square Enix\u2019s Outriders could be coming to Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.",
    "The Xbox Game Pass Twitter account shared one of its familiar spoof emails from Melissa McGamepass, which often reveal when a marquee title is coming to Microsoft\u2019s subscription service.",
    "In the past, fans have determined that Doom Eternal and Control were heading to Xbox Game Pass with some rather simple detective work, and this time the consensus is that Outriders could be the next game on the way.",
    "The last line in the email from McGamepass (who, to be clear, doesn\u2019t actually exist) says: \u201cHas anyone noticed a mysterious signal appearing in the distance lately or am I the anomaly in this situation?\u201d This has led many to speculate that Outriders, which releases on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC and Google Stadia on April 1, as the game\u2019s story revolves around searching for the source of a mysterious signal.",
    "If that wasn\u2019t enough, the Outriders demo (which you can download now) includes a mission that has players escaping an 'anomaly'.",
    "Microsoft recently added 20 Bethesda games to Xbox Game Pass to celebrate it\u2019s multi-billion dollar acquisition of its parent company, ZeniMax Media. If Outriders does indeed make its way to Xbox Game Pass, it will be another boon to a service that some consider to be the best deal in gaming.",
    "The move could also help Outriders\u2019 long term future immensely. The co-operative, looter shooter space can be extremely difficult to break into, especially as Outriders is going up against the likes of Destiny 2, Borderlands 3 and The Division 2, all of which have established and dedicated player bases. If Outriders is on Xbox Game Pass, the game can reach a massive audience from day one, which is crucial for online multiplayer titles.",
    "Microsoft announced that there were over 18 million Game Pass subscribers in January, 2021. We\u2019d imagine that number has only grown since then, particularly now that Bethesda\u2019s future releases are guaranteed to launch on Game Pass on day one."
