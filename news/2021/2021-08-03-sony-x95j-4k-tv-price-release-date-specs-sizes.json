  "summary": "The Sony X95J is its best 4K LCD this year \u2013 but should you buy it?",
  "article": [
    "Do you need the Sony X95J 4K TV? This is Sony\u2019s flagship 4K LCD for 2021 and it only recently launched in June. That means it\u2019s bound to be the go-to purchase for anyone who wants the newest Sony TV without splurging on OLED.",
    "However, at $2,999 / \u00a33,399 (around AU$3,800) it certainly isn\u2019t cheap. So is it worth buying the Sony X95J 4K TV? These days, flagship LCD TVs often occupy an uneasy space in a TV brand's range, overlapping with the price point of entry-level OLED TVs.",
    "For example, Sony currently has a similarly-priced OLED option available. Take a look at the Sony A90J OLED TV. At $3,799 / \u00a33,499 / AU$4,999 for the 65-inch option, the A90J is far from the most affordable OLED TV around, but you absolutely get what you pay for with exquisite picture quality and robust sound.",
    "But remember, price isn\u2019t the only thing to consider. Choosing an expensive LCD or a relatively cheap OLED (given the technology's higher costs) can be difficult, and we recommend checking out our full OLED vs LCD guide to consider this further.",
    "In our guide below, we\u2019ll run through everything you need to know about the Sony X95J 4K TV so you can decide if it\u2019s the right option for you. Including how much it costs, the key specs you need to know and how it shapes up.",
    "We'll also fill you in on gaming features like HDMI 2.1 \u2013 a crucial specification for the Sony PS5 that was poorly supported on last year's Sony sets, but which is more of a priority this time around.",
    "Finally, if you\u2019re looking for a new Sony TV but don\u2019t fancy this one, check out the cheaper X90J model, which is a step-down from the X95J 4K TV and, therefore, less expensive starting at $1,299 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,895 for the 50-inch size. In our review, we called it \u201cone of the best mid-range 4K TVs money can buy in 2021.\u201d",
    "The Sony X95J's pricing is $2,299 / \u00a32,199 (around AU$3,000) for the 65-inch model, $2,999 / \u00a33,399 (around AU$3,800) for the 75-inch model, and $4,499 / \u00a34,499 (around AU$5,800) for the 85-inch model.",
    "By comparison, the step-down X90J model starts at $1,299 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,795 for a 50-inch size, going up to $1,499 / \u00a31,249 / AU$1,795 for a 55-inch size, $1,799 / \u00a31,499 / AU$2,295) for a 65-inch size and $2,499 / \u00a32,599 / AU$3,695 for a 75-inch size.",
    "It's notable, though, that last year's model was also available in 49-inch and 55-inch sizes, with Sony limiting sizes on the X95J to larger models. It's possible that the smaller sizes didn't sell as well, or that Sony simply wishes to differentiate between its cheaper sets and more flagship models.",
    "The Sony X95J was released in the US and UK markets in June 2021.",
    "It's expected to hit the Australian market in late August \u2013 we'll update this guide with a firm date and Australian pricing when we find out more.",
    "The Sony X95J is the first step down in that middle range of the Sony TV lineup from the pricey premium models. That said, you\u2019re not sacrificing a ton of features, here: the X95J still offers the XR Contrast Booster that the Master Series models use (though it won\u2019t be as bright) and the XR 4K Upscaling technology. It has X-Wide Angle, XR Motion Clarity and 3D Audio Upscaling thanks to the Cognitive XR Processor, but will only have X-Anti-Reflection on the two larger models.",
    "That Cognitive XR processor is what elevates this set above the X90J and X80J, with Sony saying that it utilizes a \u201ccompletely new processing method designed to replicate the ways humans see and hear\u201d, detecting a so-called \u201cfocal point\u201d in the TV\u2019s picture to focus processing around the more important parts of the image.",
    "\u201cWhile conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) can only detect and analyze picture elements like color, contrast and detail individually, the new processor can cross-analyze an array of elements at once, just as our brains do,\u201d Sony says.",
    "In terms of changes compared to last year\u2019s X950H/XH95, one of our favorite Sony TVs from last year, the X95J is slimmer by about 10mm and adds HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K/120 gameplay \u2013 perfect for the PS5 and Xbox Series X. That was a huge sore spot on last year\u2019s model, so it\u2019s great that Sony has added them in for this year.",
    "You won't get the screen-shaking Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology here, as it only works with OLED panels. However, the X95J does feature Acoustic Multi-Audio, which uses \"sound-positioning tweeters to ensure high-frequency sounds come from the right place in the scene, exactly where the action is happening.\"",
    "You'll get front-facing speakers and an integrated subwoofer, alongside Dolby Atmos audio and a \"3D Surround Sound upscaling\" technique to give a sense of verticality to non-Atmos sound. Sony also supports Dolby Vision dynamic HDR, though not the HDR10+ standard favored by Samsung.",
    "The X95J will also make use of a Google TV smart platform, rather than the Android TV software usually seen on high-end Sony TVs, with baked-in support for both Chromecast and Google Assistant.",
    "The much-marketed Netflix Calibrated Mode makes a return, too \u2013 even if we wouldn\u2019t bother using it \u2013 but IMAX Enhanced is also supported for those with compatible content.",
    "The Sony X95J also has a three-way multi-position stand, making it simple to adjust to the parameters of the counter or media unit you're placing the television on, and with a 'hero position' to fit in an appropriately-sized soundbar underneath the screen."
