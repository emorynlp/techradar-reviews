  "article": [
    "Time is a funny thing. Sometimes it goes fast, sometimes it goes slow, and sometimes it just seems to repeat itself every time you fall down the stairs.",
    "I\u2019m talking, of course, about the hit Netflix show Russian Doll \u2013 the smart-mouthed time-travel romp through modern-day New York, where the cynical video game designer Nadia Vulvokov (played so effectively by Orange is the New Black\u2019s Natasha Lyonne) seems cursed to repeat the same day over and over again every time she dies.",
    "It\u2019s been a while since Russian Doll was really in the news. After launching in 2019 to much fanfare, and a second season being confirmed shortly thereafter, there\u2019s no word on when more Russian Doll episodes are coming to our screens. That\u2019s a shame, given how eagerly fans of the show are expecting Nadia\u2019s return, but it\u2019s fitting that the first season is always there, waiting to be relived all over again.",
    "I\u2019m of the opinion that Russian Doll has never felt more relevant than now, at a time when our lives lack variation, and most of us are condemned to look at the same walls, ceilings, and surroundings every single day.",
    "The time travel premise used in Russian Doll was really first set out in 1993\u2019s Groundhog Day, where a nihilistic news reporter is forced to relive the same day in a sleepy American town until he starts to appreciate and see the joy in its humdrum encounters and miniature dramas.",
    "It takes Russian Doll, though, to push this premise to a new level. It follows a game designer caught in a time loop that doesn\u2019t restart at dawn so much as go back to a checkpoint every time she dies \u2013 and die she does. You\u2019ll see Nadia fall down the stairs of her apartment block, get hit by a car or bus, or even freeze in the cold as she pushes the limits of her quantum confinement to new places.",
    "I won\u2019t spoil too much for new (or forgetful) viewers, but the genius of the show is in how broadly it ties in different philosophies and schools of thought, whether religious, scientific, or otherwise \u2013 and it\u2019s Nadia\u2019s own experience as a game designer that gives her the biggest lightbulb moments, using a modern understanding of gameplay loops or software bugs to enlighten and enhance the Groundhog Day formula. (It seems somewhat fitting that Natasha Lyonne credits a computer algorithm for the show\u2019s success too.)",
    "There is a real vigor to the way the Netflix show repeats the same camera shots, snippets of dialogue, or environments \u2013 turning what should be stale into a deepening understanding of Nadia's life, home, and relationships every time she restarts her day.",
    "Near-identical conversations become thrilling for the slight variations, and how they spin into new narrative arcs \u2013 inevitably cut short, deleted and restarted, for Nadia to try again.",
    "It\u2019s not all hopeless, though \u2013 it\u2019d be a difficult eight episodes otherwise \u2013 and Russian Doll finds a way to make the repetition thrilling, even turning it into a catalyst for change.",
    "And that\u2019s a sentiment I think we could all use right now.",
