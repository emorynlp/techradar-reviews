    "We're swapping deserts for the shores of Senegal's famous Lake Retba, better known as Lac Rose for its famous pink waters, a short drive away from Dakar, a city synonymous with motorsport. The first round was utterly enthralling, so follow our guide to watch the Ocean X Prix online and get an Extreme E Dakar live stream wherever you are right now - best of all you can tune in for FREE.",
    "Johan Kristoffersson and Molly Taylor wrote their names into the history books with last month's commanding victory in the first ever Extreme E race, leaving Andretti United and Team X44 trailing behind them in the Saudi Arabian dust.",
    "That gives the standings a distinctly 2016 F1 feel to them, with Rosberg X Racing topping the charts and Team X44 in hot pursuit, but it's all to play for.",
    "It's going to be another sandy weekend in Senegal, though proceedings have been tweaked for the Ocean X Prix. Four teams will battle it out in the final, and an additional five team points are up for grabs for the driver who sets the fastest time in the 'Super Sector' part of the course.",
    "With the next Extreme E round scheduled for the end of August, make sure you don't miss this one. Read on for full details of how to get an Ocean X Prix live stream and watch Extreme E Dakar online this weekend - catch all the action from start to finish with the help of this guide.",
    "Because Extreme E is brand new, there are loads of ways to watch all of the action for free, all around the world.",
    "The best way to tune in to Extreme E Dakar is via the Extreme E website or the Extreme E YouTube channel, both of which are live streaming all of the action, including the Qualifying rounds, Semi-Finals, Crazy Race and, of course, the Final itself.",
    "Some domestic broadcasters are also showing the action. The BBC in the UK being the obvious example. More details on who has an Extreme E live stream can be discovered below.",
    "If you're abroad for this weekend's Ocean X Prix, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic Extreme E coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you whizz around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred Extreme E live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
