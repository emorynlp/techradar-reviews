    "Stylus phones are rare, and while the Samsung Galaxy Note 21 looked to be the only one yet to launch in 2021 (if it does at all), we could see a surprise from Motorola on the way very soon.",
    "That's because a leaker thinks a 5G-enabled version of the Moto G Stylus (2021) is coming soon. This leaker, called Nils Ahrensmeier, shared some images too, which are below.",
    "Ahrensmeier isn't a prolific leaker, but what their track record lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quantity - plus, these pictures confirm an old point of confusion. Just before the Moto G Stylus (2021) launched, a popular leaker unveiled pictures of the phone which turned out to be inaccurate - but these newer images look identical to those, suggesting the early leak was actually of this 5G phone.",
    "In the images, we can see a square camera bump, a rear fingerprint sensor and a front-facing camera situated to the top-left of the screen in a cut-out. The camera and fingerprint scanner are both different compared to the non-5G model.",
    "According to Ahrensmeier, this phone will be exclusive to the US - that makes sense, as the standard Moto G Stylus was too. We don't yet have any details of a release date.",
    "If the leaked Moto G Stylus 5G has next-gen connectivity, a stylus and a low price (as the Moto G branding implies), it could be a strong rival for the Samsung Galaxy Note 21, a phone that'll hit those first two points but possibly lack in the latter.",
    "Saying that, we've heard strong rumors the Samsung S Pen smartphone has been canceled in 2021, so stylus-lovers might have little choice for their next smartphone.",
