    "This year may have gotten off to a dull start, but ITV\u2019s Dancing on Ice is back to make it sparkle. Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield return to host the long-running competition series, which will see celebrities like Myleene Klass, Jason Donovan, and Denise Van Outen take to the ice to wow the judges and take home the trophy. Prepare for breath-taking spectacle as we detail how to watch Dancing on Ice 2021 online from anywhere \u2013 including 100% free for anyone in the UK with ITV.",
    "Once again forming the judges panel is John Barrowman, Ashley Banjo, and UK Olympic gold medallists Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean \u2013 although they\u2019ll all be separated by Perspex screens this time to maintain social distancing. But, in an exciting new twist for the show, the judges can save one of their favourite couples from being voted off in the first two weeks, by issuing them with a Golden Ticket and guaranteeing them a place on week three.",
    "Who can we expect to see glide Swan Lake-style into the finals? This year\u2019s twelve contestants include ex-Hear\u2019Say band member Myleene Klass, TOWIE\u2019s Billie Shepherd, Jason Donovan, rapper Lady Leshurr, Coronation Street actress Faye Brooks (a current favourite to win), and Olympians Graham Bell and Colin Jackson. They\u2019ll be partnered with DOI pros like Matt Evers, who\u2019s appeared on every season since the show began, and newcomers Angela Egan and Brendyn Hatfield.",
    "So, get ready to be dazzled \u2013 and not just by Phillip and Holly\u2019s kilowatt smiles \u2013 as we explain how to watch Dancing on Ice season 13 online from anywhere.",
    "While fans of competitive dance shows in the UK can enjoy Dancing on Ice 2021 online with ease, regional restrictions mean that tuning in from anywhere else in the world will be near impossible. That means that anyone based in the UK currently travelling abroad \u2013 and having paid for an annual TV license \u2013 won\u2019t be able to connect to ITV Hub either.",
    "Luckily, downloading a VPN provides a simple solution. This nifty bit of kit changes your IP address, allowing you to connect to your favourite on-demand services and watch all its premium content regardless of where you\u2019re streaming from."
