  "article": [
    "Google has unveiled a wide-reaching overhaul to Google Workspace (previously G Suite), its suite of productivity and collaboration tools, in preparation for the rise of hybrid working once the pandemic subsides.",
    "In a hybrid working model, employees divide their time between the home and office, reaping the rewards of remote working without sacrificing the benefits of face-to-face interaction. However, Google believes this new flexible arrangement will demand a set of tools that is adept at supporting all ways of working at once.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re especially interested in what we call collaboration equity, or the ability to contribute equally, regardless of whether you\u2019re sitting in the same room as your colleague or hemispheres apart,\u201d said Javier Soltero, who heads up Google Workspace.",
    "\"Today, we\u2019re announcing new tools and features to help people make the most of their time, collaborate equally and deliver more impact.\u201d",
    "Some of the most significant Workspace changes, which are expected to roll out in the coming weeks and months, revolve around how employees divide up their working day and make themselves available to colleagues.",
    "\u201cA trend we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s workforce is the juggling of professional and personal responsibilities, with many employees now working in \u2018sprints\u2019,\u201d explained Soltero. \u201cAs more businesses embrace a flexible, hybrid model, we\u2019ll all need tools to help us achieve better work-life balance and make the best use of our time.\u201d",
    "A new \u201csegmentable working hours\u201d feature, for example, will allow Workspace users to specify chunks of time during which they are available for meetings, while \u201clocation indicators\u201d will show which days a person is working from home versus the office.",
    "\u201cFocus time\u201d and \u201crecurring out-of-office events\u201d, on the other hand, will give users a way to schedule distraction-free portions of the day. The former limits the kinds of notifications received during a predefined period, while the latter can be used to establish regular time slots away from the desk, automatically declining all calendar events that overlap.",
    "Workspace is also getting a new analytics feature that will let employees see how their time is divided between each of their responsibilities. This data is visible only to the employee, not their manager, so cannot be wielded as a means of monitoring staff.",
    "Beyond new time management facilities, Google will also deliver a range of upgrades designed to make collaboration more \u201cequitable and accessible\u201d.",
    "The company has announced new Google Meet options for those that use a range of devices (e.g. conference room hardware, Nest Hub Max etc.) to host meetings. According to Soltero, these \u201csecond screen experiences\u201d will allow users to present and participate in all aspects of a meeting (chat, polls, Q&As etc.) from any device and any location.",
    "Google Meet for mobile devices will also receive a much-needed tile view, allowing multiple attendees to appear on-screen at once, while picture-in-picture support will give users the option to perform other actions on their device without navigating away from the meeting feed.",
    "In the name of inclusivity, meanwhile, Google is introducing a live captions feature for live streaming, with support for a range of languages, along with Q&A and polling functionality and the ability to stream across multiple Workspace domains within a single organization.",
    "Rounding out the announcement, Soltero revealed that users of the most basic Workspace package, Essentials, will gain access to a few additional services, including the new-look Google Chat, whiteboard app Jamboard and Calendar."
