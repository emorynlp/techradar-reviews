    "Every drop of blood, sweat and tears shed over the past few months and beyond count for nothing without the Vince Lombardi Trophy to show at the end of it. But only one team, once coach and one QB is worthy of the sport's highest honor. Read on as we explain all you need to know about Super Bowl LVI - including early details of how to get a 2022 Super Bowl live streams all over the world.",
    "It's the fixture that sets storylines in stone and immortalises names, faces and journeys.",
    "Some may argue that Aaron Rodgers is the better player, but there's no debating that Tom Brady is the greater. The Buccaneers center has held that iconic sterling silver trophy aloft seven times to Rodgers' solitary triumph.",
    "The race for Super Bowl 56 is proving to be wildly unpredictable, with both the NFC and AFC lacking any one single, genuinely dominant force.",
    "The Bucs, Chiefs, Packers, Rams, Cowboys and Bills have already lost at least three games each, while the previously unfancied Patriots, Colts and Titans have emerged as potential dark horses, after less-than-stellar early outings.",
    "Of course, the Super Bowl isn't just about the football, and you can read on as we explain how you'll be able to watch Super Bowl 2022 - you can even watch a FREE Super Bowl live stream in some countries - and what you can expect at the Super Bowl 56 halftime show.",
    "If you've mismatched a holiday or you're away on business and you want to watch your country's Super Bowl 2022 coverage from abroad, then you'll need to use a VPN. This will help you dial in to a location back in your home country to avoid geo-blocks and regain access to the content and services you already pay for back home.",
    "A VPN is generally perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location when the big game is on.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Super Bowl 2022 from anywhere",
    "The 2022 Super Bowl is set to be staged at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, on Sunday, February 13.",
    "Construction delays prevented the stunning new facility from hosting last year's showpiece, and it's hoped that we'll see it at full capacity for this year's event.",
    "SoFi is a 70,000-seater, but can hold upwards of 100,000 fans if needed.",
    "Following in the footsteps of a performance from The Weeknd that launched several thousand memes and at times perfectly embodied the Chiefs, rap and R&B royalty Dr. Dre, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige and Snoop Dogg will headline the 2022 Super Bowl Half-Time Show.",
    "It's a megastar lineup that's up there with the best there's ever been, and will be just as big a spectacle as the game itself.",
    "The playoff spots are still pretty wide open, such has been the volatile nature of this season, and many of the pre-season picks, including the Chiefs, Browns and Bills, have looked anything but a shoo-in for the championship game.",
    "It's simply too early to tell, but for many it seems written in stars that it will be contested by Bill Belichick's New England Patriots Evil Empire v2.0 and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of his one-time wingman Tom Brady.",
    "Who else? Tom Brady won his seventh Super Bowl ring and was named Super Bowl MVP for the fifth time as he led his new team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, to a resounding victory over then-reigning champions the Kansas City Chiefs, on home soil.",
    "It was a shockingly one-sided affair that few had seen coming, the top-seeded Chiefs crumbling spectacularly on the big stage.",
    "Patrick Mahomes' depleted O-line allowed their quarterback to get hit time and time again and his receivers vanished into thin air, showing that anything really can happen in this game."
