    "While we\u2019ve still yet to see Sony\u2019s PSVR 2 headset itself, the controllers for the PS5\u2019s virtual reality device have already been revealed. However, a recently uncovered patent for the PSVR 2 controllers shows Sony\u2019s next-gen virtual reality gear in more detail.",
    "Over at the WIPO IP Portal (the World Intellectual Property Organization), a new patent filing has been made public. Filed on February 26, 2021, and made public on December 2, 2021, it shows detailed diagrams of the PSVR 2 controller, including button placements, how it will be easier to detect by the PlayStation HD Camera, and a trigger-like grip.",
    "According to the filing\u2019s abstract, \u201cthe present invention improves the stability of detecting a light-emitting unit by using a camera.\u201d Image 23 of the patent's drawings shows numerous black dots which seem to indicate tracking points on the device.",
    "The patent also describes a trigger-grip-like controller, with a ring that sits behind the buttons and the user\u2019s thumb, and the drawings show three additional buttons that can be pressed using a player's middle finger, ring finger, and little finger.",
    "The new patent appears to be a match with the existing PSVR 2 controllers that Sony has already been showing off, moving away from the wand-like PS Move controllers that accompanied the original PlayStation VR kit in favor of a more compact, orb-like device that's akin to Valve's Index controllers.",
    "Of course, as ever, a patent is no indication of a product to come \u2013 it\u2019s merely a way for a company to protect its inventions and ideas, and potential iterations on other devices that are in existence. But with VR remaining a relatively experimental medium there\u2019s room for a variety of input ideas to be explored. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out to see if everything in this patent is included in Sony's next-gen VR controllers once we get more details."
