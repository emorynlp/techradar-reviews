    "Having beaten Perth in their Qualifier clash, the Sixers take home advantage for the grand finale and are therefore huge favourites to notch up another win against the Scorchers and defend their title.",
    "While the odds may be against them according to the bookies, Perth have nevertheless been given something of a fillip with the news that Sydney star man Mitchell Starc will not be available for selection. That selection issue for their rivals is tempered by the fact that the Scorchers themselves will be without key batsman Jason Roy for the final, however.",
    "Perth have shown they still have plenty of fight left in them after defeating Brisbane Heat in impressive style in the Challenger contest to reach this showdown, with their bowlers doing a sterling job to deliver a 49-run victory by the DLS method.",
    "Similar resilience will be needed here for Perth to pull of a shock win, but don't count against the Scorchers exacting revenge over the Sixers in the very best way possible.",
