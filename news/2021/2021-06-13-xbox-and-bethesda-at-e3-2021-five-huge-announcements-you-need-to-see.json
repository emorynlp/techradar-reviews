  "article": [
    "Xbox and Bethesda combined forces to deliver their first joint E3 conference since Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media in September last year.",
    "It was a blockbuster show full of exciting reveals and updates, but if you want to trim the fat, we\u2019ve got all of the details on the five biggest announcements from the show right here.",
    "From Starfield to Redfall, and everything in between, here are the biggest announcements from the Xbox and Bethesda games showcase at E3 2021.",
    "Todd Howard kicked things off with one of the biggest reveals of the show. 25 years in the making, Starfield is described as a next-generation role-playing epic about hope and our shared humanity, and it finally has a release date.",
    "During the Xbox conference, we got our first look at in-engine visuals from the game, which was first teased back in 2018. The video introduced us to one of Starfield\u2019s characters, who is part of a spacefaring movement called \u201cConstellation\u201d, described as \u201cthe last group of space explorers\u201d. Players will take part in \u201cthe beginning of humanity\u2019s final journey,\u201d and explore many worlds.",
    "The other big piece of Starfield news is that it\u2019s coming out on November 11, 2022. And if you were wondering if future Bethesda games would be Xbox-exclusive after Microsoft\u2019s landmark 2020 acquisition, then we got a compelling answer here, one that was echoed throughout the show. As well as coming to PC, Starfield will be an Xbox console exclusive. Xbox Game Pass subscribers will also be able to access it on launch day.",
    "Xbox revealed a wholly new game during the opening of its E3 conference, soundtracked by Steely Dan\u2019s \u2018Do It Again\u2019. Contraband is a co-op open-world game in development from Avalanche Studios, the developers behind Just Cause and Mad Max.",
    "It looks like you\u2019ll play as treasure hunters, as the video showed a master plan for stealing loot from a fireproof safe. The footage also gave us a tiny glimpse at some of Contraband\u2019s characters. Stuck in time, they were spotted reclining, likely discussing the next big score and fixing up a mucky truck. The game has a distinct 1970s theme, judging by the decor.",
    "Sadly we didn\u2019t get any indication of a release date for Contraband, but it\u2019s coming to Xbox Game Pass day one, and it will be an Xbox console exclusive. It sounds promising, especially for fans of the chaotic action and brilliant movement tech featured in Avalanche\u2019s earlier games.",
    "Thanks to a wonderfully irreverent trailer from Obsidian, we learned that the studio is currently hard at work on a sequel to 2019\u2019s The Outer Worlds. The Outer Worlds 2 is exclusive to Xbox, so that means it\u2019s coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, Windows 10 and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Xbox Game Pass subscribers will also be able to play it on launch day, the trailer revealed.",
    "But uh, as for the trailer\u2019s contents, the narrator made it clear that nothing is finished just yet, except for the game\u2019s title. The CGI visuals were striking though, and there\u2019s definitely scope to expand The Outer Worlds IP into a series of space-faring role-playing games. It\u2019s just a shame that hulking trailer monster won\u2019t be in the game, apparently. Sadly there was no gameplay to show just yet, but we\u2019ll surely see it in time. Naturally, there\u2019s also no word on a release date either, but at least we know it\u2019s on the way!",
    "Playground Games revealed Forza Horizon 5 during the Xbox conference, and it\u2019s set in Mexico. The sequel to 2018\u2019s Forza Horizon 4 has some serious biodiversity, as the gameplay showed cars racing through detailed small towns and across volcanic mountain ranges.",
    "The wider preview showed that real players can link up and play together with very few strings attached thanks to upgraded server technology and the \u2018Forza Link\u2019 artificial intelligence system. One clip showed players seamlessly jumping into an event where they had to pop pinatas to win. Another more arcade-focused event had cars smashing into bowling pins in a manmade arena.",
    "The end of the trailer revealed that Forza Horizon 5 is coming to Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PC and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Xbox Game Pass subscribers will also be able to check out Forza Horizon 5 on launch day, which is November 9, later this year.",
    "Xbox closed the show with a huge reveal. Redfall is the next game from Arkane Austin (Prey, Dishonored) and it\u2019s an open-world co-op shooter coming in Summer 2022 (so sometime between June and August). Redfall is named after the game\u2019s setting, a town in Massachusetts where vampires have blocked out the sun.",
    "Redfall stars four characters, Devinder Crousley, Layla Ellison, Jacob Boyle and Remi De La Rosa. The trailer showed the four vampire hunters fighting hordes of bloodsuckers with robots and supernatural powers. The game\u2019s website claims that Redfall is going to blend single and multiplayer options seamlessly, which means that you can have fun solo or with a group of four friends in co-op. There will also be \u201cdifferent hero loadouts\u201d available to fine-tune your hunter and up the variety.",
    "Redfall is an Xbox console exclusive, which means it\u2019s launching on Xbox and PC, and not PlayStation. It will also be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on launch day, which is sometime in Summer 2022."
