    "While Prime Day deals may be offering some great prices on the latest tech and big fashion brands, Amazon doesn't have a monopoly on discounts today. Plenty of retailers like Best Buy and Walmart have also launched their own sales, and you'll find many exclusive discounts beating out Amazon's own Prime Day deals at these stores as well.",
    "Whether it's because Amazon simply hasn't dropped the price on certain items, or stock has run out at the online giant, there are plenty of competing Prime Day deals that Amazon definitely doesn't want you to know about. But we've found them...",
    "Highlights include Nintendo Switch games from $39.88 at Walmart ($10 less than Amazon), a $100 saving on the 2020 iPad Pro at B&H Photo (Amazon has run out of stock here) and a $34.99 price tag on a 6qt mult-cooker at Best Buy that Amazon is still charging around $60 for.",
    "These deals highlight just how important it is to price match even the best-looking offers from Amazon. While the online retail giant is known for price-matching its competitors, there are some products it simply can't discount as well as other stores. That's usually down to stock issues or retailer-exclusive brands offering their own price cuts, which is why there are plenty of competing offers today outside of Amazon on both the hottest tech and budget items.",
    "You'll find all the best Prime Day deals you won't need a Prime membership to buy just below, with our top picks further down the page.",
    "We're rounding up plenty more Best Buy Prime Day deals, but also scanning for all the best Prime Day laptop deals and Prime Day TV deals from around the web as well."
