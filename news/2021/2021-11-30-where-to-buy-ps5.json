    "If you're still wondering where to buy a PS5 you're not alone. Those looking to make the most of the next generation are still hunting for those all-important PS5 consoles, but knowing where to focus your search can make all the difference. We're here to bring you all the latest info on this page with regular updates throughout the week.",
    "Latest: PS5 restocks are coming in thick and fast as we approach Christmas. A PS5 restock at Walmart was available on December 8 for Walmart+ members. For those in the UK, consoles were available at Currys, PlayStation Direct and Very, including a few Digital Edition bundles. It's strongly rumoured that Game will have more consoles on December 9 or 10.",
    "We've seen more regular drops at certain retailers, like Best Buy and Walmart in the US, and Very and Game in the UK, but you'll find all the retailers that have offered the chance to buy PS5 recently just below.",
    "We're hoping there will be more consoles in stock before the year is out but it's going to be one of the year's hottest items before Christmas so competition will be tough. If you're lucky enough to secure a console, do keep an eye on our guide to all the best PS5 deals so you can snag a bargain on some games or accessories. You can also find the best PS Plus deals to get a cheap membership to with your new console if you're successful.",
    "If you're getting desperate to buy PS5, it can be tempting to head over to a reseller site. However, even though stock can be snapped up quickly it's not impossible to get your hands on the next-gen console. We'd recommend staying well clear of these price hiked sites and instead sticking with retailers you know and trust.",
    "The US stores below carry PS5 and Digital Edition consoles regularly. We update this list as soon as we get news of an upcoming restock with the announced (or rumoured) time and date so you can be best prepared to bag a console.",
    "Check the quick links below to find out where to buy PS5 in the UK today. With PS5 stock regularly hitting the country at least every couple of weeks, your chances of getting a console have increased considerably as of late.",
    "It's not easy to buy PS5 today, so you'll find answers to some of the top questions many shoppers have right now just below.",
    "The PS5 is currently out of stock at most retailers but PS5 restocks have been popping up over the last few weeks, with the Sony Direct queue and Target offering more chances to buy PS5 in the US and over in the UK rumors are spinning of a massive PS5 restock hitting over January.",
    "We'll keep you update when and where you can get your hands on PS5 stock as soon as it becomes available.",
    "If you've missed out on PS5 stock until now, don't panic. It's likely retailers will offer up more chances to buy PS5 in the near future. These opportunities will all be equally competitive, however, so you'll want to stay tuned for the latest updates right here.",
    "With stock looking low and delivery dates being pushed back, it's worth wondering if you need to buy PS5 today. In general, we would say that the earlier you can get your hands on Sony's next-generation console the better. We don't know what stock is going to look like for the next few months so the sooner your delivery date (however delayed that might be from today) the better.",
    "However, if you're after bundle deals and can hold off, you might want to think about buying PS5 when stock settles down further into the new year.",
    "The PS5 price is $499 (\u00a3449 / AU$749.95). That puts it at the same price point as the Xbox Series X, but that shouldn't come as a surprise to many, seeing as it's difficult to imagine the PS5 price exceeding $500 when it's up against the affordable spread put out by Microsoft.",
    "However, the cheaper PS5 Digital Edition price is $399.99 (\u00a3359.99 / AU$599.95), which does flag some concerns considering the Xbox Series S's $299 price tag. However, the PS5 Digital Edition will run the same specs as the fully-fledged console, further cementing its position in the market as a high value for money option.",
    "That means bargain hunters can still experience everything the PS5 has to offer while foregoing the opportunity to play physical PS4 and PS5 games or save cash by buying in the second-hand market. It's an excellent proposition that will certainly capture those going for sheer value for money at launch.",
    "You can buy one of two version of the PS5 today - the standard disk version, or the Digital Edition. The former allows you to play your physical PS4 and PS5 games, however you can still access your downloaded PS4 titles on the Digital Edition as well.",
    "The cheaper \u00a3359 PS5 Digital Edition doesn't have a disk drive, but still runs the same specs as the full fat console. That means you can buy PS5 for less today and you'll still be running the latest tech from Sony.",
    "However, there's only 825GB in this SSD and that's going to fill up quickly, provided you don't grab an external HDD for your PS4 games. If you've got a substantial physical collection already then it might be worth upgrading to the main console.",
    "That said, it's difficult to buy PS5 either way right now, with launch seeing an incredibly limited number of consoles hitting the shelves. While we wouldn't necessarily advise settling for the console you can get (there's going to be more chances to buy PS5 in the future, and it's a lot of cash to be taking second best with), if you're set on buying PS5 today you might have to take what you find.",
    "You'll need some new gear when you do buy PS5 - check out the best PS5 accessories, the latest PS5 game deals, the best DualSense PS5 controller deals and new Pulse 3D headset stock."
