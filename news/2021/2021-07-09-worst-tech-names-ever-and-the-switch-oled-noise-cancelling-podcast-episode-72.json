    "We begin this week's episode by chatting about the worst tech product names of all time. We also introduce a new gadget into our hall of fame, the PlayStation Portable.",
    "After the Sony Xperia 1 III launch, we spend some time reminiscing about some of the best Sony smartphones ever made, and also discuss why Sony still can't make an impact on the modern smartphone market. We also talk about the recently announced Nintendo Switch OLED, Motorola and why MagSafe on iPhone 12 isn't a bigger deal.",
