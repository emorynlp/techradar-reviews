    "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\u2019s rumored large-scale zombies mode may have just been accidentally confirmed by Activision.",
    "As spotted by Call of Duty leaker Okami, a page briefly appeared on the official Call of Duty website reading, \u201cWelcome to Outbreak \u2013 a new, large-scale zombies experience.\u201d",
    "The page also included a \u2018watch trailer\u2019 button, which suggests we could be getting an official reveal of the new game mode \u2013 along with an announcement trailer \u2013 very soon.",
    "The news comes merely a week after the same tipster shared details of the upcoming Outbreak mode, rumored to be a \u201cTreyarch-style, co-op zombies [mode] on a large-scale Fireteam map.\u201d Okami then adds that it\u2019s been described by the developers as \u201copen world zombies,\u201d which suggests Outbreak could borrow elements from the franchise\u2019s hugely successful Warzone mode.",
    "It seems likely that Activision will launch Cold War\u2019s Outbreak mode alongside Season 2 of Warzone.",
    "A series of recent events in Verdansk (thanks, PC Gamer) suggest the new zombies mode will somehow be integrated into the Warzone experience. Players have spotted references to the original zombies mode in the battle royale maps themselves, including a trial machine in the Hospital and Stadium maps which triggers a \u201cZAI/ACTIVATE_ZOMBIES\" prompt when approached.",
    "Rumors are also swirling that the developer is building an entire event around the new large-scale zombies experience. Following the original tweet, Okami suggests Outbreak will \u201cbe a bigger deal than people realize.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s unclear whether the upcoming Outbreak mode was intentionally leaked on the Call of Duty website to garner interest in the new experience, or indeed some unlucky schmuck over at Activision was a little too quick to push the \u2018publish\u2019 button.",
    "In any case, a bigger and better zombies mode is coming \u2013 lock and load.",
