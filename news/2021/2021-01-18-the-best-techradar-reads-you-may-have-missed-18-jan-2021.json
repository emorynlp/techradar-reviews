  "article": [
    "Ah, the weekend. A time for living in your slippers and switching off from the general madness that continues to swirl around you \u2013 and who can blame you? But just because your brain enjoyed a few days of well-earned rest doesn\u2019t mean the world of tech ground to a halt. With CES 2021 coming to a close, it\u2019s been a busy few days for everything from OLED displays to robot butlers, so we\u2019ve gone ahead and wrapped up the best tech news of the week in a neat little package for you.",
    "So, what\u2019s been happening? Well, it\u2019s been a busy week for a certain South Korean behemoth. For starters, we spent 24 hours with the Samsung Galaxy S21, and below we detail our five key takeaways from our time with the device. We\u2019ve also gone ahead and hosted the royal rumble of Samsung Galaxy Buds so you can figure out which pair is right for you.",
    "There\u2019s also a host of exciting gaming, TV and computing news for you to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re after something a little less visually-demanding (we understand), you\u2019ll be pleased to learn we\u2019ve snuck the latest episode of the TechRadar Noise Cancelling Podcast at the end of the article for your convenient listening pleasure.",
    "Less of a three-course-meal and more of a speed date, we spent 24 hours with the Samsung Galaxy S21 and had\u2026 some thoughts. From changes to the fingerprint scanner to the redesigned camera bump, Samsung\u2019s latest flagship iteration has enjoyed some refreshing updates.",
    "You\u2019ll have to wait for the full review for our final opinion on the next-gen phone, but for now we can bring you the top five things we\u2019ve learned about the Samsung Galaxy S21 in our first 24 hours.",

    "What do you get if you put the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, the Galaxy Buds Live and the Galaxy Buds Plus in a room together? Well, you get our comparison piece.",
    "We put their respective designs, audio performance, battery life and more to the test to bring you a detailed round-up of the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to Samsung\u2019s range of wireless earbuds.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "Finally, after what seems like a whole year (did something happen in 2020?), the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe adventure is here. WandaVision has dropped on Disney Plus, and turns Avengers Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) and Vision into a married couple at the center of their very own sitcom.",
    "But when the hell is it set? We detail the ins and outs of where WandaVision fits into the labyrinthine timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and provide some handy explanations as to what happened to Vision after that finger-snap in Avengers: Infinity War.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "It\u2019s no secret that Microsoft\u2019s diminutive tower of power is a fantastic console. The Xbox Series X is packed to the rafters with great tech, and a few more next-gen games could see it properly flex its power-laden muscles \u2013 but, for now, there\u2019s a handful of PS5 features that give Sony\u2019s latest hardware the edge.",
    "Some are trivial (convenient mute settings), but some are almost essential (have you seen that controller?), and here we break down the 5 PS5 features we wish were on the Xbox Series X.",

    "CES wouldn\u2019t be CES without a slew of laptop announcements to get the gamers, designers and photographers of the world excited, and this year\u2019s event was no different.",
    "Could this be the year of the Chromebook? New entries from Samsung and Acer suggest it might be. Plus, we dish the dirt on some of the weirdest and wackiest laptop designs we\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 Lenovo, is everything ok?",

    "Zelda fans, unite! February 21 marks the 35th anniversary of Nintendo\u2019s flagship franchise, and we\u2019re expecting something big after the Japanese giant pulled out the stops last year for the same Mario anniversary.",
    "Other than the Breath of the Wild 2 game we haven\u2019t heard a whisper about since a trailer dropped at E3 2019, could we expect a new AAA Zelda title? From original adventures to remasters of old favourites, we\u2019ve rounded up everything we want to see for The Legend of Zelda\u2019s 35th anniversary.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "In perhaps the most unglamorous \u2013 but nonetheless important \u2013 news of the week, both Samsung and LG have unveiled a tripod TV stand for their premium sets.",
    "Three-legged floor stands will be available for Samsung\u2019s 2021 iteration of The Frame and LG\u2019s Gallery Series OLED display \u2013 because even the most powerful TVs need a little support sometimes. While not the most ground-breaking revelation to emerge from CES, the like-minded announcements represent a rare moment of unity among two industry heavyweights constantly at each other's throats.",
