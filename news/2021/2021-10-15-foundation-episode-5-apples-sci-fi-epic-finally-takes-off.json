    "Major spoilers follow for Foundation episodes 1 to 5. Watch them first before reading on.",
    "There\u2019s something pleasingly symbolic about Upon Awakening, Foundation episode 5\u2019s title.",
    "Until now, Apple TV Plus\u2019 sci-fi saga has been sleepwalking, with its sluggish plot and lack of action doing little to stir it to life.",
    "Upon Awakening changes all of that. Rousing from its slumber, Foundation\u2019s fifth episode is an absorbing entry that provides compelling mystery and some much-needed combat in equal measure.",
    "Like previous entries in the series, Foundation episode 5 follows two storylines. For the first time in season 1, though, Trantor isn\u2019t the focus of one of these narratives. It\u2019s a welcome change: taking a break from the Galactic Empire's politics-heavy story, Foundation pivots towards plots that are as important (if not more so) to its overarching tale while showing that the galaxy's rulers aren't as in control of the wider universe as they think they are.",
    "Having spent two episodes floating in space in her stasis pod, it\u2019s finally time to reunite with Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell). And boy, there\u2019s a lot for her to catch up on.",
    "Rather than pick up events immediately after episode 4\u2019s final scene, where Gaal\u2019s pod was recovered by a mysterious spaceship, though, Upon Awakening initially focuses on her backstory.",
    "At first, it appears to be an unnecessary use of episode 5\u2019s time. We\u2019re already aware that Gaal is shunned by Synnax\u2019s population due to her scientific studies, and that she left her home to become the prodigy of Hari Seldon (Jared Harris).",
    "And yet learning more about Gaal\u2019s past is genuinely interesting. We find out why she turned her back on her religion, how she came to Seldon\u2019s attention and the disdain that Synnax\u2019s population holds for her heretical beliefs. Like episodes 1 and 4, it presents an intriguing debate about the ongoing battle between religion and science (and their values) in our societies: one that, even though Foundation takes place in the far future, still doesn\u2019t have an easy resolution.",
    "These flashbacks also show how afflicted Gaal is as a character. She\u2019s torn between her vocation and her family\u2019s religious values but, like any well-written protagonist, she follows her instincts and sets herself on a potential path to greatness. Clearly, Seldon has big plans for Gaal, so it\u2019s pleasing to gain more insight into one of Foundation\u2019s prominent characters, even if it\u2019s a couple of episodes late.",
    "Her significance to Foundation\u2019s wider plot is underlined when episode 5 returns to the present day. After she\u2019s awakened from her cryosleep, Gaal searches for answers concerning the ship that she\u2019s on, what happened to Hari and Raych Seldon (Alfred Enoch) and, most importantly, where she is in the cosmos.",
    "As it turns out, Gaal is alone on the spaceship \u2013 a whole segment that plays out with horror genre sensibilities. There\u2019s an eeriness to proceedings as she explores the vessel, with the lighting, atmosphere and tone of the sequence very Alien-like in style.",
    "It isn\u2019t long before answers present themselves. Using the ship\u2019s AI assistant (one not too dissimilar from 2001: A Space Odyssey\u2019s HAL), Gaal is astonished to learn that she\u2019s been in stasis for 34 years. Video recordings also reveal that Hari died from his stab wounds, while Raych was executed for murdering his stepfather.",
    "Given that we haven\u2019t spent any time with Hari or Raych since episode 2\u2019s shocking ending, both scenes are surprisingly emotional. Part of that is down to Llobell\u2019s superb acting in both moments \u2013 her anguish clearly palpable \u2013 but Foundation has struggled to work as an emotionally moving show until this point. Let\u2019s hope that it can build on the momentum generated by these scenes and provide equally emotive sequences in future episodes.",
    "Events that transpire during Upon Awakening\u2019s Terminus storyline are similarly moving.",
    "Unbeknownst to Salvor Hardin (Leak Harvey) and the Foundation\u2019s other leaders, the Anacreons wanted them to arrest and interrogate Phara (Kubbra Sait). Taken to Terminus City\u2019s main tower, Phara ends up detonating a field disruptor that causes the settlement\u2019s defenses to fail, allowing Anacreon\u2019s invading forces to attack.",
    "After three episodes of waiting, it\u2019s about time, too, even if the battle itself is a little hit and miss. Some close-quarters combat, such as Salvor and Phara\u2019s fight, come across as a bit amateurish, and the battle as a whole isn\u2019t a giant spectacle by any means. Still, any form of conflict is a welcome addition at Foundation\u2019s halfway stage.",
    "Terminus City\u2019s small band of armed forces do their best to withstand the assault, but it\u2019s all for nothing. Despite rescuing her mother Mari (Sasha Behar) from Phara\u2019s clutches, Salvor and Mari are recaptured and made to watch as Terminus City is raised to the ground.",
    "An imperial warship, sent by the Galactic Empire to find out why Terminus\u2019 communications array had gone offline, ends up entering the fight to try and aid the city\u2019s citizens. The Anacreon flak cannon set in episode 4, however, deals huge damage to its hull and it crashes to the surface below. The resulting CGI explosion is a sight to behold and, even though those on board are loyal to the Empire\u2019s unlikeable rulers, it\u2019s still hard to watch them perish.",
    "That\u2019s true of everyone who dies, seemingly including Daniel MacPherson\u2019s Hugo, during Anacreon\u2019s retaliatory attack. Upon Awakening isn\u2019t messing about with how often it tugs on the heartstrings: it feels like it\u2019s making up for lost time due to the lack of similar moments in other episodes.",
    "If there\u2019s one part of episode 5 that\u2019s dissatisfying, it\u2019s the constant jumps between storylines. Again. Compared to its predecessors, Upon Awakening is well paced until it reaches its midway point. Its first 23 minutes focus solely on Gaal\u2019s story and, while that makes episode 5 easier to follow, it also helps with the episode\u2019s overall flow.",
    "Once Terminus\u2019 plot is introduced, Upon Awakening regularly alternates between its two tales \u2013 and it\u2019s annoying. From a plot structure perspective, Foundation\u2019s episodes work better when they follow one storyline at a time. Episode 3 had a similar story structure to Upon Awakening, and its first half (centered solely on Trantor) was subsequently more cohesive.",
    "While Foundation\u2019s episodic structuring continues to be a sore point, the show has done a solid job at setting up its cliffhanger endings, and Upon Awakening is no different. Gaal learns that the ship is heading to Helicon, Hari\u2019s home world, which isn\u2019t an ideal destination as she believes that Helicon\u2019s population thinks she was an accomplice in Hari\u2019s death.",
    "Moments later, though, she spots a holographic projection of the dying mathematician near to the ship\u2019s AI interface. It\u2019s unclear what all of this means, but hopefully we\u2019ll find out next week. It was something of a long wait to find out what happened to Gaal after episode 2: fingers crossed that another lengthy pause isn\u2019t on the cards.",
    "Upon Awakening is Foundation\u2019s best episode so far. We don\u2019t get the big battle that we thought we would, but what we do receive is something far better than a 45-minute set piece.",
    "In devoting plenty of screen time to Gaal, one of Foundation\u2019s most important characters, episode 5 delivers richer character development than we\u2019ve been used to. Its focus on a solitary individual\u2019s journey sets it apart from what\u2019s come before, proving that Foundation\u2019s constant location jumps aren\u2019t vital to its success.",
    "Episode 5\u2019s methodical unraveling of the mystery surrounding Hari, Raych and Gaal is a huge plus point, so we\u2019re keen to see more of this form of storytelling moving forward. There are moments in Upon Awakening that leave a lump in the throat, too, which goes some way to rectifying problems that we\u2019ve had with Foundation\u2019s emotionally cold exterior.",
    "\u201cYou can\u2019t lose faith in the plan\u201d, Raych says during an episode 5 flashback \u2013 and he\u2019s right. Based on how good Foundation\u2019s latest entry is, we can\u2019t completely write this show off just yet.",
