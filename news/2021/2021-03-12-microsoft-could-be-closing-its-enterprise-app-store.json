    "Update: Microsoft told TechRadar Pro in a statement that, \"(W)e announced via Microsoft Docsc two feature updates to the Microsoft Store for Business and Education. We have nothing further to share at this time.\"",
    "Microsoft has apparently started emailing Windows 10 customers notifying them about new restrictions in the Microsoft Store for Business and Education, signalling a move towards its imminent closure.",
    "The app store, which carried custom apps and tools to cater to business and education users, went live in the summer of 2015. ZDNet had previously gotten wind of Microsoft\u2019s plans to shutter the store in an effort to streamline its various app store offerings.",
    "\u201cStarting April 14, 2021 all apps made available for a base price above \u201cfree\u201d will no longer be available for acquisition in the Microsoft Store for Business and Education,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s email, shared by Twitter user @hoyty, read.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s email explains that existing users who\u2019ve already purchased apps through the business store will be able to use the apps and continue to receive updates. What they won\u2019t be able to do however, is to buy additional licenses or purchase new apps from next month.",
    "The message goes on to suggest that in case users need to buy additional licenses, post April 14, they\u2019ll have to engage directly with the app publisher. This again points to the eminent demise of the business store as a means of acquiring apps.",
    "Notably, Microsoft hasn\u2019t officially commented on this change nor have they publicly discussed their future plans for the business store.",
    "TechRadarPro has reached out to the Microsoft for comment but we haven't heard back from the company yet.",
