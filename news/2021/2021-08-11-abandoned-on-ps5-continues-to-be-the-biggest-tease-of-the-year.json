    "After another public no-show, we still haven\u2019t seen Abandoned on PS5. And more to the point, despite being announced in April on the PlayStation Blog, it\u2019s hard to say with conviction what type of game Abandoned really is.",
    "What it could be, however, has people really excited.",
    "A new trailer for Abandoned was supposed to be released on August 10, but it never materialized due to technical difficulties that seemingly couldn\u2019t be resolved. That may sound odd, considering dropping a trailer on YouTube is hardly the greatest technical feat to accomplish, but Abandoned is using a native PS5 app to offer a \u201crealtime experience\u201d when it comes to the game\u2019s trailers.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time the developer Blue Box Game Studios has delayed its Abandoned reveal trailer, as it was initially supposed to arrive in June. Load up the app now, which is available to download from the PlayStation Store, and you\u2019ll be greeted with a \u201cCheck back soon\u2026\u201d message.",
    "Abandoned has been shrouded in mystery ever since its reveal, and has somehow managed to spawn more wild conspiracy theories than you\u2019d hear at a flat-earthers' convention. From being a secret Hideo Kojima project to Silent Hill, it\u2019s hard to keep track of it all unless you have an evidence board to hand.",
    "Blue Box Game Studios hasn\u2019t exactly done itself any favors, either. The studio has previously teased a blurred image of what appeared to be a figure wearing an eye-patch (Solid Snake, anyone?) and wrote what can only be considered as an ill-advised tweet, asking fans to guess the letters between S and L. Of course, everybody replied \u201cSilent Hill\u201d.",
    "The sheer number of conspiracies have led the Abandoned dev team to publicly deny any links to Konami and Hideo Kojima, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the Twittersphere from continually piecing bits of evidence together to make surprisingly plausible links. Even the studio\u2019s Twitter handle is a little suspect: @BBGameStudios. As Death Stranding fans will know, a BB is a Bridge Baby, which is a key component in Hideo Kojima\u2019s last game.",
    "In fact, the most recent teaser from Blue Box Game Studios shows a man walking towards what appears to be an open door. The man is wearing a green coat, jeans and fairly smart-looking shoes. That wouldn\u2019t mean much in any other game, but it\u2019s almost a match for the outfit worn by James Sunderland in\u2026 Silent Hill.",
    "What we do know is that Abandoned is a first-person \u201ccinematic survival sim\u201d that\u2019s supposed to arrive on PS5 later this year. And, whatever the hell it turns out to be, the game\u2019s marketing team are either geniuses or off their rocker.",
    "If there\u2019s one thing that won\u2019t be abandoned anytime soon, it\u2019s the hype for a PS5 game that almost everyone has an opinion on. Until we hear more, you can expect speculation to be rife, ridiculous and sometimes\u2026 dangerously believable."
