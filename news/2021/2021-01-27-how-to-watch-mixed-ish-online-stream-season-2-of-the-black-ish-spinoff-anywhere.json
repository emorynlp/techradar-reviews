    "Arica Himmel and Tracee Ellis Ross are back on our screens to guide us through another eye-opening, heart-breaking and hilarious chapter of the life of as Bow Johnson, as she struggles to work out where she fits in the world around her while growing up in a mixed-race family in the 1980s. Follow our guide as we explain how to watch Mixed-ish season 2 online wherever you are.",
    "Bow, along with brother and sister Johan and Santamonica, have been unceremoniously extracted from their idyllic former existence in a commune, which we will not talk about, and plunged into a mainstream school in the suburbs.",
    "Oh, and not only are the Johnsons the only mixed-race kids anyone there has ever come across, their new classmates are all to happy to point out every single way in which Bow, Johan and Santamonica are different from them.",
    "As if growing up wasn't confusing enough.",
    "From Johan pretending not to be mixed race, to Alicia and Denise arguing over who the stronger black woman is, to a classic case of puppy love, season 2 of Mixed-ish navigates a whole new minefield of issues related to race, family and identity, all set against a backdrop that tends to be far from progressive and understanding.",
    "Read on as we explain how to watch Mixed-ish season 2 online and stream new episodes of the hit show from anywhere today.",
    "Those who already have a streaming service they use to watch Mixed-ish online may find themselves unable to access it when abroad, due to pesky geo-blocking restrictions. While we're aware that most people aren't going anywhere in the immediate future, you may be stuck abroad for any number of reasons.",
    "Fortunately, there's an easy solution to geo-blocking. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite shows no matter where you are. This simple bit of software changes your IP address so that you can access episodes on demand just like you would at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Mixed-ish online from abroad",
    "And don't forget that a VPN isn't just for TV - there's loads you can do with these clever bits of software. From unblocking restricted sites and watching Netflix in other countries, to adding an extra layer of security for online shopping and banking, Virtual Private Networks offer loads of benefits beyond streaming TV."
