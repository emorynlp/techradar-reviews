  "summary": "The iPhone 13 range could be getting all sorts of upgrades",
  "article": [
    "New iPhone models tend to excel in most areas, but one thing they\u2019re a bit inconsistent about is battery life, with some performing well, and others \u2013 such as the iPhone 12 \u2013 just performing okay. The iPhone 13, though, might have a battery boost according to the latest leak.",
    "That\u2019s according to Ming-Chi Kuo (an analyst with a great track record for Apple leaks). He claims in an investor note obtained by 9to5Mac that the iPhone 13 will have a larger battery capacity than the iPhone 12, making the device heavier in the process.",
    "He doesn\u2019t say how big the iPhone 13\u2019s battery will be, but with the one in the iPhone 12 being just 2,815mAh, there\u2019s certainly room for improvement.",
    "And that\u2019s not all he had to say. Kuo also claimed that the iPhone 13 range would have smaller notches and that the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max will have a 120Hz refresh rate and use more power-efficient LTPO technology \u2013 things that have already been extensively rumored.",
    "Other information in this investor note includes that the new models will apparently be the same sizes as the current ones, and that they\u2019ll all include a Lightning connector (rather than being USB-C or portless). There will apparently be four iPhone 13 models too, just like with the iPhone 12 range, so it sounds like the mini model is here to stay.",
    "While some sources suggest the iPhone 13 will have a fingerprint scanner (possibly an in-screen one), Kuo disagrees, but he does think the Pro models will have an upgraded ultra-wide camera, going from a five-element f/2.4 fixed focus lens on the current models to a six-element f/1.8 one with autofocus on the upcoming phones. This is something he\u2019s said before, so he\u2019s just reiterating it here.",
    "Other details include a claim that LiDAR will once again be reserved for the Pro models, the 5G modem will be upgraded, with the iPhone 13 range apparently using the newer Qualcomm X60M, and the phones will supposedly sport space-saving designs, with their SIM card slots integrated into the mainboard. This might be how Apple is finding space to increase the battery size.",
    "Of course, nothing is certain yet. While Kuo is a reputable source, we\u2019re also a long way out from the likely September launch of the iPhone 13 range, so we wouldn\u2019t be confident of any leaks yet. Still, things like 120Hz screens and smaller notches have leaked enough that they\u2019re looking fairly likely."
