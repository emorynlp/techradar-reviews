    "When I was in college over a decade ago, I spent hundreds of hours in front of a 19-inch Samsung LED-LCD TV that had a max resolution of 720p. It was fine for the time \u2013 HDMI was still new at the time, after all, and it felt cutting-edge \u2013 but it still cost me hundreds of dollars for a TV that really wasn't that good.",
    "That's par for the course. Everyone buys something cheap to get them through school. But when I got out, I still used that TV for another four years. At that point, I really wish I splurged on something nicer... something like the 48-inch LG CX OLED.",
    "What I hadn't considered is just how much time I'd spend huddled around that 19-inch screen. I used it for work. I used it to game. Heck, I used it to host movie nights. I used it for basically everything and, had I known that, I probably would\u2019ve paid a bit more money to get something I truly loved.",
    "Admittedly, there was nothing quite as advanced as the LG CX OLED available at the time I graduated in 2012 and the closest I could\u2019ve gotten was a decently sized plasma screen \u2013 which was also pretty pricey at the time \u2013 but I can\u2019t help but feel like all that time I spent in front the TV would\u2019ve been more enjoyable had I just sprung for higher-end screen.",
    "Let me start off by saying that I don\u2019t think that an OLED is a great investment for everyone, especially if you're not necessarily a TV watcher. But if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s planning on spending hours every day in front of a screen for work, play and fun, then it\u2019s probably worth considering if it fits into your budget.",
    "The reason I\u2019d recommend an OLED \u2013 specifically the CX OLED \u2013 is that it\u2019s currently one of the best all-around TVs. It\u2019s great for TV and movie watching thanks to its outstanding black levels, while gamers can use it as both a 120Hz gaming monitor or in tandem with the PS5 or Xbox Series X.",
    "It has larger viewing angles than an LED-LCD TV, which means it\u2019s great for hosting people, too, and at just 48-inches you should be able to squeeze it into an on-campus apartment or even a large dorm room without a problem.",
    "The LG CX is expensive when you\u2019re first striking out on your own \u2013 and might even be a risky investment if you live somewhere where the TV could get damaged \u2013 but if you\u2019re the kind of person who takes care of their gear and doesn\u2019t mind spending a bit more for quality, then you should definitely give the LG CX OLED some consideration."
