    "Finding the best free android apps on the Google Play Store can be a real chore, what with all the options out there. Who knew, when Google launched Android 13 years ago, that there would be this many available apps to choose from. You can find one to cater for every need, whim, or desire. And, a lot of them come with that magic price tag, free, so that you\u2019re just a few clicks away from taking your phone to the next level.",
    "But, just because there\u2019s such a glut of apps out there doesn\u2019t mean that most of them are quality. There\u2019s a lot that you should probably skip. In fact, the Play Store gives you a lot of tools to parse through all the noise, from Editor\u2019s Picks for different categories to recommendations for new releases or for apps based on your prior downloads.",
    "You can also narrow the search by reading reviews and ratings or searching for an app you have and seeing what similar results pop up.",
    "With that said, there are so many in the store\u2019s library, that a free android app that\u2019s worth downloading can still get lost in the shuffle. To help you find the best android apps that are free, we\u2019ve collected our top picks here to make sure you have all the apps you could want or need on your phone or tablet, sorted into categories so you can more easily find what you're looking for.",
    "Every few weeks we add a new app to this list and you'll find the latest addition below.",
    "It seems like everyone has a podcast these days, which can make sifting through them all and finding ones you\u2019re actually interested in a daunting prospect, but Moonbeam makes this a little easier.",
    "This is a podcast discovery app which lets you swipe through a feed of podcast clips. Each clip is a curated \u2018moment\u2019 \u2013 usually two or three minutes long, and it will fit into a category that you\u2019ve told the app you like, be that comedy, science or whatever else.",
    "If you like what you hear you can tap through to listen to the whole episode or subscribe. If you don\u2019t like it then a single swipe will take you to the next clip.",
    "So you can use Moonbeam to listen to podcasts as well as discover them, but it\u2019s not as full featured for that as some players. Still, it\u2019s easy enough to add any discoveries to your subscriptions in your podcast player of choice, so Moonbeam could complement another podcast app admirably."
