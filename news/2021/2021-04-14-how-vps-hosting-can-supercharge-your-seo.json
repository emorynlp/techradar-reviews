    "Hosting providers give you easy access to the online world but building a website is just the first step toward your project's success. How are you going to promote the site? What channels would bring you the most targeted audience? Should you go for paid ads, organic traffic, or a combination of both?",
    "While you have many business decisions ahead of you, the choice of a web hosting plan is the foundation everything lies upon. If your foundations are not solid - even the fanciest roof will crumble.",
    "Here is our take on one of the trendiest services in web hosting - virtual private servers.",
    "Hosting providers take advantage of a process called virtualization to split a single physical server into multiple virtual instances. The host allocates a dedicated set of system resources to every user and isolates each account in a caged environment, acting completely independently.",
    "VPS services solve many of the problems associated with shared hosting - oversold servers, resource hogging, hacker breaches from neighboring accounts.",
    "Compared to the next step you can take, renting an entire dedicated server, VPS platforms prove much more affordable while keeping most of the benefits.",
    "In terms of what's included in the package, there are two distinct types of VPS hosting - managed and unmanaged.",
    "If you're a beginner in the field and don't have much technical knowledge about server setup and management, going for a managed VPS deal would be your best bet. While slightly more expensive, this service lets you take advantage of the expert support team of your provider. Their role typically covers the initial server setup, hardware maintenance, software installation, updates, and technical issues. You can see how this extra help would be highly beneficial for startups and SMBs with less experience in the field.",
    "In comparison, unmanaged VPS solutions are definitely a better fit for the pros. The service includes the monthly rent of a bare-metal machine and probably some initial setup. You get full control of the server, so what you do with it is entirely up to you. As technical support is not included, though, you're on your own if you run into trouble. Managing a virtual server might be a breeze for experienced developers and web admins, but first-timers can find the service a bit overwhelming.",
    "Working closely with many providers on a daily basis, we can highlight ScalaHosting as one of the hosts that offer top-tier managed and unmanaged VPS solutions.",
    "Now for the good stuff.",
    "You have a reliable hosting provider and your website is already up and running - so what next?",
    "When promoting your online project, it's important to utilize multiple channels for the best effect. A proper SEO strategy should be among your first steps.",
    "SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and outlines the process of improving your website to get better rankings and more recognition in search engines. It is an ongoing process that has the potential to bring excellent organic traffic, and most importantly - it's absolutely free to employ.",
    "Understanding SEO is not the easiest thing in the world. There are over 200 factors involved, and search engine giants like Google do their best to keep their cards close when it comes to explaining how the algorithms work. Still, from what we know and have seen trough our own testing, there are numerous ways in which web hosting affects SEO.",
    "Apart from its business advantages, a great virtual private server can bring some search engine optimization benefits as well. These include:",
    "To summarize, your VPS host plays a key role in your SEO efforts. A great hosting provider will ensure your server is always up, running fast, and properly secured against unauthorized access. Combined with a suitable site-building tool, plugins, and a marketing strategy, you're already on the right path to impressing search engines and organic visitors."
