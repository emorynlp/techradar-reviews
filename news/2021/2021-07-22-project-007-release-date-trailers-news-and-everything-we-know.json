    "Project 007 is the working title for a brand new James Bond game from IO Interactive, the developer behind the popular Hitman game franchise.",
    "Details about Project 007 are scarce. But what we do know is the game is currently in development and it will be IO Interactive\u2019s next big release.",
    "IO Interactive first shared the news about Project 007 on Twitter, along with a short teaser trailer on a dedicated website for the game. Although the teaser doesn\u2019t show any gameplay, the website does reveal that the story is going to be about James Bond\u2019s origins and it\u2019ll be \u201ccompletely original\u201d to the game \u2013 that means IO Interactive won\u2019t be borrowing stories or even actors from previous James Bond movies.",
    "We love that the teaser trailer gives us a riff on that classic Bond intro sequence we all know and love. Watch it for yourself below.",
    "To say that there hasn't been a good Bond game in recent memory is an understatement. Throughout the storied history of James Bond video games, only a few have ever stood out.",
    "Chief among them, obviously, is GoldenEye 007, which came out on the N64 (1997). After that, the next best offering was 007 Nightfire on the PS2 which was released in 2002. While both of these games were seriously awesome, everything which came after them has been disappointing.",
    "Will we finally going to get a half-decent James Bond game with Project 007? Perhaps, we're hoping IO Interactive decides to keep the multiplayer options like team deathmatch and all the other brilliantly fun parts of versus.",
    "Given IO Interactive's track record, this Bond game could be one of the best spy sims to ever grace our consoles and PCs whenever it releases.",
    "Depending on how highly you value the Hitman games, you'll either be pleased or mildly indifferent to the fact that IO Interactive is taking the helm of this new project, as it shifts its focus away from the Hitman franchise.",
    "At the moment, further details on the project are few and far between, but an interview with IO Interactive's studio director did reveal that the upcoming game won't be based on any of the actors featured in the film series. Hakan Abrak described how his team \u201chave been allowed to make [their] own digital Bond, which will not lean on a Bond actor.\"",
    "In the past, almost all Bond games have relied upon the likeness to a big-screen actor as both a marketing tool and a way to ground the game narrative in a movie-like authenticity.",
    "In the interview, Abrak also confirmed the originality of the studio's take on Bond, suggesting players could take control of a much younger 007 than fans might be used to. It makes sense, then, that Project 007 won\u2019t be based on a Bond movie actor.",
    "Because IO Interactive is actively recruiting a team for Project 007, we can make guesses about the upcoming game based on the type of talent the developer is looking for. According to the IO job board, the developer is on the hunt for an AI programmer with experience working on third-person action games. This isn't surprising given that Hitman is a third person game.",
    "But we do know it might be a little different to the Hitman franchise based on another job listing. As GamesRadar reported back in February 2021, an IO job listing was looking for a writer to create \"character-driven scenes with substantial dialogue.\" We know there's not a great deal of that in Hitman, which suggests Project 007 could straddle the line between movie and game.",
    "There are no official details about when we can expect the new Project 007 game. Given we know that IO Interactive is still pulling together its development team, it could be a good few years before the new James Bond title sees the light of day.",
    "For now, we can probably expect to see this game release on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and PC, but we won't know definitively until we get more information as time goes on."
