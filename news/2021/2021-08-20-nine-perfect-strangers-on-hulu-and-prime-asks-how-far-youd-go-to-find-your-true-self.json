    "Nine Perfect Strangers is a miniseries about concealing the truth. The thrilling new drama, based on Liane Moriarty\u2019s 2018 novel of the same name, explores the lengths that people will go to in order to mask their insecurities and underlying trauma with fabricated personas.",
    "Set in the present day, Nine Perfect Strangers follows nine individuals \u2013 Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Frances, Michael Shannon\u2019s Napoleon and Luke Evans\u2019 Lee, among others \u2013 who gather at Tranquillum House, a wellness resort run by the mysterious Masha (Nicole Kidman).",
    "Here, the group embark on a 10-day retreat to heal their internal wounds and transform their lives \u2013 but it isn\u2019t long before the guests discover that Masha and her world-famous resort are hiding secrets of their own.",
    "Ahead of the series\u2019 launch on Hulu in the US and Amazon Prime Video in the UK, TechRadar sat down with star Manny Jacinto, who portrays Masha\u2019s loyal assistant Yao, to discuss how Nine Perfect Strangers examines the notion of facades and why we utilize them. We also chat about the love triangle involving the characters Masha, Delilah (Tiffany Boone) and Yao, and how it ties into the show\u2019s exploration of deceit.",
    "From the outset, Tranquillum House is deceptive in its appearance. The resort\u2019s location \u2013 a secluded, natural environment \u2013 and its employees seem perfect to the guests upon their arrival.",
    "The fact that the facade works so well is due to Yao\u2019s, and other Tranquillum employees\u2019, devotion to Masha. As Jacinto \u2013 who was drawn to the role by the prospect of working closely with Kidman \u2013 explains, Yao\u2019s unwavering faith in Masha is the result of the pair\u2019s meeting years prior. But being part of Tranquillum\u2019s inner circle doesn\u2019t mean Yao\u2019s own problems have simply vanished as a result of being Masha\u2019s closest confidante.",
    "\u201cYao is devoted to Masha almost to a fault,\u201d Jacinto says. \u201cHe has an incredible amount of loyalty towards her vision, what she wants to accomplish and to Masha in general. Yao is the calmer, glass half full aspect of Tranquillum\u2019s main trio [Masha, Delilah and Yao] but he\u2019s still trapped in this conflict of who he is and what he stands for.\u201d",
    "So, on the surface, Yao may seem like a composed individual. Underneath that serene exterior, though, an internal battle rages between his allegiance to Masha\u2019s ambitious plans and Delilah, who he\u2019s in a supposedly committed relationship with.",
    "It\u2019s the emergence of this love triangle that puts a strain on the trio\u2019s relationships with one another as the series progresses. As Jacinto reveals, though, the process of adapting their complex dynamic from page to screen was made easier by collaborating extensively with his co-stars before production began in July 2020.",
    "\u201cI remember doing my homework on Yao before filming started,\u201d Jacinto says. \u201cAnd then I had a conversation with Tiffany that changed my view of Yao about how he interacts with Delilah. Meeting with Nicole altered my perception further. Yao\u2019s trying to figure out how to juggle the woman he loves and the woman he\u2019s devoted to, so that created a lot of subtext and layers to Yao and who he represents.\u201d",
    "While Yao wrestles with his own internal issues, he still wants to help Tranquillum\u2019s guests to overcome their inner demons.",
    "In a miniseries that, in essence, acts as a microcosm of humanity\u2019s negative aspects \u2013 narcissism, impertinence and being self-absorbed, to name three \u2013 Yao\u2019s desire to alleviate guests\u2019 suffering comes from a genuinely kind-hearted place. In that sense, Yao is a symbolic representation of the good parts of human nature: characteristics that still exist but, in an increasingly divisive and cynical world, have become a rarity.",
    "For Jacinto, the opportunity to explore the positive and negative traits of being human, and the impact that they have on how much of our authentic selves we exhibit, was complex and interesting to tackle.",
    "\u201cI had to figure out why Yao was so devoted to this,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all rooted in the pursuit of self-improvement. Whether they [Tranquillum\u2019s guests] see it or not, Yao is there to guide them through it. He\u2019s gone through his own dark past and he can see what the benefits are with improving yourself personally. He can see himself in them and that they want to get better, so that\u2019s how I approached Yao as a character and anchored him in the idea of wanting to enlighten people and help them find what they\u2019re searching for.\u201d",
    "Nine Perfect Strangers doesn\u2019t just offer viewers a thrilling ride by unraveling the mystery of its setting and Masha herself \u2013 it's designed to provoke viewers into a little bit of self-reflection.",
    "Through its relatable, flawed characters, and the gradual removal of the personas that they display at the start of the show, Nine Perfect Strangers provides viewers with the opportunity to question whether they portray their most authentic selves or regularly hide behind a facade. Its eclectic cast of characters, location and story may be fictional, but there\u2019s a truth to its overall message about being more honest with each other.",
    "Nine Perfect Strangers is available to watch now on Hulu in the US and Amazon Prime Video in the UK."
