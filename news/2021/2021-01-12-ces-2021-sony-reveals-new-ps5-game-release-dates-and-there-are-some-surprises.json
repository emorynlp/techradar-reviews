    "A number of PS5 game release dates were revealed at the end of Sony\u2019s CES 2021 stream, and there\u2019s a couple of nice surprises for gamers to look forward to this year.",
    "A small sizzle reel showed off various upcoming PS5 games and PS5 hardware to close out Sony\u2019s CES 2021 presentation, and a disclaimer shed some new light on when we can expect some big PS5 titles to arrive.",
    "Upcoming PS5 first-party exclusives such as Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Horizon: Forbidden West are still slated for 2021, but we now know that Kena: Bridge of Spirits is due in March, Little Devil Inside arrives in June, Solar Ash is set for July, and Stray and Ghostwire Tokyo are both scheduled for October 2021.",
    "The disclaimer also revealed that Square Enix\u2019s PS5 exclusive Project Athia will release in January 2022, a lot sooner than many were expecting, while Capcom\u2019s Pragmata won\u2019t arrive on PS5 until sometime in 2023.",
    "Of course, these targeted release dates could change in the near future, but it\u2019s pleasing to see that so many PS5 games are scheduled to release this year.",
    "The next two titles PS5 owners can look forward to are Hitman 3, out January 20, and Returnal, which is out on March 19.",
    "We\u2019ve rounded up the best PS5 games you can play right now, and we're expecting this list to grow in 2021 as more top titles arrive. You can also check out the best PS4 games, many of which run better than ever before on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility.",
    "During its CES presentation, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan also took the opportunity to reiterate that the PS5 is SIE's \"most successful launch and biggest console launch ever\" for PlayStation.",
    "Ryan said the company was committed to bringing \"incredible, quality games through our PlayStation studios after year's of organic growth and successful acquistions\" and that Sony's studios have helped deliver \"the best launch lineup in PlayStation history.\"",
    "The PS5 launched with Demon's Souls, Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, all of which we thoroughly enjoyed. The PS5 also comes with the fabulous Astro's Playroom pre-installed on every console, and it's great showcase for the new PS5 DualSense controller."
