    "MSI has introduced yet another variant of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 graphics cards. The Suprim SE models will be slightly slower than its top-of-the-range Suprim X versions \u2014 but don\u2019t expect these cards to sell out any less quickly.",
    "These GPUs are still Nvidia RTX 3080s and 3070s, both of which are highly sought after by PC gamers and crypto miners looking to enhance their computer performance. On top of that, while these cards are slower than both MSI\u2019s Suprim X and Suprim versions, the SE cards have only a 5-7% slower clock speed. Other than that, the cards are all identical \u2014 and manual tuning should be able to bring the SE versions in line with the X.",
    "You might also have to fork out a fair amount to purchase one \u2014 even before inflated resale prices. MSI\u2019s Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Suprim X 10G and GeForce RTX 3070 Suprim X 8G should retail for $900 (\u00a3650 / AU$1160) and $660 (\u00a3475 / AU$850) each. The non-X versions don\u2019t drop much lower than those prices \u2014 only around $50 \u2014 so the SE models likely won\u2019t offer significant savings either.",
    "For many of us, the idea of comparing top graphics cards seems a bit useless. With Nvidia and AMD\u2019s best cards nearly impossible to get hold of, people are having to settle for whatever is available.",
    "In our testing, we found the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 to offer some of the best performance we\u2019ve ever seen from a graphics card. Value-wise the RTX 3080 even beats out the RTX 3090 to take second place on our best graphics cards list \u2014 while the RTX 3070 comes in at fifth, which isn\u2019t too bad itself.",
    "AMD offers some stiff competition too. The AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT and 6900 XT are some pretty powerful GPUs, and definitely ones to also be on the lookout for if you want a high-end PC experience. With GPUs so difficult to find right now, keeping an eye out for stock across a broad selection should increase your chances of getting one.",
