    "Not only do the best large format displays you'll find on this page help you display adverts and branding for your company, they can be used to display information for your customers, and this can be especially important if that information changes regularly, which makes large format displays a wiser investment than traditional printed posters.",
    "The best large format displays can also make any shop, office or restaurant feel modern and vibrant.",
    "So what are large format displays? They aren't just super-sized monitors, but high definition displays that range from 32-inches to over 100-inches, and they often have super-thin bezels that surround the screens. This allows single LFDs to show off images, footage and more without wasting any space, and it also allows you to link together multiple LFDs to create one super-large display as well.",
    "Buying the best large format display for your business can be a tricky process, so let us show you the top LFDs on sale.",

    "Spanning 85 inches, this mammoth large format display is pretty while also costing a pretty penny. It justifies its premium price tag as it uses the latest 8K screen tech, which flaunts four times the number of pixels as 4K and 16 times that of a regular 1080p TV.",
    "This stunning display is optimized for professional display applications and uses Sony is X1 Altimus image processor combined with 8K X-Reality PRO to display high-contrast HDR images packed with detail, rich color and exceptional contrast. It runs Android 8.0, so you can display content from other devices using its inbuilt IPTV service or integrated Chromecast capabilities.",
    "Boasting a giant 98-inch display, this model opt for a more sensible 4K resolution, rather than 8K, which lends it a greater degree of compatibility with content that\u2019s out in the wild. Designed for use in control rooms or large training rooms where ultra-high definition is required, it is also compatible with a range of NEC solutions.",
    "They include the company\u2019s NEC MultiPresenter Stick, its wireless presentation solution for NEC Displays, and it also supports multiple simultaneous connections on Windows, macOS, iOS and Android.",
    "If you are looking for a large format display that doubles down on image quality, this sizeable screen sports high color gamut coverage which makes it ideal for streaming video services.",
    "The secret sauce here is its high dynamic range (or HDR), which expands the contrast ratio and color pallet to display a more realistic and natural image. With a maximum brightness of 400 nits, it\u2019s not going to blow you away, but it\u2019s more than adequate for showing content in anything but the brightest of rooms.",
    "LG has been making top-tier displays for years, many of which have appeared on smartphones and, more recently, virtual reality headsets. This 84-inch 4K large format carries over that quality to deliver high-contrast, true-to-life images.",

    "There aren't many large format displays that have multitouch, which makes the NEC MultiSync E905 SST an interesting option. It's hardly a small screen at 90-inches across the diagonal, but it can be interacted with up to 6 simultaneous touch points thanks to NEC\u2019s ShadowSense technology.",
    "An advanced optical position sensing technology, it uses high-performance sensors to provide high performance, stability, and accuracy. The display also sports an anti-reflective coating to reduce reflections to a minimum, which makes content displayed on it easier to read.",
    "Samsung\u2019s QM85D is a large format display that sports an impressive 120Hz refresh rate, which makes movements across the display - whether that\u2019s dragging windows and other content or watching a video - appear much smoother while reducing stutter.",
    "This model also packs UHD upscaling, which is useful for displaying full HD content in 4K. Another handy feature is the QM85D\u2019s ability to divide the entire screen into four quadrants using PIP (Picture-in-Picture) mode, allowing you to share content from up to four different devices.",
    "This ProLite model is a large format display with a sharp 4K resolution. It features a slim design with hardly any noticeable bezel, which allows content on its IPS LED panel to shine when combined with its exceptional colors and image performance.",
    "Plus, it comes with iiyama\u2019s iiSignage content creation and management software, which is a boon for businesses who want to get their messages across to clients. Its built-in expansion slot supports the Open Pluggable Specification (OPS) standard, which simplifies the installation of a plug-in PC for digital signage applications.",
    "More than a display, the BenQ CP8601K DuoBoard IFP is unlike any other meeting room display on the market. It features all the hardware and tools meeting participants need \u2014 HD video camera, speakers, a six-microphone array, video conferencing, and cloud-based screen sharing, annotation, and collaboration features \u2014 without hassling with separate, incompatible software and systems.",
    "This all-in-one hub allows multiple meeting participants to access files from any software or cloud service such as Google or Dropbox and share the screen with up to four other people with simple to use annotation tools. Participants can collect, categorize, edit, and share notes between the IFP and their mobile devices or laptops from anywhere and save them to their cloud storage.",
    "Get compelling out-of-the-box features that benefit not only in-person and remote teams but also IT and tech managers. Perhaps our most favorite feature allows organizations with robust meeting and visualization needs to combine two DuoBoards together for double the collaboration space."
