    "We've had to wait for two years, but the time is finally here...a Eurovision grand final! Prepare for a night of crazy characters, weird and wonderful performances, and even the odd banger. How you could you genuinely be anything other than hooked? Follow our guide below as we explain everything you need to know about the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest today, with your Eurovision live stream details explained in full.",
    "And after last year's show was cancelled due to Covid-19, anticipation is at fever pitch now that we've made it to Eurovision 2021 week!",
    "Proceedings are always sweeter and saltier than any item you'd dare to cram onto your jumbled snack platter of pan-European delicacies, but with international relations at a real low, this could turn out to be one of the cattiest shows ever. Nul points all round!",
    "Duncan Laurence led the Netherlands to victory two years ago with his spine-tingling hit \"Arcade\", and Rotterdam has been selected as the host city for 2021, with Dutch singing/presenting trio Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley and Jan Smit on hosting duties, alongside vlogger Nikkie de Jager.",
    "While the Netherlands and five other Eurovision stalwarts (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) are already guaranteed a place in the final, the rest had to battle things out in two gut-wrenching semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday. You can see a full list of the 2021 Eurovision countries below.",
    "But read on as we explain how to watch Eurovision 2021 final action online so that you can live stream the Eurovision Song Contest from anywhere.",
    "Eurovision has become something of a global phenomenon, and there are ways to watch around the world as well as in Europe - some of those are discussed below.",
    "Plus, two years ago, the grand final was also be available to watch via the Eurovision YouTube channel. This means easy access through any device that you can get at YouTube with. The downside? You'll miss out on the commentary (or perhaps that's a positive if you're hosting a Eurovision party and really like the limelight).",
    "But if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for streamers all over the world, but there's a handy solution in the form of a VPN.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a 2021 Eurovision live stream from anywhere",
    "We love how these days we don't even know who will be participating in the grand final until after the semi finals. But it's now decided, and these are the countries set for the battle of the ballads on Saturday (in the order that they'll perform):",
    "Unfortunately, there's no longer a regular Eurovision broadcaster in New Zealand, so your best bet could be to use a VPN to tap into another country's coverage.",
    "If you do fancy going down that route, note that the action starts at 7am NZST on Sunday morning.",
    "18-year-old Destiny, representing Malta, has been the name on most avid Eurovision fans' lips over the past couple of months. Her song, \"Je Me Casse\", is bouncy, sassy, empowering - everything you'd want from a successful entry.",
    "Barbara Pravi's \"Voila\" for France is pure silk, sounding like something from a much more romantic era. The only potentially pitfall being that it's sung entirely in Barbara's native tongue, something that doesn't always go down too well at Eurovision.",
    "That said, the points are expected to pour in for Switzerland's entry, \"Tout l\u2019Univers\", another hauntingly gentle French-language song from Gjon's Tears.",
    "Eurovision\u2019s rather confusing voting system has been around since 1975 but was finally overhauled in 2016. Now public votes make up 50% of the total vote, with the other half determined by a professional jury in each participating country.",
    "Once voting is closed a national spokesperson from each country presents the points of their jury.",
    "Voting methods can vary by country, but the easiest way to have your say is by using the Eurovision app, which is free to download and widely available no matter what device you use.",
    "Just bear in mind that you can only cast your vote when the voting window opens after the final song has been performed - the window will close 15 minutes later.",
    "And for obvious reasons, you can't vote for your own country.",
    "The obvious one has got to be Sweden's ABBA with - you guessed it \"Waterloo\".",
    "Then Finnish Lordi for the brilliantly named \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\". Portugal's \"Amar Pelos Dois\" by Salvador Sobral could be one of the best winners in the last two decades. Italy's Gigliola Cinquetti song \"Non Ho L'et\u00e0\" is unforgettable and very moving.",
    "And how could we not mention Bucks Fizz's effervescent performance of \"Making Your Mind Up\" in 1981?",
    "Family affair Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0 of Iceland's 2020 entry, \"Think About Things\", sadly wasn't to be, but it became a viral hit off its own back.",
    "And the music video for their 2021 entry, \"10 Years\", is quite something, blending elements of old Japanese monster movies, the Power Rangers and Paw Patrol - with keytars.",
    "We'd love to see them bring some of that magic to the stage.",
    "Ukrainian entry \"SHUM\", from Go_A, looks like another extraordinary audiovisual spectacle, which we can't wait to watch live."
