  "article": [
    "Michael Pearce\u2019s Encounter, which arrives on Prime Video December 10, is a tricky film to describe. So genre-bending is its premise that the director himself has a hard time nailing down an appropriate elevator pitch.",
    "\u201cI call it a coming-of-age film trapped within a psychological road thriller,\u201d Pearce tells us over Zoom, \u201cbut I might change that description tomorrow.\u201d",
    "In fairness to the British filmmaker, who rose to prominence with his 2017 sleeper hit Beast, that\u2019s a fairly apt summary of Amazon\u2019s latest road trip-cum-sci-fi adventure: Encounter stars Riz Ahmed as Malik, a decorated Marine on a mission to save his estranged young sons from an extraterrestrial infection sweeping the Earth.",
    "If that sounds like a story written with the zeitgeist in mind, you might be surprised to learn that Pearce\u2019s latest film is actually the product of a screenplay (from Giri/Haji creator Joe Barton) that lay dormant for some years before landing on the director\u2019s plate.",
    "\u201cAfter Beast, I wanted my next three or four movies to be based on other people's material, or maybe a book I could find,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo I read a lot of scripts, and I was looking for stuff that was part character study and part elevated genre film. But to my surprise, there wasn't much of that around. I was either reading dramas or harder genre films.",
    "\u201cAnd then Joe\u2019s script came to me. I just immediately identified with these characters, particularly this relationship between a father and his two young boys, and how it was a portrayal of the coming-of-age moment that this family goes through.\u201d",
    "Pearce is referring here to the narrative thread at the heart of Encounter. Ahmed\u2019s Malik spends much of the movie traversing America\u2019s western plains with his two sons, Jay and Bobby (played by newcomers Lucian-River Chauhan and Aditya Geddada), who he abducts from their potentially infected mother and tries to escort to the safety of a US military base.",
    "Things aren\u2019t that simple, of course, but this is a precarious film to contextualize in greater detail. There\u2019s plenty more to say about the experience of its central protagonist, a veteran tormented by the threat of bugs and bacteria, though doing so risks spoiling Encounter\u2019s most effective surprises.",
    "Luckily, Pearce\u2019s newest feature is only half concerned with its otherworldly creepy crawlies, and equally interested in exploring the relationship between the family at its center. Encounter belongs as much to Chauhan and Geddada as it does Ahmed, and the changing dynamic within the trio is ultimately what convinced the director to bring the project to life.",
    "\u201cSometimes, parents need help from their children to get through a crisis,\u201d Pearce says, \u201cand [the script] was talking about all these themes in a really nuanced way. It felt deeply personal to me \u2013 I experienced a similar coming-of-age moment with my younger brother and my dad \u2013 and I just thought, \u2018wow, now I have a character study and a genre film and a personal story in one.\u2019\u201d",
    "The resonance of that \u201cpersonal story\u201d won\u2019t only be limited to those with siblings, either \u2013 something Pearce discovered when audience-testing Encounter for the first time.",
    "\u201cYou know, we did a lot of test screenings for this film,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was my first experience [doing that], taking 400 \u2018average Americans\u2019 from different demographics and having them watch the movie. And it was actually really touching, because a lot of people from a massive variety of backgrounds connected with different themes. Whether that's someone who\u2019d been in the military, or someone who'd experienced similar conditions to that family, the evolution that these characters go through reflected their own experience.",
    "\u201cSo, hopefully people are connected to the very human truth we're trying to put on screen. [We want them to] have fun with some of the genre stuff, but ultimately, they go with the movie because it's this intimate portrayal of a family.\u201d",
    "Encounter is near-universally relatable in its examination of unconditional family trust, though viewers may find the increasingly dramatic elements of its plot geared more towards American audiences \u2013 despite the fact that both its director and leading man are British.",
    "\u201cJoe\u2019s script was already set in the States and I didn't want to add to it, but it also felt like a uniquely American story,\u201d Pearce tells us. \u201cWhen you think of road movies, the landscapes are just so captivating. That geography doesn't exist [in the UK].",
    "\u201cBut then there\u2019s [also] the commentary on gun violence in the film, which is a really shocking phenomenon for us as Brits. There were just so many aspects in the script that somehow had greater resonance in 2020, too. There were rampant conspiracy theories in the US at the time, an increase in right-wing militia groups \u2013 all of these things meant it wasn't a story that could be transposed anywhere else.\u201d",
    "Oh, and have we mentioned the pandemic-sized elephant in the room? Hearing that Pearce picked up Barton\u2019s screenplay after it\u2019d spent years on the shelf might lead one to wonder whether that decision came from a wish to press on the open wound of the pandemic \u2013 but the contemporary relevance of Encounter was purely circumstantial, as the director explains.",
    "\u201cWhen I was developing the script, [the pandemic] didn't exist,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI cast Riz in January 2020, we were getting ready to shoot in the Spring, and then Covid hit in February. So the story was actually already set.\u201d",
    "\u201cI mean, the script wasn't locked,\u201d Pearce adds, \u201cso we did think, at one point, about whether we should fully embrace Covid in the world of the story, but we felt that it would date the movie. There were a few little tweaks made here and there, but we decided that the film was already reflecting our current moment \u2013 this invisible threat affecting the population \u2013 so we didn't need to push it too much.\u201d",
    "Given the sci-fi trimmings, road-trip structure and pandemic-tainted premise of Encounter, then, it would be reasonable to assume that Pearce\u2019s sophomore project bears little similarity to the low-budget debut feature that made his name several years ago. But the director is keen to stress the opposite.",
    "\u201cThere's a relationship between the two [movies] insomuch as this is [also] using genre to do a character portrait,\u201d he explains. \u201cBeast is a psychological thriller, or even maybe a bit of a romantic thriller, but it's really a portrayal of a complicated woman. And [Encounter], although it\u2019s a road movie or sci-fi thriller, it\u2019s still a portrayal of another complicated figure.",
    "\u201cThen the other thing that I carried over [from Beast] was that sense of vacillating between quite an observational style of shooting, and giving the actors a lot of freedom to improvise. To feel that we're capturing something very truthful and authentic in their performances, whilst also jumping inside the heads of these characters.",
    "\u201cI love movies where the point of view is shifting and you\u2019re forced to question not just your relationship with a character, but the nature of reality and what you're seeing and hearing.\u201d",
    "Make no mistake, though: Encounter is a much noisier, more imposing affair than Pearce\u2019s 2017 effort. Grander in scale than Beast by a long way \u2013 \u201cthe variety of landscapes that you get in California is quite special\u201d, he says \u2013 this is the work of a filmmaker clearly enjoying the larger budget at his disposal. But where did the director turn to for inspiration?",
    "\u201cThe big sci-fi influence for Joe's original script was Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d Pearce reveals. \u201cEspecially the 1970s movie \u2013 it\u2019s such a great template, because the threat is your next-door neighbor. It\u2019s not contingent on any big special effects to be sinister. So for me it was that and Paris, Texas, which is such a tender portrait of a father-son relationship set against these really vast, epic landscapes.",
    "\u201cAnd then my director of photography [Benjamin Kra\u010dun] and I watched some desert-set thrillers where we really appreciated the rigorous camera language. Things like No Country for Old Men and Sicario were big references.\u201d",
    "Once Malik and his boys hit the road in Encounter, the influence of those last two movies becomes clear as day \u2013 and Pearce\u2019s sweeping camerawork more than holds its own against the work of Denis Villeneuve or the Coen brothers.",
    "It\u2019s worth repeating that Encounter marks the debut of both the young actors starring alongside Ahmed. Lucian-River Chauhan and Aditya Geddada were 10 and eight, respectively, at the time of filming, and yet the pair manage to command roles which could so easily have proven too demanding. Pearce admits he was initially skeptical about working with such inexperienced talents.",
    "\u201cIt was kind of daunting at the beginning, because so many people had told me that it's difficult to work with kids,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was a long casting process to find the two of them, and because we couldn't meet before we started shooting, we really needed to feel a lot of security that they were the right kids for the part. I spent a lot of time talking with them over Zoom and just got to know them as people, so by the time we did meet for the shoot, we were already close buddies.\u201d",
    "But Pearce needn\u2019t have worried. \u201cIt was my first time directing children,\u201d he admits, \u201cand you know, they almost became the thing that saved us while making this film through Covid. They turned up with these big smiles every day, and that affected the whole crew.",
    "\u201cI felt they were both very emotionally mature, and I didn't need to speak in a completely different language; I didn't need to trick or manipulate a performance out of them. I was really just trying to make them feel like the set was a playful, fun environment where they could discover things and try ideas out. And they came with such confidence, they were so spirited and enthusiastic every day.\u201d",
    "The director\u2019s praise is well founded, too. It\u2019s no easy task for any actor, let alone a young newcomer, to hold their own alongside Ahmed, one of the most accomplished performers working today, but both Chauhan and Geddada \u2013 the former in particular \u2013 prove in Encounter that they\u2019ve got the talent to forge long careers in the industry.",
    "Come for the aliens, vistas and hypnotic cinematography, then, but stay for the performances of two child stars who turn a potentially run-of-the-mill sci-fi thriller into a poignant family drama. It's their involvement \u2013 not the extraterrestrial parasites \u2013 that makes Encounter so infectious.",
    "Encounter is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video from December 10."
