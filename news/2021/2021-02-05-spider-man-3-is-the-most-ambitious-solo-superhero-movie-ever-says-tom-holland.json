    "Tom Holland's third Spider-Man movie sounds like it's the MCU film to keep an eye on over the coming year. Speaking to Variety, Holland explained that the currently untitled Spider-Man 3 is \u201c...really impressive,\u201d and shortly after he claimed that \u201cit\u2019s the most ambitious standalone superhero movie ever made.\u201d",
    "Clearly excited about the project himself, Holland was asked by Variety if he could tell them anything about the MCU\u2019s third Spider-Man outing, which is the sequel to 2019's Far From Home. He naturally remained tight-lipped about the film. \u201cObviously, I can\u2019t really say anything,\u201d he replied.",
    "Holland was asked what the ending of the film is. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny is like, I nearly told you then,\u201d said Holland. \u201cYou were so close to getting what you want.\u201d",
    "Previous reports have suggested that this Spider-Man movie will converge all live-action Spider-Men to date into a single story \u2013 with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles, according to Collider. THR also reported that Spider-Man 2's Doc Ock, Alfred Molina, is on-board for this picture, along with Jamie Foxx as The Amazing Spider-Man 2's Electro.",
    "Could this be the element that makes this third Spider-Man film so ambitious?",
    "Holland elaborated a little bit on what the new Spider-Man movie is trying to achieve. \u201cI can say that it\u2019s the most ambitious standalone superhero movie ever made. You sit down, read the script, and see what they\u2019re trying to do, and they\u2019re succeeding. It\u2019s really impressive. I\u2019ve never seen a standalone superhero movie quite like it.\u201d",
    "Holland also talked about the progress on filming the movie, saying: \u201cWe got a lot more shooting to do. We started before Christmas and shot for like seven weeks. We stopped for the Christmas break, and then we\u2019re starting again. I\u2019m just as excited as everyone else to see it, let alone be a part of it.\u201d",
    "The third Spider-Man movie is currently scheduled to release on December 17, 2021.",
    "Both Spider-Man Homecoming and Spider-Man Far From Home have been well-received by critics and fans, after the cooler reception to Andrew Garfield's last Spider-Man picture, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Adding Peter Parker to the MCU has been a big part of that success \u2013 but the movies have just been more consistent overall.",
    "Hopefully, Holland\u2019s comments signal a strong capper to the trilogy. After Into the Spider-Verse, the possibility of seeing multiple Spider-Men team up in live-action is surely very exciting to MCU devotees.",
    "Tom Holland is also set to star in the upcoming Uncharted movie based on the popular video game series."
