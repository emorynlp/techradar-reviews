    "It\u2019s official: Succession is returning for a fourth season on HBO.",
    "Executive Vice President of the studio, Francesca Orsi, confirmed the renewal of the Emmy Award-winning TV series, which follows the twisted relations of the influential Roy family, in a recent press release.",
    "The news comes shortly after Succession season 3 kicked off on October 17, with new episodes continuing to air every Sunday until December 5.",
    "Created by Jesse Armstrong, Succession has proven a bankable hit for HBO, with 1.4 million viewers tuning into its season 3 premiere alone. That figure marked not only a 21% increase over the viewership of its season 2 finale, but the best premiere night of any HBO Original series since the launch of HBO Max.",
    "But why is Succession continuing to prove so popular with audiences? For starters, it smartly combines the urban appeal of Suits or Billions with the Shakespearean political drama of Game of Thrones, and is anchored by a stellar cast that includes Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin.",
    "Each new season has improved on the last, too, with the show\u2019s sophomore outing raking in seven Emmys and its third gaining yet more critical acclaim. Season 4 looks set to continue that trend.",
    "\u201cWith each season of Succession, Jesse Armstrong has continued to surpass our wildest expectations, pulling us deeper into the Roy family\u2019s inner sanctum with indelible wit, humanity, and precision,\u201d studio boss Orsi said in a press release.",
    "\u201cThis season [3] is undoubtedly no exception, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited for all that\u2019s in store in this next season ahead.\u201d",
    "We\u2019ve got no release date for Succession season 4 just yet, but with season 3 not set to conclude until December this year, we expect to be waiting until at least the back-end of 2022.",
    "As for whether season 4 will be the show\u2019s last, we\u2019re refreshingly confident that it won\u2019t be.",
    "Though HBO itself didn\u2019t allude to further seasons in its recent press release, several interviews with cast and crew have put our minds at ease.",
    "Series mainstay Brian Cox, for instance \u2013 who plays family boss Logan Roy in Succession \u2013 told GQ that he expects \u201cpossibly two more series, and then I think we're done.\u201d",
    "Series creator Armstrong shares the enthusiasm of his leading man, though recently admitted that he wants the show to come to a definitive end. \u201cThere's going to be a very definite moment when that story is over, and it can't go on too long,\u201c he told The New Statesman.",
    "It seems likely, then, that we\u2019ll be treated to a fifth season of Succession after seasons 3 and 4 \u2013 which gives plenty of time for Logan to finally appoint a successor to his media empire."
