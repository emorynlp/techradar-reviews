    "Potter fans, brace yourself: the first look teaser for Harry Potter\u2019s 20th anniversary special, Return to Hogwarts, has arrived.",
    "As per Warner Bros\u2019 official synopsis, the one-off reunion will tell \u201can enchanting making-of story through all-new in-depth interviews and cast conversations, inviting fans on a magical first-person journey through one of the most beloved film franchises of all time.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s set to air on HBO Max, Sky and NOW TV on New Year\u2019s Day, and arrives 20 years after the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (styled as the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone in the US).",
    "You can check out the first official teaser below.",
    "The short clip shows actors Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Matthew Lewis (Neville) and Mark Williams (Arthur Weasley) receiving their invitations to the reunion, before a deliberately obscured Emma Watson (Hermione) is seen walking across platform 9\u00be.",
    "They won\u2019t be the only cast members to feature, though. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter, obviously) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) will also be returning to complete the beloved trio, while the likes of Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange), Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge) and many more will be on hand to cast nostalgic spells of their own.",
    "Director of the first two movies, Chris Columbus, will join proceedings, too, which were all filmed earlier this year in the familiar environment of London\u2019s Warner Bros. Studios.",
    "As for what fans can actually expect to see from the special, the above synopsis suggests we\u2019ll be treated to a series of anecdotal conversations between cast members and behind-the-scenes footage revealing how the magic of the franchise was brought to life.",
    "It\u2019s been confirmed that J. K. Rowling won\u2019t be making a personal appearance in the special \u2013 presumably in light of the ongoing controversy surrounding comments she made about transgender individuals back in 2019 \u2013 though she will be shown in archival footage.",
    "Incidentally, Return to Hogwarts won\u2019t be the first reunion special to land on HBO Max, either. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need a time turner to remember that Friends: The Reunion released on the platform earlier this year, so it\u2019s a safe bet to assume we can expect a similar format from the Harry Potter equivalent come New Year\u2019s Day.",
    "Let's just hope the awkward celebrity appearances are left out this time around."
