    "Cheers to love! We're well and truly into the first of two series of The Bachelorette this year, starting off with the firecracker, Katie Thurston, who first created a buzz when she appeared as one of the eligible women in this year's The Bachelor with Matt James. Coming 11th, Thurston is back to whittle down 30 young men until she finds true love. Make sure you know how to watch The Bachelorette 2021 online and stream season 17 no matter where you are.",
    "Here come the girls - The Bachelorette season 17 is set to be the fiercest season, not least because of Katie Thurston's iconic entry (wielding a sex toy no less) in her season of the Bachelor. As well as speaking out against the toxic environment created by bullying amongst fellow contestants, this season will also see two women take the hosting reins.",
    "Longstanding host Chris Harrison has chosen to step back, with this season of the Bachelorette instead hosted by two former Bachelorettes, Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe.",
    "Breathing a new lease of life and female empowerment into the Bachelorette 2021, Katie is now down to 22 contestants to date and get to know, ultimately all lining up to win over her heart.",
    "Katie is a 30-year-old bank marketing manager from Seattle, Washington. Outspoken about female pleasure, Thurston is certainly one of boldest bachelorettes the show has ever seen, which makes us all the more excited to see just who she will end up choosing.",
    "Make sure you know how to watch The Bachelorette 2021 online with our guide.",
    "Taking a well-earned vacation or out of the country on business? Not a problem. You can easily keep up with new episodes of The Bachelorette from almost anywhere, despite geo-blocking restrictions.",
