    "George R.R. Martin has recently been discussing his role as a collaborator in the development of FromSoftware\u2019s Elden Ring and it turns out his part in the project was completed \"years ago\".",
    "Speaking to WTTW News Chicago, the Game of Thrones creator said that, from him, FromSoftware \u201cwanted a world created to set the game in.\u201d \u201cWorld building is a big factor in fantasy and science fiction,\" he explains, \"You\u2019re not only talking characters and the plot, but the setting is almost as important as everything else: Tolkien\u2019s Middle-Earth, Robert E. Howard\u2019s Hyborian Age, the foundation universe of Isaac Asimov.\u201d",
    "Martin says he \u201cworked up a fairly detailed background for them\u201d and that the developer \u201ctook it from there.\u201d As a result, his \u201cwork on it was actually done years ago. These games, they\u2019re like movies, they take a long time to develop.\u201d",
    "It seems that, once his work was completed, Martin didn\u2019t see too much more of the game as he reveals \u201cit\u2019s been several years since I last seen them\u201d and he is \u201cas excited as anybody else to see it.\u201d That said, he\u2019s not been completely in the dark as he adds, \u201cthey would come and periodically show me some monsters they\u2019d designed or the latest special effects, or the cool things.\u201d",
    "This largely lines up with Hidetaka Miyazaki\u2019s description of Martin\u2019s involvement in the project in a recent interview with IGN. According to Miyazaki, Martin \u201cbrought things to the table that we couldn't have done by ourselves, in terms of that rich storytelling and that sense of character and drama.\u201d",
    "Miyazaki explains that Martin was the source for the name of the game\u2019s setting, the Lands Between, and that after getting the \u201cinitial impetus from George R.R. Martin's mythos\u201d, the team \u201cused that to paint the foundation and the initial layers of the game.\u201d",
    "After a long wait, fans finally got the chance to see a brand new Elden Ring trailer during the recent Summer Game Fest: Kick Off Live. Between this and recent revelations on what the game will involve from Miyazaki, it feels like Elden Ring is finally starting to step out of the shadows. If you missed the trailer, or you just can't resist watching it one more time, you can see it for yourself below:",
    "During the stream, we also learned Elden Ring\u2019s release date: January 21 2022. When the game releases, you\u2019ll be able to play it on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC."
