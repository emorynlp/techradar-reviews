    "We're already seeing some fantastic Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals appear, and when it comes to micro SD cards, there's never been a better time to buy. For less than the price of a downloadable game, you can quadruple your Switch console\u2019s storage and never have to worry about whether you have room to install something again.",
    "With Black Friday 2021 now just a few days away, there are already some fantastic micro SD card deals to snap up right now in both the US and UK. If you download a lot of games from the Nintendo eShop and are feeling the pinch of the console\u2019s stingy 32GB of internal storage, we strongly advise grabbing these deals before they\u2019re gone.",
    "The easiest recommendation for most users is to choose a 128GB micro SD card, which gives you four times more storage and costs less than the price of an indie game. If you\u2019re someone who likes to download every demo, downloadable piece of content or simply never buys physical games, we\u2019d opt for the 512GB model, which will give you more than enough space to store whatever your heart desires.",
    "While it\u2019s possible to save on Nintendo Switch micro SD cards all year round, the biggest discounts tend to fall on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, especially on the higher capacity models. We're seeing that here, with the 256GB option almost 50% in the UK.",
    "(Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "Expanding your Nintendo Switch storage is incredibly simple. Simply locate the micro SD slot on your Switch and insert your new card (the slot can be found underneath the console\u2019s kickstand on both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED). Once it\u2019s inserted, you\u2019ll be able to store games, screenshots, and video clips directly to the micro SD card.",
    "Even though most Nintendo Switch games are smaller in size than what you\u2019ll find on PS5 and Xbox Series X, even some physical games require some data to be downloaded and installed, which means storage can run out quickly. This is a great chance to save, then, and make storage worries a thing of the past.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Nintendo Switch micro SD cards from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
