  "article": [
    "Intel\u2019s incoming heavyweight gaming GPU has been shown off on Twitter, complete with an assertion that it\u2019s going to be capable of some seriously smooth frame rates.",
    "Obviously at this stage, we can take any such claims with more than a few liberal pinches of salt \u2013 Intel is still very much building up a cloud of hype steam, as it were. But it\u2019s good to hear that the Xe-HPG (high-performance gaming) GPU is shaping up to be a capable force, and to see an actual pic of DG2 (as the card is also referred to, being the sequel to Intel\u2019s first discrete offering, DG1).",
    "The tweet is from Raja Koduri, chief architect (and senior VP) of the graphics division at Intel, but the comment about the smoothness is from Roger Chandler, Intel\u2019s GM of Client XPU Products. Chandler describes progress made on the GPU as: \u201cFrom jittery journeys to buttery smooth.\u201d",
    "As you can see from the chip shown, this is the DG2 variant with 512 Execution Units, and going by previous rumors, this will be the flagship gaming graphics card.",
    "As Wccftech, which spotted the above tweet, points out, Koduri replied in another tweet when questioned about whether Intel might adopt AMD\u2019s DLSS rivalling FSR tech (FidelityFX Super Resolution).",
    "AMD just confirmed at Computex that FSR will debut later in June, and rather than Nvidia\u2019s proprietary DLSS, Team Red\u2019s take on frame rate boosting will be an open standard. Indeed, AMD already demonstrated it working on an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card with Godfall \u2013 so theoretically, this is something Intel could benefit from, rather than trying to brew its own image upscaling potion.",
    "As Koduri makes clear, this is something Intel is \u201cdefinitely looking at\u201d and that the firm would want to \u201calign with open approaches\u201d (meaning FSR) in the cause of making things easier for game developers. (Introducing another separate standard \u2013 like \u2018XeSS\u2019 which has been rumored before \u2013 would complicate matters further, of course, and would likely be a major uphill struggle for Intel in terms of trying to push devs to adopt).",
    "The long and short of it is that AMD\u2019s technology could help Intel\u2019s new gaming graphics cards better rival Nvidia, and indeed Team Red\u2019s own GPUs for that matter.",
    "Intel\u2019s Xe-HPG card might appear before 2021 is out \u2013 and indeed this pic is a hopeful sign that things are on schedule \u2013 but a recent rumor indicated that early 2022 is a more realistic proposition, at least for the desktop GPUs (mobile versions of DG2 for gaming laptops are purportedly set to arrive first)."
