    "Update: Nvidia has issued a statement to confirm that this leak is real \u2013 but obviously unauthorized \u2013 and clarified that the inclusion of any game on it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Nvidia told Wccftech: \u201cNvidia is aware of an unauthorized published game list, with both released and/or speculative titles, used only for internal tracking and testing. Inclusion on the list is neither confirmation nor an announcement of any game.",
    "\u201cNvidia took immediate action to remove access to the list. No confidential game builds or personal information were exposed.\u201d",
    "The original story follows below\u2026",
    "A major leak has been witnessed from the Nvidia GeForce Now (game streaming service) database, and assuming it\u2019s legitimate, the spillage highlights a number of top PlayStation games which could be coming to the PC \u2013 including God of War, Returnal and Demon\u2019s Souls.",
    "While the leak is believed to be genuine, at least according to our sister site Windows Central, this obviously needs to be taken with a bucketful of salt (or maybe even a larger container) \u2013 and at any rate, just because a game is listed here doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s eventually destined for the PC (and indeed Nvidia\u2019s streaming service).",
    "Anyhow, the story is that Ighor July, a C++ developer, posted the list of games on Medium, as flagged up on Reddit. Apparently the dev managed to crack their way into Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now database as detailed in that post, and after experimenting with all sorts of stuff and leveraging intelligent code completion, they grabbed a list of games from the servers of Team Green\u2019s streaming operation \u2013 consisting of no less than 18,000 items.",
    "Scanning through that sprawling lot revealed some seriously tantalizing findings which as we\u2019ve already mentioned include God of War (shown to be present in the Steam store \u2013 which obviously it isn\u2019t, not yet\u2026), Returnal and Demon\u2019s Souls, plus GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas remasters, Horizon Forbidden West, and Ratchet & Clank.",
    "There are also a bunch of unannounced GeForce Now games flagged up by Ighor like Mafia: Definitive Edition, and incoming PC titles like the (imminent) Alan Wake Remastered and Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection for PC (the latter is due early 2022).",
    "The first point to make here is to underline the extreme caution required around this leaked list, and that just because a game is mentioned here, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s coming to the PC. There\u2019s certainly some pretty odd stuff in the database leak such as \u2018Bioshock 2022\u2019 for example, and other unreleased or unknown projects, plus the presence of Dolphin emulator (for playing GameCube and Wii titles on the PC).",
    "All of this means that there is clearly a lot of noise with this leak, even if it does prove to be authentic. Equally, though, there are certainly things which ring true here: God of War has long been hoped for as a PC port, and seems a realistic proposition as such. Plus we\u2019ve been hearing plenty of late about \u201cmultiple upcoming PC ports\u201d of PlayStation exclusives \u2013 and that Bloodborne won\u2019t be one of these. Funnily enough, Bloodborne doesn\u2019t make the list here (although Demon\u2019s Souls does, of course). Another disappointment for some, but not really a surprising omission, is the lack of any mention of Spider-Man for a PC port.",
    "In short, it looks like we could hope that there are some delightful nuggets of truth here, among a whole bunch of potential placeholders and non-existent \u2018could-be\u2019 projects, as well as strange and clearly bogus entries."
