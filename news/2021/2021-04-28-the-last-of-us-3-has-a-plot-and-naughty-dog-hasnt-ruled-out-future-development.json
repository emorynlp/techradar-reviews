    "A plot exists for a potential The Last of Us 3, and while a next entry in the critically-acclaimed The Last of Us series isn't currently in development, developer Naughty Dog hasn't ruled out the possibility that it could happen in the future.",
    "Speaking during an episode of the Script Apart podcast (via IGN), The Last of Us Creative Director \u2013 and Naughty Dog co-founder \u2013 Neil Druckmann revealed that he and co-writer Halley Gross have written the plot for The Last of Us 3, and that he hoped \"one day it will see the light of day\".",
    "\"I don\u2019t know how much I want to reveal... [Halley Gross] and I did write an outline for a story, that we're not making \u2013 but I hope one day can see the light of day \u2013 that explores a little bit what happens after this game. We\u2019ll see.\"",
    "Druckmann went on to explain the challenges of undertaking a new The Last of Us game, explaining that with the series now having two titles, a third game would need to follow \"some structural and thematic themes\".",
    "Following the release of The Last of Us 2, it seems Naughty Dog is still exploring what to do next.",
    "\"After we finish one of our big titles, we take a long time to explore different ideas, whether it\u2019s going to be Last of Us 3, whether it's something new, whether there's some old franchise we want to go back to,\" Druckmann said. \"I like to fully explore all of those, then look at, like: okay, we have all of these ideas in front of us. As a studio, what do we want to commit to? Because it\u2019s a huge commitment \u2013 monetary, time, passion, talent, so you think about all the opportunity costs that come with that.\"",
    "We already know that Naughty Dog is working with HBO on a The Last of Us TV show, while a report by Bloomberg claims that a The Last of Us remake is currently in development at the studio. In addition, the report claims that a new Uncharted game is also in the works at Naughty Dog.",
    "We expect that if Naughty Dog does choose to go ahead with The Last of Us 3, it could be a few years before we get our hands on it \u2013 after all, The Last of Us 2 released seven years after its predecessor."
