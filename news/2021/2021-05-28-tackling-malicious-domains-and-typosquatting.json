    "Malicious domains are domains that look genuine but are disguised by attackers to steal sensitive personal information and data from unsuspecting victims. This type of crime usually employs \u2018typosquatting\u2019 techniques, which rely on user oversight.",
    "Domains look almost identical to the real thing but use minor, altered spellings in the URL to avoid detection of their fraudulent nature.",

    "TechRadar Pro had a chat with David Sygula, Senior Cybersecurity Analyst, CyberAngel to discuss why it\u2019s time for a more coordinated response from domain registrars, ISP\u2019s, security vendors, and businesses to help take these domains down quickly and effectively."
