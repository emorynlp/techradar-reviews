  "article": [
    "Microsoft announced last month that the keynote for its annual Ignite conference would be a little different this year, but the company gave little warning of quite how different.",
    "Held over virtual reality platform AltspaceVR, the event offered a glimpse into Microsoft\u2019s vision for the future of communication that was as nightmarish as it was compelling.",
    "The event showcased everything that is terrible about extended reality (XR), from technical mishaps to gimmicky set pieces. But it was also a reminder, as video conferencing fatigue reaches new heights, that we\u2019re just at the start of the remote collaboration revolution.",
    "If Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is to be believed, the \u201cinterweaving of digital bits and physical atoms\u201d will make communicating from afar an entirely different proposition in years to come.",
    "The keynote\u2019s headline announcement was the arrival of a new mixed reality platform, called Microsoft Mesh, that Nadella says will make remote communication feel more intimate and less uncanny.",
    "\u201cMesh enables you to interact holographically with others with true presence, in a natural way,\u201d he explained.",
    "\u201cI could join a birthday celebration with my extended family in India, interacting as if we were physically together, without any screens between us. Or I could meet my colleagues on the other side of the world and collaborate as though we were in the same room.\u201d",
    "Powered by the compute and AI capabilities of Azure, Mesh is also designed to allow designers and engineers that handle 3D models to work together across continents in a way that has never before been possible.",
    "\u201cMicrosoft Mesh connects the physical and digital worlds, allowing us to transcend the traditional boundaries of space and time,\u201d said a holographic version of Alex Kipman, Technical Fellow at Microsoft.",
    "\u201cThis has been the dream for mixed reality, the idea from the very beginning. You can actually feel like you\u2019re in the same place with someone sharing content or you can teleport from different mixed reality devices and be present with people when you\u2019re not physically together.\u201d",
    "Initially, Mesh users will only be able to appear as avatars, but Microsoft has promised that \u201choloportation\u201d will eventually allow people to communicate as photorealistic forms of themselves.",
    "The announcement might send a shiver down the spine of anyone hoping for a return to the office of old, but for others it\u2019s a window into a future imagined only in science fiction."
