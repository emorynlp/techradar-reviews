  "article": [
    "At its California Streaming event, Apple CEO Tim Cook unleashed an avalanche of new trailers for upcoming Apple TV Plus shows and movies. Among them were some real heavy hitters like The Morning Show Season 2, Foundation and John Stewart\u2019s new TV show, The Problem with John Stewart.",
    "Not only did we get a closer look at the upcoming content, we also got a few crucial release dates for John Stewart (September 30), Finch (November 5) and The Shrink Next Door (November 12).",
    "Until these shows come out there\u2019s plenty to watch on the service \u2013 like Ted Lasso Season 2 that\u2019s just a few weeks away from finishing up \u2013 See starring Jason Momoa and Mr. Corman starring Joseph Gordon Levitt.",
    "Not sure where to start with Apple TV Plus? Here\u2019s your guide to all the new stuff coming to the service in the next few months \u2013 and a few shows that just came out that are worth your attention.",
    "The Morning Show Season 2 (September 17)",
    "Apple TV Plus\u2019 flagship show returns on September 17 for its second season. After picking up a number of Emmy noms in its first season, The Morning Show is easily some of the highest caliber content in Apple\u2019s arsenal right now and stars big names like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. The show\u2019s a newsroom drama that unfolds after one of its original anchors (played by Steve Carrell) is caught up in a scandal. It\u2019s a primetime drama that you can watch anytime, anywhere on Apple TV Plus.",
    "Foundation (September 24)",
    "For fans of science fiction, it\u2019s going to be a great few months of shows and movies. While big-screen fans will get a chance to watch Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune in theaters and on HBO Max, owners of smaller screens will be able to watch Isaac Asimov\u2019s seminal Foundation series on Apple TV Plus starting on September 24. Asimov\u2019s heady series can make for some dense (but enjoyable) reading \u2013 so we\u2019re very much looking forward to seeing how Apple\u2019s adaptation lives up to the books.",
    "The Problem with John Stewart (September 30)",
    "There should probably be a comma in there as The Problem, with John Stewart is a much better description of the longtime TV host\u2019s new series. A talk show that picks up where The Daily Show left off, Stewart will attempt to tackle some of today\u2019s biggest issues with his signature satirical comedic style that\u2019s both utterly hilarious and simultaneously compassionate for the average American. It makes its debut on September 30.",
    "Finch (November 5)",
    "The month of October will see a few decent shows make their way to Apple TV Plus, but it won\u2019t be until November that the streaming service goes back to pumping out the blockbusters. The first up is Finch starring the legendary Tom Hanks. In what feels like a strange, strange crossover between I am Legend and Wall-E, Finch stars Hanks, his dog and a robot as they explore the ravaged remains of a planet that \u2013 in all likelihood \u2013 is planet earth after we reap all of its natural resources. It might be a bit heavy-handed for our liking, but with Hanks at the helm we\u2019re more than willing to give this a shot on November 5.",
    "The Shrink Next Door (November 12)",
    "Another big series on the docket for Apple TV Plus is The Shrink Next Door, a dramedy starring Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell. In it, Rudd plays a psychologist on a mission to help Ferrell\u2019s character set boundaries. Those boundaries clearly get crossed over time as their therapy turns into basketball, long hugs and walks in the park, but we\u2019re expecting the results to be heart-warming and funny rather than bleak and/or creepy. We\u2019ll find out one way or the other when the first episode drops on November 12.",
    "Ted Lasso (Season 2 available now)",
    "If you leave here remembering only one recommendation of ours, make it Ted Lasso. The genuinely beautiful series starring Jason Sudeikis as Coach Lasso threw us for a few loops in the first season, but the second season has shown us that wounds heal over time and that family are truly the people we choose to be with rather than the ones we\u2019re born with. The second season of the show wraps up shortly but now\u2019s as good a time as any to start if you\u2019ve yet to witness the magic that is Ted Lasso on Apple TV Plus.",
    "Mr. Corman (Season 1 available now)",
    "Both Apple and Disney are infatuated with music teachers this year. While Disney and Pixar\u2019s Soul showed us the power of music as a cornerstone of our lives, Mr. Corman shows us the total opposite \u2013 basically what happens when someone with musical talent doesn\u2019t put it to the best of their abilities. The result is a dramedy that is a rollercoaster of laughs and depression as we see actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt struggle with his life choices and a dream deferred.",
    "Mythic Quest (Season 2 available now)",
    "Take the dysfunctional family of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, stick them in charge of a video game developer and voila! You\u2019ve got Mythic Quest. While the premise sounds completely and utterly ridiculous the results are\u2026 OK, they\u2019re ridiculous too. What makes Mythic Quest great is its amazing cast of characters, pitch-perfect satire of the games industry and some sweeping character arcs that are as epic as the title suggests. We highly recommend watching both seasons of the show.",
    "The Elephant Queen (Available now)",
    "Even if you don\u2019t fancy yourself much of an animal documentary fan, The Elephant Queen is all-around good cinema. Following the life of an elephant matriarch named Athena and narrated by Chiwetel Ejiofor, this acclaimed documentary was nominated for Best Science/Nature Documentary and Best Narration in 2019 when it was released and won at the Cinema for Peace Awards. If you haven\u2019t had enough pachyderms for the day, we also highly recommend watching Elephant (2020) on Disney Plus that\u2019s narrated by none other than Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and is downright phenomenal as well."
