    "A lot of devices have come out since the iPhone 6S but the issue is that a lot of them are seriously expensive. Seeing the price tag of the iPhone XS Max and even the iPhone 11 Pro Max (a lot of Max really) is more than enough to make you run back to the comforting prices of the 6S!",
    "Yes, the iPhone 6S doesn't quite have the screen quality, specs or design of its more powerful and newer brothers, but it makes up for that with its much, much lower price tag.",
    "And that\u2019s where we come in: we\u2019ve done the hard work in rooting through the likes of Amazon, eBay and the other major retailers to work out where the best unlocked iPhone 6S handsets are lurking, so you don\u2019t end up spending too much.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a SIM free phone, then the chances are you\u2019re looking to upgrade an older iPhone, or (sadly) replace a broken or lost handset - if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019ll enjoy the power and performance on offer from the iPhone 6S.",
    "If you\u2019re upgrading from an iPhone 5S, for instance, you\u2019ll love the larger screen that lets you do so much more - and if you combine it with with a cheap SIM only deal you\u2019ll be able to get online for very little without being tied into a long-term contract.",
    "So have a look below at TechRadar\u2019s custom-made price comparison chart to ensure you pay a great price for your new phone."
