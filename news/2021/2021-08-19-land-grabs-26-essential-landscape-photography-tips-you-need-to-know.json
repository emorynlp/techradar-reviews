    "The wind in your hair, a camera slung over your shoulder and a great location in mind: nothing beats getting out into the great outdoors to shoot landscape photography.",
    "With the right conditions to hand, a successful outdoors shoot can be an exhilarating experience. But when time is of the essence, you need to learn how to work quickly and methodically to guarantee great shots on every outing.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter where you live: you\u2019re rarely ever far from a great location or two. And even if you have to travel, it\u2019s all part of the adventure. Whether you\u2019re shooting at home or abroad, location research has never been easier and the planet certainly feels like a smaller place, with even far-flung destinations feeling within reach.",
    "The great thing about landscape photography technique is that it doesn\u2019t matter when or where you\u2019re shooting: all of the tricks and techniques are the same. Perfect your technique and you\u2019ll be ready to take on the world and enjoy the landscape more than ever before.",
    "When David Hockney said, \u201cEnjoyment of the landscape is a thrill,\u201d he hit the rusty, weathered nail on the head. By the time you\u2019ve digested these landscape photography tips, the only thing you\u2019ll have to worry about is the weather\u2026",
    "Checking the weather before you head out is a given \u2013 but how about finding out exactly what time sunrise or sunset will take place at your chosen location, or exactly which direction the sun will rise or fall in relation to your desired shooting position? The good news is that you can do all this and more with super-helpful tools like Photopills and The Photographer\u2019s Ephemeris.",
    "Both of these apps cost the same ($9.99 / \u00a38.99) will show you all the info you need when planning a landscape shoot. The web/browser-based version of The Photographer's Ephemeris is free to use, but the smartphone app is an excellent ally to have when out on a shoot.",
    "Landscape photography is a subject where you can use a huge range of lenses, from the classic wide-angles all the way up to telephotos. While the location and subject will always dictate the best focal length and technique to use, every landscape photographer certainly needs an ultra-wide-angle lens in their kit bag.",
    "For an APS-C camera, consider a lens with a focal range of 10-20mm; for full-frame cameras, roughly 15-30mm will provide a dramatic, wide field of view. Don\u2019t leave home without one!",
    "With the prospect of walking several miles to get to a location, it\u2019s imperative that you only pack what you\u2019ll need. Anything could happen, but if you know you\u2019ll only need one or two lenses, only pack these. Don\u2019t forget your filters, spare batteries, lens-cleaning accessories and, of course, clothing to suit all the possible weather conditions for the time of year.",
    "When you shoot an amazing landscape location and the planets align to give you the best conditions possible, it can feel like you\u2019ve won the lottery and that you never need to visit that particular place again. But you should definitely revisit that location, possibly even multiple times in different seasons, weather conditions and at different times of the day.",
    "This is the perfect way to develop an intimate knowledge of a place while also capturing it in as many ways as possible. Don\u2019t forget to also try multiple viewpoints, different focal lengths and techniques to see what works best. The two shots of the same tree below show the variations you can find in the same scene.",
    "The camera settings you need for landscapes are pretty simple. Shoot in Aperture Priority mode so you can control the depth of field while the camera sets the appropriate shutter speed for you. With the aperture set to f/16 for a large depth of field, set the ISO to 100 for the best image quality. With the metering mode set to Evaluative/Matrix, the camera will read light from all areas of the scene to calculate a correct exposure. If required, use exposure compensation to lighten or darken the exposure as necessary.",
    "With settings like these plus the possibility of filters being attached to the lens, there\u2019s a high possibility that the shutter speed will be slow. If you find it drops below 1/125 sec, attach your camera to a tripod and use a remote release to fire the shutter without touching the camera. This combination will help to avoid camera shake \u2013 a type of blur in your photos created by tiny camera movements when shooting at slow shutter speeds.",
    "Maximising the overall image sharpness and depth of field relies on using both a narrow aperture and the correct focusing technique. Even with a narrow aperture such as f/16, if you focus on the wrong part of the scene, the foreground or background could still be out of focus.",
    "The best way to focus for landscapes is to switch the camera and lens to manual focus, and rotate the lens\u2019 focusing ring to focus on the right part of the frame. You need to identify the position in the scene that\u2019s one third of the distance towards the horizon, and focus roughly at this point. This piece of advice is sometimes confused with focusing one third of the way up the frame, which is incorrect: make sure you\u2019re looking at the depth of the scene.",
    "Once you\u2019ve identified this point, either look through the viewfinder or use Live View on your rear display while slowly rotating the focus ring. When the image looks sharp at the right point, stop and take a shot. Zoom into the image on the LCD screen and check that it\u2019s sharp from the front, all the way to the back of the shot. If it\u2019s sharp in the foreground but not in the background, you\u2019ll need to set the focus further back, and vice versa. Don\u2019t be afraid to keep adjusting the focus until you achieve sharpness throughout the scene.",
    "Polarizing filters are one of the most versatile accessories in the photographer\u2019s arsenal. Not only do they help to deepen blue skies, remove a degree of glare, reduce reflections and increase color saturation, but they can also be used as a limited neutral-density filter because they reduce light entering the lens by one or two stops.",
    "Neutral-density filters are designed to reduce the amount of light that can enter the lens, which means you can use slower shutter speeds than you would normally. This makes creative blurring of water and clouds possible. NDs are often available in 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, 10- and even 15-stop light-blocking densities.",
    "Neutral-density graduated filters \u2013 known as ND grads for short \u2013 are essential landscape filters that allow you to reduce the amount of light that enters at the top of the frame.",
    "They then graduate to no effect at all at the bottom, leaving this area completely unaffected. This means that you can achieve the otherwise tricky job of capturing a perfectly exposed bright sky and dark foreground in a single shot.",
    "Like genres of music, photographic subjects are made up of multiple sub-genres, and while grand vistas are the archetypal \u2018landscape\u2019 image, there are many more approaches that can be taken to capture eye-catching results.",
    "Details in the landscape, whether manmade or natural, can provide incredibly interesting images that tell as much of a story as a classic wide-angle composition, sometimes more. The image of dried mud above is one of a series taken just before sunset while capturing more traditional seascapes, but it\u2019s these detail shots that provided the most interesting images from the day.",
    "The sun has gone down and it\u2019s getting dark, so time to head home, right? Absolutely not. Twilight brings with it a number of opportunities, but one you may want to hang around for is known as the \u2018blue hour\u2019.",
    "It\u2019s a period of time (not necessarily an hour), after sunset and the better-known \u2018golden hour\u2019 period have passed, where predominantly blue and violet wavelengths of light are reaching the Earth. While the sky may still contain flashes of red or orange, the ground will be bathed in soft blue light \u2013 and the result is very cool.",
    "An overcast day may not provide a colourful sunrise or sunset, but what it can do is give you a full day of shooting. As long as the sky isn\u2019t an endless expanse of grey and detail is present in the clouds, you can shoot incredibly moody images. And, of course, if the sun does happen to break through for a moment, it will look amazing.",
    "Alongside great light, the right weather conditions and a perfect exposure, composition is one of the most important aspects of landscape photography. Composition is simply a term to describe how elements of the scene are arranged within the image frame. There are a number of tricks or devices you can use to give your shots visual balance and draw the viewer into them.",
    "The rule of thirds is the most basic, and also one of the most reliable compositional devices. It can be used in conjunction with the other devices we\u2019ll be looking at, so consider it to be the foundation of your shots. By following this rule, your landscapes will have a true sense of balance that\u2019s pleasing to the eye.",
    "With the rule of thirds, you have to imagine that the frame is split into nine equal sections by two horizontal and two vertical lines.",
    "The idea is that you position the main focal point of the image on one of the four points where these lines intersect. When you\u2019re using foreground interest, positioning that area as well as the focal point according to the rule of thirds will result in a much more pleasing image. Equally, the horizon line could be positioned on either the top or bottom horizontal line when shooting in both portrait and landscape format.",
    "Some cameras offer a rule-of-thirds grid in the viewfinder, or on the LCD screen when you shoot using Live View, so if you find it hard to imagine the grid, this is a great way to actually see it. The viewfinder setting will most likely be found within your camera\u2019s custom function menu; with Live View, the Display button will toggle through the available display modes.",
    "Foreground interest is a powerful compositional device that has the ability to make the foreground and background areas of images work in perfect harmony. By positioning an object such as a rock, water or anything that relates to the scene as a whole, you create a visual stepping stone \u2013 a starting point for the viewer\u2019s eye to enter the image.",
    "Don\u2019t include a random object as foreground interest for the sake of it. It needs to have relevance to the scene, and ultimately complement it. And by composing the object using to the rule of thirds, you\u2019ll keep balance and visual harmony.",
    "If you want to create dynamic landscape images that draw the viewer into and through your images, lead-in lines are an amazing compositional device to employ.",
    "You\u2019ll need a strong linear element in the scene, such as a wall, a road, rocks or a bridge. By positioning this element so it begins in the bottom third of the frame, ideally right at the bottom, you can compose the shot so the lines aim towards the focal point in the image. In some situations, lead-in lines can also act as foreground interest.",
    "One of the best ways to extend the field of view of a lens is to shoot a series of overlapping exposures with the camera in portrait orientation to create panoramic images. This method provides the greatest resolution possible, but sometimes this approach is unnecessary if you simply want to increase the field of view slightly.",
    "In situations where you can\u2019t quite get everything into the composition with the wide-angle lens you\u2019re shooting with when the camera is in landscape orientation, take a two-shot panoramic image by rotating the tripod head slightly to get more of the scene in. These can be merged in seconds using Lightroom, and the result can be as dramatic as capturing a scene with a 12mm field of view with a 16mm lens, for instance. For portrait format images that require a wider field of view, shoot a vertical pano with the camera in landscape orientation.",
    "We\u2019ve looked at some of the rules and devices that can be used to make your landscape scenes look fantastic. But aren\u2019t all rules made to be broken?",
    "Once you learn how to use the rule of thirds, it often becomes second nature, but there are times when completely ignoring it and composing with the main subject or the horizon line in the centre of the frame produces the most eye-catching image possible.",
    "You\u2019ll discover that the best types of scenes to compose centrally are those where there\u2019s an obvious element of natural symmetry, such as a pier, lavender fields or lone trees.",
    "Minimal landscapes can look amazing. They can be just as compelling as a classic landscape scene bursting with detail and light. In photography and art there\u2019s a compositional idea called \u2018the rule of threes\u2019: the premise behind it is simply that three objects are more visually pleasing than two or four.",
    "So when you\u2019re shooting minimalist landscapes, if you don\u2019t have a lone tree or a single derelict groyne on a beach, try to find three. Give it a try \u2013 we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll agree that the rule of threes really is a winning formula.",
    "Framing is a technique where you can use manmade or natural elements to frame a subject within the wider scene by composing so the element occupies the area around the subject. The overall effect of this is that it emphasizes the focal point in the scene and draws the viewers\u2019 eye to it, and can also be used to \u2018tidy up\u2019 messy elements around the focal point.",
    "Framing is a technique that relies on the existence of elements such as trees, a ruin or a window, like in our example here, so you can\u2019t apply it in all situations. But when available it can be a powerful and visually striking compositional device.",
    "Landscape photography is usually all about capturing sharp images. When motion blur is included, it\u2019s often to blur moving elements, such as water. To capture the whole landscape as a dynamic blur, you have to turn the way you shoot on its head. Set the camera to Shutter Priority at 1/8 sec with ISO at 100; these settings will work perfectly for both techniques below.",
    "Panning landscapes is where you move the camera across or vertically during the exposure. A vertical pan works best for trees; for coastal shots, try a horizontal pan.",
    "A zoom burst is where you zoom the lens into the subject you\u2019re photographing and focus. You then begin to smoothly zoom out while releasing the shutter. Experiment with the zoom speed for the best results.",
    "When you shoot at sunrise or sunset, the sun will be extremely bright when it\u2019s just above the horizon. The light will still be soft and colourful, but the bright sun can make shooting difficult. One way to overcome the problem, and to apply a stunning effect, is to create a starburst. To do this, either position yourself so the sun is partially obscured by something, or shoot when the sun is just peeking over the horizon line. Now with the aperture set to either f/16 or f/22, the bright light will be captured as a star. It really is that simple \u2013 no filters required.",
    "Reflections can be a hugely creative addition to all types of photography, but with landscapes they can provide mirror-perfect symmetry. For this type of shot, position the far bank of a lake or the horizon line across the centre of the frame to split the scene and the reflection into two equal parts.",
    "Waking up to mist may not seem like the best conditions for shooting, but the mysterious look of the landscape is an opportunity not to be missed. The best mist for photographers is \u2018radiation fog\u2019, which forms during clear, still nights when the ground loses heat via radiation. This type of mist will often remain close to the ground, forming a thin, white layer.",
    "You may need to use exposure compensation to avoid under-exposure. You should try positioning yourself so the sun is in front of you for more dramatic results.",
    "Using a figure in the landscape to add a focal point or a sense of scale is an old technique despite its overuse in images shared on Instagram. But while the technique is ubiquitous, don\u2019t let that put you off employing it \u2013 having a figure in the scene can provide a point of interest that it would otherwise lack.",
    "The easiest way to do this is to ask a friend to stand in the desired part of the scene, but if shooting alone you can either use the self-timer and run into position yourself or use a shutter remote to release the shutter once you\u2019ve walked into position.",
    "If your camera can link to a smartphone app that shows a Live View from the camera, this can help massively when working alone because you can see exactly what the camera sees while standing in position in front of it. Plus, you can use the self-timer so that the phone can be put away while you strike your pose.",
    "Just because the weather isn\u2019t ideal doesn\u2019t mean you have to pack up all your photography kit and head home: there are plenty of other opportunities to keep you busy. Why not explore different locations and look for interesting details such as patterns in rocks or reflections in pools of water, and focus on these?",
    "A kit lens or a telephoto will allow you to zoom in and exclude the surrounding area, and don\u2019t forget to experiment using filters too. You need to remember that polarising filters can reduce glare and saturate colours, while ND filters allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds, so you could even try blurring water to achieve a dynamic abstract effect.",
    "Simply setting up your camera and tripod to capture what\u2019s in front of you can quickly come to dictate how you approach and shoot landscapes. So don\u2019t forget to explore locations when you arrive to find the best viewpoint \u2013 and if that means laying on the ground to look up, go for it!"
