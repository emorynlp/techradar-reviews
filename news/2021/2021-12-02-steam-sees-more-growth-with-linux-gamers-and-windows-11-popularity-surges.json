  "article": [
    "The number of Linux gamers active on Steam continues to increase going by the latest hardware survey from Valve for November, and has now reached 1.16% \u2013 plus there\u2019s been a big increase for Windows 11 adoption (more on that later).",
    "Since April 2021, the amount of Linux gamers on Steam has kept on going upwards, so that\u2019s seven straight months of growth \u2013 with the figure crossing the 1% adoption mark five months ago, and (obviously) remaining above that level since.",
    "Admittedly in November, there was only a very slight uptick of 0.03%, but that\u2019s still an increase, taking Linux to 1.16% as mentioned.",
    "Presumably the more recent increases are at least partly down to the Steam Deck effect, with more folks checking out Linux as an alternative gaming platform ahead of the handheld\u2019s release.",
    "Gaming on Linux, which spotted this, observes that once the Steam Deck actually comes out, that could stoke adoption figures to a greater level \u2013 depending on whether Valve counts the devices (or rather, Steam OS 3-powered hardware) in its figures. Remember, it didn\u2019t with Steam Machines, but given Valve\u2019s pretty firm insistence on marketing the Steam Deck as a PC \u2013 just a small, handheld one \u2013 we\u2019d imagine it\u2019ll be up for inclusion in the monthly reports.",
    "As we\u2019ve said before, this is the first time in years that Linux has exceeded the 1% mark of OS adoption on Steam, and funnily enough, the last time this happened was when Proton \u2013 the compatibility layer that facilitates running Windows games in Linux (and with the Steam Deck) \u2013 was first released by Valve.",
    "Maybe we could see Linux driven towards the 2% mark, or even a scenario where it starts to challenge macOS as the second most-used operating system in Steam \u2013 Apple\u2019s platform is now on 2.7%.",
    "The vast majority of gamers are, of course, using Windows, and mostly Windows 10, but with the latest figures for November, a big shift has started to occur with many more folks moving to Windows 11.",
    "Windows 11 was on 1.82% in October\u2019s survey, and has now leapt up to 8.28%, with Microsoft making the OS available to a good many more PCs as of mid-November. If that kind of pace continues, the January Steam hardware survey could see around 20% of gamers on Windows 11."
