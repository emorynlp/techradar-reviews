  "article": [
    "Intel has been showing off its XeSS feature, which is Team Blue\u2019s equivalent to Nvidia DLSS, releasing some footage of a couple of games using the upscaling tech \u2013 namely Hitman 3 and The Riftbreaker.",
    "At Intel\u2019s recent Innovation event, the company confirmed further details about its incoming Arc Alchemist desktop GPU \u2013 which will indeed run with 512 EUs (Execution Units) and 32 Xe Cores \u2013 and as Tom\u2019s Hardware spotted, Intel has also shared video footage of the above games with illustrative comparisons of XeSS upscaling.",
    "The catch is that the clips are uploaded in 1080p \u2013 Intel will apparently provide proper 4K resolution videos at a later date, though \u2013 and the comparative images shown are native 1080p contrasted with XeSS-powered 4K.",
    "Obviously we do need to bear in mind that Intel\u2019s own showcases will be designed to make the tech look good, but still \u2013 the results are seemingly impressive on the face of it.",
    "As well as these promising glimpses of how XeSS is shaping up nicely in these pre-release days, there\u2019s a further sign that Intel is serious about ramping up this supersampling tech with the creation of the XeSS DevMesh program.",
    "This is a way of giving devs a chance to submit their interest for incorporating XeSS within their games, preparing the ground for developers to get up and running with the tech sooner rather than later.",
    "It\u2019s clear enough that XeSS looks promising, then, and efforts to get devs into the mix and using the upscaling tech are of course welcome.",
    "What\u2019s perhaps most exciting about XeSS is that \u2013 in theory \u2013 it\u2019s kind of taking the best of both worlds when you compare to rivals Nvidia DLSS and AMD FSR. Namely that it\u2019s an open standard like the latter, and not a proprietary (closed) affair like Nvidia\u2019s effort, but crucially, XeSS is AI-powered like DLSS, whereas FSR isn\u2019t, and machine learning (AI) isn\u2019t involved with AMD\u2019s software-based upscaling trickery (though note that Team Red\u2019s goal is to achieve something which plays nice across all hardware and even older graphics cards, a rather different angle).",
    "In short, the hope is that XeSS could end up a potent blend that boasts AI upscaling results that compare with DLSS 2.0, the much-improved second-gen of Nvidia\u2019s tech, while keeping the openness that AMD offers (and not just running on Intel\u2019s own GPUs, but also AMD and Nvidia \u2013 although it\u2019ll run better on Team Blue\u2019s graphics cards, naturally). The operative word here is could, of course, and we don\u2019t really know how this third upscaling horse will actually pan out in reality. Time will tell.",
    "These early glimpses seemingly offer plenty to be optimistic about, and the fact that XeSS is already up and running in a big-name title like Hitman 3 is a good sign, along with that early access scheme to get more devs involved."
