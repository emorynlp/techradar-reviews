  "article": [
    "The global semiconductor shortage is delaying the production of everything from refrigerators and microwaves to gaming consoles and smartphones. Experts are saying it could take months for the industry to recover, but in reality the shortage is changing consumer electronics forever.",
    "The industry has been reliant on silicon for decades, but the chip shortage is helping to make electronic devices more environmentally friendly, more efficient and smaller. More companies are turning to gallium nitride (GaN), because it is easier and faster to produce than silicon chips, among other benefits.",
    "TechRadar Pro spoke to Stephen Oliver, VP Corporate Marketing and Investor Relations at Navitas Semiconductor, to find out how the shortage is impacting consumer electronics and shifting the industry away from silicon. Navitas supplies GaN chips to companies including Anker, Aukey, Belkin, Dell, Hyper, Lenovo, OPPO, RAVPower, Verizon and dozens of others."
