    "Spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follow.",
    "Back in the original Captain America\u2019s day, sorting the heroes from the villains was easy \u2013 Cap and his Howling Commandos good, HYDRA and the Nazis bad. In the subsequent decades of the MCU, however, lines of morality have become significantly more blurred, with shades-of-gray ethics and ever-shifting points of view coming to the fore. Never has this been more the case than in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, where only the two title characters are definitively heroes \u2013 and even they\u2019ve got their fair share of issues to work through.",
    "Obi-Wan Kenobi once told Luke Skywalker that \u201cmany of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view,\u201d and \u2018The Whole World is Watching\u2019 is that sentiment played out on an epic scale. Are the Flag Smashers \u201cterrorists\u201d or \u201crevolutionaries\u201d? Would Earth have been a better place if the 50 per cent snapped out of existence by Thanos had never come back? Is new Captain America John Walker making the world safer, or is he a dangerous hothead with a shield? Perhaps the answer is yes to all of the above\u2026 Because this episode makes the most of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s appetite for keeping your allegiances and sympathies in motion \u2013 while also delivering a couple of genuine shocks.",
    "Although one of the main themes of this instalment is ambiguity, there\u2019s little doubt that everyone is after Baron Zemo. The Captain America: Civil War antagonist may not get to show off his dance moves this time out, but he still has to be fleet of foot to keep ahead of the various groups who want him back in prison.",
    "Walker and his partner, Battlestar/Lemar Hoskins, have him on their hit list, but front of the queue are Wakanda\u2019s Dora Milaje, who want Zemo to face justice for the bombing that killed their former king, T\u2019Chaka. Bucky has a long history with Ayo \u2013 she helped him override his Winter Soldier programming \u2013 but that\u2019s only enough to give guarantee a brief stay of execution for Zemo.",
    "When the Dora show up to get their man, it\u2019s the best fight scene of the series so far, a beautifully choreographed sequence where Wakanda\u2019s elite guards prove more than a match for a Falcon, a Winter Soldier, a Captain America wannabe and his friend \u2013 they even reveal that Bucky\u2019s vibranium arm comes with a handy quick-release mechanism. Ironically, of course, the fight to bring Zemo into custody is the distraction that aids his escape.",
    "And it\u2019s good for the series that he\u2019s still at large, because Daniel Br\u00fchl may now be The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s MVP. Despite the seriousness \u2013 and real-world relevance \u2013 of the show\u2019s more political themes, there\u2019s still room for a character who can simply have fun being the bad guy. He\u2019s the sort of man who responds to questions about killing Nagel, the scientist behind the Super-Soldier Serum, with a true politician\u2019s answer: \u201cDo we really have to litigate what may or may not have happened?\u201d",
    "And yet, while Zemo\u2019s clearly not to be trusted, he\u2019s usually on hand with a pertinent, food-for-thought question \u2013 even if Karli Morgenthau\u2019s motives are well-intentioned, does the desire to become a superhuman automatically turn her into a dangerous supremacist? Are Super-Soldiers inherently a bad thing?",
    "While Zemo\u2019s true plans remain unclear, it now seems unlikely that he\u2019s the Power Broker \u2013 smashing up all those vials of Super-Soldier Serum would seem a spectacularly short-sighted business move if he is. Sharon Carter remains the more likely candidate \u2013 especially as she seems very keen for Sam and Bucky to find Karli. Besides, how many art dealers do you know with access to top-secret spy satellites?",
    "Meanwhile, the more we learn about Karli and the Flag Smashers (not a \u201960s beat combo, sadly), the more intriguing \u2013 and human \u2013 they become. As Karli describes the way Mama Donya took her in, it\u2019s clear she has a genuine urge to help people \u2013 and when the group describe the borderless world that existed after the Blip, you start to understand the twisted logic in Thanos\u2019s plan.",
    "But at the same time, her rap sheet includes the deaths of innocent civilians, as well as threatening to come after Sam Wilson\u2019s family to get to him. As a result, the scenes between Karli and Sam are among the most powerful in the episode, both of them wanting to see good in the other, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. Sam\u2019s idealism, calmness and desire to avoid the spotlight are arguably what drove him to turn down Captain America\u2019s shield. Ironically, his drive to find a peaceful solution shows he probably is the best person for the job.",
    "That said, after John Walker\u2019s exploits this week, the position of Captain America may not be quite so attractive\u2026",
    "Despite everything else going on, Walker\u2019s misguidedly gung-ho approach inadvertently makes him the most pivotal player in the episode. While he genuinely seems to want to make a difference \u2013 and have his highly decorated military career count for something positive \u2013 his hot-headed inability to look for a peaceful solution turns him into a liability. Defeats to the Dora Milaje and the Flag Smashers leave him doubting his abilities, but he really is the last person who should be allowed anywhere near the Super-Soldier Serum \u2013 the fact he\u2019s in possession of the last vial in existence is bad news for everyone.",
    "Especially after a closing scene that ranks among the most visceral \u2013 and chilling \u2013 in MCU history. Sure, you don\u2019t see much on screen, but you don\u2019t need much imagination to feel the full impact of the moment Walker takes vengeance for the accidental killing of Lemar \u2013 the image of a guy in Captain America\u2019s uniform beating a Flag Smasher to death with the shield will linger long in the memory.",
    "It\u2019s a moment sure to have major repercussions for the next two episodes because \u2013 with the incident filmed on multiple cellphones \u2013 the whole world really will be watching. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has made a lot of Cap\u2019s shield being a symbol. Now it\u2019s covered in blood, it\u2019s a symbol for all the wrong reasons\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "The image of Captain America carrying a blood-stained shield will be the big takeaway, but there\u2019s more to this brilliant episode than John Walker revealing the dark side we always knew he had. While \u2018The Whole World is Watching\u2019 has its superhero moments \u2013 including Sam giving his Falcon suit a rare bit of action \u2013 The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is clearly prioritizing its more human angle.",
    "Whether or not you agree with the characters \u2013 and you frequently find yourself changing your mind in a matter of minutes \u2013 every single one of them has a plausible, human motive. That even includes John Walker, whose out-of-control last act display was driven by revenge and rampant insecurity about his place in the world.",
    "Now that he's seemingly powered-up by the Serum, we can\u2019t wait to see how the last two episodes play out \u2013 it\u2019s clear it\u2019s not going to end well for everyone.",
    "New episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available on Disney Plus every Friday."
