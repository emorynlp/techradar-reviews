    "Lara Croft is set to return to the silver screen in a new Tomb Raider movie \u2013 and we now know what it is likely set to be called, with a working title of \u2018Tomb Raider: Obsidian\u2019.",
    "The film is to be directed and written by Misha Green (writer on the very good Lovecraft Country). It\u2019ll be her first feature-length directorial role, taking the project over from UK director Ben Wheatley.",
    "\"Still a long journey to production,\" Green tweeted. \"Title's not even approved. But first draft finished!!!\"",
    "Other than that, there isn\u2019t much else to go on regarding the new Tomb Raider film. Checking the cast list over on IMDB, it looks as if Alicia Vikander and Kristin Scott Thomas are reprising their respective roles of Lara Croft and Ana Miller, held in the 2016 reboot. But that\u2019s pretty much all we know of note for now \u2013 and with just the first draft being completed, we\u2019re still a way off from learning much more, it would seem.",
    "Despite only garnering middling reviews, the 2018 Tomb Raider movie reboot did reasonably well at the box office, making around $275 million on an estimated $95 million budget.",
    "It saw Vikander take the lead role once held by Angelina Jolie, in a story that more closely resembled the survival-focussed reboot games than the swashbuckling 32-bit originals.",
    "Though she\u2019s yet to helm a big blockbuster behind the camera, Green is a good choice to bring the franchise forward, with a keen eye not only for adventure, but for the supernatural, as shown by Lovecraft Country. It\u2019ll also be the first time a Tomb Raider film will be directed by a woman, which is as overdue as it is apt.",
    "Interestingly, it now seems as though the Tomb Raider movie sequel release will follow that of another closely-tied movie adaptation, with the long-gestating Uncharted movie due a February 2022 release date. The Uncharted game series took its cues from Tomb Raider, which in itself was a play on the Indiana Jones films \u2013 also getting a sequel that's expected to hit cinemas in 2022. That's not to mention Netflix's own Tomb Raider TV show currently in development. It\u2019s set to be a busy few years for Hollywood's \u2013 and gaming\u2019s \u2013 favorite adventuring archeologists then."
