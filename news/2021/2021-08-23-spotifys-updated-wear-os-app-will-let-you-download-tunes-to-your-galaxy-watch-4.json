    "While Spotify has allowed offline listening on smartphones for years \u2013 and the feature arrived on Apple Watches in May \u2013 it\u2019s finally coming to Wear OS smartwatches in an update coming soon to owners of the Galaxy Watch 4 and other wearables.",
    "Spotify first teased the feature at Google IO 2021 back in May, per What HiFi. The update is rolling out to Spotify\u2019s Wear OS app in the coming weeks, enabling offline music downloading for Premium (e.g. paying) users only \u2013 sorry, free tier listeners \u2013 but everyone will be able to download podcasts to their smartwatch, according to an official blog post.",
    "Doing so is easy: much like with the smartphone app, while listening to a song or album or playlist or podcast, tap \u2018download to watch.\u2019 A green arrow next to their names will pop up, indicating they\u2019re stored locally.",
    "Smartwatches will need to run WearOS 2.0 or newer to take advantage of the new features, and also run the latest Spotify smartphone app on their paired handset.",
    "While more is always better when it comes to specs, we haven\u2019t found too much use for the onboard storage on a smartwatch. Much of it is taken up by the operating system and pre-loaded apps \u2013 these occupy half of the Galaxy Watch 4\u2019s 16GB, for instance \u2013 and the rest could theoretically be used for apps and music.",
    "But the former don\u2019t take up that much space, and actually getting content downloaded to your smartwatch is often as cumbersome as it was to get songs on an old MP3 players.",
    "It\u2019s far easier to download content wirelessly, as we\u2019ve been able to do on phones for years \u2013 but that capability has only recently been added to smartwatches, on a service by service basis and first to Apple Watches (both Tidal and Spotify included the feature in May updates).",
    "That\u2019s why Spotify adding offline downloading for Wear OS watches is such a big deal. Even though it comes months after the feature was added to Apple Watches, it\u2019s still welcome now, especially after Samsung\u2019s new Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic have hit stands running Wear OS 3 (made in partnership between Google and Samsung). While the rollout is unclear, Spotify named Fossil, Mobvoi, and Suunto as getting the app update in the coming weeks, so keep an eye peeled.",
