    "Canadian police have arrested a teenager for reportedly stealing $46 million CAD (about $36.5 million) worth of cryptocurrencies, in what is being described as a SIM swap attack.",
    "To facilitate the theft, described as the largest-ever cryptocurrency pilferage from a single individual, the teen managed to hijack the victim\u2019s phone number, which he then used to log into the victim\u2019s crypto wallet by intercepting the two-factor authentication requests.",
    "At the time of the arrest, police only managed to seize about $7 million CAD ($5.5 million) in stolen cryptocurrency from the teen, in Hamilton, in Ontario, Canada.",
    "According to a statement, the arrest was the result of a joint investigation that began in March 2020 between the Hamilton Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force.",
    "It isn\u2019t immediately clear when the robbery took place, and whether the rest of the stolen cryptos haven\u2019t been recovered because they\u2019ve all been spent.",
    "However, the Hamilton Police statement did mention that the thief made the rather amateurish mistake of using the stolen cryptos to purchase \u201can online username that was considered to be rare in the gaming community.\u201d",
    "Although they haven\u2019t mentioned the amount the thief spent on purchasing the username it would have been sizable enough to attract the attention of the authorities. In fact it was by tracking the transaction associated with the purchase of this rare username that led the authorities to the teenager.",
    "The teenager has been produced before the courts, but the statement doesn\u2019t mention the quantum of the punishment awarded.",
