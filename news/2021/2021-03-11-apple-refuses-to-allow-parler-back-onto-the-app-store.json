  "article": [
    "Apple recently rebuffed an attempt by social network Parler to return to the App Store after a review of the company\u2019s new content moderation policies, documents show.",
    "The right-leaning social media platform was removed from the App Store in January, in the aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol. At the time, Parler was told it would not be allowed to return until it established moderation policies that prevent threats of violence circulating on the platform.",
    "Although Parler amended its community guidelines in mid-February, Apple does not believe the changes provide adequate protection against the dissemination of hateful content.",
    "\u201cAfter having reviewed the new information, we do not believe these changes are sufficient to comply with App Store Review guidelines,\u201d wrote Apple, in a letter to Parler. \u201cThere is no place for hateful, racist, discriminatory content on the App Store.\u201d",
    "In support of its findings, Apple cited various instances in which users had posted misogynistic, homophobic and racist content. The company also provided screenshots that highlighted the use of white nationalistic imagery in user profiles.",
    "\u201cSimple searches reveal highly objectionable content, including easily identified offensive uses of derogatory terms regarding race, religion and sexual orientation, as well as Nazi symbols. For these reasons, your app cannot be returned to the App Store for distribution,\u201d Apple told Parler.",
    "Marketed as the \u201cfree speech\u201d social network, Parler is renowned for its laissez-faire attitude to content moderation and has long resisted any form of user surveillance.",
    "These attributes meant Parler was the odds-on favorite to become the platform of choice for ex-US President Donald Trump after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook, and even topped the App Store download charts for a period.",
    "After the storming of the Capitol Building, however, a raft of partners came out against the social network. Both Apple and Google, which control the two largest mobile application stores in the world, removed Parler from their marketplaces over violent content that remained live on the platform.",
    "The nail in the coffin was delivered by Amazon Web Services, which withdrew its hosting services and effectively removed Parler from the public internet. It took the social network over a month to secure another content distribution partner in the form of domain registrar Epik, known for its conservative sympathies.",
    "Despite its return to action, the future remains uncertain for the platform, which has been hamstrung by its removal from major application marketplaces.",
    "The decision to block Parler\u2019s return to the App Store will add yet more fuel to debates over the ethics and legality of the Parler boycott and the need for new regulation targeting the world\u2019s largest tech and social media companies.",
    "Update: Amy Peikoff, Chief People Office at Parler, has since provided TechRadar Pro with the following statement:",
    "\"Parler\u2019s mission is to provide a welcoming, nonpartisan social media platform which allows users to exercise their freedoms of speech, thought, and association, while also respecting their privacy.\"",
    "\"Over the past two months, we\u2019ve worked towards the goal of returning to Apple\u2019s App Store, in reliance on Tim Cook\u2019s statements that Apple's problem was not with our mission, but only with the perceived lack of enforcement of our guidelines. Parler has always opposed and worked to remove violent and inciting rhetoric from our platform, because it inhibits productive, civil discourse. Accordingly, and even though we knew that problems with violent and inciting content were not unique to Parler in the weeks leading up to Jan 6\u2014a fact that independent reviews of court records have now shown\u2014we worked tirelessly to adopt enhanced protocols for identifying and removing this type of content.\"",
    "\u201cWe have since engaged Apple to show them how we\u2019ve incorporated a combination of algorithmic filters and human review to detect and remove content that threatens or incites violence. We\u2019ve also explained our new feature which empowers individual users with the option to filter out personal attacks based on immutable and irrelevant characteristics such as race, sex, sexual orientation, or religion. It\u2019s just the latest way in which Parler enables users to curate their own feeds as they choose.\"",
    "\u201cParler expects and hopes to keep working with Apple to return to the App Store. We\u2019re optimistic that Apple will continue to differentiate itself from other \u2018Big Tech\u2019 companies by supporting its customers\u2019 choice to \u2018think different\u2019\u2014to exercise their constitutionally protected freedoms of thought, speech, and association\u2014while using Apple products.\u201d",
