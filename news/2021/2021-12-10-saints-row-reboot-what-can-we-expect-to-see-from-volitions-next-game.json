    "A Saints Row reboot was revealed during Gamescom 2021 Opening Night Live, which took place on August 25, 2021.",
    "We were hoping to see the game\u2019s bonkers brand of off-the-wall action return, and weren't disappointed, as Saints Row looks like it will continue to provide a more ridiculous take on Grand Theft Auto\u2019s successful open-world formula.",
    "Even though Saints Row is a reboot, it seems like it follows the blueprint of the original game very loosely. The first two games in the series started out as a far more serious and grounded take on gangland warfare, before Saints Row descended into fighting aliens, attacking people with phallic objects and other general absurdities. The new Saints Row looks like a blend of the two.",
    "A teaser website for the Saints Row reboot first appeared on August 20, which featured a brick wall covered in graffiti. The word \u201crebooting\u201d was accompanied by the Saints Row logo, and all but confirmed that a Saints Row reboot was coming. The wall has since been lavished with more graffiti, with the phrase \u201ckeep it strange\u201d suggesting the Saints Row reboot won\u2019t deviate too far from the silly antics of the previous games.",
    "We were expecting to get a Saints Row reboot release date at Gamescom 2021 Opening Night Live, and we weren't disappointed. The game will be released on Aust 23, 2022, after a recent delay.",
    "The game is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, as well as PS4 and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch doesn't seem likely, which is a shame, especially as the game recently received Saints Row: The Third - The Full Package.",
    "Want to see all the Saints Row reboot trailers in one place? We\u2019re rounding up every trailer for the game so you don\u2019t have to waste your time scouring the internet to find them all.",
    "Saints Row - Game Awards Gameplay trailer We've been given another glimpse at Saints Row, as a new gameplay trailer was released during The Game Awards 2021. The trailer shows off some of the game's customization options, combat, and typical bonkers moments the series is famed for.d",
    "Saints Row criminal ventures Learn how you can build your empire in Saints Row. You'll take your gang from upstarts to running a criminal empire, and you'll get to choose how you do it. Check out the new trailer below.",
    "Saints Row Districts of Santo Ilesco Check out the city of Santo Ilesco in the latest Saints Row trailer. You can see some of the districts and territories which the three factions control below.",
    "Saints Row Official Announce Trailer A beautiful CGI trailer for Saints Row was revealed during Gamescom 2021, showing the types of antics you'll be getting up to when the game arrives in 2022. Check it out below.",
    "Saints Row started off as a fairly straight bat competitor to Rockstar\u2019s colossal Grand Theft Auto series. Released in 2006, Saints Row was an Xbox 360 exclusive, though the game\u2019s sequel, Saints Row 2, did make its way to PlayStation 3.",
    "Both games were perhaps unfairly labeled as GTA clones, which led to developer Volition ripping up the rulebook for Saints Row: The Third. The move to being as daft as feasibly possible was generally well-received, particularly as there\u2019s a growing number of gamers who miss the days when Grand Theft Auto didn\u2019t take itself so seriously. The decision to let loose at least helped Saints Row carve out its own audience, and avoid further comparisons with Rockstar\u2019s iconic series.",
    "The Saints Row reboot seems to use the original game as a very loose blueprint, and sprinkles over some wacky touches to inject some more fun and vibrancy into the overly serious first game. Expect a lot of crude jokes, unthinkable weaponry and a general tendency to turn things up all the way to 11.",
    "The Saints Row franchise has taken players to the depths of hell, given us superpowers and giant foam heads, but now we know the game will take place in an entirely new city: Santo Ileso. You'll also play as the future Boss of the Saints, and take on Los Panteros, The Idols and Marshall, three other gangs vying for dominance.",
    "Developer Volition promises that the Saints Row reboot will be the \"biggest and best Saints Row playground ever created\" and that the world of Santo Ileso is the perfect place for \"criminal ventures and blockbuster missions, as you shoot, drive, and wingsuit your way to the top.\"",
    "Expect a more comprehensive create-a-character option than what was available before, too, and all-new missions and side quests to complete.",
    "Want to know the latest Saints Row reboot news? You\u2019ve come to the right place. Below, you\u2019ll find all the biggest announcements about the Saints Row reboot that you won\u2019t want to miss, so make sure you check back regularly to stay up to date.",
    "Saints Row release date and announcement Saints Row was revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live, and will release on February 25, 2022. The announcement was made via a fancy CGI trailer, and showed off some of the frenetic action players can expect.",
    "Saints Row reboot website is live A website for the Saints Row reboot is now live, and shows a brick wall covered in various graffiti. The most prominent piece of spray-can art can be found in the middle of the wall, and says \u201crebooting\u201d. It doesn\u2019t take a detective to figure out, then, that we\u2019re getting a Saints Row reboot."
