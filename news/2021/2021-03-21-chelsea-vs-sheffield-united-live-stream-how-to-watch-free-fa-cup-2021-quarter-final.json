    "Chelsea come into this tie having secured a place in the Champions League quarter-finals with a commanding midweek home win over Atletico Madrid - a result that extends Thomas Tuchel's unbeaten streak to 13 games in all competitions since he replaced Frank Lampard as Blues boss in January.",
    "The away side's disastrous league form has seen them part ways with boss Chris Wilder since making the quarter-finals of the cup, with under-23 coach Paul Heckingbottom stepping him as replacement. Without the shackles of their seemingly doomed relegation battle, the interim manager will be hoping his side can pull off a shock, and strengthen his case on taking on the job full time.",
    "Having scored a feeble 16 Premier League goals this season - the lowest in the division - and having drawn a blank in their last four away games, a cup upset nevertheless seems unlikely for the Blades. Couple the fact that Chelsea have managed six clean sheets in as many home games following Tuchel's arrival, and its hard to see anything but the Blues progressing into the semi-finals.",
