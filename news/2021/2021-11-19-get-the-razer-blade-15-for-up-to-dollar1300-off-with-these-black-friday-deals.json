    "The Razer Blade 15 makes our best gaming laptops list year after year, and the 2020 model is still one of the most powerful \u2013 and usually most expensive \u2013 laptops around thanks to its RTX 2080 Super GPU.",
    "But now, with these early Black Friday deals, you can get the 4K OLED Razer Blade 15 (2020) for just $1,999 from Amazon and Best Buy.",
    "You can also get the FHD 300Hz Razer Blade 15 for only $1,799 from both Best Buy and Amazon if you're looking for a faster display and aren't as concerned with 4K graphics \u2013 or if you'd just like to save a bit more money.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "Both Razer Blade 15 models on sale right now feature an Intel Core i7-10875H processor, Nvidia RTX 2080 Super 8GB GPU, 16GB RAM, and 1TB SSD in a CNC aluminum chassis with Thunderbolt 3 ports.",
    "The difference comes down to the resolution and speed of the display. The 4K OLED version obviously comes with 4K graphics (3840 x 2160p), but OLED panels are restricted to 60Hz refresh rates, meaning that the fastest frame rate you'll ever be able to get without encountering tearing is 60 fps. Even with an RTX 2080 Super, there aren't many games where you'll be able to get 4K graphics at 60 fps anyway, so this really won't be much of an issue.",
    "The Razer Blade 15 with a full HD (1920x1080p) display, however, has a 300Hz refresh rate, which is lightning fast, especially when playing eSports titles like League of Legends where speed and response times are far more important than the quality of the graphics. Again, this is still a high-definition display, so games will look great on it, especially since a 15.6-inch display isn't the best screen size to get the most out of a 4K display.",
    "Whichever way you go, you're looking at the lowest prices we've ever seen on these two laptops that weren't refurbished units, so if you've been looking to get your hands on one of these babies, now's the time.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Razer Blade 15 from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
