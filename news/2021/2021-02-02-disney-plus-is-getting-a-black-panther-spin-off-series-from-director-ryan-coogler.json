    "\"With Black Panther, Ryan brought a groundbreaking story and iconic characters to life in a real, meaningful and memorable way, creating a watershed cultural moment,\" said Disney's executive chairman Bob Iger in the announcement. \"We\u2019re thrilled to strengthen our relationship and look forward to telling more great stories with Ryan and his team.\"",
    "Speaking on behalf of Proximity Media, Coogler said \"we couldn\u2019t be happier to be launching our television business with Bob Iger, Dana Walden and all the amazing studios under the Disney umbrella,\" also teasing that the company is \"already in the mix on some projects that we can't wait to share.\"",
