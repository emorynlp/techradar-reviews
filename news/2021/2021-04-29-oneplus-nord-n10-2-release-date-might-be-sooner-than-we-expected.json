    "The OnePlus Nord N10 5G was only announced back in October 2020 (and hit stores in November), but you might not have to wait until October of this year for the OnePlus Nord N10 2 \u2013 or whatever its successor ends up being called \u2013 because there are signs that it\u2019s landing imminently.",
    "Mukul Sharma (a leaker with a reasonable track record) tweeted that the OnePlus Nord\u2019s successor (apparently codenamed OnePlus Ebba) has been certified in both Singapore and India.",
    "These sorts of certifications usually happen quite close to launch, so the phone will probably land much less than a year after its predecessor.",
    "Unfortunately, no additional details have been shared here, but it\u2019s worth noting that as we haven\u2019t seen certifications for the OnePlus Nord N10 2 in other parts of the world, it\u2019s possible that it will only launch in parts of Asia, at least initially.",
    "This wouldn\u2019t be that surprising, after all, the OnePlus 9R recently landed in India but hasn\u2019t had a global launch. So you might not be able to buy the OnePlus Nord N10 2 everywhere.",
    "In any case, while there are no spec details here, the phone has previously been leaked by Steve Hemmerstoffer (another reputable leaker), who claims the OnePlus Nord N10 2 has the same 6.49-inch screen as the Nord N10, a plastic back, a metal frame, a triple-lens rear camera, and a punch-hole selfie camera.",
    "He also suggests it might not be much of an upgrade, so maybe it won\u2019t be the biggest loss if this phone isn\u2019t widely available. The OnePlus Nord 2 might be more interesting, and it\u2019s possible that will land around the same time.",
