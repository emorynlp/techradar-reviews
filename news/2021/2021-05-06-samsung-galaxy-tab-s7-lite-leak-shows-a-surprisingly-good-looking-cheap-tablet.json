    "After renders leaked last month showing off the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite in black, new images give us a glimpse of the other colors we could be getting when the budget slate releases.",
    "This new leak comes from the same source as before \u2013 user @evleaks on Twitter \u2013 who has shared new images of the tablet in pink, blue, green and white. We also got our first look at the tablet\u2019s book cover case which includes a holster for Samsung\u2019s premium S-Pen stylus, though it doesn\u2019t look too different from what we\u2019ve seen before.",
    "If the leak is real, Samsung\u2019s upcoming budget tablet seems set to be a stylish option even if you\u2019re not looking to splash out too hard on your next tech purchase. We\u2019ll have to wait until the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite releases to know for sure, and we likely don\u2019t have long to wait.",
    "Given that affordable gadgets often have pretty utilitarian designs, we're glad to see this anticipated device could bring good designs to the cheap tablet market.",
    "With the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite supposedly releasing soon \u2013 multiple sources have suggested June \u2013 there\u2019s a fair bit we now know about the tablet beyond its color options. For one we\u2019ve heard that it\u2019ll come with 5G connectivity capabilities \u2013 though you\u2019ll likely need a SIM and data plan to take advantage of it.",
    "Other leaks have said that the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite will also be packing a 12.4-inch 1600 x 2560 LCD screen, alongside a Snapdragon 750G chipset and 4GB of RAM. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw the tablet come with different size and higher RAM options too.",
    "Based on the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 we\u2019d expect the base version to start at around $349 / \u00a3349 / AU$649, if not slightly higher for the improved features. As we learn more about the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite from leaks and official information, we'll be sure to keep you up to date with the latest."
