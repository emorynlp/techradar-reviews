    "If you\u2019re yet to watch the animated Star Wars TV shows, you may be asking why Ahsoka Tano warrants her own TV show. Everyone else, however, will simply be wondering why it\u2019s taken so long.",
    "Arguably the most important Star Wars character who hasn't appeared in a live-action movie, Ahsoka Tano was Anakin Skywalker\u2019s Jedi apprentice throughout the Clone Wars. Thanks to The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels TV series, she\u2019s been present for many of the most pivotal moments in the history of that galaxy far, far away. Now that she\u2019s made her live-action debut (Rosario Dawson played her in The Mandalorian season 2 episode \u2018The Jedi\u2019), the Ahsoka TV show is poised to continue the former Padawan\u2019s story.",
    "The spin-off couldn\u2019t be in better hands either, with Dave Filoni \u2013 the man who oversaw both The Clone Wars and Rebels, and co-created Ahsoka \u2013 calling the shots as showrunner. So, as Filoni works his way through the scripts for this eagerly anticipated limited series, we\u2019ve been diving into some Force visions to find out what Ahsoka will have in store when it lands on Disney Plus.",
    "Release date: Disney is yet to confirm Ahsoka\u2019s release date but, seeing as the show\u2019s still at the writing stage, we\u2019d be surprised if we see it before 2023.",
    "Story: Rosario Dawson reprises her Mandalorian role as Ahsoka Tano, alongside Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Star Wars Rebels Mando Sabine Wren. Hayden Christensen is also reportedly set to return as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.",
    "Cast: Plot details are, as is standard, hidden behind Lucasfilm\u2019s impregnable defense field. It seems likely, however, that the story will send Ahsoka and Sabine on a quest to track down trainee Jedi Ezra Bridger and his Imperial nemesis, Grand Admiral Thrawn.",
    "SPOILER ALERT! Proceed with caution if you\u2019re yet to watch The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels or The Mandalorian.",
    "It was one of many new Star Wars and Marvel TV shows announced at the Disney Investor Day in December, but it looks like we\u2019ll have to wait some time for an Ahsoka TV show release date.",
    "Disney and Lucasfilm have given little indication of when the limited series will land on Disney Plus and, with an article in Empire revealing that showrunner (and Lucasfilm executive creative officer) Dave Filoni is still working on the scripts, there\u2019s clearly some way to go.",
    "The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Andor and The Mandalorian season 3 are all ahead of the Ahoska TV series in Lucasfilm\u2019s effects-heavy production pipeline, so we\u2019d be surprised if it appears any time before 2023.",
    "With the show still at the scripting stage, it\u2019s way too early to expect an Ahsoka trailer \u2013 especially as Lucasfilm rarely debuts footage more than a few months ahead of launch.",
    "For the moment ,we\u2019ll have to make do with the logo above, or rewatch some Ahsoka-focussed episodes of The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels on Disney Plus.",
    "\u201cWhen gone am I, the last of a Jedi will you be,\u201d a dying Yoda told Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi.",
    "But he was only correct from a certain point of view. Ahsoka Tano isn\u2019t technically a Jedi because she never passed the relevant trials but in all other regards, she has all the necessary qualifications.",
    "Making her first appearance in Star Wars canon in the animated 2008 Clone Wars movie that set up the long-running TV show, the Togruta was Anakin Skywalker\u2019s Padawan apprentice throughout the eponymous conflict. A highly respected commander in the Republic forces, she fought with a distinctive two-lightsaber style, and was nicknamed \u201cSnips\u201d by her master, owing to her supposedly snippy attitude. She referred to Anakin as \u201cSky Guy\u201d.",
    "Ahsoka went on to play a key role in Star Wars Rebels, set in the run-up to A New Hope, and she\u2019s since returned in The Mandalorian season 2 episode \u2018The Jedi\u2019. Her voice can also be heard among the choir of Jedi giving Rey a pep talk in The Rise of Skywalker.",
    "For the benefit of anyone yet to watch the animated Star Wars shows, here\u2019s a brief history of Ahsoka Tano\u2019s life and times.",
    "Having served the Republic with distinction throughout the Clone Wars, she left the Jedi Order under a cloud during season 5. Although she was eventually exonerated for bombing the Jedi Temple \u2013 she\u2019d been framed by her friend and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee \u2013 she decided not to return, and went out into the galaxy solo.",
    "During the final days of the Clone Wars, she helped Bo-Katan Kryze remove Darth Maul from the Mandalorian throne, and was on her way to return the former Sith Lord to Jedi custody when the Emperor initiated Order 66. With some help from her old friend Captain Rex \u2013 whose mind-controlling inhibitor chip she surgically removed \u2013 Ahsoka survived the Jedi purge and went into hiding.",
    "She showed up again in Star Wars Rebels, set around 15 years after the Emperor came to power. It was eventually revealed that Ahsoka was the mysterious \u2018Fulcrum\u2019, an agent who helped pull disparate cells of freedom fighters together to form the Rebel Alliance.",
    "She also fought a fateful duel with her former master \u2013 when she removed a portion of Darth Vader\u2019s helmet with her lightsaber, she became one of the few people in the galaxy to know his true identity. The Vader/Skywalker connection wouldn\u2019t become common knowledge across the galaxy for several decades, and the secret was eventually leaked to damage Leia Organa\u2019s political aspirations, as detailed in Claudia Gray\u2019s 2016 novel, Bloodline.",
    "Ahsoka barely made it out of the duel alive, but she was saved by a future version of Jedi apprentice Ezra Bridger. He pulled her into the \u2018World Between Worlds\u2019, a mystical realm where the usual rules of time and space do not apply. By the time of the Rebels epilogue \u2013 set some time after Return of the Jedi \u2013 Ahsoka had somehow returned to the normal reality of that galaxy far, far away.",
    "Her most recent canonical appearance came in The Mandalorian, where she met Din Djarin (aka The Mandalorian) and Baby Yoda. While communing with the Child, she learned that real name was Grogu, and gave Mando some pointers to help find some other Jedi.",
    "So what do we know about the Ahsoka TV show\u2019s story? Well, it'll have plenty of existing canon to work from, and there\u2019s nobody on the planet who knows how to navigate the Star Wars timeline better than Dave Filoni. During his previous life as supervising director on The Clone Wars, Filoni co-created Ahsoka Tano with George Lucas. He then went on to shepherd her through seven seasons of The Clone Wars and several guest appearances on Rebels. He also directed her episode of The Mandalorian.",
    "Asked about his experience writing the new show, Filoni told Empire that, \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling, I gotta tell you. It\u2019s something you imagine doing for a long time, and then it\u2019s kind of startling when you\u2019re sitting there, and now you have to do it.",
    "\u201cI thought of this adventure for Ahsoka for a long time, and it\u2019s interesting to see how it\u2019s evolved. Years ago, I never would have imagined that it was sprung from a branch of a tree that had anything to do with a guy [like] Din Djarin [aka the Mandalorian], or a child that looks like Yoda. It\u2019s a great lesson for me on how, when you have other creatives like [The Mandalorian showrunner] Jon Favreau, they can help lend such dimension and depth to what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",
    "Going by StarWars.com\u2019s original announcement about the series, it looks like the new series will pick up soon after Ahsoka\u2019s meeting with Mando and Grogu: \u201cAfter making her long awaited live-action debut in The Mandalorian,\u201d said the site, \u201cAhsoka Tano\u2019s story will continue in a limited series.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s currently unknown, however, whether that Rebels epilogue takes place before or after Ahsoka showed up in The Mandalorian.",
    "\u201cThat's not necessarily chronological,\" Filoni told Vanity Fair in November 2020. \"I think the thing that people will most not understand is they want to go in a linear fashion, but as I learned as a kid, nothing in Star Wars really works in a linear fashion. You do [Episodes] 4, 5 and 6 and then 1, 2, and 3. So in the vein of that history, when you look at the epilogue of Rebels you don't really know how much time has passed. So, it's possible that the story I'm telling in The Mandalorian actually takes place prior to that. Possible. I'm saying it's possible.\u201d",
    "One thing that both the Rebels epilogue and the Ahsoka TV show will have in common is Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren. Deadline has confirmed that Natasha Liu Bordizzo will take the character into live-action, which potentially offers up more clues about the Ahsoka story.",
    "In the Rebels finale, the duo set out to find their lost friend, Ezra Bridger, assumed to be trapped in the \u2018World Between Worlds\u2019. This could also tie in with Ahsoka\u2019s primary mission in her episode of The Mandalorian. There, she revealed that she\u2019s on the hunt for Imperial bigwig Grand Admiral Thrawn, who just happened to be with Bridger when he went missing. The way Ahsoka pressed Calodan town magistrate Morgan Elsbeth about the location of her master, aka Thrawn, suggested he\u2019s already back to make a nuisance of himself. Maybe Bridger isn\u2019t far behind?",
    "And while revenge isn\u2019t traditionally the Jedi way, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Ahsoka gets to settle a few scores with Barriss Offee. Being framed for murder is going to leave a few scars.",
    "Here's the rumored cast so far:",
    "Although Ashley Eckstein voiced Ahsoka throughout The Clone Wars and Rebels, Sin City/Daredevil star Rosario Dawson played the character in The Mandalorian, and she'll reprise the role in Ahsoka. Dawson will be joined by Natasha Liu Bordizzo, who replaces Rebels voice actor Tiya Sircar as Sabine Wren.",
    "In other casting news, these are particularly good times to be Hayden Christensen. Not only is he playing Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Hollywood Reporter says he\u2019s now joining the Ahsoka cast. As yet, it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll be playing the \u2018Sky Guy\u2019 or Vader incarnations of the character or both. But, seeing as he\u2019s dead at this point in the Star Wars timeline, chances are he\u2019ll either be appearing in flashbacks or as a Force ghost.",
    "Entering the realms of speculation, Katee Sackhoff seems a likely candidate for a return as Mandalorian princess Bo-Katan Kryze. She was the one who told Mando that Ahsoka was hiding out on Corvus, so they\u2019re clearly still in contact \u2013 and you never know when you might need to call on an old friend.",
    "We\u2019re unsure about the current whereabouts of friendly ex-Clone Trooper Captain Rex but, considering he was one of Ahsoka\u2019s best friends in The Clone Wars, a reunion would be most welcome. That could mean a cameo for The Book of Boba Fett star Temuera Morrison, whose Jango Fett was the model for all the Clones.",
    "And it\u2019ll be interesting to see who \u2013 if anyone \u2013 joins the Ahsoka TV show cast as Ezra Bridger and Grand Admiral Thrawn. Sackhoff is the only voice star from the animated series to play their character in live-action, so it would be surprising if both Taylor Gray and Lars Mikkelsen (brother of Rogue One\u2019s Mads) reprised their roles. If you picture Mikkelsen with a blue hue, however, it\u2019s immediately clear that he\u2019d make a brilliant Thrawn.",
    "Perhaps the most intriguing possibility for the Ahsoka cast, though, would be a return for digital Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. As the two most powerful (known) Force practitioners in the galaxy, they\u2019d surely have plenty to talk about \u2013 as well as reminiscing about Luke\u2019s dad, they could discuss why Ahsoka turned down the opportunity to train Grogu while Luke grabbed the opportunity with two hands."
