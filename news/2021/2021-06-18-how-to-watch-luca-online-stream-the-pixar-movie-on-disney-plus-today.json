    "Bringing the sunshine home, Pixar's latest animation is making a splash as it arrives exclusively on the House of Mouse's streaming platform. Now available to stream on Disney Plus, here's all you need to know on how to watch Luca online.",
    "Featuring young stars Jacob Tremblay and Jack Dylan Grazer, they voice Luca and Alberto alongside big stars Sacha Baron Cohen and Maya Rudolph, to bring the story of Luca to life. Transporting us to the Italian Riviera, Luca is about to experience a life-changing summer with his new best friend.",
    "From Disney's very own Italian, Enrico Casarosa directs a stunning new coming-of-age story about Luca, a sea monster able to take on the human form.",
    "Embarking on an unforgettable summer, Luca is set with the backdrop of the picturesque Italian Riviera. Here Luca goes on an exploration around the town of Portorosso with his new best friend, Alberto.",
    "Based on Italian folklore, Luca's deeply kept secret of his true identity threatens to be revealed in this stunning take inspired by the summers of our youth, and those formative childhood friendships we make along the way.",
    "Disney Plus has released a fair few exclusives recently - from its previous Pixar release, Soul, to Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon. Follow our guide below as we explain how to watch Luca online and stream the Pixar film today. Spoiler alert: it's as simple as grabbing a great value Disney Plus subscription!",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck in to we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN+ to your subscription price. The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as The Great, Upload, Helstrom and Normal People. While ESPN+ brings tonnes of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "In addition to being the exclusive release platform of new Pixar movies like Luca, subscribers can look forward to Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian, Cruella, Hamilton, Loki and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "Now that Disney has set the precedent of releasing its live-action Mulan remake on the service instead of in theaters through its Premier Access program, expect the company to keep bring more blockbuster films that were originally intended to be shown on the big screen to Disney Plus in 2021.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star payload that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy. It costs a tiny bit more, but is worth it based on our initial impressions - and you can still save big by going with an annual subscription.",
