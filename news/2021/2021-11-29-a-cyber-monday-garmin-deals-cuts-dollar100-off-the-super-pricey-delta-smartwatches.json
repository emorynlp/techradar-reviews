    "If you've got loads of cash to dump into a Cyber Monday smartwatch deal - we're talking about serious change here - then perhaps this Garmin deal is for you. The brand's two most expensive lines, Delta and Enduro, both have $100 reductions.",
    "To give you a taste of the price of these smartwatches, $100 off for Cyber Monday isn't even 10% off some of these - seriously, the top-end Delta model cost $1,300 originally. Wow. We haven't seen these Garmin watches go cheaper though, so if you want one you might as well go for this deal - though if you follow along with our Garmin, Fitbit and smartwatch deal live blog something else might crop up.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Garmin watches from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
