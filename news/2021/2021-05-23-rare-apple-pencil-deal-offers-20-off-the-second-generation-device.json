    "We don't tend to see too many Apple Pencil deals hitting the premium second-generation pointer, however Verizon has chopped 20% off the final price of the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro accessory this weekend. You will need to add the device to your cart to see the full offer, but you're saving $26 here, bringing the cost down to just $103.99.",
    "That's a stunning offer that sits only $4 above the record low price, and considering we tend to only see Apple Pencil deals during larger sales events a particularly rare one at that. On a day to day basis we only generally see this model dropping to between $120 and $125.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Apple Pencil prices in your region.",
    "The Apple Pencil second generation offers a slightly different design to the previous model, with a matte finish for better grip and a flat edge. That edge will not only allow you to magnetically charge and store your pencil on your iPad Air 4 or iPad Pro (2018 and up) but also provides access to the tap-sensitive button that can be used to quickly swap over to an eraser or secondary tool.",
    "It's also worth noting that the second generation is only compatible with the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro models from at least 2018.",
    "If you're using an older iPad Pro, an older iPad Air, a 5th generation iPad Mini, or a 6th, 7th, or 8th generation iPad you'll need to pick up the first generation Apple Pencil instead. While you do lose some of the quality of life features here, like magnetic charging, a better grip texture, and that tap button, the process of drawing or writing is functionally exactly the same.",
    "If you're looking to upgrade, you'll find a range of cheap iPad deals available right now. Or, take a look at how you can pre-order the iPad Pro 2021 for the latest and greatest in Apple's tablets. We're also rounding up the best iPad Magic Keyboard prices if you're looking to fully kit out your device.",
    "Plus, you'll find plenty more discounts in the upcoming Prime Day deals, or through next week's Memorial Day sales.",
