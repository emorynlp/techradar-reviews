    "What do you get when you combine Frances McDormand, acclaimed auteur Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, and the Oscar-nominated producer of Call Me By Your Name, Peter Spears? Awards dynamite, that\u2019s what!",
    "We detail here how to watch Nomadland online with a Hulu subscription, so you can finally catch the explosively understated drama that made the critics swoon in 2020 and emerged as one of the big winners at the Golden Globes.",
    "Based on Jessica Bruder\u2019s non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century, the movie finds middle-aged Fern (McDormand) unemployed after the economic collapse of her Nevada home town.",
    "With few prospects, she sells all her belongings and drives off across America, seeking a greater sense of peace in the nomadic lifestyle. Along the way she falls in with a group of fellow wanderers: experiencing hardship and grief, joy and freedom, against the majestic backdrop of the American West.",
    "This skeletal story might sound trite, but it powerfully resonates. McDormand is profoundly engaging as an actress, and as Fern, a woman worn down by life\u2019s tough realities, she\u2019s quietly devastating. Meanwhile, writer-director Zhao \u2013 who stunned critics with 2017\u2019s The Rider \u2013 brings an understated, earthy, documentary sensibility to Nomadland, which helps to render the reality of life on society's periphery.",
    "Judging by its amazing awards tally, it\u2019s a film that has to be seen and one of the early Oscars 2021 favorites. It\u2019s the first ever to win both the Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival and TIFF\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Award, while the Golden Globes saw it take home Best Film and Zhao win Best Director. So, prepare to be floored by a modern masterpiece as we detail how you can watch Nomadland online, and exclusively on Hulu.",
    "And if it's sports and entertainment you\u2019re after, minus the high price tag, you\u2019re in luck if you're in the US. Hulu lets you bundle together three OD platforms \u2013 ESPN, Disney +, and Hulu \u2013 for the ridiculously low fee of $12.99 a month. That combo guarantees something to suit every mood: live sports events, The Simpsons, movies, documentaries, and binge-worthy TV.",
