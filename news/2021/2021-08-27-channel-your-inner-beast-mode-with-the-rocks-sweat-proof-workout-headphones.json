    "Gym goers, listen up: The Rock has added to his fitness fashion line with a pair of workout-ready JBL headphones.",
    "Hollywood's highest paid actor has once again teamed up with Under Armor for the Project Rock Over-Ear Training cans, designed to be used in a busy gym environment and, obviously, to make you feel as powerful as the 270-pound former wrestler himself.",
    "But as well as simply being branded with the star\u2019s Brahma Bull insignia, the headphones \u2013 which are essentially an updated version of a similar JBL model released back in 2018 \u2013 actually boast some pretty impressive audio features, too.",
    "For starters, they pack active noise-cancelling (ANC) tech and a 45-hour battery life. Most of the best noise-cancelling headphones in our buying guide don\u2019t rock anywhere near that level of endurance, with most over-ear models \u2013 including our top pick, the Sony WH-1000XM4 \u2013 packing around 30 hours on a full charge.",
    "What\u2019s more, Under Armour claims The Rock\u2019s latest cans also sport a speed charging feature that allows users to get two hours of playback time in just five minutes. Again, that\u2019s a faster charge time than most of the best headphones out there right now.",
    "Evidently, though, the Project Rock Over-Ear Training headphones are designed with fitness fanatics in mind, hence their IPX4 sweat-resistance rating, extra headband grip and washable supervent materials on their fast-drying ear cushions.",
    "Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa are also on hand should you find yourself needing to answer a call, change music track or double check how to safely perform a deadlift mid-workout.",
    "They\u2019re not cheap, mind. At $299.95 / \u00a3232.00 (around AU$410), these running headphones are in a similar price category to those at the top of our buying guides \u2013 but at least you\u2019ll feel like a beast, right?",
    "As if The Rock needed to line his pockets any further, the Hollywood A-lister\u2019s latest headphones arrive in tandem with his Under Armour-branded running shoes and sweat-activated graphic T-shirts.",
    "The former are pretty self-explanatory \u2013 they\u2019re foam-based workout trainers, basically \u2013 but the latter are blank vests and T-shirts that reveal motivational messages when exposed to moisture.",
    "Now, we\u2019re no personal trainers, but we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019d keep that novelty quiet if we were having a slow day in the gym.",
    "The entirety of The Rock\u2019s new workout collection is available now at Under Armour\u2019s official website."
