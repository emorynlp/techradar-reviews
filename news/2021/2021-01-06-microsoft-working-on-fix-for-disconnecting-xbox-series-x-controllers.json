    "Microsoft has committed to correcting an issue that causes some Xbox Series X controllers to stop sending inputs in certain games and, in some cases, disconnecting from consoles entirely.",
    "The problem was the subject of hundreds of complaints \u2013 beginning in mid-November upon the console\u2019s initial release \u2013 on Microsoft\u2019s Xbox forum, and can occur across both blue and black versions of the controller.",
    "One user, for example, complained: \u201cWhen I load Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, the controller keeps connecting and disconnecting on its own. So, for example, within 10 seconds it connects and disconnects about 5 times which makes the game unplayable,\u201d to which over 1700 others selected the \u201cI have the same question\u201d option.",
    "Twitter users have shared videos highlighting the frustrating issue.",
    "\"We are aware some players may be experiencing disconnects with their new Xbox Wireless Controllers and our teams are actively working on a solution to be included in a future update,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said, encouraging customers to update to the latest controller firmware via the company\u2019s troubleshooting page.",
    "If you\u2019re experiencing similar controller disconnects on a Windows PC via Bluetooth, there\u2019s already a Windows Update you download to patch the issue. In any case, Microsoft is aware of the pesky bug, so expect a quick fix on the way soon."
