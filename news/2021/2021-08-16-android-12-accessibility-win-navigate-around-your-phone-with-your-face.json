    "While the Android 12 beta has been available for months, new features are being discovered all the time \u2013 like one that allows users to control their phone with their face.",
    "The feature, which was first noticed by Droid Life via Twitter user Hani Mohamed Bioud, adds the feature specifically to expand accessibility, though there\u2019s nothing stopping other users who have downloaded the early version of Android 12 from trying it out.",
    "The feature, called Camera Switch, recognizes particular facial movements \u2013 from smiling to raising eyebrows to looking left, right, and up \u2013 which can be mapped to navigation options. The feature is nested deep in the phone\u2019s settings \u2013 to reach it, head to Settings > Accessibility > Switch Access > Settings > Camera Switch.",
    "The Android 12 beta was made available shortly after it was officially revealed at Google IO 2021, and while new perks like the Material You unified UI redesign and new privacy controls were showcased, we haven\u2019t seen much in the way of accessibility with beta releases aside from making it easier to summon Google Assistant by long-pressing any phone\u2019s lock button.",
    "That makes Camera Switch the most exciting accessibility feature we\u2019ve seen yet in Android 12, making up some ground behind Apple\u2019s operating systems, which have offered superior and more widely-ranging accessibility options \u2013 for instance, an iPadOS update earlier this year added support for third-party eye-tracking devices to navigate using eye movements.",
    "But if you\u2019re curious, the Android 12 beta is open to more than just Pixel phones, though admittedly Google\u2019s handsets will get a more stable public beta; if you\u2019re using one of a dozen other Android 12 compatible phones like the Oppo Find X3 Pro, OnePlus 9, TCL 20 Pro 5G, or Xiaomi Mi 11, you\u2019ll have access to a more finicky (but still free) developer beta."
