    "Hype is building that Microsoft will announce Windows 11, or some kind of successor to Windows 10, at an event on June 24. But before we get too excited, we\u2019d like the company to fix some outstanding issues in Windows 10 first.",
    "One of the most annoying problems with Windows 10, as Bleeping Computer points out, is the fact that Windows 10 still only offers one option update at a time.",
    "Optional updates aren\u2019t automatically installed, but they can contain fixes and new features that will be useful for certain people, but not everyone.",
    "However, if you use Windows 10\u2019s Update tool and select \u2018View option updates\u2019, it doesn\u2019t show you all of the updates that are available.",
    "This may mean you have to install other updates to see the one you actually want. In Bleeping Computer\u2019s example, the new Windows 10 21H1 update is offered above all other optional updates, and you can\u2019t install other optional updates until you install Windows 10 21H1 update. We checked, and the same happened for us.",
    "As Bleeping Computer points out, Microsoft added an Option Update Experience to Windows 10 back in 2019 to allow you to choose what optional updates you want to install. It appears this feature isn\u2019t working.",
    "This is frustrating, as if you need to install other updates to get to the update you want, it\u2019s not very optional.",
    "It also makes us a bit concerned that Microsoft is turning its attention to Windows 11, or whatever the \u2018next generation of Windows\u2019 will be known as, before fixing fundamental problems in Windows 10.",
    "As we\u2019ve seen recently, Microsoft is still in the habit of releasing updates for Windows 10 that break more things than they fix.",
    "A new report by Windows Latest highlights how the News and Interests feature, which has been recently added to Windows 10, and is supposed to show you weather and news based on your location and search history, is causing issues for some people.",
    "So, what we\u2019d like to see is Microsoft address these problems before we get too excited about Windows 11. Otherwise, it just feels like Microsoft is dropping Windows 10 \u2013 and the users who want to stick with it \u2013 for something newer and shinier."
