    "It\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve had to speculate in earnest about the identity of the next James Bond.",
    "Of the six actors to have played 007 in the official series, nobody\u2019s done it longer than Daniel Craig. In fact, when he hangs up his Walther PPK after the long-delayed No Time to Die (read our spoiler-free review here), it\u2019ll be 15 years since he first wore the tuxedo in Casino Royale. And while Sean Connery and Roger Moore both headlined more movies, the Craig era will go down as one of the finest, with both Casino Royale and Skyfall deserving to be ranked alongside the 59-year-old franchise\u2019s best. Which means that whoever gets the gig as the next James Bond actor has some big shoes to fill.",
    "In keeping with tradition when a 007 star departs, the rumor mill is now in overdrive, as fans and media outlets around the world try to second guess where producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson \u2013 the keepers of the Bond flame \u2013 will go next. Will they go younger, with a Jason Bourne-style action hero as they did for Casino Royale? Or will they be looking for a star who can quip with the best of them, in the tradition of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan?",
    "Historically speaking, if you\u2019re a male actor with a decent screen profile, who can pull off a passable English accent, and are aged between 30 and 50, chances are your name will be mentioned in conversations about the next James Bond. And this time out, we can expect the talent search to be much more diverse than in the past, with actors of color and women now coming into the mix \u2013 though, going on Broccoli\u2019s comments last year, a female Bond still seems unlikely.",
    "\u201c[James Bond] can be of any color, but he is male,\u201d producer Barbara Broccoli told Variety in 2020. \u201cI believe we should be creating new characters for women \u2013 strong female characters. I\u2019m not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.\u201d",
    "So with Daniel Craig\u2019s final mission for queen and country landing in UK theaters on September 30 (October 8 in the US), we\u2019ve picked out 10 of the leading candidates to be the next James Bond.",
    "The current favorite with the bookmakers has long been held up as a potential successor to Daniel Craig, and it\u2019s easy to see why \u2013 Hardy looks good in a suit, has charisma to spare, and has a big Hollywood profile. But, there\u2019s little on his resum\u00e9 suggests he\u2019d want to be the next James Bond \u2013 he\u2019s an actor with a history of idiosyncratic career choices, with even his blockbuster roles (Eddie Brock in Venom, Eames in Inception, Bane in The Dark Knight Rises) leaning towards the eccentric. In fact, it\u2019s hard to imagine him playing a role as by-the-book as 007.",
    "Having narrowly missed out to Daniel Craig ahead of Casino Royale, the 38-year-old Man of Steel star remains a leading contender to be the next James Bond. He\u2019s already proved he looks the part as a secret agent in both The Man from UNCLE and Mission: Impossible: Fallout, and told GQ in 2020 that he would \u201cabsolutely jump at the opportunity\u201d. But with The Witcher a major commitment \u2013 and the possibility of playing Superman again still open \u2013 will he have the time?",
    "Like Hardy, Elba is another star now associated with 007 by default. And having taken roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (the Thor movies), the DC Extended Universe (The Suicide Squad), the Alien franchise (Prometheus) and Pacific Rim, his blockbuster credentials are beyond reproach. While he\u2019d undoubtedly be brilliant in the role, however, the big question mark over Elba is his age. At 49, he\u2019s just four years younger than Daniel Craig, and you have to wonder if the producers will want to commit to a leading man who\u2019d be in his mid-to-late fifties by the time his third movie came around.",
    "If we were writing this when No Time to Die was originally slated to come out in March 2020, the question on everybody\u2019s lips would have been, \u201cReg\u00e9-Jean who?\u201d Since then, however, his starring role in Bridgerton (Netflix\u2019s biggest show ever) has turned him into one of the hottest talents on the planet \u2013 and a frontrunner to play the next James Bond. He\u2019s now signed up to play the lead role in a movie reboot of Leslie Charteris\u2019s spy thriller The Saint, but don\u2019t expect that to stand in the way of Bond if Broccoli and Wilson decide he\u2019s their man. Besides, Roger Moore played the Saint before his long-running stint as 007, so there is a precedent.",
    "When conversations start about the identity of the next James Bond, there\u2019s usually a few British network TV stars in the mix. The leading contender this time out (in the eyes of the bookmakers, at least) is James Norton, who\u2019s become a big name in the UK thanks to Happy Valley, Grantchester, McMafia and War & Peace. Despite a leading role in HBO\u2019s The Nevers, however, his limited Hollywood profile may count against him \u2013 something that could also be said of Poldark\u2019s Aidan Turner.",
    "Since his breakout role in Crazy Rich Asians, Golding\u2019s career has only headed in one direction \u2013 up. With roles in rom-com Last Christmas and GI Joe spin-off Snake Eyes, he\u2019s clearly on Hollywood\u2019s radar, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 also seems to be interested in the role. \u201cIt is the opportunity for change,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cBe it female, male, bi, gay, straight, trans, Asian, black, Latina\u2026 Now is the time in history where it doesn\u2019t matter. That is the most amazing feeling. So the possibilities are endless.\u201d His stint as a presenter on the BBC\u2019s The Travel Show should also be good preparation for all that globetrotting.",
    "Another big name who seems to fit the 007 like a glove \u2013 Hiddleston even went to the same school, though Bond was expelled from Eton College for his misdemeanours. The Loki star proved his espionage potential in brilliant BBC drama The Night Manager, and would undoubtedly be a bankable lead \u2013 but, after a decade in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and Loki still a going concern), would he really want to tie himself to another mega-franchise? Marvel co-star Benedict Cumberbatch may have similar issues with the role.",
    "He may not have made it past the third season of Game of Thrones, but the former King in the North hasn\u2019t let the events of the Red Wedding stand in his way. He\u2019s about to make his blockbuster debut as a god-like superhuman in Marvel\u2019s Eternals, but his big 007 calling card is undoubtedly his role in hit 2018 Brit drama Bodyguard (created by Line of Duty\u2019s Jed Mercurio). If the producers want their next James Bond to punctuate the action with scenes of intense brooding, Madden could be their guy.",
    "A slightly leftfield option for the next James Bond, admittedly, but Tom Ellis does have some time on his hands now that Lucifer has finally, definitively come to an end on Netflix. Playing the Devil in LA across six seasons, Ellis proved he has suaveness in spades, and if the producers unexpectedly decide they want to ramp up the Roger Moore-style archness, we can\u2019t think of a better candidate.",
    "She\u2019s not necessarily the next James Bond, but it seems Captain Marvel star Lynch will be the next 007 \u2013 her No Time to Die character Nomi has reportedly inherited the codename from the exiled Bond. We\u2019ve already seen from the trailers that she\u2019s every bit her predecessor\u2019s equal, so \u2013 while Barbara Broccoli\u2019s comments suggest there won\u2019t be a female Bond \u2013 there\u2019s no reason Nomi couldn\u2019t front a spin-off movie set in the same universe as the Bond franchise. In fact, the main thing counting against her is that other double-0 agents in Bond movies tend to have a very low life-expectancy.",
    "No Time to Die is in theaters from September 30 in the UK and October 8 in the US."
