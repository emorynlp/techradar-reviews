    "Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Fleabag comprises 12 third wall breaking, family drama cringing, guinea pig petting, statue stealing, hot priest swooning episodes of practically perfect television. And thankfully, every one of them is available to see from pretty much anywhere and absolutely free - keep reading to discover how you can watch Fleabag online where you are.",
    "On the face of it, this is almost a modern comedy of manners, as the eponymous 20-something Fleabag (played by Waller-Bridge) navigates her way through mortifying family dinners, embarrassing sexual encounters and a mind haunted by the tragic death of her best mate and business partner (that business being, of course, a guinea pig-themed caf\u00e9). It's by turns poignant, irreverent, cringe-inducing, tear-jerking - but, most of all, it's just downright hilarious.",
    "Now with a mantel-piece heaving under the weight of Baftas, Golden Globes and Emmys, Fleabag was the series that turned Phoebe Waller-Bridge into a global star. Yep, this is where the Star Wars cameos, Donald Glover collabs and James Bond screenwriting all began.",
    "Whether you're streaming it for the first time or are rebinging it (again!), the great news is that you can see both seasons absolutely 100% free, with your avenues to watch Fleabag online explained below.",
    "If you find yourself abroad in a country where your preferred streaming service isn't available or you can't log-in to watch the show as usual, that's probably down to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Thankfully, help is at hand. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite show no matter where you are, simply by changing your IP address to one that's back in your country of residence. Here's how to get started with this essential bit of streaming software.",
