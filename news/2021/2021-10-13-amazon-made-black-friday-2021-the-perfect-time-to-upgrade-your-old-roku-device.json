    "Amazon has just sent out another warning to Roku users that its Prime Video app will soon no longer be supported on some older devices, just in time for the Black Friday 2021 season.",
    "On November 1, you\u2019ll no longer be able to rely on Amazon\u2019s video streaming platform for entertainment if you\u2019re still using some of Roku\u2019s oldest legacy streaming boxes. Thankfully, newer devices will still be supported by Amazon, with access to Prime Video only being taken away from the following:",
    "In fairness, these are all included in Roku\u2019s list of legacy devices and some haven\u2019t been supported by their own manufacturer for a couple of years at this point. Amazon pulling the plug on its support is just another nail in their coffin, and a reminder that you need to upgrade to something more up to date as soon as you can.",
    "November 1 will mark the start of the Black Friday 2021 build-up, so if you can hold on a little longer, you might be able to snag a great deal on the newer Roku devices just as your old one becomes defunct.",
    "If you want to see a major leap forward in performance, you\u2019ll want to be on the lookout for Roku Express 4K Plus (2021) deals. While it was only released in April this year the device has already been discounted slightly and could be set to drop more substantially below its $39.99 / \u00a339.99 asking price come November.",
    "With 4K and HDR10+ support, this stick supports a brilliant image quality and the Roku OS is still a breeze to use - we like this stick so much we gave it four out of five stars.",
    "Alternatively, you could check out slightly older devices like the Roku Streaming Stick Plus or the Roku Express which are sure to be discounted further during the Black Friday season."
