    "One of the beauties of the website builder and web hosting solution that is WordPress is its customizability. With a little bit of code tweaking, you can make your site look however you like. But such power can be intimidating. Where do you start? How do you do it? How long would it take you?",
    "Thankfully, many creators have done all the hard work for you: there are a plethora of themes you can apply to your site to transform it in seconds. With that in mind, we\u2019ve looked at five of the best WordPress portfolio-styled themes aimed at making your creative business stand out.",
    "Angle was created by WPZoom, who have a wealth of themes to choose from. Angle offers a very clean look. As with nearly all themes, this one covers everything, from a main page, to individual posts, and there are enough customization possibilities to transform it into the ideal display for your work or business. Widgets are also available for further customization.",
    "As you should expect from a modern theme, it is built to be responsive (i.e. it adapts itself to the screen it\u2019s being viewed on - be it desktop, tablet or phone), and can manage the high \u201cretina\u201d resolution of modern portable devices.",
    "The theme will cost you $69 per year and includes a year of updates and support, but you also have a one-time purchase option of $159 (currently reduced from $395). Updates and support are unlimited for that option. Alternatively, it\u2019s worth mentioning that $129 per year would get you all of WPZoom\u2019s 37 WordPress themes.",
    "The aim of Coastline is to put your photography front and center. The main menu is composed of large thumbnails, as examples of your work for each of your categories. The sidebar is placed on the left and we really liked that it\u2019s anchored in position: no matter how far you scroll down, it\u2019s always there ready to take your visitor to another page on your site (of course this doesn\u2019t apply when viewed on a phone screen, but just shows how well this theme\u2019s responsive design is).",
    "Coastline is currently on offer for $49 (at the moment, it's reduced to $34.3). This is a one-time fee, but should you need support and updates beyond your first year, you\u2019ll have to pay again for the privilege. A little more - $69 (at the moment, it's reduced to $48.3) - grants you access to all of CSS Igniter\u2019s themes (again for a year of updates and support). If you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019d rather pay once for a lifetime\u2019s worth of support and updates, all their themes can be yours for $249 (at the moment, it's reduced to $174.3).",
    "If you\u2019re familiar with Themify, the designers of the Elegant theme, you\u2019ll know they include their \u2018drag & drop builder\u2019 with each purchase, meaning that it\u2019s incredibly easy to customize their theme to suit your exact needs, by adding and moving modules anywhere you want on the page.",
    "Elegant is the right name for this\u2026 elegant theme. It comes with its own typography, and even comes with filters that are triggered when you mouse over your photos. These include sepia, blur and grayscale. Various layout options are offered, along with the ability to customize the header for each page.",
    "Elegant is a very beautiful and simple theme which costs $59. This includes one year of support and updates, and the right to use it on as many sites as you\u2019d like. Themify also offer a 30-day money back guarantee, as well as a 50% discount if you\u2019re switching from another theme. You can also gain access to all of Themify\u2019s themes, for $89.",
    "Gallery Pro aims for the minimalist look, which is not a negative, we assure you. As with all modern themes, it is fully responsive and looks good on whichever screen it\u2019s viewed from. Of course, just like the others, it is fully customizable, allowing you to change its background, colors and content. It also comes with a series of templates to help you create new pages, such as blogs and landing pages, with very little effort. You can mix and match your pages with various design elements, including \u2018full width\u2019 which, as the name suggests, lets you display a photo, taking up the entire width of the screen - or window. Various customization widgets are also part of the deal.",
    "The only downside really is its price. It\u2019s noticeably the most expensive theme on the list as there\u2019s no yearly subscription: $129.95 is a one-time purchase. It includes StudioPress\u2019 \u2018Genesis Framework\u2019, continuous updates, and one year of support.",
    "Nikkon is a simple theme, but it comes with an unbeatable advantage over the others on this list: it\u2019s free. Now of course it won\u2019t have all the bells and whistles the others offer, but if you\u2019re starting out, you really can\u2019t beat free. So what do you get for your money?",
    "Ideal for photography enthusiasts, this theme\u2019s main page offers a grid-based layout, so you can display your images clearly and with ease. You can anchor a sharing toolbar so it\u2019s always available no matter how far a visitor scrolls down. The theme comes with several header styles to suit your needs, supports blogging, and also integrates with WooCommerce should you decide to sell your shots. As it stands, it\u2019s ideal for starting out, and there\u2019s also a Nikkon Pro option with additional feature when you\u2019re ready to pay for them.",
