    "The Oculus Quest 2 is getting expanded voice command functionality with a new wake phrase: \u2018Hey Facebook\u2019. The same feature is also being released to Portal devices, with plans to have it rolled out to older Quest devices in the future.",
    "According to an Oculus blog post, the new \u2018Hey Facebook\u2019 phrase can be used to preface commands like \u2018open Supernatural\u2019 or \u2018take a screenshot\u2019 much like how saying \u2018Hey Alexa\u2019 activates your Amazon Echo.",
    "This new opt-in feature won\u2019t be available right away on every device - and could take about a week to get to everyone - nor will it be replacing the current methods of turning on voice commands - such as double-tapping the controller button. However, it won\u2019t alleviate any fan concerns about increased Oculus and Facebook integration.",
    "Oculus already sparked annoyance from fans after it was revealed that if your Facebook account and Oculus profile are linked, deleting your Facebook takes away all of your Oculus purchases and progress.",
    "While these voice commands aren\u2019t on the same scale, they will act as a constant reminder to users that Facebook is - and likely always will be - an integral part of Oculus devices.",
    "If you want to stave off this latest feature as long as possible you shouldn\u2019t have too much to worry about. \u2018Hey Facebook\u2019 voice commands are currently an optional feature and if your mic or headset is turned off, there\u2019s no way it can listen to you even if it wanted."
