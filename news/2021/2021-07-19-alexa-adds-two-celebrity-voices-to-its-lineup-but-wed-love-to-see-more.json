    "Amazon has added two new voice profiles to its Alexa voice assistant, allowing users to spice up their smart home experience with a touch of celebrity. That is, if you want your home to be filled with the voice of either Melissa McCarthy or Shaquille O\u2019 Neal.",
    "As reported by CNN, Amazon made the announcement via its About Amazon news blog. For $4.99 each, users will be able to replace the default voice profile of Alexa to either Shaq or McCarthy.",
    "Currently, the celebrity voice profiles are only available to US customers, with no word if the dulcet tones of the former NBA star or comedian will show up in other territories. This was also the case with the Samuel L. Jackson voice profile for Alexa released in 2019, which is similarly limited to the US.",
    "Enabling one of these celebrity voices on your Alexa device is blissfully straightforward. Once you\u2019ve bought your desired voice profile, simply say to your voice assistant: \u201cAlexa, introduce me to Shaq/Melissa McCarthy,\u201d and the respective voice will be set. You can then designate a wake word to easily access your desired voice profile at any time.",
    "But what if you\u2019re not in the US? Fear not, as other celebrity voice profiles do exist depending on your region. UK Alexa users, for example, can download a Gordon Ramsay voice profile for free \u2013 if you want your cooking to be berated with characteristically violent language, that is. Voice profiles seem to be available on a per-region basis, so it\u2019s worth searching \u201cAlexa voice\u201d or a similar keyword to browse what\u2019s available in your country.",
    "We\u2019re actually surprised Amazon hasn\u2019t fully capitalized on this tech just yet. There\u2019s shockingly few voice profiles available, but we feel the tech giant could be onto something by making more voices available worldwide. The voice profiles use impressive \u201cdeepfake\u201d tech that emulates the celebrity\u2019s voice, so they don\u2019t have to spend years recording for every possible instance.",
    "Personally, we\u2019d love for Christopher Walken to tell us a joke, or have Captain Jack Sparrow deliver us the morning news. Ultimately, though, we hope it doesn\u2019t take Amazon another couple of years to add more celebrity voice profiles, because we think the novelty factor alone can be seriously fun."
