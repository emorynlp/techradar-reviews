    "Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the first games I ever played growing up \u2013 but for the youth of today, that honor probably goes to Minecraft (or if you\u2019re really unfortunate, Fortnite).",
    "Now, though, my childhood hero Sonic is entering the world of Minecraft to celebrate his 30th anniversary, and I feel like this represents the best possible chance for me to play Mojang\u2019s incredibly popular game for the very first time.",
    "You see, for someone who prides themselves on having sampled most of what the gaming world has to offer, I\u2019m slightly ashamed to admit that I still haven\u2019t played Minecraft after all these years. I don\u2019t know if it was the whole \u201cbuild it yourself\u201d nature of the game that first put me off or the basic blocky visuals, but the craze passed me by in the blink of an eye \u2013 kind of like Sonic running at top speed.",
    "However, after watching the Sonic x Minecraft DLC trailer, which has been created by Gamemode One Inc. in close collaboration with Mojang and Sega, I think I might be ready to give Minecraft a good old college try to finally see what all the fuss is about. I mean just look at how great the Sonic looks using Minecraft\u2019s unique artstyle... and Knuckles.",
    "Even though the Sonic and Minecraft crossover doesn\u2019t revolve around the usual \u201cmine, craft, build\u201d formula of Mojang\u2019s game, that\u2019s probably a good thing. I can dip my toes into the game\u2019s unique world off the back of something I already know and love, as the Sonic DLC will have players collecting rings, dashing past obstacles and defeating bosses. Then, if I find myself warming up to Minecraft\u2019s ways, maybe, just maybe, I\u2019ll go pound away at some blocks.",
    "Crucially, the Sonic DLC looks to be far more substantial than the Super Mario crossover, which just looked like a load of skins and items to my untrained eye. Take that, Mario.",
    "Now, I\u2019m aware that the Sonic x Minecraft DLC won\u2019t rival the likes of the superb Sonic Mania, but doesn\u2019t it look fun? Even just a little bit? Say what you want about Sonic (as long as it\u2019s nice), but the fastest thing alive still has a habit of injecting a feel good factor into games.",
    "It\u2019s also Sonic\u2019s 30th anniversary today, June 23, so it\u2019s about time gamers showed him some damn respect already. He\u2019s the reason we got a Sega Dreamcast after all, which is arguably the greatest console of all time.",
    "But what does Sonic\u2019s future hold outside of Minecraft? Well, there\u2019s another Sonic movie on the way, which was easily the best video game film in the last 10 years, and Sonic Colors is getting an impressive remaster for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch on September 7.",
    "Fans of the Blue Blur can also look forward to Sonic Origins, which compiles the first three games along with Sonic CD into one neat package, and there\u2019s a brand-new Sonic game in the works from the folks at Sonic Team.",
    "The future\u2019s looking rosy for everyone\u2019s favorite spikey hedgehog, then, and with the Sonic x Minecraft DLC now available, the celebrations are officially underway. Here\u2019s to 30 more years."
