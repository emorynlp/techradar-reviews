    "Microsoft has posted a video attempting to clarify the requirements of Windows 11, while agreeing with the frustrations of some who won\u2019t be able to upgrade to the operating system.",
    "It\u2019s safe to say that the messaging for the requirements of Windows 11 hasn\u2019t been the clearest, so Microsoft has been trying to make sense of it to users in the lead up to its release.",
    "With conflicting advice on what the requirements are for, especially with no clear explanation as yet regarding the TPM 2.0 module, this question and answer session to potential business users for Windows 11 was another effort in making the system requirements clear.",
    "In a video named \u2018Windows 11 upgrade paths and deployment tools\u2019, representatives from Microsoft further explained how the upcoming operating system was a big upgrade, while also making sure it was compatible with enterprise and business users to easily deploy the upgrade to workplaces across the world.",
    "However, the topic of Windows 11 system requirements was raised, with the company keenly aware that the eligibility requirements were steep compared to previous Windows releases.",
    "\u201cWe know it sucks that some aren\u2019t going to be eligible for Windows 11,\u201d Microsoft explained, \u201cbut the great thing to remember is the reason we\u2019re doing this is to keep devices more productive and ensure that users have better security than ever before so businesses can stay protected in this new workforce.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s now two months since Windows 11 was officially announced, and while its new look and features were welcomed by many, these seemed to be spoiled by the complex system requirements that it necessitates.",
    "Before June, you would be hard-pressed to read about TPM, but now it\u2019s a valid concern for many people, as without it, you won\u2019t be able to run Windows 11. Even before the upgrade is released, there\u2019s already concerns that the messaging has been messed up for the new upgrade, with users wondering if staying with Windows 10 is the better option for now, especially as it\u2019s being supported until at least 2025.",
    "It would be great to see Microsoft revisit these requirements, and perhaps better explain them in a blog post, or even a video, explicitly explaining what\u2019s needed, or at least explain why TPM is required from a security standpoint. Apple explains the security of its operating systems at every opportunity to its customers, so it\u2019s not that much of a stretch to expect Microsoft to do something similar.",
    "However, we are quickly approaching the rumored release date of October for Windows 11, and to get a clear explanation of which devices can run Windows 11 could be a great help to many.",
