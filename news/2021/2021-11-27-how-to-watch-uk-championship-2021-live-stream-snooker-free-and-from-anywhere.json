    "Neil Robertson consigned Judd Trump to more UK Championship heartbreak 12 months ago, but the Bristolian enters the first Triple Crown event of this season in top form. Will anyone be able to stop him in York? Read on as we explain how to watch a 2021 UK Championship snooker live stream online today from anywhere - including for free thanks to the BBC and its easy-to-use iPlayer streaming service.",
    "The UK Championship is second only to the World Championship in terms of scale and importance, and Trump - currently ranked world No. 2 behind Mark Selby - has only won it once, a full decade ago.",
    "However, having blasted aside the competition in his maiden Champion of Champions triumph last weekend, he's looking like the man to beat.",
    "The tournament has been a far happier hunting ground for Ronnie O'Sullivan, the most successful player in UK Championship history with seven titles to his name. With recent murmurs suggesting that The Rocket may have lost his edge, don't rule out some timely fireworks.",
    "Robertson edged an unforgettable neck-and-neck classic of a final a year ago, and whatever happens this time, the good news is that it's easy to get a FREE snooker live stream - just follow our guide to watch the 2021 UK Championship online from anywhere.",
    "We've set out below the ways you can watch a UK Championship live stream in a number of countries around the world. However, if you're away travelling for work or pleasure, you probably won't be able to watch the snooker like you normally would at home.",
    "That's the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world. A good streaming VPN can let you get around these digital borders, while also offering robust protection from cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream snooker from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to the BBC iPlayer site or app once the broadcaster's coverage begins",
    "Until recently, Eurosport used to be the place for snooker fans in Australia to get the coverage of world tournaments. But that is no more, and we can't find it listed on any other broadcaster's schedule.",
    "That means that the only way we can think of to live stream snooker Down Under is to grab the best streaming VPN you can and head to a broadcaster's site abroad that is showing it."
