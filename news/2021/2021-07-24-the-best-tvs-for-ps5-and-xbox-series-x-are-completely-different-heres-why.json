  "article": [
    "If you\u2019re after the best TV for a PS5 or Xbox Series X console, now is the time to get one. The 2021 TV ranges from most TV makers are out in the wild, and those brands have had the chance to respond to the launches of these next-gen consoles by packing in more gaming modes, enhanced refresh rates, and HDMI 2.1 inputs than we\u2019ve ever seen before.",
    "But if you only have one of these consoles \u2013 as we suspect most next-gen gamers do \u2013 it\u2019s important to note that the TV requirements for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X (and, of course, the lower-spec Xbox Series S) aren\u2019t quite the same.",
    "If you have bought a high-spec gaming TV, you needn\u2019t worry too much. A TV with a good picture, low input lag, and HDMI 2.1 specifications (such as 4K/120Hz passthrough and variable refresh rate / VRR) is going to work great with either console. Dedicated gaming modes are also pretty common these days, whether on TVs or projectors, meaning your screen\u2019s processor will prioritize smooth motion and responsible inputs over incredibly cinematic detail.",
    "The main difference is in format support, with Sony and Microsoft taking very different stances when it comes to integration with HDR and 3D audio standards. Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
    "As much as Xbox and PlayStation consoles are seen as bitter enemies \u2013 along with their fan bases \u2013 the fact is that the PS5 and Xbox Series X are both pretty similar pieces of hardware. They\u2019re essentially gaming PCs, after all, both with custom AMD chipsets and equivalent (if slightly varying in places) performance.",
    "One place where they really do vary, though, is with HDR. The Xbox Series X is a standout HDR console with its support for Dolby Vision, which will at some point enable high-end HDR gaming \u2013 likely for Halo Infinite, for one \u2013 and is already being trialled for a certain number of Xbox Insiders.",
    "The PS5 doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision, of course \u2013 and while we\u2019re told that there\u2019s no exclusivity agreement between Microsoft and Dolby, it\u2019s clear that the format doesn\u2019t fit into Sony\u2019s immediate plans for its console lineup.",
    "This is complicated further by how varying HDR support is across today\u2019s smart TVs. While any 4K TV (and even some HD TVs) will support the basic HDR10 format, the more premium Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats are found a lot less consistently. These premium formats add metadata that helps to calibrate your TV\u2019s picture scene by scene, though only for compatible titles that have been released in those formats.",
    "New Samsung TVs only pack in support for HDR10+, while LG favors Dolby Vision, even as Philips, Panasonic, and Vizio screens are largely compatible with both.",
    "The issue here is that you could buy an excellent gaming TV for your PS5, but if it doesn\u2019t feature Dolby Vision, you wouldn\u2019t be futureproofing yourself for maximum-performance gaming with an Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S.",
    "That\u2019s not all, though. The Xbox Series consoles also support Dolby Atmos, which is a 3D surround sound format \u2013 best experienced with a multi-speaker setup for immersive gaming audio, but also with a great sense of depth over soundbars and over-ear headphones.",
    "Sony has opted not to include Dolby Atmos, instead preferring to push its own Tempest 3D AudioTech solution.",
    "You\u2019ll find it supported on a number of PS5 games, such as Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered, Astro\u2019s Playroom, Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Demon\u2019s Souls, and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart \u2013 with support incoming for a number of new titles too. But it doesn\u2019t have quite the same impact as Atmos in our tests \u2013 with our time with the official PS5 Pulse 3D Wireless Headset leaving us slightly disappointed.",
    "\u201cUnfortunately, none of the games we tried with the headphones so far sounded as immersive as, say, a Dolby Atmos film due to the limited nature of the 3D sound, but getting a taste of the 3D AudioTech was preferable to not hearing it at all,\u201d we wrote.",
    "While Atmos is also supported on a large number of high-end TVs, soundbars, and Dolby Atmos speakers, Sony\u2019s 3D Audio isn\u2019t. TechRadar\u2019s senior gaming writer, Adam Vjestica, tells us that \u201cyou can use any wired or USB wireless gaming headset to experience the effects of 3D Audio\u201d \u2013 if the headset is good enough to hear the difference, that is \u2013 but it won\u2019t impact the sound coming out of your television just yet.",
    "We previously spoke with Sony\u2019s gaming division about how PS5 3D audio tech would continue to grow as Sony continues to gather feedback from developers and designers. Kenichi Imai, Deputy Head of the Software Engineering Group at SIE, told us that \u201cAs Mark Cerny previously mentioned, the audio experience is something that will continue to evolve. Going forward, we will continue to strive to provide the most immersive experiences possible on PS5 and explore ways to improve the 3D audio experience even further.\u201d",
    "Imai added that, \u201cWe\u2019re always exploring ways to deliver a more immersive experience to our players, but we have nothing to share at this time\u201d \u2013 suggesting that the format could come to more audio hardware in the future. It would certainly be something of a scoop if it landed solely on Sony TVs, but it might lock out a lot of angry gamers if it didn\u2019t become more widespread or manufacturer-agnostic.",
    "The key differences here are in a number of select 3D audio and dynamic HDR formats, which won\u2019t affect the majority of games, players or TVs for the time being.",
    "For those eager to make the most out of their gaming hardware, though, these specs are only going to become more important, especially as more games are able to properly utilise enhanced picture and sound.",
    "The easiest answer here is to opt for a TV that matches all of these Xbox requirements, in case you have (or may one day want) an Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S in your home. And the specific audio standard used with the PS5 is yet to make any specific demands on your TV choice, meaning that shouldn\u2019t influence your buying decision for the time being.",
    "If you\u2019re happy with a PS5, though, or aren\u2019t fussed about the promise of Dolby Vision gaming in the years to come, then you needn\u2019t worry quite as much. By the time Dolby Vision games are truly widespread, of course, it may even be time to upgrade your gaming TV again.",
    "You might also want to check out the capabilities of HDMI on PS5."
