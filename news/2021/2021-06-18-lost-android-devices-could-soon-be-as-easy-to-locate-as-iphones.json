    "If you\u2019ve ever lost your Android phone you\u2019ve probably turned to Google\u2019s Find My Device service, and this can be a slick way to locate your handset \u2013 as long as it\u2019s signed into your Google account and has an internet connection. But soon, you might be able to use a crowdsourced network of Android devices to locate your missing gadgets without that.",
    "That\u2019s because XDA Developers has found reference to a 'Find My Device network' in code for the latest Google Play Services beta. There was also a string that reads 'Allows your phone to help locate your and other people\u2019s devices.'",
    "It sounds then like Google is building a Find My Device network that would allow other Android devices out in the world to locate your device if it\u2019s nearby \u2013 probably over Bluetooth \u2013 and send the location to you.",
    "From the wording it sounds like you\u2019d need to opt in, but that it would be an all or nothing situation, in that you wouldn\u2019t be able to leverage this device network to track your device if you didn\u2019t also agree to allowing your phone to help locate other lost devices, and vice versa.",
    "In any case, this crowdsourced network sounds a lot like what Apple is doing with its Find My iPhone service, and with AirTags, which rely almost entirely on being nearby to an iDevice. It would also allow Google to launch a rival device to the AirTag if it chose to, so you'd be able to locate anything the tracker was attached to.",
    "But there are even more Android devices out in the world than there are iPhones, so Google has the potential to build the most powerful and robust device finding network yet. Of course, whether it will remains to be seen, as while the presence of this code likely means Google is exploring the idea, it doesn\u2019t guarantee the Find My Device network will ever see the light of day.",
    "If it does though, perhaps we\u2019ll get some official news about it in upcoming Android 12 betas, or in the final Android 12 release, which is expected in or around September.",
