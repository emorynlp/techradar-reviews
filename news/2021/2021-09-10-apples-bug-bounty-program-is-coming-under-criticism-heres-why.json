    "Cybersecurity researchers aren\u2019t pleased with Apple's bug bounty program, which already has a massive backlog of unfixed bugs, according to reports.",
    "Apple launched its bug bounty program in 2016, but only opened it to the public in 2019. The program has several reward tiers, going all the way to $1 million for the most serious of vulnerabilities.",
    "Based on comments from domain experts and anonymous security researchers, the Washington Post now reports that the company doesn\u2019t enjoy a good reputation in the security industry.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a bug bounty program where the house always wins,\u201d Katie Moussouris, CEO and founder of Luta Security, told the Washington Post.",
    "As an example of Apple\u2019s apparent disdain for security researchers, the Washington Post cites the instance of Cedric Owens who submitted a bug that could\u2019ve been exploited to allow hackers to install malicious software on Mac computers, bypassing Apple\u2019s security measures.",
    "While security experts said the bug put Mac users \u201cat grave risk,\u201d Apple paid Owens a measly $5000 for his troubles. This is surprisingly shocking considering that there\u2019s an active dark web market that\u2019s willing to pay big bucks for such vulnerabilities.",
    "Moussouris believes Apple\u2019s attitude towards the bug bounty program will lead to \u201cless secure products for their customers and more cost down the line.\u201d",
    "That isn\u2019t too hard to fathom given the recent Pegasus spyware scandal, which was followed by news of another zero-click attack on the latest iPhone devices.",
    "Apple however calls its program a \u201crunaway success\u201d in an official statement, saying that the company leads the industry in the average amount paid per bounty.",
    "In terms of total bounties awarded though, the report states that while Apple spent $3.7 million in 2020, Google paid $6.7 million in the same year, while Microsoft dished out bounties worth $13.6 million in the 12-month period beginning July 2020.",
    "Ivan Krstic, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture called the company\u2019s bug bounty program a work in process, listing the various ways the company is working to expand the program, while reducing response times and improving communication.",
    "Update: An Apple spokesperson defended its bug bounty program and shared the following statement with TechRadar Pro:",
    "\u201cCompared to the rest of the industry, the Apple Security Bounty program is growing faster, pays more per-reward and more per-researcher than other programs. Before our program began, it took even top industry programs more than 3 years after launch to reach $2M in annual payments. The Apple Security Bounty paid researchers nearly double that amount, $3.7M, in its first year as a public program.\u201d",
