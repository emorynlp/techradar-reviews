    "We're just a few weeks away from Amazon Prime Day 2021 now, which means the retailer is rolling out a whole host of warm up offers, including the return of this excellent 'spend 10, save 10' promotion. From now until June 20, shoppers in both the US and UK can bank $10 / \u00a310 of Amazon credit for use over the Prime Day deals period just by spending $10 / \u00a310 on products from small businesses.",
    "This campaign has been a hugely popular offer over the last few years, and now that more than 300,000 sellers are included there's more choice than ever. You'll find everything from handmade accessories to pet supplies, electronics, groceries, and more here, so there's truly something for everyone.",
    "You will need to be a Prime member to take advantage of this offer, and you'll only receive one allocation of $10 / \u00a310 credit overall, so no stacking on this one.",
    "We'll be rounding up plenty of Amazon Prime Day TV deals and Amazon Prime Day laptop deals over the next few weeks, so stay tuned for more discounts."
