    "Undeterred by upset filmmakers and looming legal action from an unhappy production company, Warner Bros. is pushing forward with its 'Same Day Premieres' strategy, in which its upcoming tentpole films will come to HBO Max the same day as they hit theaters.",
    "In an effort to show its commitment to the controversial strategy, HBO Max has dropped a new Same Day Premieres trailer, which offers our first look at several films from its upcoming lineup.",

    "Footage from Denis Villeneuve's Dune is also presented front and center in the trailer, despite the director's very public criticism of the studio's release strategy \u2013 in a essay for Variety, Villeneuve declared that Warner Bros.' parent company AT&T had \"hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history.\"",
    "Legendary Pictures, the production company behind Dune and Godzilla vs. Kong, is considering legal action against Warner Bros., alleging that it was not consulted at all by the studio before its contentious Same Day Premieres strategy was announced."
