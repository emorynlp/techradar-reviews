    "Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare have received an upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X owners to enjoy in the form of a new high resolution texture pack.",
    "The optional add on, which weighs in at 8.4GB on PS5 (thanks, VGC), lets players enjoy \u201cthe most detailed textures for weapons and Operators in Modern Warfare and Warzone\u201d, according to the game\u2019s store page.",
    "The listing notes that the high resolution texture pack is only recommended to those who have \u201chigh-resolution displays\u201d, so there\u2019s not much point installing the pack if you don\u2019t own a 4K TV.",
    "If you\u2019ve longed for sharper textures when playing Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare on PS5 or Xbox Series X, the texture pack should help improve the look of the game, particularly when your character is pressed face first against a wall as you hide from a pursuer.",
    "Call of Duty: Warzone continues to receive regular updates and has recently added a new zombie mode that brings the stumbling undead into the battle royale game. The texture pack should make the new Call of Duty: Warzone Season 2 content look nicer on the eye, then, provided you\u2019ve got a capable display.",
    "Thankfully, the high resolution texture is an optional download, so you don\u2019t have to install it if you don\u2019t want to. And thanks to Call of Duty games\u2019 massive file sizes, you might not be able to. Activision recently warned players on 500GB PS4 consoles that they might have to \u201cmake room\u201d if they wanted to install the latest updates for Call of Duty: Warzone, Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War."
