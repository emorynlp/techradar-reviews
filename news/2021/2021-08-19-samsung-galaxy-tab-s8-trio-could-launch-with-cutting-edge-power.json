    "Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab S7 in August 2020, so we should be due a new model imminently, yet sources suggest the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 range might actually not land until early 2022. That\u2019s a shame, but it seems that Samsung might be making the most of the extra time.",
    "According to @UniverseIce (a leaker with a good track record), the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8, Galaxy Tab S8 Plus, and Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra will all have a Snapdragon 898 chipset.",
    "That\u2019s a chipset that hasn\u2019t even been announced yet, let alone made available on phones, but it\u2019s expected to be the successor to the Snapdragon 888 and is likely to power many of next year\u2019s top Android flagship phones. So if the Galaxy Tab S8 launched now it wouldn\u2019t be able to have such a powerful chipset at its heart.",
    "The source emphasizes that none of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 models will use the Exynos 2200, which is expected to be the next top-end chipset built by Samsung itself. This isn\u2019t surprising though, since Samsung\u2019s flagship slates tend to stick with Snapdragon.",
    "As well as this chipset information, @UniverseIce also claims that the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 range will all support 45W charging. That\u2019s a lot faster than Samsung\u2019s phones, which for the most part top out at 25W, but it\u2019s no better than what was offered on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7.",
    "With all three rumored Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 models supposedly using a top-end chipset faster than any currently found in an Android phone or tablet, they could be well positioned to compete with the mighty M1 chipset in the iPad Pro 2021 models.",
    "If they have 45W charging too then they\u2019ll also charge much faster, with Apple\u2019s slates topping out at 18W.",
    "Based on previously rumored specs, the Galaxy Tab S8 range could also rival the iPad Pro range for size, with the Tab S8 Ultra actually thought to be even bigger at 14.6 inches.",
    "High resolution screens and 120Hz refresh rates are likely too, as is AMOLED (at least on the pricier two models). None of the iPad Pro range use AMOLED, though the iPad Pro 12.9 (2021) would likely be able to hold its own with its Mini LED display.",
    "Still, these rumored specs suggest the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 range will be able to rival or beat Apple\u2019s best tablets in most hardware areas \u2013 though they might still struggle to compete when it comes to software.",
