    "Big No Time To Die spoilers follow. Watch the film before reading this.",
    "They actually went and did it\u2026",
    "For a franchise that\u2019s spent most of its six decades adhering to a strict formula, No Time to Die\u2019s final act was as bold as they come. Not only was perennial singleton James Bond on the verge of becoming a family man, he was unexpectedly (and definitively) killed off at the sharp end of a barrage of missiles.",
    "This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to be. One of Hollywood\u2019s biggest certainties \u2013 that 007 can, and will, walk out of any situation intact \u2013 was instantly turned on its head. This was unfamiliar, through-the-looking glass territory \u2013 and all the more exhilarating for it.",
    "But perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Ever since Daniel Craig first ran through walls in Casino Royale, his tenure at MI6 has been characterized by a desire to work outside conventional mission parameters. Craig\u2019s five movies haven\u2019t always hit the target \u2013 No Time to Die itself has several issues of its own \u2013 but a series of adventurous, very un-Bond storytelling choices marks them out as a golden period in 007\u2019s lengthy service history.",
    "It\u2019s a stark contrast with Disney\u2019s Star Wars sequels, whose own inability to \u201clet the past die\u201d was ultimately their undoing.",
    "Even before Sean Connery hung up his Walther PPK for the (official) last time in 1971, the Bond movies were the opposite of Forrest Gump\u2019s famous box of chocolates \u2013 you always knew what you were going get. Sure, there were subtle changes to the packaging, with new locations and stunts, and Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan taking different positions on a scale between brooding action hero and eyebrow-raising archness.",
    "Nonetheless, if you watched a Bond movie between 1973 and 2002, you nearly always knew you were getting.",
    "Monologue-ing megalomaniac unleashing a plan to kill millions and/or extort cash? Q showing off his latest selection of gadgets? 007 having brief relationships with a couple of women, one of whom will be dead by the end credits? A bombastic finale, that may or may not take place in a spectacular lair? It was a rare Bond outing that didn\u2019t tick off most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of these touchstones. For many, the formulaic nature of the 007 brand was part of its charm.",
    "Casino Royale, however, showed that things didn\u2019t have to be that way. A response to both the affectionate spy spoofery of the Austin Powers series \u2013 how do you create an old-school Bond villain in a world where Dr Evil exists? \u2013 and the grittier action of Jason Bourne, it essentially functioned as a reboot, rebuilding the character from the ground up.",
    "With no Q, no Moneypenny and a rookie Bond, this was the beginning of a story arc that would continue over five blockbuster instalments. Instead of being trapped in a time warp as the world changed around him, this Bond would evolve. In fact, the later Craig movies even acknowledged the fact he was getting older \u2013 something the series had even failed to do when a 56-year-old Roger Moore creaked his way through A View to a Kill.",
    "This 007 would have long-term relationships and emotional attachments. And when franchise regulars Q, Moneypenny and Blofeld were eventually reintroduced, they\u2019d been given 21st century makeovers. Ironically, Brosnan\u2019s final outing in Die Another Day \u2013 one of the undoubted nadirs of the franchise \u2013 may have been the best thing that ever happened to it, the catalyst that forced rights holders Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson to look at their tuxedoed cash cow in a whole new light.",
    "Like Casino Royale, Disney\u2019s Star Wars sequel trilogy was, in part, a response to movies that had disappointed large sections of the audience \u2013 in this case George Lucas\u2019s not-as-bad-as-people-make-out prequels. Lucasfilm\u2019s instinct was not to reinvent their long-running franchise, however, but to play safe by riffing on past glories.",
    "The Force Awakens is undeniably a fun movie, that effortlessly captures the spirit of that galaxy far, far away \u2013 who couldn\u2019t relate to Han Solo\u2019s poignant \u201cChewie, we\u2019re home\u201d aside? But when even Bond \u2013 rarely afraid of an in-joke or bringing an old Aston Martin out of storage \u2013 has realized that you can\u2019t sustain a franchise on fan service alone, sooner or later you have to stop being a tribute act. That means taking viewers somewhere they haven\u2019t been before, even if that place is slightly strange and disconcerting.",
    "The Last Jedi did, at least, give it a good go. Rian Johnson\u2019s Episode VIII may have proved divisive among the fanbase but in many ways it was what the franchise needed after the nostalgia-fest of its predecessor.",
    "From casually killing off Emperor substitute Supreme Leader Snoke (turning the wonderfully petulant Kylo Ren into the Big Bad in the process), to establishing that Rey\u2019s family tree was actually nothing special, writer/director Rian Johnson did everything he could to wrongfoot his audience. Not everything worked \u2013 Leia\u2019s impersonation of a space angel still feels clunky \u2013 but at least the movie wasn\u2019t falling back on tropes established a long time ago.",
    "Unfortunately, saga-closer The Rise of Skywalker undid any good work that had come before it \u2013 indeed, it gets worse every time you watch it. Johnson had set up JJ Abrams\u2019 trilogy closer with an intriguing cliffhanger, with the Resistance cut back to its barest bones, its calls for help unanswered as it waged war against a First Order led by a guy with the emotional intelligence of a teenager. This was the perfect opportunity to give Star Wars its own \u201cBond has a kid!\u201d twist, but the movie lacked the courage to do anything quite so radical.",
    "Suddenly, a cackling Emperor Palpatine \u2013 killed off three decades previously in Return of the Jedi \u2013 was back to pull the strings, as Rey learned she was actually his granddaughter. So much for undoing the idea that the fate of that galaxy far, far away rested on a couple of famous bloodlines\u2026",
    "As well as shamelessly retconning what we thought we\u2019d learned in The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker cheapened everything that had come before with the \u2018fake-out\u2019 non-demises of Chewbacca and C-3PO \u2013 emotionally manipulative shocks with zero consequences. Maybe, Abrams felt that \u2013 with the original triumvirate of Han, Luke and Leia gone \u2013 audiences would revolt at the loss of another classic hero. But if your characters are never in any peril, you\u2019re always going to revert to the status quo, and sooner or later your franchise will hit a dead end.",
    "If Bond \u2013 the most immortal mortal man who ever lived \u2013 can die, there are clearly few limits on where a franchise can go. Being bold isn\u2019t a guarantee of success, of course, but it\u2019s hard to imagine how the riskier approach of No Time to Die could have made The Rise of Skywalker any worse. Besides, what\u2019s the worst that could happen? Whatever 007\u2019s identity next time he (or she) stares down that famous gun barrel, one thing is certain: James Bond will return.",
    "No Time To Die is screening in theaters around the world. All of the Star Wars movies are available to view on Disney Plus."
