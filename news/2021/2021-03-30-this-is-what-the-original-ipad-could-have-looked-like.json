    "The original Apple iPad was undoubtedly a major step forward for the tablet market of the time \u2013 but the first generation model nearly had one very different feature.",
    "According to prototype images obtained by tech collector Giulio Zompetti, the original iPad, at some stage, included two 30-pin connector ports; one at the bottom, and an extra one added to the left side of the device.",
    "The final product ended up scrapping the additional port, but these images nonetheless suggest Apple had planned to introduce a so-called dual dock system with its inaugural iPad model.",
    "Of course, iPads haven\u2019t used 30-pin connector ports since the introduction of Apple\u2019s Lightning technology in 2012, but it\u2019s interesting to learn that the original device might have supported concurrent charging.",
    "An extra port also means iPad accessories \u2013 like cases and keyboards \u2013 may have ended up looking different to those in today\u2019s market, given the extra functionality enabled by an additional charging dock.",
    "The decision to remove the second connector was reportedly made by Steve Jobs close to the iPad\u2019s launch in 2010.",
    "As it happens, this revelation arrives just as rumors are beginning to swirl regarding Apple\u2019s pursuit of the next generation of charging technology.",
    "We recently reported that the Cupertino giant is developing a connectivity port based on its existing MagSafe charger, after a filing submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office revealed a three-pinned \u200cMagSafe\u200c charger, similar to those used to charge older MacBooks, connecting to what appears to be an iPhone.",
    "The patent outlines several pin designs \u2013 one rounded, one with a flat surface \u2013 which indicate that Apple is looking towards a future without Lightning cables.",
    "Apple might be turning its attention to magnet-based charging ports for several reasons. As well as the improved charging speeds of MagSafe technology, a MagSafe connectivity port would also allow for easy detachment should the charger be pulled or tripped over.",
    "What\u2019s more, the introduction of a MagSafe port would mark a further step towards a port-free future for Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads, which has long been known as an ambition for the company.",
    "So, future iPads might have no ports at all \u2013 that\u2019s a world away from an original iPad with two giant ones\u2026",
