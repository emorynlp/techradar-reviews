    "Update: Rode has released an updated, premium prfoessional studio arm \u2013 the PSA1+ \u2013 which retails for $129 / \u00a3114 / AU$199. It's compatible with any microphone weighing between 94g and 1.2kg, including the NT-USB Mini and offers clever shock-absorbing tricks to reduce any unwanted desk vibrations and sounds.",
    "While the Blue Yeti USB microphone and its more compact Nano successor have been the go-to for many podcasters, Rode is hoping its latest NT-USB Mini will steal their thunder.",
    "Priced at $99 (\u00a399, AU$149), the NT-USB Mini costs the same as the Yeti Nano and offers much the same proposition \u2013 take a successful USB microphone and shrink it down, condensing controls and maintaining audio quality in the process.",
    "The interface on this little Rode mic is incredibly minimal, with a single dial that adjusts headphone level found on the front, and a USB-C and 3.5mm headphone port found on the rear.",
    "The desktop stand is weighted and is designed to absorb any shocks from a bumped desk. It\u2019s attached magnetically to a 360-degree swivelling mount for the microphone, so you can quickly detach it and mount it on a mic stand or studio arm.",
    "Outside of the company\u2019s reputation for professional, studio-grade audio quality, one of Rode\u2019s standout features is the simplicity in which its microphones interface with other gear. The NT-USB Mini is class-compliant, meaning it will work immediately with any computer or tablet when hooked up via USB, with no drivers, firmware or apps required.",
    "The NT-USB Mini features an integrated pop filter and is constructed from \u201chard-wearing steel and reinforced nylon resin\u201d, so it should be compact and rugged enough for grab-and-go situations.",
    "The Rode NT-USB Mini is available now in the US for $99 with other region\u2019s availability and pricing to follow."
