    "On the hunt for an e-reader and want to save money? Now that the new Kindle Paperwhite 2021 is out, the previous Kindle Paperwhite 2018 is on sale for $40 off its list price at Amazon's Black Friday deals event. (Not in the US? Scroll below for deals in your region.)",
    "The Kindle Paperwhite is Amazon's mid-tier ereader, with more functionality and features than the base-level Kindle, but not quite all the bells and whistles of the more expensive Kindle Oasis.",
    "While you'll be missing out on some features from the newest model, the Kindle Paperwhite 2018 is still a great ereader with a slim design, 8GB or 32GB of storage space, and up to 6 weeks of battery life. With this discount, you'll be able to buy a lot of books and other media with the money saved.",
    "And for comparison, here are the higher and lower Kindle models, none of which are on sale yet \u2013 and the basic Kindle is even priced just a bit higher than the Paperwhite above. The Kindle Oasis is far pricier than either of the others.",
    "If you want to look at other Kindle Paperwhite deals or if you're not in the US, check below for the best prices on Amazon's ereader \u2013 both the 2018 model and the new 2021 model:"
