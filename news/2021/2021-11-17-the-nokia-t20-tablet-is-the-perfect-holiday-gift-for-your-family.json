    "Zoom conferences. E-learning. Streaming. Gaming. Online work.",
    "If nothing else, COVID-19 has underscored the crucial role that technology plays in our lives. It's a cornerstone of how we work and connect with colleagues, a foundation for entertainment, and a lifeline to our loved ones.",
    "The recently-released Nokia T20 tablet was designed with all that in mind. As the first in the brand new T-series, it offers precisely the level of quality and innovation you'd expect of a flagship Nokia device.",
    "Built to the same high standards as all Nokia products, the Nokia T20 combines a crystal-clear 2K screen with a powerful battery, a versatile feature set, industry-leading security, and two years of free OS upgrades.",
    "More importantly, the Nokia T20 is the perfect holiday gift for your family, because it really does have something for everyone.",
    "You can't always stay in your home office when it's time for your weekly Zoom touch-base, and you won't always be in quiet surroundings when meeting with a new client over Microsoft Teams. What you need is a device that can move with you \u2014 one that gives you the flexibility to change locations without sacrificing call quality, and can act as a second screen for your laptop to boot.",
    "The Nokia T20 is that device. Its dual microphones are ideal for noisy surroundings, ensuring you'll come through loud and clear even with family in the background \u2014 and its OZO Playback speakers ensure you won't miss anything, either.",
    "With monthly security updates, any work and personal data stored on the device will be kept safe. ExpressVPN is also available with a 30-day free trial as well, adding another layer of protection.",
    "Whether you're cramming for an upcoming midterm or sitting in on a science class, the Nokia T20's blue light certified screen is easy on the eyes, even during late-night study sessions.",
    "More importantly, it has a battery you can trust to last through everything from virtual quizzes to online lectures and group study sessions. Its simplified design, meanwhile, is based on the same Scandinavian philosophy behind Nokia's phones, with an equal blend of ergonomics and aesthetics.",
    "And if you need a soundtrack while studying, the Nokia T20's speakers feature OZO Playback for a truly immersive listening experience \u2014 and a Spotify partnership gives you access to 70 million tracks and 2.9 million podcasts right out of the box.",
    "That also means it's the perfect way to unwind when you're done, whether that's through Netflix or playing games. Either way, an Octa-core chipset enables effortless multitasking.",
    "Sometimes, you need a bit of peace and quiet. The easiest way to get that is to keep your kid entertained. There's just one problem \u2014 children don't exactly mesh well with fragile technology.",
    "It's a good thing, then, that the Nokia T20 is built out of premium sandblasted aluminium, with a toughened, scratch-resistant screen. It's durable enough to handle whatever your kids might throw at it. And on the rare occasion it suffers damage, you can count on an extended warranty, complete with screen insurance.",
    "As a parent, you're doubtless aware that there's no shortage of predatory mobile developers, and content you don't want your kids to see. That's where Google Kids Space comes in. A trusted kids-only mode, it's designed specifically to help nurture the inquisitive young minds of children, complete with recommended apps, books, and videos.",
    "Kids Space works in tandem with Family Link Parental controls, too, so no more worrying about your child stumbling onto something they shouldn't.",
    "If you have kids, they\u2019ve probably come close to breaking a phone or tablet before. Who can really blame them, though? Many modern devices are simply too flimsy.",
    "The Nokia T20 is an exception to that rule. It's made to be just as durable as the old-school bricks. Better yet, it's got a battery that lasts, so you don't need to worry about it dying on you when the kids are playing games or watching their favorite show.",
    "Work. Play. Study. Entertainment. Your family is diverse, and so are their needs.",
    "And the Nokia T20 is purpose-built to meet each and every one. So whether you're looking for the perfect gadget to place under the tree or you simply want to treat yourself to something nice for the holidays, it's an excellent choice.",
    "The Nokia T20 is available now in the United States. The 4 GB/64 GB Wi-Fi configuration comes in Ocean Blue and starts at $250 USD. Learn more here."
