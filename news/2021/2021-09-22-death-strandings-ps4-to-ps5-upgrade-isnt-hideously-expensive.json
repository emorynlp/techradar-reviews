    "If you own Death Stranding on PS4 and fancy upgrading to Death Stranding: Director\u2019s Cut on PS5, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that it\u2019ll only cost you $5 / \u00a35 / AU$10 to do so.",
    "Sony has typically charged $10 / \u00a310 / AU$20 for PS4 to PS5 upgrades, with some games, such as Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut priced slightly higher, as it included a large chunk of additional content in the form of the Iki Island DLC.",
    "That\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t get a significant amount of new things to do in Death Stranding: Director\u2019s Cut. Hideo Kojima\u2019s enigma of a game that sees you making deliveries as The Walking Dead\u2019s Norman Reedus includes enhanced visuals, a firing range, new story missions, combat mechanics, traversal options, and, bizarrely, a racing mode.",
    "The game also features a \u2018wide mode\u2019, which adds horizontal black bars to the top and bottom of the screen and changes the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 21:9. The wide mode in Death Stranding: Director\u2019s Cut will let players see more enemies, items, and the foreground.",
    "As you\u2019d expect, the PS5 version of Death Stranding will also take advantage of the DualSense controller\u2019s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, as well as the PS5\u2019s 3D audio, which can now be played through your TV speakers.",
    "The fact you can cheaply upgrade the PS4 version of Death Stranding means it's a good idea to pick up a disc version, which is cheaper than the game on the PlayStation Store. Of course, if you have a PS5 Digital Edition, you're out of luck.",
    "It\u2019s honestly refreshing to see a smaller fee for a PS4 to PS5 upgrade, although Sony\u2019s approach is still at odds with Microsoft\u2019s Smart Delivery system, which gives Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S players the best version of the game for free.",
    "That\u2019s not to say Sony hasn\u2019t shown some generosity in the past: the PS4 versions of Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us 2, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ratchet and Clank, and Days Gone all received free updates that enabled 60fps support, though no other visual updates were included.",
    "Sony has said that from 2022, it\u2019ll cost PS4 owners $10 / \u00a310 to upgrade a PlayStation 4 version of the game to PS5. The company recently fell foul of fans after it revealed that Horizon Forbidden West would charge players the same fee to upgrade the PS4 version to PS5 after it was previously claimed that the upgrade would be provided for free. Sony later reverted on this decision due to the backlash.",
    "Death Stranding: Director\u2019s Cut releases on September 24, 2021, for PS5. A sequel is apparently in the works as actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, told Adoro Cinema \"I think we're doing a second Death Stranding. The game is in negotiations right now. So... yay!\""
