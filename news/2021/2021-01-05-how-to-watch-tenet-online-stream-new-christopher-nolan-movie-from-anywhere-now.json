    "Of the many 2020 blockbusters hit hard by the coronavirus, few perhaps suffered more so than Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece, Tenet. Despite being released to widespread critical acclaim, it grossed 'just' $29.5 million at the US box offices as audiences opted to stay home in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. Now though, anyone can feast their eyes on the dazzling sci-fi flick. Here's how to watch Tenet online and stream the new Christopher Nolan movie wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "Tenet was nearly two decades in the making, with five years spent on the scriptwriting alone. It stars John David Washington as 'The Protagonist', a CIA agent who finds himself recruited by a secret organization known only as Tenet to stop World War III.",
    "Tenet possess, among other things, the ability to invert the entropy of objects and people - in layman's terms, to go back in time.",
    "Thematically, the distortion of time-flow most obviously reminds of another Nolan masterclass, Inception - and Tenet's stunning ensemble cast also brings to mind the same work.",
    "Alongside John David Washington, Tenet also stars talent young and old in Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, Michael Caine, and Kenneth Branagh.",
    "As with most Nolan movies, Tenet has to be seen to be believed, so stop what you're doing now and read on as we explain how to watch Tenet online today.",
    "Unfortunately, if you\u2019re travelling outside of countries like America or the UK for work or taking a well-deserved vacation, geo-blocking restrictions will prevent you from connecting to your preferred VOD platform and streaming new film Tenet online.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s a simple solution. Downloading a Virtual Private Network (VPN) will allow you to change your IP address, meaning you can access content that would normally be specifically restricted to your region from wherever you are in the world.",
