    "The 2022 season of Overwatch League will kick off using an early build of Overwatch 2, Blizzard has confirmed.",
    "Vice president of the Overwatch League at Blizzard, Jon Spector, tweeted about the company\u2019s plans for the league\u2019s next season, confirming that it is currently slated to begin sometime in April 2022.",
    "In a second tweet, Spector quoted DotEsports reporter Liz Richardson, who had received confirmation that the 2022 season will \u201cbegin on an early build of Overwatch 2\u201d from an Overwatch spokesperson. Spector didn\u2019t elaborate on this but did say that Blizzard will \u201cshare more details about 2022 roster construction timelines soon and more info generally on our 2022 season as we get closer to April.\u201d",
    "Competitive players will undoubtedly be keen to get their hands on Overwatch 2 in order to experience the changes made to the original game for themselves. Overwatch 2 PvP matches will, for example, be 5v5, with each team containing two damage dealers and two support characters but only one tank.",
    "This is pretty big news for Overwatch 2 which, at time of writing, doesn\u2019t actually have a solid release date and hasn\u2019t been seen a whole lot lately. There are plenty of reports on a possible release date, though. Very recently, an Overwatch insider, Metro, tweeted that they had heard development of Overwatch 2 \u201cis taking longer than expected\u201d and that a 2022 release \u201cdoes not seem likely anymore\u201d.",
    "However, even more recently than that, a report from Dexerto dismissed this and claimed that they have heard from sources that releasing Overwatch 2 soon is a high priority and that the team is \u201clooking to get it out before the Summer of 2022.\u201c",
    "The news that an early build of the game will be used in the 2022 Overwatch League suggests that Blizzard does still have a 2022 release in its sights. Given competitors will be playing on an \u201cearly build\u201d, a public release alongside the Overwatch League is unlikely but maybe it\u2019s possible Overwatch fans won\u2019t have to wait too much longer after that.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting, of course, that no official release date has been confirmed by Activision Blizzard itself and so we can\u2019t know for sure until that happens. In an August earnings call (via IGN), the company only stated that the game\u2019s development \u201cpassed an important internal milestone in recent weeks\u201d and that the team would be \u201crevealing more of the game in the coming months as they approach the later stages of production.\u201d"
