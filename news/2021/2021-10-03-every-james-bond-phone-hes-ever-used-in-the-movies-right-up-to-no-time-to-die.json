    "INT. FENCE AROUND SECRET BASE - NIGHT",
    "James Bond is a silhouette against a dark forest, as he tip-toes along the side of a chain-link fence - through the gaps in the fence, we see the spires of a gray factory jutting into the star-speckled night sky.",
    "Bond digs into his pocket and pulls out a smartphone. It's a Sony Xperia 1 IV, because Bond gets first dibs on new phones. He holds it landscape, pointing it towards the buildings.",
    "PHONE SCREEN: We see the camera app. Bond\u2019s fingers pinch and drag to zoom in. They do so again, and we see the factory taking up the majority of the display. Bond\u2019s finger taps at the shutter button, and the screen flashes to signify the picture has been taken.",
    "We see Bond\u2019s face as he squints at the display, as the light from the device flickers on his face.",
    "PHONE SCREEN: We\u2019re looking at the Gallery app. Bond selects his recent photo, and it appears large on the screen. The finger taps the send button, and on the list of options that appears, we see a WhatsApp icon with Q\u2019s face. Bond selects this, and adds the message \"wish u was ere\", then puts the phone away.",
    "Okay, okay - we\u2019ve never seen a smartphone used like that in a James Bond film. In fact, in your average day-to-day life, you probably use smarter processing, connectivity and photography tech than 007 ever has in a film or book. But the Bond films have a history of mobile phones at this point, slotting into his selection of gadgets as the series entered the modern age.",
    "Since the Brosnan days, Bond films have become glorified product placement reels, with stories seemingly written to give 007 moments to look cool with whatever products Eon has been paid to show off. Alongside mediocre lagers and expensive watches, mobile phones are among the products that we often see in the hands of 007 and his comrades.",
    "As the distributor of most of the Daniel Craig Bond films, Sony has lots of devices in these films - though it\u2019s not the only company to have its devices grace Bond\u2019s palm. In No Time To Die, it\u2019s HMD Global (makers of Nokia phones) which steps up to the podium - more like Nokia Time To Die.",
    "James Bond is a bit of a technophobe, if you can call a gadget-toting superspy that - he barely uses his smartphones for anything beyond calling and texting, with few secret functions hidden in these devices. We've never even seen him play Snake, Angry Birds or Call of Duty: Mobile. He'd probably kill at the latter.",
    "To celebrate the newest flick, we\u2019ve looked through all the films in which 007 or his companions have used a mobile phone, so you can see how the character progressed from the brick phones of old, to\u2026 well, less-old Sony phones.",
    "Bond\u2019s first recognizable mobile is one that doesn\u2019t actually exist. The Sony Ericsson JB988 was designed by Sony explicitly for Tomorrow Never Dies, and it\u2019s not even a spin-off of an existing device, as the J series was designed for kids and only went up to 300 anyway (yes, we do get the \u2018JB\u2019 suffix though).",
    "It\u2019s probably a good thing this phone never hit the market, as some of its stand-out features include a 20,000 volt taser and a remote control for Bond\u2019s BMW. Those features in the hands of the public would cause mayhem. Oh well: it really puts the features in \u2018feature phone\u2019.",
    "Though Bond took a digital detox in The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day, another character stepped up to make sure the product placement didn\u2019t stop. Sony\u2019s Ericsson T68i was used by Halle Berry\u2019s character Jinx - though it was literally just used as a bomb, which isn\u2019t the best advertisement in the world.",
    "The bigger phone in the picture, though, was the Ericsson P800 used by Rick Yune\u2019s character Zao (the guy with all the diamonds encrusted on his face). It plays an important role, as it\u2019s how the villain receives information about James Bond at the beginning, including a crisp low-res portrait of Pierce Brosnan which would have looked great in 2002 when the film came out.",
    "There are two keyboard-toting Ericsson feature phones in Casino Royale: the K800i used by Bond itself, and the M600i used by Eva Green\u2019s Vespa Lynd.",
    "The K800i doesn\u2019t do much in the film, though Sony pushed the tie-in for the phone\u2019s marketing, which also presented the devices as (at the time, at least) a competitive camera phone. The M600i is much more important, as Bond reads a text Lynd receives on it near the end of the film, for some major information.",
    "Neither of those uses exactly screams \u2018super-spy\u2019, but Daniel Craig\u2019s first film marked a point where product placements switched from \u2018an annoying part of the movie you can overlook\u2019 to \u2018basically the only reason they make these things\u2019.",
    "James Bond actually remembered to use his phone in Quantum of Solace, snapping pictures of stuff with that 5MP camera the C902 has, and taking some calls too. Nice work, Jimmy.",
    "The special edition version of the phone 007 uses actually has a James Bond game pre-installed. We can therefore only assume the spy stumbled upon it and discovered he was a fictional character, like some twisted version of Stranger Than Fiction but with an Ericsson phone instead of Emma Thompson.",
    "007 finally joined the smartphone world with Skyfall, as the spy was seen to be carrying and using the Android-toting Xperia T. In fact, it this was the center of a huge promotion for the Xperia T, with Sony calling it the \u2018Bond phone\u2019.",
    "In Skyfall, Bond doesn\u2019t really do much with the Xperia T - he receives a text with it at one point, showing off one of the Sony phone\u2019s flashiest features of\u2026 receiving texts. He didn\u2019t even try to take a picture with its 13MP camera or look at secret files on its (then-crisp) 720p display. Disappointing.",
    "Move over, texting in Skyfall, as Bond has an even cooler thing to do with the Sony Xperia Z5 in Spectre - or should we say, call-\u2019er! Bond is seen calling Moneypenny on the Z5 as he zooms around in a car chase, and the phone basically doesn\u2019t show up again. Not exactly the flashy spy xperia-nce we were expecting.",
    "In the film, we also get a rare glimpse at a non-Sony phone, as the Samsung GT-S5611 feature phone shows up, and actually has more plot relevance than the Sony. Bond sends it to Moneypenny so he can carry on communicating with her when he goes dark, and disguises it so no-one can tell. Now that\u2019s what we call spycraft. Understandably, the Samsung logo was hidden in the film though - Sony clearly couldn\u2019t let a single frame of a competitor\u2019s logo get into the movie.",
    "When No Time To Die was initially meant to be released, HMD Global\u2019s product placements meant a Nokia phone would be used by Bond - maybe he could do something super-futuristic like access the internet or put it on charge, judging by other Craig films.",
    "At the time, the Nokia 8.3 5G was announced as the tie-in, as that was the brand\u2019s newest device. With Bond 25 being delayed, though, that handset is no longer new. The Nokia XR20 rugged phone is the brand's newest 'big phone', but that's not debuting in No Time To Die - the older 8.3 remains, alongside a cutesy Nokia 3310 cameo (that's the famous brick phone everyone's owned at least once)."
