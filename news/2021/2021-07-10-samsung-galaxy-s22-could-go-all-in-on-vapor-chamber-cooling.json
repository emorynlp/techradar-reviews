  "article": [
    "The Samsung Galaxy S22 range could use vapor chambers to cool down the handsets\u2019 insides, using a technology that\u2019s most often found in high-end gaming phones.",
    "Not that Samsung\u2019s a stranger to using vapor chambers in its flagships, but it has been implemented them haphazardly, putting them in the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus but not its cheaper siblings (they got an 'advanced heat pipe' system) as well as in some (but not all) of the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra phones.",
    "Now a new DigiTimes report suggests that Samsung is considering bringing vapor chambers back for its 2022 flagships, and while that\u2019s still uncertain, it\u2019s apparently promising enough for Taiwanese suppliers to get ready in case the phonemaker orders them en masse.",
    "That presumably means the Samsung Galaxy S22 flagship range, but could also include other top-tier handsets \u2013 like if there is a Samsung Galaxy Note 22 or a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, for instance.",
    "Vapor chambers have certainly sounded like the best mobile cooling situations, especially as they\u2019re featured in top gaming phones \u2013 heck, the Asus ROG 3 even has a transparent plastic section on its rear cover to show off its vapor chamber.",
    "And while the vapor chambers do cool down phones, it\u2019s not clear if they\u2019re the only solution for top-tier flagship phones. In fact, the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra phones had multiple cooling systems that were quietly implemented \u2013 seemingly at random \u2013 across both phone models. Some would have copper vapor chambers, while others would have graphite thermal pads siphoning away heat.",
    "In an investigative teardown report, iFixit found that the systems did seem to be split between phone models seemingly without rhyme or reason. While boasting about vapor chambers seemed to have been a marketing boon that sold more units in prior S-series flagship phones, they\u2019re potentially prone to failure when damaged, an expert told the site. While graphite pads reportedly showed up in the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, perhaps bringing on vapor chambers in its 2022 smartphones means the phonemaker isn\u2019t settled on one cooling tech over the other.",
