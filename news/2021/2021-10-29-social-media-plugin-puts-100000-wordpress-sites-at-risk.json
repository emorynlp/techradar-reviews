    "In yet another vulnerability that could have serious repercussions, cybersecurity researchers have discovered a cross-site scripting(XSS) bug in the NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster plugin for WordPress.",
    "The plugin is used to automatically publish posts from websites to any of the configured social media accounts in a fully automated manner.",
    "Discovered by Wordfence\u2019s Ramuel Gall, the vulnerability in the popular WordPress plugin with over 100,000 installations, made it possible to perform a reflected cross-site scripting attack.",
    "\u201cAs with all XSS attacks, malicious JavaScript running in an administrator\u2019s session could be used to add malicious administrative users or insert backdoors into a site, and thus be used for site takeover,\u201d observes Gall.",
    "While explaining the bug, Gall notes that the XSS vulnerability reared its head because of a relatively obscure peculiarity of how PHP handles superglobal variables.",
    "\u201cThis meant that it was possible to execute JavaScript in the browser of a logged-in administrator by tricking them into visiting a self-submitting form that sent a POST request to their site,\u201d says Gall.",
    "The vulnerability was disclosed to the plugin\u2019s developer in August, and a patched update of the plugin was released in early October.",
    "Wordfence suggests all users of the plugin update to its latest version to prevent abuse of their WordPress websites.",
    "You can use these WordPress website builders to build your website in no time, but remember to secure them using these WordPress security plugins."
