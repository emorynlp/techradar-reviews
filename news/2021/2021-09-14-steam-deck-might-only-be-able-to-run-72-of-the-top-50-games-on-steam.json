    "Ever since Valve announced its Steam Deck handheld console, there\u2019s been questions over how much of Steam\u2019s huge library the device will be able to run \u2013 and it appears that, out of the box, it may struggle to run some of the most popular games.",
    "As Toms Hardware reports, a recent survey by the Boiling Steam website found that of the current top 50 games on Steam, only 72% can be played on Linux, either natively or using Proton, the compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run in Linux.",
    "While that\u2019s not an awful percentage, it does mean that some incredibly popular games such as PUGB: Battlegrounds, Destiny 2, Rust and Apex Legends can\u2019t run on Linux \u2013 and that\u2019s not great news for the Steam Deck.",
    "That\u2019s because the Steam Deck will run its own Linux distro, Steam OS 3.0, so it\u2019ll only be able to play games that can run on Linux. For Windows 10-only games, that means relying on Proton. While the Steam Deck has got a lot of people excited (us included), Valve needs it to be a success, as some of its previous hardware launches (such as Steam Machines), struggled to find a market.",
    "If it\u2019s not able to play some of the most popular games, that could put some potential customers off.",
    "In a perfect world, the Steam Deck would be able to play every game on Steam, but that\u2019s not going to be the case. As Valve\u2019s Pierre-Loup Griffais hinted at in a recent interview, the hardware of the Steam Deck is strong enough to potentially run any game on Steam.",
    "But, as James B. Ramey, who worked on developing Proton with Valve, clarifies, while the hardware could play any game, the software side of things is more tricky.",
    "This goes back to Valve\u2019s decision to use Linux as the operating system. While it makes a lot of sense \u2013 Valve gets greater control of the software, and won\u2019t need to pay Windows 10 licensing fees to Microsoft, which would up the cost of the console \u2013 it does mean that getting some games to run won\u2019t be straightforward.",
    "Proton is a great tool that is constantly improving, and that has helped many games that have been coded for Windows 10 to run on the Steam Deck. However, some games \u2013 particularly competitive multiplayer titles \u2013 use anti-cheat software meaning they can\u2019t currently be run in Linux, either via Proton or natively.",
    "So, if you were looking forward to playing Destiny 2, or any of the other games that can\u2019t currently run on Linux, on your Steam Deck when it launches later this year, should you be worried? We don\u2019t think so.",
    "As we mentioned earlier, Proton is constantly being worked on to expand the list of titles it supports, and that will continue up to \u2013 and beyond \u2013 the Steam Deck\u2019s release. That will hopefully mean that when you get your hands on one, most Steam games you want to play on it will be compatible.",
    "In a Steam Deck FAQ, Valve also states that it is working with the developers behind some of the biggest anti-cheat software to \u201cget support for Proton ahead of launch.\u201d If this works out, then that\u2019ll hopefully make almost all of the top 50 Steam games compatible with the Steam Deck.",
    "Finally, as Valve has been keen to point out (including in the aforementioned FAQ), the Steam Deck is essentially a PC, and that means you can replace Steam OS with an operating system of your choice \u2013 including Windows 10 (or Windows 11, for that matter). If your favorite game just won\u2019t run in Linux, then installing Windows will hopefully sort that out.",
    "It\u2019s this kind of flexibility that could put the Steam Deck ahead of traditional consoles such as the Nintendo Switch."
