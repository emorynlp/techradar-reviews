    "The vast majority of Apple Watch deals over Black Friday are on three different Apple smartwatches; if you've been perusing the discounts, you've probably caught yourself wondering 'which of them should I buy?'",
    "These three models are the Apple Watch 3 from 2017, which Apple now treats as its low-end offering, the Apple Watch SE from 2020 which was designed as a budget alternative to its contemporary Watch 6, and the newest Apple Watch 7 from this year.",
    "So which of those is best for you? And what kind of Black Friday deals are we seeing on each of them? We'll run you through each of the smartwatches so you can get the lowdown on them.",
    "This is the most affordable option of the three we're seeing most deals on. When it came out in 2017, it was a pricey device, but it's slowly reduced in price over the last few years.",
    "In our Apple Watch 3 review we noted that its battery life is slightly better than its rivals, and its screen was bright - however Siri didn't work flawlessly for many functions.",
    "The main issues with the smartwatch are in what it misses from the Watch SE and Watch 7. It doesn't have an always-on display, sleep tracking isn't native, and its display doesn't look as good as the ones on more modern Apple watches. So it's a good option, but it misses out on all the premium bells and whistles of the newer devices.",
    "This is a good choice for someone who just needs an Apple Watch, and doesn't care about it having all the newest features.",
    "This smartwatch was designed as an affordable alternative to the Apple Watch 6, which launched at the same time, for people who didn't need every single new feature and spec.",
    "In our Apple Watch SE review we commended its value-for-money proposition, especially with the range of health features it offers and ways it worked alongside an iPhone. However, we did lament the lack of an always-on display, and found the battery life wasn't quite up to scratch either.",
    "This is a good option for someone who wants a modern Apple Watch, but doesn't exactly need the minor tweaks and improvements of the newest top-end devices the company offers.",
    "This is Apple's newest smartwatch, but it's not as 'new' as you might think; in our Apple Watch 7 review we noted that it wasn't hugely different from its predecessor.",
    "The main difference here is the higher screen-to-body ratio, with the black bezel around the screen being much thinner than on the Watch 6, and charging is also faster too.",
    "So if you care about a better screen and quicker powering, this watch could be a better option - it'll also last you for longer. However deals on it aren't fantastic, so you'd be forgiven for skipping it.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Apple Watches from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
