    "Danish audio powerhouse Bang & Olufsen has announced a new pair of noise-cancelling earbuds \u2013 and they\u2019re as premium as they come.",
    "The Beoplay EQ are the brand\u2019s first true wireless ANC (active noise cancelling) earphones, designed to maintain their supreme sound quality in the busiest of environments.",
    "They\u2019ll boast up to 20 hours of total playtime (6.5 hours with ANC turned on), and benefit from B&O\u2019s fast charge technology, which can provide two hours of extra playtime from a 20-minute charge.",
    "With playtimes, charging speeds and audio features like that, the Beoplay EQ could rival the likes of the Bose QuietComfort and Apple AirPods Pro as the best premium ANC earbuds on the market.",
    "Perhaps the biggest feature for which B&O\u2019s latest earbuds stand out from the crowd, though, is their price. At launch on August 19, the Beoplay EQ will cost $399 / \u00a3349 (around AU$500). Let that sink in for a moment.",
    "B&O products have always been pricey. In many ways, the Danish brand has built a reputation for wallet-damaging speakers and earphones in the name of forging its luxury identity. But at that price, the Beoplay EQ are more expensive than even some models on our list of the best noise-cancelling headphones.",
    "As for its category rivals, the prices of those aforementioned Bose and Apple earbuds \u2013 which themselves were criticised at launch for being too expensive \u2013 are altogether dwarfed by the figure commanded by the Beoplay EQ. The AirPods Pro, for instance, come in at $150 / \u00a3100 cheaper than B&O\u2019s latest earbuds.",
    "They\u2019re easy on the eyes, mind, available in Black Anthracite (black) and Sand (gold) colorways, but we\u2019ll have to wait until we get our hands (or ears) on them before declaring whether their performance justifies the price tag.",
    "As mentioned, B&O has made a name for itself by producing high-grade products that are as much about aesthetics as they are sound quality \u2013 and that\u2019s always reflected in the price of their products.",
    "Take the brand\u2019s Beovision Contour OLED TV, for instance, which retails for $5,999 / \u00a35,150 (around AU$8,250) but is undeniably beautiful. Or the Beosound Emerge wireless speaker, which boasts a $899 / \u00a3699 (about AU$1,150) price tag but is one of the coolest-looking models we\u2019ve ever seen.",
    "The point being, B&O products often justify their expense given the novelty of their design \u2013 but right now, it\u2019s difficult to tell what the Beoplay EQ will offer that other earbuds on the market don\u2019t already offer for less.",
    "Still, it\u2019s a business model that has worked for B&O for almost 100 years, so we reckon these latest earbuds will go down just as well as the rest of the brand\u2019s luxury lineup."
