    "The Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have been revealed, and it looks just as the rumors predicted: a sleek flagship phone with a visor-like camera block. It's also launching with Google's first chipset, the Google Tensor, with a planned launch in 'fall' (Q3 2021).",
    "The Google Pixel 6 looks notably different from the Google Pixel 5, according to images shown off by an official Google tweet. The new phone ditching an all-metal matte black back for a horizontal camera block that splits the rear into two distinctly-colored sections.",
    "Thankfully, Google hasn't been stingy on the details \u2013 that tweet is one of thirteen explaining all about the phone. Here are the top-level takeaways:",
    "Separately, we know the Google Pixel 6's two cameras will be a main and ultra-wide and its selfie camera will be positioned in the middle of the front display thanks to Marques Brownlee's new video made after he claims to have handled one of the phones.",
    "Brownlee also revealed a few other tidbits: the Pixel 6 Pro will have an around 6.7-inch display, and the rails (top and bottom edges) of the camera bar will be glossy silver on the Pro phones and matte black on the standard handsets. Neat!",
    "Brownlee went even further in on the Tensor chipset itself, explaining that the new silicon gives Google the opportunity to switch out the same photo sensor it's been using since the Pixel 2 for a new one tailored to its brand-new SoC.",
    "But he also emphasized how Tensor enables the Pixel 6 phones to decode voice and process it on-device (as opposed to on Google servers) for faster responses from Google Assistant and other vocal interface features.",
    "The Google Pixel 6 wasn\u2019t shown off at Google IO 2021 back in May, but that's not surprising \u2013 Google often waits to show off its flagship, which typically launches in October. What is surprising is that we haven't heard anything official about the mid-range Google Pixel 5a, given that its predecessor launched around this time last year.",
    "What's more, a Bloomberg report suggested Google would announce and release the Pixel 5a in August, and there's plenty of time in the month left for the company to reveal it.",
    "But Google has only mentioned that its Pixel 5a 5G will come out in the US and Japan, so either the mid-range phone will get a far more limited release than the Google Pixel 4a \u2013 or Google will only release a 4G LTE version globally.",
    "Those aren't the only questions, of course \u2013 will the Pixel 5a just inherit the Pixel 5's perks, or will it get a taste of Tensor, too? We'll have to wait until Google officially reveals the phone."
