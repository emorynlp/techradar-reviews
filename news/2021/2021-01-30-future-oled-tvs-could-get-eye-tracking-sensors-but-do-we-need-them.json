  "article": [
    "OLED TVs could look quite different in a few years time compared to today. While OLED is generally considered the big TV tech of the moment, with its \u2018infinite\u2019 contrast ratio, color accuracy, and deep blacks, there\u2019s no denying that it won\u2019t stay top dog forever \u2013 at least, not without some further innovations beyond the capabilities of its picture.",
    "Not long after we heard from Panasonic that the picture quality of its OLED sets had pretty much peaked, we got the opportunity to speak with the CEO and co-founder of OTI Lumionics, Michael Helander, about the technical advancements that could up-end the way we interact with OLED TVs in the future \u2013 including baked-in sensors for tracking our eyes, heads and hands.",
    "First, some background: OTI Lumionics is a specialty materials company, one that works across the electronics industry to, as its CEO puts it, \u201chelp drive new user experiences\u201d beyond the iterative improvements we usually see in TV makers\u2019 annual product ranges.",
    "It receives a large amount of investment from LG Display, which is the only manufacturer of OLED panels for TVs, and clearly has a big stake in driving innovation in the space.",
    "\u201cWe're really only focused on solutions to new user experiences, rather than, you know, helping to drive small incremental improvements to make your display slightly brighter, or slightly reduce power consumption,\u201d says Helander. \u201cThat\u2019s just not interesting from a user perspective.\u201d",
    "New TV ranges are often disappointing in the lack of big, substantive changes \u2013 in the 2021 LG TV range, for example, the major technical changes seem to be the introduction of a tripod TV stand and an OLED evo technology designed to make the Gallery Series OLED look marginally brighter. But what exactly can OTI or any of the major players in the TV space actually innovate in?",
    "In Helander\u2019s opinion, the most exciting development in OLED is \u201cthe integration of the display\u201d with \u201cdifferent types of sensors and cameras.\"",
    "This is something we see far more commonly in the world of smartphones, where a need for embedded front-facing cameras and facial recognition sensors have to grapple with a desire for all-screen, bezel-banishing designs. With the exception of so-called \u2018notch\u2019 cameras, where else can these things go, if not under the screen itself?",
    "Helanda explains that, \u201cIn mobile phones we're starting to see the first generation of products with under-display cameras, directly integrated into the display and kind of hidden under active pixels. We\u2019re anticipating some future products with under-display Face ID and other types of IR sensors too.\u201d",
    "But as we figure out how to do the same with OLED TVs, whole new opportunities for interfacing could open up. Helander tells us that \u201cthe ability to have a camera or built-in IR sensors that can track your eyes, your face, your hands\u2026 It opens up new possibilities for user interaction with the display and the content.\u201d",
    "It's OTI\u2019s developments in cathode patterning, in particular \u2013 the process by which negatively-charged electrodes are latticed behind an OLED panel to channel electricity towards it \u2013 that are enabling under-display sensors, allowing for \u201ctotal design freedom\u201d when deciding how this layer of cathodes is made and arranged, and what can be placed in the gaps between them.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely that this will have much of an immediate impact on your souped-up home cinema, though Helander suggests that head-tracking could lead to spatial audio functionality, \u201cthe way that Apple has done with the AirPod Pros and AirPod Max, by tracking the position of your head. You could do the same thing in a home cinema setting, at least for an individual watching TV.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s possible, too, that this could have an impact in the world of gaming, with sensors able to track your eyes, head, or gestures for navigating an in-game environment \u2013 as with the Microsoft Kinect camera for Xbox 360.",
    "Helander admits the main use case for a TV screen packed with sensors and cameras is probably in \u201can office setting, for video conferencing [...] so that when you're looking at someone on the screen, you're actually looking at their eyes, they're looking at your eyes, and it becomes a much more engaging experience.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen you think about the size of the TV,\u201d says Helander, \u201cthat's a really large area where you could put quite a lot of different sensors, even starting to get some depth mapping data, and other types of 3D scanning, just by having multiple sensors placed behind it this way.\u201d",
    "Of course, manufacturers will still have to pack those sensors in somewhere.",
    "\u201cWith some of the designs you see from Sony, there's still a large box of electronics mounted at the back of the panel, in the centre region, where you could accommodate a lot of those sensors, and still have the edge of the panel be very thin.",
    "\u201cOr, if you look at the \u2018wallpaper-thin\u2019 LG WX OLED, that may be a little bit more difficult to integrate certain types of sensors and optics \u2013 but of course people are getting better and better at squeezing down the space that all of these types of sensors need for smartphones, as there are limitations on just how much physical space you have in a very slim phone. So again I think a lot of the technology there is going to get adopted into the largest size panels.\u201d",
    "The exact uses of these sensors is unclear at the moment, and we expect it will be quite a few years before they come baked into the average home television. It\u2019s obvious, though, that new ways of interfacing with our devices are emerging, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before a mainstream product makes a strong case for them."
