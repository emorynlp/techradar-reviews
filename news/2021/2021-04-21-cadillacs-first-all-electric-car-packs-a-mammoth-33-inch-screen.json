    "Cadillac has announced its first fully-electric car, the Lyriq \u2013 and it\u2019s a looker.",
    "Although the crossover SUV was technically revealed back in 2020, it was, at the time, merely a concept car, but it\u2019s impressive to see Cadillac remain so faithful to that same design in its production offering, which is set to arrive in 2022.",
    "Beyond its futuristic aesthetic \u2013 think of it as a four-wheeled great white shark \u2013 the Lyriq is also set to come equipped with some impressive performance specs and energy-saving credentials.",
    "For starters, Cadillac claims its EV debut will boast 300 miles of range from a 100kWh battery, utilising the same electric architecture as GMC\u2019s upcoming EV Hummer SUV (both manufacturers are off-shoot brands of General Motors).",
    "For comparison, that\u2019s a meatier battery and longer range than the entry-level models of both the Audi Q4 e-tron and BMW iX, though it\u2019s worth remembering that these figures are merely projections at this stage, and may deflate somewhat upon the car\u2019s eventual arrival.",
    "A single permanent-magnet motor will drive the rear axle, providing, Cadillac says, a power output of approximately 340bhp / 255kW to the 5,610-pound vehicle. It will be interesting to see, then, if the Lyriq can live up to its bold range claims, given that it\u2019s such a heavy car. Perhaps its weight is an ode to Cadillac\u2019s muscle car roots?",
    "Less impressive is the Lyriq\u2019s anticipated charge time \u2013 said to be 52 miles of range per hour from an at-home 240V AC charger, though public DC fast charging bumps this up to around 76 miles in just 10 minutes, which isn\u2019t too shabby.",
    "Inside the Cadillac Lyriq, things once again take a turn for the impressive.",
    "The dashboard is Mercedes-esque in design, boasting a giant 33-inch LED display that spans almost two-thirds of its entire width. The climate vents, too, stretch right the way across the front of the car.",
    "The steering wheel in the Lyriq is a refreshingly understated affair for a Cadillac, though it\u2019s still loaded with enough buttons and bezels to keep things suitably futuristic. Super Cruise, the brand\u2019s hands-free driving-assistance feature for compatible roads, will also feature.",
    "What\u2019s more, the manufacturer has made a point of accentuating the car\u2019s hefty internal space, with both seat rows allowing for 38 and 39 inches of headroom, respectively, and roughly 40 inches of legroom. Admittedly, that\u2019s a lot of breathing room for a crossover SUV in today\u2019s market.",
    "The trunk will benefit from that same generous size, too, boasting 28 cubic feet of space behind the second row, which expands to 60.8 cubes when the rear seats are folded down.",
    "As for its price, the base model Cadillac Lyriq will start at $59,990, with options and further model variants set to inflate that figure. While that\u2019s not exactly inexpensive for a brand new electric car, it\u2019s a much smaller sum than you\u2019d have to fork out should you decide to opt for one of those aforementioned German SUVs.",
