    "UPDATE: SaferVPN has told TechRadar Pro that the company has now released version 5.0.5.0 for Windows, which addresses CVE-2020-26050 and includes an update of the OpenSSL library.",
    "ORIGINAL: A security researcher has discovered a new vulnerability in the VPN service SaferVPN that could allow for local privilege escalation on Windows systems.",
    "The local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered by a researcher known as nmht3t who previously disclosed the fact that SaferVPN silently fixed a DoS vulnerability in its VPN client last September. In a new blog post on Medium, mmht3t revealed why he chose to publicly disclose his latest discovery, saying:",
    "\u201cSaferVPN does not fix this vulnerability even after a 90-day disclosure deadline. Therefore, there is no patch available at the moment for this product. In order to inform the users of the vulnerability, I decided to publicly disclose the vulnerability.\u201d",
    "Security researchers often give companies a 90-day deadline to fix any vulnerabilities before they disclose them publicly. As SaferVPN failed to patch this latest vulnerability in a timely manner, mmht3t felt it was in the best interest of the company's users to warn them about it.",
    "According to mmht3t's vulnerability summary, when SaferVPN attempts to connect to a VPN server it spawns the OpenVPN executable in the context of NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. The service's VPN client then tries to load an openssl.cnf configuration file from a non-existing folder (C:\\etc\\ssl\\openssl.cnf).",
    "However, as a low-privileged users is able to create folders under C:\\ on Windows, it's possible for them to create the appropriate path and place a crafted openssl.cnf file in it. Once OpenVPN starts in SaferVPN, this file can load a malicious OpenSSL engine library which results in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.",
    "SaferVPN versions 5.0.3.3 to 5.04.15 are vulnerable to this local privilege escalation flaw tracked as CVE-2020\u201326050.",
    "Mmht3t first discovered this vulnerability earlier this year and they sent the details of the vulnerability to SaferVPN in July. After a follow up with no response from the company and informing them that the 90-day disclosure deadline was approaching, mmht3t decided to make their findings public in January."
