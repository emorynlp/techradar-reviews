  "article": [
    "If there\u2019s one inevitability that links all long-running franchises it\u2019s that sooner or later, one or more of your leading actors will become unavailable. Whether that\u2019s caused by scheduling conflicts or a simple desire to go off and try new things, there are several ways the powers-that-be can face up to the challenge.",
    "The most straightforward option is to simply recast and pretend nothing has changed \u2013 see Becky in Roseanne, Aunt Viv in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and numerous Game of Thrones characters \u2013 but that runs the risk of leaving viewers wondering why a pivotal character has undergone radical facial reconstruction overnight. James Bond\u2019s producers, meanwhile, prefer to make a headline-grabbing song-and-dance of recasting British intelligence\u2019s most universal export every few years, and generally treat it as an opportunity to take the franchise in a new direction.",
    "Arguably the most ingenious solution to a departing star came in 1966, when Doctor Who\u2019s writers enshrined in canon the convenient fact that Time Lords can regenerate into new bodies. More than five decades later, nobody bats an eyelid that the UK\u2019s most famous sci-fi character has been played by 13 (or 14, if you\u2019re being pedantic) different actors.",
    "Now, reports that Sam Wilson (played by Anthony Mackie) may be about to take the lead in Captain America 4 \u2013 having first inherited Steve Rogers\u2019 mantle in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s finale \u2013 suggest the Marvel Cinematic Universe has come up with a new way to tackle the problem.",
    "As we\u2019ve come to expect from the most successful movie series in box office history, the MCU\u2019s approach to overcoming the departure of Chris Evans \u2013 one of its biggest names \u2013 is super-smart. It should also ensure that the franchise stays relevant through Phase 4 and beyond.",
    "Marvel hasn't even had to resort to reboots or Marvel\u2019s fledgling multiverse to make it work. Instead, the solution is simple storytelling common sense \u2013 and means that less familiar newcomers to the MCU such as Eternals, and Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings won't have to do all the heavy-lifting.",
    "Just as the MCU took inspiration from its comic book source material in creating a vast shared universe where all its heroes can pop up in each other\u2019s movies, having new characters step into famous uniforms is a direct lift from Marvel pages. On top of Sam Wilson becoming the new Cap, the 21st century has seen the introductions of Miles Morales as a new Spider-Man, Amadeus Cho as a new Hulk, Jane Foster as a new Thor, and Riri Williams as Iron Man replacement Ironheart.",
    "Not only has the strategy improved the diversity of a superhero line-up that\u2019s traditionally been dominated by white men, it can help make decades-old superhero tropes feel relevant again. If you thought writers were running out of challenges to sling at Peter Parker, there\u2019s no need to worry because Miles Morales\u2019 characteristics will undoubtedly showcase those Wallcrawler abilities in a new light.",
    "And while Parker, Rogers and Bruce Banner will always be synonymous with Spidey, Cap and the Hulk, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that they\u2019re usually remembered more for what they do as their superpowered alter-egos than what they do in civilian life \u2013 the same way that Clark Kent can blend into the background, while Superman is one of the most recognizable figures in pop culture. Indeed, superhero brands are usually bigger than any particular incumbent of the role \u2013 or the actor playing them.",
    "When faced with the exit of its two biggest stars, most franchises would recast, reboot, or find a strange halfway house as the X-Men saga did when it turned its timeline into an indecipherable mess with four prequel movies and three Wolverine-spin-offs. Yet thanks to Marvel\u2019s ingenious succession planning, the loss of Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans should amount to a mere blip on the MCU landscape.",
    "Downey, in particular, did so much to make the role of Tony Stark his own that it\u2019s impossible to imagine anyone else playing Marvel\u2019s most famous genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist. It\u2019s a recasting headache best avoided \u2013 see also: finding a successor Hugh Jackman as Wolverine \u2013 and the MCU has seemingly sidestepped the dilemma entirely by bringing Ironheart (played by Dominique Thorne) into the mix in next year\u2019s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and her upcoming TV show. If you like your heroes running around in technologically advanced battle armor, Marvel Studios has still got you covered.",
    "Crucially, prioritizing super-brands over specific characters allows Marvel to preserve its most important asset \u2013 that epic continuity. Sure, the MCU could make like Gotham City \u2013 where the upcoming The Batman will be the start of the fourth Caped Crusader arc since 1989 \u2013 and retell Stark\u2019s story from day one. But then you risk destroying the legacy of 13 years of storytelling, and devaluing Stark\u2019s sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame. Besides, Marvel already has What If\u2026? reinventing popular characters, making movie reboots somewhat redundant.",
    "We perhaps didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but when Anthony Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson agreed to become Captain America in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, he was helping secure the MCU\u2019s future as the biggest movie/TV franchise in the known universe. Who knows, maybe Natalie Portman\u2019s Jane Foster playing god in Thor: Love and Thunder could be Chris Hemsworth's excuse to hang up his hammer after a memorable decade in the role? Or, when Tom Holland decides he\u2019s too old to play the teenage Peter Parker, could Miles Morales swing in to save the day?",
    "Marvel Studios has long been redefining the way we look at superhero movies and TV shows. By allowing its most iconic heroes to live on after the original incumbents of the super-suits have moved on, chances are they\u2019re going to be doing it for years \u2013 and even decades \u2013 to come."
