  "article": [
    "Microsoft\u2019s latest guidelines regarding the recently disclosed OMI vulnerabilities has put the onus on users to patch many of the affected Azure services.",
    "The September Patch Tuesday bundle shipped with fixes for four zero-day vulnerabilities in the open source software agent named Open Management Infrastructure (OMI), which is automatically deployed inside Linux virtual machines (VM) when users enable certain Azure services.",
    "However, instead of patching all affected Azure services, Microsoft has put an advisory stating that while it\u2019ll update six of them, seven others must be updated by users themselves.",
    "\u201cCustomers must update vulnerable extensions for their Cloud and On-Premises deployments as the updates become available per schedule outlined in table below...For cloud deployments with auto update turned on, Microsoft will actively deploy the updates to extensions across Azure regions as per the schedule in the table below,\u201d reads the advisory.",
    "The Register points out that Microsoft\u2019s handling of the situation hasn\u2019t gone down well with security researchers.",
    "\u201cThey\u2019ve also failed to update their own systems in Azure to install the patched version on new VM deployments. It\u2019s honestly jaw dropping,\u201d tweeted security researcher Kevin Beaumont.",
    "Since Microsoft has left it upon users to patch the impacted services, it didn\u2019t take researchers long to discover vulnerable instances.",
    "\u201cThere are 56 known exposed services worldwide that are likely vulnerable to this issue, including a major health organization and two major entertainment companies,\u201d wrote security vendor Censys after performing an impact assessment.",
    "While the number seems small, Censys reasons it\u2019s probably because of how the OMI service responds to such scans, or perhaps because exposing OMI to the internet likely requires deliberate effort.",
    "In any case, since exploiting the vulnerability is a \u201claughably easy trick\u201d according to Sophos, security researchers strongly urge users to patch any vulnerable OMI-using services in their Azure deployments without delay.",
