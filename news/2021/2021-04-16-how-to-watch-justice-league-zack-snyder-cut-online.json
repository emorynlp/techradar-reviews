    "It took a long time to release (and will take a while to watch, too!) but the so-called Snyder Cut of 2017's Justice League movie is here. Fans of DC Comics and superheroes in general now get to watch the Justice League movie just as its visionary director intended - although probably on a smaller screen than he would have liked... Follow our guide below as we explain how to stream the Snyder Cut, with HBO Max the place to be in the US.",
    "Featuring a who's who of DC's best-loved superheroes including Batman (Ben Affleck), Superman (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Erza Miller) and Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the Justice League that made it to theaters a few years ago was a commercial and critical disappointment, netting a mortal $658 million at the box office and receiving decidedly mixed reviews.",
    "Many saw the creative vision for the film as compromised by the fact that two directors had worked on the project and the theatrical version was something of a disappointment for fans. The superhero team-up flick also underperformed at the box office, bringing in just US$658 million in ticket sales \u2013 significantly less than what the standalone Wonder Woman film made just a few months earlier.",
    "Now fans can finally see for themselves what Justice League would have looked like if Snyder had stayed at the helm, with the infamous four-hour Snyder Cut having landed on HBO Max in the US as well as a number of other well-known streaming services and PVOD platforms all over the world.",
    "The wait is finally over! Read on as we explain how to watch Justice League online and stream the full Snyder Cut movie this week.",
    "Let's face it...you've probably already made up your mind whether you'll invest four hours of your precious time into watching the Snyder Cut of Justice League.",
    "But just in case you're still wavering, we have a full review of Zack Snyder's Justice League on site. We definitely think that the longer form makes a big improvement to the original release and everybody from Superman to Cyborg gets their time to shine. Obviously the film's duration will make it feel like a bit of a slog for some - especially considering that the first half does drag a little.",
    "Still, when you've got through the film, you might want to check out our explainer of the Zack Snyder's Justice League ending. We'll also explain why the Justice League aspect ratio isn't in widescreen when you watch it today.",
    "More great HBO Max content:"
