    "This new show from Paramount Plus promises to go where no Star Trek animated series has gone before. Devised for a younger audience, this cinematic adventure series will be the first in the franchise rendered using CGI and 3D modelling. Below we\u2019ll explain how to watch Star Trek: Prodigy online from anywhere now.",
    "Set in the year 2383, a disparate bunch of alien teens commandeer an abandoned vessel, the USS Protostar. Guided by the hologrammatic version of Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew, reprising her role from Voyager), Roh-Tahk, Dal, Jankom, Murf and friends go on a series of adventures across the galaxy, heading for Federation space.",
    "The series features a wildly colorful cast of characters. Rylee Alazraqui voices Rok-Tahk, an animal-loving humanoid. Brett Gray is 17-year-old \u201cmaverick\u201d Dal, and Angus Imrie plays a genderless energy-based lifeform called Zero. Meanwhile, Dee Bradley Baker as Murf is basically an indestructible blob, while Big Mouth\u2019s Jason Mantzoukas has been perfectly cast as a quarrelsome Tellarite.",
    "Set your phasers to stunned as we explain how to watch Star Trek: Prodigy online now, no matter where you are.",
    "If you\u2019re in the wrong quadrant of space \u2013 or even just abroad \u2013 when new Star Trek: Prodigy drops, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the new animated series due to annoying regional restrictions.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream Star Trek: Prodigy online no matter where you are. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Star Trek: Prodigy from abroad",
    "Star Trek: Prodigy is still a lightyear or two from reaching viewers across the pond. But with the ongoing international rollout of Paramount Plus, it\u2019s anticipated that the platform will launch in the UK sometime in 2022, in partnership with British media and telecommunications company Sky.",
    "Remember, though, that even if you are abroad you'll be able to access your streaming service subscription from anywhere, if you download a good VPN and follow our instructions above."
