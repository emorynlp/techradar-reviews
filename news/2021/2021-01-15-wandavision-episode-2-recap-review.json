    "Spoilers for WandaVision follow. Check out our WandaVision episode 1 recap if you want to get caught up.",
    "It\u2019s the middle of the night. A noise outside the bedroom window disturbs Wanda, so she uses her powers to flick the lights on, waking Vision. He gets up to look out of the window, but all he can see are the rose bushes. \u201cAre you using your night vision, Vision?\u201d she asks, but he assures there\u2019s nothing amiss\u2026 Until another bang prompts him to hide under the covers.",
    "He says that some friends in the office had mentioned some ne\u2019er-do-wells in the area \u2013 though Wanda wonders if they might have been referring to a couple who walk through walls or move objects without touching them. After another bang, Wanda uses her magic to pull their twin beds together, and open the curtains. As they applaud themselves for resolving the situation \u2013 and for Wanda\u2019s impromptu redecoration \u2013 Wanda turns the beds into a double. Vision tells her to get the light and they dive under the covers for a very different reason than before.",
    "Following some Bewitched-inspired animated credits, a top-hatted Vision is rehearsing a magic act, asking Wanda to wheel out the \u201cCabinet of Mysteries\u201d. As Illusion, he\u2019s planning to make his assistant, Glamour, disappear \u2013 and when he taps the wooden cabinet, she\u2019s vanished behind a fake wall in the closet. He\u2019s worried that the trick looks too fake, but she points out that\u2019s the whole point of a magic act \u2013 and that it\u2019s their neighborly duty to participate in the talent show fundraiser. She also thinks it\u2019s their chance to appear as normal as possible, and she wants them to fit in.",
    "They both abandon the rehearsal for meetings: Wanda to the talent show planning committee, Vision to the local neighborhood watch \u2013 he\u2019s keen to make sure security is as good as possible after the previous night\u2019s disturbances.",
    "Wanda hears a mysterious bang outside. She sees a toy helicopter in the bushes, standing out as vibrant red and yellow against the monochrome surroundings \u2013 just to add to the mystery, there\u2019s a SWORD (Sentient World Observation and Response Department) logo on its side. As Wanda considers what she\u2019s holding, she\u2019s interrupted by Agnes who\u2019s brought round Se\u00f1or Scratchy, a rabbit for the magic show. Wanda and Agnes leave for the meeting, Agnes explaining that influential committee head Dottie is the key to getting on in the town, and that it\u2019s worth making an effort to impress her. Wanda asks if she can just be herself \u2013 a suggestion Agnes finds hilarious.",
    "As Dottie lectures the committee members, Wanda starts chatting with Geraldine, another attendee at the meeting. Dottie scolds Wanda for talking at the wrong times, and shows bizarre control over the other women \u2013 any use of the phrase \u201cfor the children\u201d prompts the audience to reply in unison. \u201cHow is anybody doing this sober?\u201d asks Agnes.",
    "Vision arrives at the meeting in the library and is told it\u2019s a members-only type deal. He says he\u2019ll wait there until they get to \u201cnew business\u201d, but when they say they\u2019re just about to get to \u201cnew business\u201d, it turns out that really means eating danishes. Vision accidentally admits he doesn\u2019t eat, leading to some backtracking as he tries to join in their top secret (but not very interesting) gossip by suggesting that \u201cNorm is a communist\u201d. The group laugh wildly, and decide Vision isn\u2019t as square as they thought. He\u2019s even offered a stick of chewing gum which \u2013 reasoning that it\u2019s \u201cpurely for mastication\u201d \u2013 he accepts. Unfortunately, he accidentally swallows the gum and \u2013 as shown in an animated representation of his insides \u2013 it clogs up his Synthezoid workings.",
    "Wanda helps Dottie to clean up. Wanda asks why they\u2019ve got off on the wrong foot \u2013 Dottie says she\u2019s heard things about Wanda and Vision. Wanda assures her she doesn\u2019t mean anybody any harm, but Dottie doesn\u2019t believe her.",
    "They\u2019re interrupted by a mysterious message on the radio, a man\u2019s voice saying \u201cWanda. Wanda, can you read me, over?\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d asks Dottie, before the radio explodes, shocking her into breaking her glass. Her hand is cut, and her blood shows up as vivid red.",
    "In this week\u2019s commercial break, a James Bond type advertises Swiss-made Str\u00fccker watches, with the slogan \u201cHe\u2019ll make time for you\u201d.",
    "At the talent show, Wanda waits nervously backstage. Vision arrives late, stumbling and looking dishevelled \u2013 another animation shows that his insides are still gummed up. Wanda tries to explain the weird happenings with the helicopter and Dottie, but there\u2019s no time. Dottie reminds the audience it\u2019s all \u201cfor the children\u201d \u2013 they all recite the line back \u2013 and introduces Vision and Wanda\u2019s act.",
    "Vision stumbles over his lines as if he\u2019s drunk. He tells them, \u201cToday, we will lie to you and yet you will believe our little deceptions, because human beings are easily fooled due to their limited understanding of the inner workings of the universe.\u201d He starts the act by using his powers to levitate, baffling the audience \u2013 forcing Wanda to magic up a rope and pulley to maintain the illusion of a fake illusion.",
    "She subsequently keeps their cover intact by turning a piano into a cardboard cut-out after Vision picks it up with one hand, and creating some mirrors when he phases a top hat through his body. The performance is a massive hit, especially after the showstopping final trick where a very confused Geraldine materializes in the Chamber.",
    "After the act is done, Wanda identifies Vision\u2019s problem and uses her powers to remove the gum. He starts to recover instantly, realising he\u2019s not as funny when he\u2019s not blocked up. Worried they\u2019ve blown it with the town\u2019s residents, they try to make a fast getaway. They\u2019re spotted by Dottie, however, and she awards them with the inaugural award for Comedy Performance of the Year. They invite Geraldine on stage to share the applause \u2013 but they still won\u2019t tell her how they did the trick. Another chant of \u201cFor the children\u201d echoes through the audience.",
    "Wanda and Vision get home and compliment each other on the performance, joking about the whole thing being \u201cfor the children\u201d. When they get up from the sofa, Wanda is suddenly pregnant. \u201cIs this really happening?\u201d she asks \u2013 Vision assures her it is.",
    "There\u2019s more banging outside the front door. Initially they can\u2019t see anything, until someone emerges from a manhole. It\u2019s someone in a beekeeper\u2019s suit \u2013 and they have the SWORD emblem on their back.",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d says Wanda, and rewinds the action to the point where she asked, \u201cIs this really happening.\u201d Things unfold differently this time, however, and Vision\u2019s head goes Technicolor \u2013 followed by the rest of their front room and Wanda. They kiss as the scene dissolves into the credits.",
    "\u201cWanda? Who\u2019s doing this to you, Wanda?\u201d asks the voice on the radio. \u201cWanda?\u201d",
    "\u201cPlease Stand By,\u201d says the test card screen.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Could chewing gum have defeated Thanos? If it can turn a robotic superbeing who can phase through walls, fly and instantly carry out incomprehensible calculations into an incompetent (but harmless) stage magician, it would certainly have been worth a try. Whatever the results, Infinity War would have turned out very differently.",
    "That we\u2019re even asking the question shows how much two half-hour episodes of WandaVision have transformed the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You\u2019re constantly struck by the boldness of a decision to take two frontline Avengers, and give them a spin-off where jokes and canned laughter are as essential a part of the mix as superpowers. It\u2019s an unlikely scenario, but the brilliant comic timing of Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany makes sure it works like a charm.",
    "After episode 1\u2019s pitch-perfect dissection of 1950s sitcom conventions, the destination this time is the \u201960s. It\u2019s just as wonderfully realized, from the Bewitched-style animated credits to larger scale production values that expand the cast, and move the action beyond the confines of studio sets. The attention to detail is impressive \u2013 the fact that the television set has now become the centerpiece of the front room, or that Wanda wakes up in the middle of the night with her hair perfectly coiffed, are subtle but brilliant details that make WandaVision a clever and fun journey into TV history.",
    "But alongside the comedy, this episode really ramps up the MCU components of the story. What\u2019s making the noises in Wanda and Vision\u2019s garden? Why did a modern helicopter toy (featuring a SWORD logo) appear in full color? Who\u2019s the voice calling out to Wanda through the radio? And who\u2019s the \u201cbeekeeper\u201d who appears from the sewers in the last act?",
    "As the show dripfeeds its many mysteries, the biggest questions now concern Wanda\u2019s instant pregnancy \u2013 is it connected to the Westview residents\u2019 disconcerting \u201cFor the kids\u201d mantra? \u2013 and how much control she wields over this strange world. The fact that she can rewind time to change events implies she\u2019s more than just a mere bystander.",
    "As the Wizard of Oz style explosion of color in the final scene suggests we\u2019re still learning the rules of the WandaVision universe, chances are we\u2019ll be asking more questions before we get significant answers.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
