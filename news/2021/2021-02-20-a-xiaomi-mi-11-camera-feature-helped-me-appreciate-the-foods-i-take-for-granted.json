    "It\u2019s very easy to take food for granted \u2013 the packet-to-mouth process takes very little brain power and even if, like me, you love to cook and bake, it\u2019s easy to view food merely as an ingredient, a piece of a puzzle, a means to an end.",
    "Recently, though, I\u2019ve come to realize food can be a lot more beautiful than we give it credit for \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking the beauty of a freshly-cooked five-cheese pizza, but the captivating patterns and designs of small, raw ingredients.",
    "I\u2019ve been using the Xiaomi Mi 11 for around a week now, and one of its features has me thinking about food a lot more \u2013 and, more importantly, viewing food in a way I hadn\u2019t before.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 11 has the best macro camera of any smartphone I\u2019ve tested (used for close-up snaps). Not only is its sensor higher-resolution than most, but its lens is a telemacro one, so you don\u2019t have to hold the phone so close to the subject. As a result, you won\u2019t find yourself blocking all the natural light with the hefty phone, as you would for another device.",
    "The upshot of this is that, not only does the Xiaomi Mi 11 take better close-up snaps than most phones, but it\u2019s a lot easier to use too. When I figured this out, I went on an energetic spree photographing most anything I could find around my house.",
    "Naturally, this quotidian photoshoot took place largely in my kitchen, my place of worship \u2013 I don\u2019t exactly have a big house \u2013 and I found myself taking lots of photos of various foodstuffs. Rice, coffee granules, herbs, more.",
    "These pictures showed me the food in far better detail than my eye could make out \u2013 I could see the tiny textures of foods, the droplets of moisture, grooves cut in vegetables and the pits and craters and valleys of an instant coffee granule that could have been confused for a lunar map, if it weren\u2019t for the coffee jar it was in.",
    "For the first time in a long time, I actually started looking at food again \u2013 I don\u2019t mean looking like I do when cooking, checking to make sure a potato is totally peeled, or a pepper thoroughly fried, or some loaded fries crisped to the perfect shade of gold \u2013 I mean really admiring the food.",
    "As with many products of the natural world, food contains so many patterns and rhythms that you only spot when you look up close. An orange peel can turn into a peg solitaire board, oats can become a shale cliff that\u2019s close to collapse.",
    "Natural fractals are always curious things, and while I can\u2019t quite say those perfect mathematical patterns were replicated in my larder, it was still captivating to see all the diagrams and ornaments present when you look at food up close.",
    "This article will be peppered with Xiaomi Mi 11 macro camera samples, and hopefully one or two of the shots will captivate you as it did me.",
    "This would typically be the point in the article where the grand breakthrough happens \u2013 \u2018and thanks to seeing food up close, I learned I should eat healthier\u2019 \u2013 but I\u2019m sorry to say there\u2019s no such denouement here. I just thought this close-up food looked really interesting to look at, enough so to share.",
    "Since my macro revelation, I\u2019ve found myself photographing just about everything I eat, and more often than not it produces impressive results. Lentils look gorgeous up close, and I somehow even managed to make tofu look appealing, though that latter result is more evidence than the rest of this article that I\u2019ve been going a little macro-mad.",
    "I\u2019m looking forward to my country\u2019s lockdown ending, so I can take pictures of things that aren\u2019t about to go on my face, but until then I\u2019m enjoying this new-found admiration of the beauty of food."
