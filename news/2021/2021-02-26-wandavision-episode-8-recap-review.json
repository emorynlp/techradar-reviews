    "Spoilers for the latest episode of WandaVision follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "Salem, Massachusetts, 1693.",
    "A young Agatha Harkness is escorted through the forest and tied to a stake using magic. She\u2019s surrounded by a circle of hooded women.",
    "\u201cAgatha Harkness, are you a witch?\u201d asks their leader. \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. \u201cI am a witch.\u201d The leader tells Agatha she\u2019s betrayed her coven, but Agatha denies it. She says Agatha stole knowledge above her age and station, and practised the darkest of magic. \u201cI did not break your rules,\u201d says Agatha. \u201cThey simply bent to my power.\u201d",
    "The witches chant in unison in Latin. Agatha pleads with them, saying she cannot control it \u2013 \u201cif only you would teach me!\u201d",
    "\u201cMother, please\u2026\u201d she continues, looking at the leader of the group.",
    "The whole coven directs its magic at Agatha and it looks like it\u2019s doing her serious damage. Then Agatha\u2019s own magic kicks into life in the form of purple energy, and she throws it back at the other witches. Agatha\u2019s mother, Evanora, flies into the air and directs her own magic at Agatha. Agatha frees herself and creates a shock wave that knocks out all the witches except Evanora, leaving them as wizened corpses on the ground.",
    "\u201cPlease, I can be good,\u201d Agatha says to her mother. Evanora says she cannot, and attacks her again. Agatha retaliates and leaves her mother for dead. She removes a brooch from Evanora\u2019s dress \u2013 the same one we\u2019ve seen her wearing in Westview \u2013 and flies away.",
    "Back in the present, in a dark basement in Westview, Agatha jokes with her rabbit, Se\u00f1or Scratchy. \u201cI know, she does look shocked to meet the real us, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d",
    "Wanda tries to read Agatha\u2019s mind. \u201cOh, that\u2019s adorable,\u201d says Agatha. \u201cMy thoughts are not available to you, toots. They never, ever were.\u201d",
    "Wanda asks where her children are \u2013 Agatha mocks how her Sokovian accent comes and goes. Wanda tries to use her magic again but it doesn\u2019t work. Agatha incapacitates Wanda and tells her there\u2019s a \u201cbasic protection spell\u201d on each wall, cast by magical runes \u2013 she explains that only the witch that cast the runes can use magic in any given space. \u201cHow do you not know the fundamentals?\u201d",
    "Wanda asks who she is, but Agatha throws the question back at her. \u201cI was so patient, waiting for you to reveal your true self. I got close with fake Pietro \u2013 Fietro, if you will \u2013 but no dice.\u201d (She explains that Pietro wasn\u2019t literally her, just her eyes and ears \u2013 a crystalline possession. She adds that necromancy was a non-starter because the real Pietro\u2019s body was on another country \u2013 \u201cnot to mention riddled with holes\u201d.)",
    "She taunts Wanda that she\u2019s so riddled by self-doubt that she believed Pietro was real.",
    "Agatha says that when she sensed all the powerful magic happening in Westview, she \u201ccouldn\u2019t make heads or tails\u201d of it. She grabs an insect from the wall and demonstrates mind control. \u201cQuick incarnation and a feeble psyche and you\u2019re good to go.\u201d But with thousands of people under Wanda\u2019s control, interacting together in complex storylines, \u201cthat\u2019s something special, baby.\u201d",
    "And as Agatha turns the bug into a bird and back, she says that transmutation requires \u201cyears of study to achieve even the smallest convincing illusion\u201d \u2013 and yet Wanda has manipulated every small detail, even miles away on the edge of town. \u201cWhat\u2019s your secret, sister? I need you tell me how you did this.\u201d",
    "Wanda says she didn\u2019t do anything, so Agatha slams her against the wall. Agatha says she tried to be gentle, \u201cto nudge you away from this ridiculous fantasy, but you\u2019d rather fall apart than face your truth.\u201d She reminds Wanda of what she said to Fietro about feeling empty, alone, endless nothingness\u2026 \u201cLet\u2019s start there.\u201d",
    "Agatha creates a door in the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun playing pretend for while, hasn\u2019t it, Wanda?\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s time to look at some real reruns.\u201d",
    "Wanda refuses to go but Agatha reminds her who\u2019s got her kids stashed away in her \u201cbewitched basement\u201d. Wanda hears Billy and Tommy calling for help.",
    "Wanda\u2019s back in the Maximoff apartment in Sokovia, her parents still alive. Her father brings back a suitcase containing DVDs of classic sitcoms. He says he\u2019ll sell them tomorrow, but for now, there\u2019s more for TV night. Pietro tells him to talk in English \u2013 the \u201conly rule of TV night is we try to practise our English.\u201d Pietro calls for Wanda, who walks into the scene and is suddenly her 10-year-old self.",
    "This TV night is Wanda\u2019s pick, and it\u2019s season 2, episode 21 of The Dick Van Dyke Show, \u201cthe walnut episode\u201d. Pietro says it\u2019s always a sitcom with Wanda. Meanwhile, Wanda\u2019s mother looks out at gunfire on the street outside.",
    "The family enjoy the show together\u2026 and then a huge explosion.",
    "Wanda and Pietro find themselves alone, surrounded by wreckage, their parents dead. They see a Stark Industries bomb, still active \u2013 and The Dick Van Dyke Show is still playing. \u201cAt the end of the episode you realize it was all a bad dream,\u201d says Wanda. \u201cNone of it was real.\u201d She reaches out towards the bomb as Pietro tells her not to.",
    "Agatha pulls Wanda out of the vision, and asks if she stopped that bomb: \u201cYou used a probability hex.\u201d Wanda denies it \u2013 she says the bomb never went off because it was defective, but they didn\u2019t know that at the time. They were trapped for two days.",
    "Agatha acknowledges how much trauma there was, and yet they were \u201csafe as kittens\u201d all along. \u201cSo what I see here is a baby witch obsessed with sitcoms and years of therapy ahead of her,\u201d Agatha says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t explain your recent hijinks. Where\u2019d you get the big guns, Wanda?\u201d",
    "Another door opens. Wanda says she doesn\u2019t want to go back there, but Agatha says it\u2019s good medicine \u2013 \u201cthe only way forward is back.\u201d",
    "Back in Baron von Strucker\u2019s HYDRA compound, Agatha wonders why Wanda and Pietro\u2019s reaction to the death of her parents was to join an \u201canti-freedom terrorist organisation\u201d. Wanda says they wanted to change the world.",
    "Wanda walks into a room containing Loki\u2019s Scepter. A voice on the intercom asks her to state her name and status \u2013 she confirms she\u2019s a volunteer. She\u2019s ordered to \u201ctouch the sample\u201d, as a scientist reminds his colleague that no test subject has survived contact with the artefact. The blue jewel levitates out of the Scepter and as Wanda raises her hand, the blue coating explodes away, revealing the Mind Stone inside. Wanda is bathed in its energy and when she looks up, she sees a silhouetted figure floating in the light. It has the form of the Scarlet Witch in the comics. She collapses to the ground, and the scientists rush in. She\u2019s still alive, so they put her in isolation.",
    "In her cell, Wanda watches TV. The scientists examine the footage of Wanda\u2019s Mind Stone encounter, but see nothing. Wanda turns of the television with her mind.",
    "Agatha pulls Wanda out of the flashback: \u201cSo, little orphan Wanda got up close and personal with an Infinity Stone that amplified what otherwise would have died on the vine. The broken pieces of you are adding up, buttercup. I have a theory, but I need more.\u201d",
    "Agatha takes Wanda to her room in the Avengers Compound, where she\u2019s watching an episode of Malcolm in the Middle. Wanda recalls that it was the first home she shared with Vision \u2013 that she was in a new country, Pietro was dead and she was all alone.",
    "Invited in, Vision phases through the wall. She asks him to sit next to her on the bed. As Vision tries to get his head around a joke in the show, he says he\u2019d like to know how she\u2019s feeling \u2013 if that would be of some comfort to her. She says that the only thing that would bring comfort to her is seeing Pietro again \u2013 she says it\u2019s like a wave that keeps knocking her down again and again, and she feels like it\u2019s going to drown her.",
    "Vision says that, \u201cIt can\u2019t all be sorrow, can it?\u201d He explains he\u2019s always been alone, that he can\u2019t feel loss because he\u2019s never had someone to lose. \u201cBut what is grief, if not love persevering?\u201d he asks. Vision interrupts the moment as he finally gets the gag on TV.",
    "Agatha wipes a tear from her eye, and recaps: parents dead, brother dead, Vision dead. \u201cWhat happened when he wasn\u2019t there to pull you back from the darkness, Wanda?\u201d Wanda doesn\u2019t want to go any further, but Agatha urges her on. Wanda says she wanted him back, and she marches into SWORD headquarters.",
    "Wanda tells the security guard that when she came back (from the Blip), Vision was gone. She says that she knows he\u2019s in the building, and that he deserves a funeral. The guard directs her into the building \u2013 she doesn\u2019t need a door pass, because she has magical powers to open the door.",
    "She walks into Director Hayward\u2019s office \u2013 he tells her it\u2019s an honor to meet her. He says he understands she\u2019s there to collect Vision\u2019s body, and that he has something to show her. They look down on Vision\u2019s body in pieces, being hacked apart and dissected by SWORD scientists, the wires inside him visible. She asks what they\u2019re doing. \u201cWe\u2019re dismantling the most sophisticated sentient weapon ever made,\u201d he replies. She counters that he\u2019s not a weapon and they can\u2019t do this. \u201cIn fact, it is our legal and ethical obligation,\u201d says Hayward.",
    "She says she just wants to bury him, but Hayward asks if she\u2019s sure that\u2019s what she wants. \u201cNot everyone has the kind of power that could bring their soulmate back online. Forgive me\u2026 back to life.\u201d She says she can\u2019t do that \u2013 that\u2019s not why she\u2019s there. \u201cOkay,\u201d says Hayward. \u201cBut I cannot allow you take 3 billion dollars worth of vibranium just to put it in the ground.\u201d He says the best he can do is let her say goodbye to him here. She tells him Vision is all she has, but he says the problem is that \u201che isn\u2019t yours\u201d.",
    "Wanda smashes the glass and floats down to Vision. Soldiers point their guns at her, but Hayward tells them to fall back, to let her see for herself. Wanda puts her hand to Vision\u2019s head and says, tearfully, that she can\u2019t feel him. Wanda returns to her car and looks at the envelope next to her.",
    "She drives to Westview, and looks around the town \u2013 much more run down than we\u2019re used to seeing it in the idealized WandaVision version. As she drives around, she sees the real-world versions of Herb, Phil Jones, Mrs Hart and the delivery guy. She arrives at the derelict ruins of a house in suburbia and stands in the foundations. She opens the envelope, which contains property deeds for the famous property on 2800 Sherwood Drive, Westview, New Jersey \u2013 in the name of Wanda Maximoff and The Vision. Vision has left a note in a heart: \u201cTo grow old in. V.\u201d",
    "Wanda collapses to the ground, crying. She screams out and unleashes a colossal amount of magical energy. The house rebuilds around her and the shockwave spreads throughout the town, rewriting everything as a black-and-white 1950s sitcom. In the living room, she rebuilds Vision in black-and-white \u2013 and she\u2019s transformed into the \u201950s housewife version of herself from episode 1. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d says Vision. \u201cShould we stay in tonight?\u201d They kiss on the sofa, as present-day Wanda watches.",
    "Wanda looks up and sees the studio lights and the seats for the studio audience. Agatha slow claps. \u201cBravo!\u201d she says, before disappearing.",
    "Tommy and Billy call for help. Agatha is floating above them in the street, using magical rope to grab them by the neck. Wanda assures the boys it\u2019s okay. \u201cYou have no idea how dangerous you are,\u201d says Agatha. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a myth, a being capable of spontaneous creation, and here you are, using it to make breakfast for dinner.\u201d Wanda tells Agatha to let go of her children.",
    "\u201cOh yes, your children,\u201d Agatha responds. \u201cAnd Vision, this whole little life you\u2019ve made. This is Chaos Magic, Wanda. And that makes you the Scarlet Witch.\u201d",
    "MID-CREDITS STING",
    "Outside the Hex Field, an agent tells Hayward the team is ready for launch. Hayward says it\u2019s about time. \u201cWe took this thing apart and put it back together again a million times,\u201d says Hayward. \u201cTried every type of power supply under the sun, when all we needed was a little energy directly from the source.\u201d The weaponized Stark Industries drone Wanda brought out of Westview glows with her red magical energy.",
    "A SWORD operative operates a machine and powers up another Vision, drained of his usual colour. Vision 2.0 wakes up and looks at his hand.",
    "Verdict:",
    "If you were feeling uncharitable, you could describe \u2018Previously On\u2019 as an unashamed info-dump \u2013 the traditional episode where the writers go big on exposition to answer all the questions you\u2019ve been asking for the previous seven weeks.",
    "Nonetheless, it would be a harsh way to talk about a wonderfully crafted piece of TV that uses Agatha Harkness\u2019s own quest for explanations as a clever framing device for flashbacks, diving deep into the heart of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also packs the sort of emotional punch that seemed impossible when Wanda and Vision were joking their way around \u201950s suburbia in episode 1.",
    "While Agatha has clearly been up to no good in every iteration of Westview \u2013 not least by creating a fake Pietro to act as her spy \u2013 she\u2019s obviously as confused as we are about how Wanda managed to create her all-encompassing Hex field. The question is, does she want to understand Wanda\u2019s abilities so she can harness them for herself, or is she genuinely worried those Scarlet Witch powers are a threat to the world? In the MCU, the line between heroes and villains is often blurred, so it could go either way.",
    "Agatha\u2019s efforts to put Wanda in a magically enhanced psychiatrist\u2019s chair reveal elements of the Avenger\u2019s past she was reluctant to confront by herself. We now know that her magical powers were always inside her, and that the Mind Stone enhanced what she\u2019d already used to save herself (and Pietro) from that Stark Industries bomb. Her HYDRA-induced Scarlet Witch vision suggests she might be about to rival Captain Marvel for the title of most powerful being in the MCU. And the scene where she arrives at the house that would have become her home with Vision is utterly heart-wrenching \u2013 in context, it\u2019s easy to understand how grief caused her to conjure up her utopian sitcom world.",
    "We now know, however, that one of our major assumptions about WandaVision was wrong. After Hayward used CCTV to show Wanda\u2019s post Avengers: Endgame visit to SWORD HQ, we believed she\u2019d taken his dismembered corpse to Westview. It turns out this wasn\u2019t really the case, as she headed off to Westview without getting her wish to give her partner a proper funeral.",
    "So perhaps Hayward is now the true bad guy of the show. You can see him trying to manipulate Wanda into using her powers to bring Vision back to life, subtly seeding the idea that reanimation is possible. After she tries to communicate with Vision, it\u2019s conceivable that a bit of residual energy reanimated part of his Synthezoid body.",
    "It now seems that all Hayward has wanted from the start is to get his \u201csentient weapon\u201d back online. In WandaVision, not all villains get a catchy theme song.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
