    "Looking to save some cash on a sweet foldable? We've got all the best Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 deals all rounded up right here. It's a great time to be checking in too as Samsung's own Black Friday Galaxy Z Flip 3 deals are actually still available right now. Head on over to the official site to not only get a nice price cut on a device but a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2 and a wireless charger - two great freebies.",
    "In fact, its introductory price of $999 makes it around the same price as a Galaxy S21 Plus, although no one would dare to call the Galaxy Z Flip 3 an 'affordable' device by stretch of the imagination. That said, there are a couple of nifty ways to save some cash with this week's Galaxy Z Flip 3 deals - regardless if you're looking for an unlocked or carrier device.",
    "Key upgrades include a beefy new Snapdragon 888, an expanded cover screen four times the size of that featured on the previous model, and some new camera software upgrades. Samsung has also improved the refresh rate of the internal display so it's zipping along at a speedy 120Hz - which brings it in line with all the latest flagship devices on the market.",
    "If you'd like to read a bit more about the specs of this device we've attached a mini-review just at the bottom of the page, just beneath this week's best Galaxy Z Flip 3 deals.",
    "Finally, Samsung has finally managed to do what seemed impossible just a few years ago - produce a foldable device that actually costs around the same as a similarly specced out 'normal' device. Well, relatively speaking - the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 does still costs $999 at launch, which isn't exactly pocket change.",
    "That puts it in same price bracket as the 'plus' sized flagships like the iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus - powerful devices, but not any more powerful than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, thanks to its new Snapdragon 888 chipset. Put simply, you're not paying that new-tech novelty tax for going with a foldable device, and you're even getting a few new design improvements too.",
    "While, on initial inspection, the Flip 3 may look a lot like its predecessor, it's now featuring a cover display that's four times larger, an upgraded internal screen that's capable of 120Hz refresh rate, and a reinforced hinge that feels a lot sturdier than those on previous Fold devices. Samsung has also ditched the glass outer back design for this new iteration, instead opting for a new 'glastic' design. Some may not welcome that change, but it does mean a cheaper device - and one that's more durable.",
