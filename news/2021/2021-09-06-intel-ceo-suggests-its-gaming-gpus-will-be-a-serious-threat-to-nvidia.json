  "summary": "Intel Arc graphics cards set to \u201creally put pressure on Nvidia\u201d",
  "article": [
    "Intel\u2019s CEO Pat Gelsinger has been talking up Team Blue\u2019s incoming processors and discrete graphics cards, insisting that the latter is set to give Nvidia a real run for its GPU money.",
    "Gelsinger made various comments stoking the hype train in an interview with financial analyst Pierre Ferragu, as Wccftech reports, and that included the aforementioned warning shot at Nvidia.",
    "Gelsinger said: \u201cWe have our GPU architecture where we are gonna start being in a position to really put pressure on Nvidia for the first time ever.\u201d",
    "That is, of course, a reference to Intel Arc GPUs which are the firm\u2019s discrete high-end graphics cards that are expected to arrive in Q1 of 2022. These cards will, of course, go up against AMD as well as Nvidia, but it\u2019s the latter that very much holds the lion\u2019s share of the desktop graphics card market.",
    "Gelsinger further asserted that incoming Alder Lake processors, which are due to debut later in 2021 \u2013 the rumor mill believes we\u2019re looking at an October launch, then mid-November on-sale date \u2013 will offer something special too, and indeed a step forward in line with the one AMD took with its original Zen processors.",
    "When interviewer Ferragu asks about whether there\u2019ll \u201cbe a Zen moment for Intel\u201d, Gelsinger replies: \u201cWe have a number of things going on over here ... We are rolling out the heterogenous architecture that is part of Alder Lake where we have big and little cores, you know AMD only has one. We\u2019ll have a higher performance and a more energy-efficient version of the core, pretty compelling\u2026\u201d",
    "Of course, AMD believes that it only needs one type of core (at least for now), but still, there\u2019s no doubting that what we\u2019ve been hearing about Alder Lake performance does indeed sound enticing.",
    "Gelsinger further boasts that there are other major architectural developments \u201ccooking back in the labs\u201d for the future that are a \u201cpretty dramatic step forward and well beyond anything that was talked about yet\u201d.",
    "Some of those innovations won\u2019t be unveiled for a couple of years, though, he observes, so it would seem a good bet that he\u2019s referencing Meteor Lake here, which will be Intel\u2019s big move to 7nm expected to happen in 2023 if things stay on track.",
    "Naturally, it\u2019s the CEO\u2019s job to talk up the prospects of their company and incoming products, but it\u2019s clear enough that Intel is now on a push to start seriously hyping the incoming Intel Arc GPUs, following the recent official announcement of the discrete graphics cards (and some further revelations around the branding of these offerings).",
    "The indication that Intel is aiming squarely at Nvidia to \u2018really\u2019 put some pressure on Team Green is ambitious, for sure. What we don\u2019t know is how that pressure will be applied \u2013 and what we might hope for is that Intel\u2019s attack could come at least partially on the pricing front. Frankly, the cost of graphics cards has got pretty ridiculous in recent times, and the rumor mill reckons that Nvidia\u2019s next-gen cards \u2013 due to turn up later in 2022 (maybe very late) \u2013 might be even pricier.",
    "At the very least, having a third player in the market and more discrete gaming GPUs on the table will be a massive boon just purely in terms of increased choice and stock levels, particularly as we keep hearing that the chip shortage might drag on and on throughout 2022, and maybe even into 2023\u2026"
