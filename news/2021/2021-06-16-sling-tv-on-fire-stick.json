    "If you want all the thrills of live TV without the crippling monthly cable bill, then Sling TV delivers. At half the price of rival services like Hulu, it\u2019s both affordable and flexible: offering two core plans at $35 each that can be embellished with additional Extras, Cloud DVR, and a la carte premium content from the likes of EPIX, Showtime, and Starz.",
    "You can download Sling TV on Fire Stick, a line of media streaming devices from Amazon's Fire TV range that retail at around $30-$40. That\u2019s not a lot to transform an ordinary television into a smart TV capable of downloading thousands of apps through which you can stream dozens of live channels and heaps of on-demand movies. All you need is a compatible TV (HD or 4K) with a HDMI port and a Wi-Fi connection to get going.",
    "We\u2019ll explain below how to install Sling TV on Fire Stick, the kind of content you could enjoy through the streaming app, and what other devices are compatible with Sling TV.",
    "Indeed you can! The Sling TV app is compatible with all Amazon Fire Sticks, of which there are three types available: the budget-friendly Fire TV Stick Lite, the mid-range Fire TV Stick with volume control, and the top-tier Fire Stick 4K, which provides a 4K Ultra HD streaming experience.",
    "You\u2019ll need a Sling TV membership, and can register in two different ways: through the app once you\u2019ve downloaded Sling TV on Fire Stick (just make sure the Amazon account linked to your Fire Stick has your up-to-date payment information).",
    "Alternatively, sign up via the website on your desktop or mobile device. You\u2019ll need to provide your email address, create a password, choose your core plan and then add any optional Extras, before finally entering your billing information.",
    "Not sure if Sling TV is your ideal live-streaming TV service? We\u2019ve put together this guide on the Sling TV Price and Packages, along with any new money-saving offers, to help you decide.",
    "Once you\u2019ve purchased your Amazon Fire Stick \u2013 which should come with power adaptor, voice-controlled remote control, and 3 AAA batteries \u2013 you\u2019ll need to plug it into your TV\u2019s HDMI port and complete the steps to set up your Amazon Fire TV Stick, including registering the Fire TV stick to your Amazon account.",
    "After that, you\u2019ll be able to download Sling TV on Fire Stick devices. Installing the app is free and very simple, as we detail below:",
    "Not got Sling TV on Fire Stick? You might want to read the following guide for how to install Sling TV on Roku instead.",
    "That largely depends on what Sling TV package you choose. Sling Orange is ideal for those leaning towards live sports and family programming, with a line-up of over 30 channels that includes ESPN and the Disney Channel. If you plan on watching Euro 2020 on Fire Stick, you\u2019ll need to pick Sling Orange.",
    "For the same $35 a month fee, Sling Blue has a bigger line-up with more news (Fox News, NBC), more brilliant drama (TNT, FX) and more documentaries (Discovery). And, if you want it all \u2013 sports, news coverage, and heaps of entertainment \u2013 take a punt on the combined Sling Orange + Sling Blue plan for $50 a month.",
    "Once you\u2019re happy with your base plan, you can customize it by adding a variety of Sling TV channels for an additional fee. There are eight themed channel packs available, each offering networks specializing in the content you love. For example, Sports Extra provides gaming fans with 14 extra channels, including NBA TV and the MLB Network, for $11 a month, while Comedy Extra is a gift for fans of reality TV and LGBT programming.",
    "On top of that, there are over 30 a la carte Premium channels for between $3 a month (ScreamFlix, FlixLatino) and $10. Showtime falls into the latter category: a top-tier channel full of thrilling TV shows \u2013 among them Homeland, Shameless, and Penny Dreadful \u2013 plus movies, sports, comedy, and documentary titles.",
    "Whether you opt for Sling Orange or Blue, you\u2019ll get access to some of the best live TV networks (A&E, AMC, BET, Cartoon Network, Comedy Central) and their binge-worthy on-demand libraries with Sling TV on Fire Stick.",
    "You can download thousands of channels (also known as apps) to your Fire Stick, some of which are free (Pluto TV) others of which require a paid subscription (Netflix).
