    "Recently a leaker claimed that the Google Pixel 6\u2019s rumored Whitechapel chipset would be less powerful than the flagship Snapdragon 888, and we theorized at the time that it might be in line with the Snapdragon 870. Now a new leak suggests we might be right.",
    "According to @heyitsyogesh (a data engineer and leaker), current performance from the Whitechapel chipset is close to the Snapdragon 870. The Snapdragon 870 is a fairly high-end but not top-end chipset, found in the likes of the Moto G100 and the Xiaomi Poco F3. So as with the Pixel 5, the Pixel 6 probably won\u2019t quite have flagship power.",
    "The source claims that Whitechapel\u2019s performance is reaching this sort of level on PVT (Production Validation Test) units. PVT units are intended to be the final build, so don\u2019t expect the performance to improve by the time the Pixel 6 launches.",
    "Other details about the chipset are in line what we\u2019ve already heard \u2013 it\u2019s apparently a 5nm one (like the Snapdragon 888), and is said to put a focus on machine learning and AI performance. Apparently it matches \u201cother leading mobile chips\u201d for raw AI performance, and its GPU is said to perform well under stress.",
    "It sounds like a solid chipset then, and for most users the fact that it possibly won\u2019t quite match the Snapdragon 888 likely won\u2019t really matter or be noticeable \u2013 that extra power mostly comes into play for demanding games and video editing and the like.",
    "Plus, presumably the use of a slightly lower end chipset will mean a lower cost for the Google Pixel 6 itself.",
    "And aside from the chipset, the Pixel 6 range sounds like it could compete with the best phones around. That\u2019s particularly true in the case of the Pixel 6 Pro, which based on previous rumors might have a 6.67-inch QHD AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 5,000mAh battery, and a triple-lens camera.",
