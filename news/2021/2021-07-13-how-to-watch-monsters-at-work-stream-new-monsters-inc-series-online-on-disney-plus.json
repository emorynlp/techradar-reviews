    "Nearly twenty-years on, we see the aftermath of the emotionally scarring events of Monsters, Inc as Mike and Sully bid farewell to Boo, with Monstropolis forever changed by the duo. As Monsters, Inc hits the small screen, the Scare Floor has been transformed, and recent Monsters University graduate will have to give up his dreams of becoming the best scarer and adapt his skills. Find out exactly what's going on with our guide on how to watch Monsters at Work as it drops exclusively on Disney Plus.",
    "Val, Fritz and the rest of the ragtag Monsters, Inc. Facilities Team aren't exactly the sort of crew he'd dreamed of joining. Disorganized, blundering and unambitious, they're precisely what hotshot Tylor isn't.",
    "But he's going to have to put those grand dreams of ruling the Scare Floor and working alongside Sulley and Mike to one side, because he's not going anywhere anytime soon - not until he develops a sense of humor, anyway.",
    "Follow our guide as we explain how to watch Monsters at Work online and stream the new Monsters, Inc. series today, by grabbing a great value Disney Plus subscription right now!",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck in to we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN+ to your subscription price. The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as The Great, Upload, Helstrom and Normal People. While ESPN+ brings tonnes of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "Monsters at Work is just the latest in a string of recent blockbuster releases exclusive to the platform, including Loki, Soul, The Mandalorian, Mulan, Hamilton, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "In addition, now that Disney has set the precedent of releasing movies like its live-action Mulan remake on the service instead of in theaters through its Disney Plus Premier Access program, expect the company to keep bringing more blockbuster films that were originally intended to be shown on the big screen to Disney Plus in 2021. More recently, it's the way to watch Cruella online, with Black Widow arriving in July.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star on Disney Plus that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy.",
    "It's available in the UK, most of Europe, and other select markets like Australia and New Zealand - but not in the US, where the media giant's Hulu service already has very similar ground covered.",
