    "After an unpredictable 2020 season that at times felt doubtful of ever reaching its conclusion, we\u2019re now on the cusp of kicking off the 2021 season of the NRL tonight (Thursday, March 11).",
    "This year\u2019s rounds look like they could be returning to a pre-coronavirus normalcy, with crowds expected to be welcomed back, and teams allowed to play outside their biosecurity bubble \u2013 a Covid protocol that was introduced last year.",
    "Something will be starkly different though \u2013 Melbourne Storm legend Cameron Smith announced his retirement yesterday, ending a decorated career at the club that spanned 19 seasons.",
    "Smith won three NRL premierships with the Storm, and played a record 430 NRL games with the club. With Smith no longer captaining the side, all eyes will be on Melbourne, to see if they can maintain their magic after winning the season in 2020.",
    "If you want to catch all the action, or you\u2019re looking to live stream from anywhere in the world, you can turn to Foxtel, Watch NRL or Kayo Sports.",
    "There\u2019s no need to miss a second of the Australian rugby league action, thanks to Watch NRL \u2013 a global subscription service that will give you access to every single NRL match this season.",
    "The league\u2019s official streaming service can be had on weekly, monthly and annual subscriptions, of which the last option represents the best value.",
    "It\u2019s unavailable in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, but can be watched anywhere outside those regions. Here\u2019s how Watch NRL is priced in various regions around the world.",
    "If you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access your subscriptions and services from all over the world. You may even be surprised how simple it is to do.",
    "Use a VPN to get an NRL live stream from anywhere"
