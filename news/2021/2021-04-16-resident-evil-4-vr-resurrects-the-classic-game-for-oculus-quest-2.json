    "While all eyes were on the new trailer and demo for Resident Evil 8, Capcom had a special treat to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the game series during its April stream: Resident Evil 4 VR is coming, and will recreate the classic action horror game in virtual reality.",
    "Resident Evil 4 VR is being developed in partnership with Facebook\u2019s Oculus Studios and Armature Studio, and we at least know it\u2019s launching for Oculus Quest 2 headsets. That\u2019s pretty much all we know at this point \u2013 no release date, price, or compatibility info \u2013 but more info is coming in an Oculus Gaming Showcase on April 21 on the Oculus Facebook page or on Twitch.",
    "Based on the preview footage, we know you\u2019ll be running through very familiar settings from the village and castle segments of Resident Evil 4, using familiar weapons and taking on zombies in your search for the President\u2019s daughter. In addition to combat in first-person VR, you\u2019ll also engage with puzzle elements (we see Leon turn yet another crank) and manage your inventory.",
    "Aside from Resident Evil 8, there are a couple more announcements made during the April stream to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Resident Evil.",
    "Much like the Resident Evil-themed content coming to The Division 2 announced earlier, popular 4v1 multiplayer game Dead By Daylight is getting its own content pack in June from the famed survival horror series. It\u2019s unclear which of the many popular monsters will be featured as the killer, though we have our suspicions given the spirited reception to the unreleased Resident Evil 8\u2019s co-antagonist, Lady Dimitrescu.",
    "The April stream also dropped another trailer for Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, an original anime series following Leon and Claire surviving yet another outbreak \u2013 this time in the White House."
