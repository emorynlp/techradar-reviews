    "For many of us, Apple\u2019s voice assistant Siri has become an integral part of everyday life. Whether you want to know if you need to take an umbrella on your walk to work, want it to play DJ by starting your favorite playlist on your HomePod, or even set reminders and timers, just ask.",
    "While Apple\u2019s voice assistant may have started life on iPhone, it can now to be found in Apple\u2019s whole range of devices including iPads, Macs, HomePod speakers, and the Apple TV streaming device, Apple TV, further expanding what Siri can do. For example, with Siri on Apple TV you can control your smart home devices, such as changing the color your smart lights illuminate and even seeing a live feed from your video doorbell on the TV when it's been pressed.",
    "Sometimes it\u2019s nice to have a bit of fun, and Siri can help here too. There are lots of Easter eggs in Siri\u2019s code that are there for no other reason than to make you smile. Here are some of our favorites, although there are plenty more for you to discover.",
    "Read on to discover some of Siri's best Easter eggs, or if you want to get Appple's voice assistant in your life now, check out the best prices for the latest Apple devices with the voice assistant built in.",
    "Siri\u2019s pretty good at controlling your music, but it can also amuse you with some fun musical in-jokes. If you tell Siri that \u201cI see a silhouetto of a man\u201d you\u2019ll be treated to a spoken word version of Bohemian Rhapsody.",
    "Ask \u201cHey Siri, can you rap?\u201d, and Siri will provide a funny demonstration, although Apple\u2019s voice assistant won\u2019t be winning a Grammy for its efforts anytime soon. if you say \u201cHey Siri, sing for me\u201d you\u2019ll discover that Siri isn\u2019t as confident as you might expect. Our favorite is to ask \u201cHey Siri, beatbox for me\u201d, which Siri responds to with audible delight.",
    "Siri can also tell you \u201cWhat does the fox say?\u201d, \u201chow many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man?\u201d or \u201cwhere is Elvis Presley?\u201d but if you ask them \u201cwho let the dogs out?\u201d you\u2019ll get a somewhat huffier response.",
    "Siri loves TV and movies, so it\u2019s hardly surprising to discover a host of Easter eggs dedicated to famous shows and films. Siri will happily respond to famous movie lines such as \u201cHey Siri, I am your father\u201d, \u201cHey Siri, beam me up Scotty\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, open the pod bay door\u201d, and you can also ask Siri \u201cwhat is your favorite movie?\u201d.",
    "Some of the responses are more mischievous: try asking \u201cHey Siri, is Jon Snow alive?\u201d, \u201care you HER?\u201d, \u201cIs Winter coming?\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, can I name you Jarvis?\u201d; you\u2019ll also get interesting responses to \u201cHey Siri, cease all motor functions\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, find me directions to Mordor\u201d.",
    "There are many more: try \u201csupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\u201d, \u201cmirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\u201d, \u201cwill you be my thunder buddy?\u201d or \u201cblue pill or red pill?\u201d to see if Siri is part of The Matrix.",
    "Some of Siri\u2019s responses are seasonal, so for example you can ask \u201cWhat should I go as for Halloween?\u201d There are a few festive Easter eggs dedicated to Christmas too: you can ask Siri \u201cWhere does Santa live?\u201d and no matter what time of year, say \u201cwish me a Merry Christmas\u201d to get a seasonally appropriate response. If you\u2019re feeling brave you could ask Siri to \u201ckiss me underneath the mistletoe\u201d, but don\u2019t worry: if the kids ask \u201cdoes Santa exist?\u201d Siri isn\u2019t going to spill any secrets.",
    "Siri is very well-read, and likes a good literary gag: if you ask \u201ctell me a story\u201d you\u2019ll get a very different take on a famous fairy tale, and if you ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the meaning of life?\u201d there\u2019s a 50/50 chance of getting some wisdom or getting a book joke. It\u2019s fun to ask \u201cHey Siri, do you follow the three laws of robotics?\u201d if you\u2019re a Sci-Fi fan, and if you\u2019re a fan of the Hitch-hiker\u2019s Guide To The Galaxy, say to Siri: \u201cread me a poem\u201d and \u201cmake sure you know where your towel is\u201d. Siri will also respond to \u201cdo you like green eggs and ham?\u201d",
    "Apple\u2019s engineers have packed Siri with tech jokes, references and self-deprecating humor, and you can have fun by saying things like \u201cHey Siri, OK Google\u201d, \u201cApple or PC?\u201d or \u201cWho is the best assistant?\u201d. On a Mac, ask Siri \u201cWhat is the best computer?\u201d",
    "There are plenty of others to try, including \u201ctesting, 1, 2, 3\u201d, \u201cwhat is zero divided by zero?\u201d, \u201cdo you have any pets?\u201d and \u201cwhat do you think about the Google assistant?\u201d",
    "Siri can even help with your love life: ask \u201cWhat\u2019s your best pick-up line?\u201d and Siri can offer several suggestions.",
    "Most digital assistants can tell a few really bad jokes, and Siri is no exception. Try \u201cknock knock\u201d, \u201ctell me a joke\u201d, \u201cwhy did the chicken cross the road?\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, talk dirty to me\u201d for some groan-inducing responses, or ask \u201chow much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\u201d for something more surprising.",
    "Siri isn\u2019t just here for the little things. You can ask the big questions too. Questions like \u201cWill pigs fly?\u201d or \u201chey Siri, can I borrow some money?\u201d. You can ask for advice, such as \u201cwhat should I wear today?\u201d or \u201cwhat music should I listen to??\u201d There are some limits, though: Siri isn\u2019t impressed if you say \u201cI need to hide a body.\u201d",
    "There are many more. Siri can answer \u201cwhy is the sky blue?\u201d, \u201cwhen will Hell freeze over?\u201d and even \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite animal?\u201d, and you can also ask \u201cif a tree falls in the woods and no-one is around, does it make a sound?\u201d to get a surprisingly sensible response.",
    "We\u2019re not sure what this says about Apple customers, but a lot of Siri\u2019s snappy responses are for romantic and/or personal questions such as \u201cwhat do you look like?\u201d, \u201cwhat are you doing later?\u201d, \u201cwhat are you wearing?\u201d, \u201cdo you have a girlfriend?\u201d and \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d. You can ask Siri how old they are, if they ever sleep, whether they like cats, how much they cost or how tall they are, and it\u2019s always nice to ask \u201chow are you?\u201d"
