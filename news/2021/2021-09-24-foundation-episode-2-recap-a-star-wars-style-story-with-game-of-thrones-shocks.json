    "Major spoilers follow for Foundation\u2019s first two episodes. Watch them before reading on.",
    "Foundation didn\u2019t exactly burst out of the gate during its first episode on Apple TV Plus. The detailed nature of Issac Asimov\u2019s seminal sci-fi novels meant that the show\u2019s premiere had plenty of set up to get through before it could get going. Now that the groundwork has been laid, though, Foundation\u2019s second episode \u2013 Preparing to Live \u2013 is the first true test for Apple\u2019s latest large-scale production.",
    "It\u2019s unusual for a TV series\u2019 second episode to be burdened with such expectations. After all, a show\u2019s premiere is normally enough for viewers to decide whether it\u2019s worth sticking with. Foundation\u2019s complex narrative and abundance of characters gave its first episode something of a free pass, though, even if we felt it was lacking in some areas. Now, it\u2019s up to its next entry to deliver a rousing spectacle to make audiences sit up and take notice.",
    "Thankfully, Preparing to Live does just that: producing a tighter, more thematically dense and surprising entry than its predecessor. The show still suffers from a couple of persistent issues, but it begins to make good use of Asimov\u2019s material and takes Foundation\u2019s story in an interesting direction.",
    "Picking up events sometime after episode 1, Preparing to Live follows parallel storylines involving Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell) and their followers, and the Empire\u2019s de facto rulers.",
    "The former are en route to Terminus, the barren planet that Brother Day (Lee Pace) exiled them to in the previous episode. Meanwhile, back on Trantor, Brother Day, Brother Dawn (Caleb Cooper) and Brother Dusk (Terence Mann) debate what should be done with Anacreon and Thespis\u2019 delegations following the Star Bridge attack. A subplot involving Dusk, who is going through an existential crisis, also threatens to create further tension among the trio\u2019s ranks.",
    "What\u2019s immediately apparent about episode 2 is the distinct lack of location hopping. Unlike episode 2, Preparing to Live takes place in just two settings: Trantor, and on the ship transporting Seldon\u2019s group to Terminus. By reducing the number of locations, episode 2 becomes much easier to follow than the show\u2019s premiere. You know where each group of characters is and what they\u2019re doing, which makes things less chaotic from a storytelling perspective.",
    "Of the alternating storylines, Trantor\u2019s is arguably the simpler to follow. Day and Dusk find themselves quarreling over the decision to exile Seldon, Dornick and their disciples, as well as whether they should retaliate over the Star Bridge attack.",
    "The ensuing impasse results in Day (and Dawn but, as a child, he takes a backseat to proceedings) interrogating Anaceron and Thespis' envoys over their parts in the devastating assault. Meanwhile, Dusk busies himself with menial tasks away from the hubbub, and it\u2019s during one such errand where Preparing to Live\u2019s key theme emerges.",
    "Working on the Mural of Souls, a seemingly endless piece of artwork depicting the history of the Empire\u2019s current rulers, Dusk almost falls from his lofty perch to his death. Realizing that his body is starting to fail him \u2013 each of the Empire\u2019s leaders are clones of its first emperor, Cleon I \u2013 Dusk spends the rest of episode 2 reflecting on, and questioning, his existence.",
    "Dusk\u2019s mini-story arc is the first time that Foundation thematically resonates with its audience. Initially unshaken in his belief that Anacreon and Thespis should be punished for their crimes, Dusk\u2019s dice with death, as well as a trip to one of Trantor\u2019s decimated subterranean levels in the wake of the Star Bridge\u2019s collapse, make him more sympathetic to their cause. The jaunt leads to the startling revelation (for audiences, at least) that the Emperors\u2019 advisor Eto Demerzel (Laura Birn) is also a robot: the first of three big surprises that episode 2 drops on viewers.",
    "Ultimately, Dusk\u2019s last-minute change of heart about what should be done with Anacreon and Thespis' delegates makes no difference to ensuing events (more on this later). But as viewers, we\u2019re able to examine the fragility of life through Dusk\u2019s eyes and how we might react, or be impacted by, similar events in our own futures. It\u2019s taken one and a bit episodes for Foundation to begin exploring key themes from Asimov\u2019s works, but it\u2019s welcome all the same.",
    "Episode 2\u2019s other storyline examines human vulnerability in equal measure. Dornick\u2019s heart-to-heart with supporting character Lowre (Kin Adis), who refuses to terminate her pregnancy despite the risks en route to Terminus, is one such example of this. The revelation concerning the parents of Raych Seldon (Alfred Enoch), Hari\u2019s adopted son, is similarly emotive in its exploration of life and death. It\u2019s a thematic examination that ties episode 2\u2019s coexisting storylines together and shows that commonalities exist between Seldon and Day\u2019s groups despite their differences.",
    "If Dusk\u2019s existential crisis has you feeling sorry for him, Preparing to Live\u2019s harrowing ending soon puts a stop to that. Sure, he doesn\u2019t make the final decision to enact revenge on Anacreon and Thespis but, in simply being associated to Day, he\u2019s just as accountable for the events that follow.",
    "Unable to determine who is responsible for the Star Bridge attack, Day punishes Anacreon and Thespis equally. Callously, Day makes the planets\u2019 main envoys watch as he hangs the rest of their delegations. That\u2019s not all, though \u2013 Day also sends a legion of Empire warships to Anacreon and Thespis who, on his signal, brutally bombard both worlds with immeasurable numbers of missiles. It\u2019s a highly emotive moment (millions of innocent Anacreons and Thespins are likely killed in the attack, after all) that\u2019s eerily reminiscent of Alderaan\u2019s destruction in Star Wars: A New Hope. It also feels as ghastly as comparably distressing incidents in Game of Thrones \u2013 another pop culture touchstone that Foundation is tonally similar to.",
    "Preparing to Live\u2019s other storyline delivers its own unexpected moment, too. In its final scene, Dornick (and audiences by extension) are left stunned as we see Raych murdering Hari. But, for some reason, the gravity of the situation feels a bit hollow. That\u2019s likely down to the fact that two episodes isn\u2019t enough time to invest in Hari as a character \u2013 if his shocking death didn\u2019t arrive until episode 7 or 8, it would be far more impactful. It prevents Hari and Gaal's father-daughter style relationship from progressing, too, which has been one of Foundation's bright spots thus far.",
    "As it is, Hari's death is a hugely surprising turn of events, but one that lacks the emotional depth that a main character\u2019s death would usually have.",
    "Preparing to Live is a superior episode compared to the series opener. With major character introductions and plot setup out of the way, there\u2019s more time to focus on the show\u2019s key themes, character development, traumatic events and cliffhanger ending that will leave viewers wanting more.",
    "However, Foundation continues to struggle in the story pacing department. It still feels frantic at times and audiences would benefit from knowing the timespan between each episode. Some individuals briefly allude to how much time has passed, but they\u2019re blink-and-you-miss-it moments. A clearer understanding of timescales for each story strand wouldn\u2019t go amiss.",
    "Plot pacing aside, though, Foundation episode 2 feels more cohesive than the show\u2019s premiere. The series\u2019 creative team are beginning to find a balance between honoring Asimov\u2019s source material and making a TV show that diverges from the novels in exciting ways. If it maintains this equilibrium between the lore in Foundation\u2019s books and updating its plot for present day, Apple\u2019s new flagship show will be worth sticking with.",
    "New episodes of Foundation debut exclusively on Apple TV Plus every Friday."
