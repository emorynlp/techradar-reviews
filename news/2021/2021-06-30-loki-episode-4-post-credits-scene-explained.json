    "Spoilers follow for Loki episode 4.",
    "Loki episode 4 \u2013 The Nexus Event \u2013 has landed on Disney Plus, and it\u2019s the most important instalment in the god of mischief\u2019s solo adventure yet.",
    "There are plenty of revelations in this week\u2019s episode, some of which confirmed that certain Loki fan theories were correct, but the biggest was reserved for episode 4\u2019s post-credits scene.",
    "For the first time in Marvel\u2019s Loki, there\u2019s a post-credits scene to enjoy \u2013 and you\u2019ll want to watch it for some big surprises.",
    "We\u2019re diving into major spoilers for Loki episode 4 from this point on. If you haven\u2019t finished watching, turn back or you\u2019ll have it ruined for you.",
    "Before we dive into the post-credits scene, let\u2019s briefly recap that climactic episode 4 scene.",
    "After Loki and Sylvie begin to sow discourse throughout the Time Variance Authority (TVA) \u2013 the duo tell Mobius and Hunter B-15 that they\u2019re also variants \u2013 the pair are hauled before the so-called Time Keepers by Ravonna Renslayer.",
    "Found guilty of being variants, Loki and Sylvie are sentenced to death by the Time Keepers. However, Hunter B-15 shows up, deactivates Loki and Sylvie\u2019s time collars, and a fight breaks out between the TVA\u2019s forces and the trio.",
    "During the ensuing battle, it\u2019s revealed that the Time Keepers aren\u2019t real: they\u2019re mindless androids, which means that they didn\u2019t create the TVA, the sacred timeline (the MCU timeline, that is) isn\u2019t so sacrosanct after all, and the TVA is built on a web of lies.",
    "After they defeat Ravonna and her guards (and find out that the Time Keepers are merely fake overlords), Loki and Sylvie have another weird romantic moment.",
    "That is, until Loki is seemingly killed.",
    "Coming to after she was knocked unconscious by Sylvie during their fight, Ravonna grabs one of the TVA\u2019s pruning batons and disintegrates Loki, much to the shock of Sylvie and viewers.",
    "As always, though, not everything is as it seems with Loki.",
    "Episode 4\u2019s post-credits scene shows that Loki is still alive. Waking up in a post-apocalyptic New York (there\u2019s a destroyed Avengers Tower in the background), Loki asks himself \u201cIs this Hel? Am I dead?\u201d \u2013 but it turns out he\u2019s not alone.",
    "\u201cNot yet,\u201d an off-screen stranger says. Confused, Loki looks up. \u201cBut you will be, unless you come with us,\u201d the voice continues.",
    "The camera switches from Loki to reveal who is talking to him: it\u2019s Richard E. Grant, who was rumored to appear in the TV show. At it happens, he's portraying another Loki variant.",
    "That\u2019s not all, however. Grant\u2019s old Loki is joined by three more Lokis: a younger version of Loki (known as Kid Loki in the comics), a Black Loki (who seems to have adopted the mantle of Thor) and a crocodile Loki. Yes, you read that right: a reptilian Loki.",
    "Funnily enough, the post-credits scene is similar to how the Avengers stood over Loki in 2012\u2019s Avengers Assemble, which is a cool callback.",
    "Marvel's comics hold some of the answers to this particular question.",
    "Classic Loki is pulled straight from Marvel\u2019s Golden Age comics, with his iconic yellow and green costume (complete with huge horned helmet). This is the first iteration of the character in Marvel comics, who made his debut in October 1962\u2019s Journey Into Mystery #85.",
    "This incarnation of Loki stuck around for quite a long time in the comics (even though he occasionally died), and it was this iteration who became Lady Loki for a number of comic issue runs that were released in the late 2000s.",
    "Loki dies once more during the events of 2010 comic run Siege, but doesn\u2019t stay dead for long. He gets reincarnated as Kid Loki in Thor #617 and ends up joining the Young Avengers line-up in the superhero group\u2019s 2013 comic relaunch. Kid Loki becomes teenage Loki in Marvel\u2019s Loki: Agent of Asgard comic run, but he\u2019s a less evil version of the character than he was previously.",
    "Jack Veal (The End of the F***king World) will portray Kid Loki in episode 5. Depending on how that instalment plays out, he may appear in episode 6, too.",
    "We suspect that Old Loki and Kid Loki possess similar abilities to Tom Hiddleston\u2019s Loki (shapeshifting, magic and intelligence among others) but we aren\u2019t sure if Black Loki does.",
    "Why? Well, Black Loki (portrayed by Deobia Oparei) appears to be a brand-new variation on the character. There are currently no instances of a Black Loki in Marvel's comics, so this is likely an original Loki who has been created for the TV series.",
    "Black Loki appears to have based himself on Thor, too. We see him sporting more battle-oriented clothing than Loki usually wears and he\u2019s carrying a hammer that looks like it\u2019s been assembled from scrap.",
    "Curiously, there\u2019s precedent for Loki adopting Thor\u2019s mantle in the comics.",
    "Loki has wielded Mjolnir \u2013 Thor\u2019s hammer \u2013 on a couple of occasions, with these incidents occurring during Marvel\u2019s Axis series and Thor\u2019s 2020 comic run. It\u2019s unclear, though, if Black Loki (who is also called Boastful Loki, according to the German language dub credits at the end of episode 4) has any of Thor\u2019s powers or if he\u2019s simply copying his brother\u2019s aesthetic.",
    "Finally, we have Crocodile Loki. Again, there are no examples of Loki turning himself into a crocodile or alligator in the comics.",
    "However, given that Loki can shapeshift into, well, anything he wants, seeing a crocodile version of the character isn\u2019t a stretch. We\u2019ll have to see how Crocodile Loki factors into events when episode 5 lands.",
    "We hope so. As one of Loki\u2019s teaser trailers showed, there\u2019s a version of the character \u2013 President Loki \u2013 who we haven\u2019t met yet. He\u2019s the one who says \u201cCome on, what did you expect?\u201d before seemingly being turned on by his guards.",
    "Of course, this variant could end up being the Loki that we\u2019ve followed throughout the series.",
    "This is speculation on our part, but he could overthrow whoever is in charge and, when he\u2019s located by Sylvie or someone else, it could be his way of reintroducing himself to her and the viewers at home. After all, Loki only looks out for himself. Unless, of course, the other Loki variants teach him otherwise.",
    "We may also see some of the variants that were teased in episode 2. Before Mobius, Loki and the TVA forces head back in time to 1985, Mobius runs through a number of Loki variants that the TVA has already captured and pruned. These include a Loki who retained his frost giant skin color, a Loki who won the Tour de France and a monstrous looking Loki.",
    "If nothing else, it would be fun to see Hiddleston embody some of these other Loki variants. He's a talented actor, so we'd like to see him bring his comedic performance to more Lokis in episode 5.",
    "We\u2019ll find out what\u2019s going on exactly, and how many Loki variants there are, when Loki episode 5 arrives on July 7."
