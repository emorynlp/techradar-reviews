  "article": [
    "Google Cloud has tied up with quantum computing startup IonQ to make its quantum hardware accessible through its cloud computing platform.",
    "The company\u2019s 11-qubit quantum hardware is available to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) customers, and the company expects to make its 32-qubit system available later this year.",
    "Explaining the significance of the announcement in a conversation with Google Cloud, IonQ CEO & President, Peter Chapman suggests that the offering will ensure \u201cdemocratized access to quantum systems.\u201d",
    "\u201cMaking quantum computers easily available to anyone via the cloud demonstrates that quantum is real because now anyone can run a quantum program with a few minutes and a credit card,\u201d says Chapman.",
    "IonQ\u2019s quantum computers are available in the GCP Marketplace and can be immediately provisioned by users.",
    "IonQ shares that developers, researchers, and business can access IonQ\u2019s platform with just a few clicks, just like any other platform available on GCP.",
    "The company adds that GCP users will be able to program IonQ\u2019s systems using a number of software development kits (SDK), including Cirq, Qiskit, Penny Lane, and tket, or through a custom integration with IonQ\u2019s APIs.",
    "Notably, IonQ\u2019s quantum hardware is also available on Microsoft Azure and AWS.",
    "IonQ\u2019s release also notes that the company announced its 32-qubit system in October 2020 and hopes to build on its expertise to develop small modular quantum computers in 2023, that can be networked together inside of a datacenter."
