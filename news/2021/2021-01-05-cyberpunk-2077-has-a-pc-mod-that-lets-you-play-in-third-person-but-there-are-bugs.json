  "article": [
    "Cyberpunk 2077 now has a mod that allows PC gamers to experience the open world RPG from a third-person viewpoint.",
    "As you\u2019re no doubt aware, the game is normally played in first-person \u2013 aside from when driving, which allows you to select from a couple of perspectives from behind the vehicle \u2013 but some folks have expressed the desire to play in third-person all the time (or at least dip into that view).",
    "Now that\u2019s a reality with the \u2018JB \u2013 TPP\u2019 mod, made by Jelle Bakker, which gives you a third-person perspective (in fact, there\u2019s a choice of four camera views to cycle through) albeit with caveats, as the mod is clearly labelled as a work in progress.",
    "As Tom\u2019s Hardware points out having tested the mod, it works well enough in more open areas \u2013 with some glitches \u2013 but can seemingly fail quite badly indoors, particularly in more confined spaces like an elevator, where there\u2019s little room to maneuver.",
    "There are some serious camera issues to iron out, in short, and the big problem here is that engaging in aiming and firing weapons results in some very weird animations. Even so, those flaws might be cured as the mod is worked on further, so this would seem to be one to watch for those who would prefer to ditch Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s first-person perspective.",
    "You can download it from Nexus Mods, with installation instructions provided there (check out the video clip below to see the mod in action, too). There\u2019s already a list of bugs which are being fixed, such as the main character\u2019s head disappearing (that has apparently already been resolved, with the fix applied in version 4 of the mod which is incoming).",
    "There\u2019s a whole host of mods out for Cyberpunk 2077, and they allow you to tweak the game in all sorts of ways, including things like the addition of a zoom function for the mini-map, better vehicle handling \u2013 let\u2019s face it, driving a car is pretty twitchy \u2013 and much more besides."
