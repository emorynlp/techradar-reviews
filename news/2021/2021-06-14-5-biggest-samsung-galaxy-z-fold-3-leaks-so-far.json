    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 could be one of the most exciting phones of the year, as Samsung\u2019s third-gen foldable is likely to be a polished, feature-packed handset, with none of the teething problems that initial foldables had.",
    "Of course, nothing is certain just yet, but a lot of things have been rumored, so we have a good idea of what to expect from the upcoming handset when it lands, likely in August alongside the cheaper Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Watch 4.",
    "Below, we\u2019ve highlighted the five biggest Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 leaks so far \u2013 these are mostly big or unexpected changes, and with one exception would all probably be good news too.",
    "The days of punch-hole selfie cameras are hopefully numbered, with under-display cameras likely to be the next big thing in smartphone camera tech. Already we\u2019ve seen the likes of the ZTE Axon 20 5G launch with such a snapper, but so far no big names have made the jump.",
    "That could change with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 though, as it\u2019s widely rumored that this will be the first Samsung phone to have an under-display selfie camera.",
    "That said, this camera might not be a perfected form of the tech, with a leak suggesting that there might be a visible mosaic pattern on the screen above the lens, and that photo quality might not be up to Samsung\u2019s usual standards.",
    "Still, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 likely won\u2019t be short of conventional cameras either, and a slight mosaic effect is probably better than a cut-out in the screen.",
    "Perhaps the thing we\u2019ve heard most about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it may support Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus. This is no real surprise given that the company has already launched the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra with stylus support, and is rumored not to be launching a new Galaxy Note this year.",
    "So we\u2019d say this is very likely, especially given how many different sources have pointed to it. Better yet, one leak suggests that there will be a slot in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 for the S Pen, which is something the S21 Ultra doesn\u2019t have \u2013 you have to buy a special case or risk losing the stylus.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is sure to be very expensive, there\u2019s no way around that. But it might at least be significantly cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 was.",
    "That\u2019s according to sources speaking to SamMobile, who claim that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 could be up to 20% cheaper than its predecessor, meaning it might start from around $1,600 / \u00a31,440 / AU$2,400. Still a lot of money then, but edging slightly closer to the price of a typical top-end smartphone.",
    "One less promising thing we\u2019ve heard about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is that it might have a smaller battery than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. That phone has a 4,500mAh battery, which already isn\u2019t especially big for a foldable phone, but according to one source the Z Fold 3 will have a 4,380mAh battery, while another leak suggests it could be even smaller at 4,275mAh.",
    "That might not mean the life is terrible. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 managed all-day life in our tests, and the Z Fold 3 might have slightly smaller screens and a more efficient chipset, so a lower capacity could go further.",
    "Still, it\u2019s not promising, and nor is the charging speed, which is rumored to be 25W \u2013 that\u2019s not slow, but it\u2019s well below what many premium phones now offer.",
    "One small but potentially very important upgrade that\u2019s been rumored is water resistance, with sources claiming that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 will have an IP rating.",
    "IP ratings are applied to products which have some amount of water and dust resistance, though exactly what rating and how much resistance the Z Fold 3 might have is unclear.",
    "Still, any amount would be an upgrade on the Galaxy Z Fold 2, and would also be desirable, since this is sure to be a very expensive phone, so you\u2019ll want it to be able to survive a splash, spill or bit of rain."
