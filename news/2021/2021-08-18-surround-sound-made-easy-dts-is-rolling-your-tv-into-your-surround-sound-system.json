    "DTS is about to make the process of buying a surround sound system easier on your wallet \u2013 and more convenient \u2013 with the introduction of DTS Play-Fi Home Theater.",
    "The technology, announced on Wednesday, lets you use your TV as the center of your surround sound system by pairing it up with any other DTS Play-Fi-enabled speakers.",
    "The only catch here is that your TV has to support DTS Play-Fi Home Theater \u2013 and those won\u2019t be rolling out for another few months.",
    "The benefit is that, once you have a DTS Play-Fi Home Theater TV, you\u2019ll be able to sync it up wirelessly with a Play-Fi enabled soundbar or discrete Play-Fi enabled front speakers as well as up to two Play-Fi enabled subwoofers. The whole system can then be grouped together and synced up to enhance the audio playback of your favorite shows or movies.",
    "The crux of the new technology is the desire to create a surround sound system using a TV and a bunch of DTS speakers \u2013 hence, why DTS developed DTS Play-Fi Home Theater.",
    "Once it rolls out everywhere, the tech will enable more folks to start a home theater system by buying one or two speakers at a time instead of a whole system \u2013 and remove the need to run any cables from an AV receiver to the speakers, which is something that can scare off any newcomers to the world of high-fidelity home theater setups.",
    "In some ways, it\u2019s very similar to what Sonos does with its lineup of speakers, which allow you to build up a multi-room setup over a number of years and has found real success with that strategy. That said, the difference is that Sonos typically makes its own speakers while DTS licenses out the technology to other manufacturers.",
    "Regardless, DTS\u2019s intent seems to focus on offering consumers a convenient way to dip their toes into surround sound audio without having to worry about wasting any single component. On paper, at least, it all sounds like a great idea."
