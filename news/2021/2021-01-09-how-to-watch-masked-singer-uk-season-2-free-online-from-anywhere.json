    "TV's greatest guessing game since Through the Keyhole is back for a second series, and though Ken Jeong has had to drop out because of travel restrictions, the show's producers have chosen a brilliant replacement in the comedian Mo Gilligan. Ready for some more utterly ludicrous costumed singing action? Our guide explains how to watch The Masked Singer season 2 for FREE in the UK - and also from other parts of the world.",
    "Gilligan will be joining regular panellists Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross and a hopefully regular-sized Rita Ora, rather than the terrifying giant AR version in *that* 5G ad.",
    "But enough about the panellists - let's talk characters. The series 2 lineup features a saveloy wrapped up in newspaper (Sausage), a hairy, heavily armed Viking, and what appears to be a grown-up version of Edgar the Dragon from last year's John Lewis ad, with a stack of glow-sticks strapped to his chest.",
    "Six of the 12 celebrity contestants will take to the stage in episode one, and one of them will be unmasked at the end of the show. Fingers crossed it's one of those big reveals that leaves everyone on the panel completely non-plussed. There really is nothing better.",
