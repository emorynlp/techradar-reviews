    "Cult San Francisco-based bag-maker Peak Design began life on Kickstarter, and quickly gained a massive fan following. And no wonder: it has some beautifully designed bags are extremely tech-friendly and can be customized to suit almost any purpose, and the company\u2019s clips and straps go a long way in making that happen.",
    "Every aspect of Peak Design bags are well thought-out \u2013 construction, material, functionality and usability. The bags are then tested thoroughly before they go into production. Every bag in the versatile Peak Design catalog can go from boardroom to holiday, with the ability to carry laptops, clothes or camera gear with just a few sturdy clips. We've tested a few and are big fans of the Peak Design Everyday Backpack and the Messenger is one of our favourite camera bags too.",
    "The bags aren\u2019t cheap, though, so for those who\u2019ve been lusting after a Peak Design carrier, a sale like Black Friday is the perfect time to snatch up a discount on an Everyday Backpack or an Everyday Messenger.",
    "The good news is that you don't need to wait till November 26 to grab a bargain \u2013 Peak Design's Black Friday sale is already up and running, with up to 30% off its Everyday bags \u2013 and will end on November 30. That gives you plenty of time to decide which bag or backpack suits you best, but don't dally as these are popular items that can disappear quite quickly."
