    "If you\u2019ve found Google Docs to be completely out of whack in the past few days, you\u2019re not alone, and we now know what\u2019s causing the problem. Luckily, the solution could be as simple as switching off your adblocker.",
    "Several users of Google Docs and Google Slides have had significant issues \u2013 ranging from botched text wrapping, where words seemingly ran off the document, to text overlapping, which left Docs and Slides illegible.",
    "Google Drive\u2019s product manager, Remy Burger, confirmed on Twitter that the problem was due to changes made by AdBlock and EasyList, adding that \u201cunfortunately it\u2019s out of our control\u201d.",
    "If you\u2019re using the AdBlock browser extension, or one that uses its blocklists, an easy workaround is to either whitelist Drive, Docs and Slides, or simply disable your ad blocker until a more permanent fix arrives.",
    "AdBlock later wrote on Twitter that it looked as though the problem stemmed from one of the primary filter lists on its service and that it was working on a fix.",
    "Later, it asked users to update their filter lists as a solution. On the company\u2019s Twitter account, AdBlock wrote \u201cfilter lists update automatically, but you can force it by going to filter lists > update now in the AdBlock menu.\u201d This can be found in the Advanced section of the adblocker's setting's pane.",
    "Other users have reported that using Docs and Slides in Incognito mode also solves the problem, though this is likely because the ad-blocking browser extension doesn\u2019t work while incognito.",
    "The issue also appears to mostly affect those using Chrome, so you can also try opening Google Docs or Slides in another web browser as a quick fix."
