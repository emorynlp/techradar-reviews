    "There\u2019s evidence that a number of companies might launch phones with under-display selfie cameras soon, and it now looks like Google could be among them. While we wouldn\u2019t expect this feature on the Google Pixel 6, a patent for such a system makes us a think it might be ready in time for the Pixel 7 or the rumored Pixel Fold.",
    "The patent \u2013 spotted by LetsGoDigital \u2013 is for a 'full-screen display with sub-display camera', but the system used is a bit different to what we\u2019ve seen on patents from other companies, or on the ZTE Axon 20 5G, which has already launched with an under-display camera.",
    "In most cases, the selfie camera is positioned in a similar way to punch-hole selfie cameras, just with a tiny secondary display panel over the top, so it can be hidden when not in use. Here though, the selfie camera lens doesn\u2019t actually point towards you.",
    "Instead, the display has a little \u2018window\u2019 in it, with a mirror underneath. The selfie camera is to one side of that mirror, while a tiny secondary screen is at the other side.",
    "When the selfie camera is in use, the mirror allows the lens to collect the required light, and when it\u2019s not, the mirror rotates and reflects content from the secondary screen onto the window in the main display. It\u2019s a complicated system to describe, but the images below may make it clearer.",
    "Both the main and secondary screens are OLED panels with the same pixel density, so they should allow for a seamless viewing experience. Yet it\u2019s not entirely clear what this complicated setup achieves. Perhaps it makes the selfie camera truly invisible \u2013 something which the ZTE Axon 20 5G failed to do, but that\u2019s just speculation for now.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that just because Google has patented this idea, it doesn\u2019t mean the company will ever use it in a phone. But it seems like under-display cameras could be one of the next big things in smartphones, so we\u2019d think it\u2019s likely to.",
    "Given that we\u2019ve seen leaked images of the Google Pixel 6 range with a visible selfie camera, it\u2019s very unlikely that the feature will be included there, but as noted above we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s used in the Pixel 7 or the Pixel Fold."
