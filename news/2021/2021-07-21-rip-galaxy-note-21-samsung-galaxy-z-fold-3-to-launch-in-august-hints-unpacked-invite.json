  "article": [
    "The next Samsung Unpacked event is officially happening on August 11, the company has confirmed, with a virtual event starting at 10am EDT / 7am PDT / 3pm BST (or 12pm August 12 in AEST).",
    "Customers can also reserve Samsung\u2019s next flagship phone via its Reserve Now site, though the company hasn\u2019t said what the phone is. Rumors point to the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, though the company could be liberally using the word \u2018phone\u2019 and refer to the foldable Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, also hinted to be coming at the event.",
    "In fact, Samsung hasn\u2019t confirmed anything that\u2019s rumored to be coming at the event, so we\u2019re left to speculate. Of course, we\u2019ve got months of rumors and leaks to back up our expectations for what could be revealed at the biggest multi-device launch event since the Samsung Galaxy S21 range was unveiled in January.",
    "That leaves us wondering what will be revealed at Samsung Unpacked, which promises to be a banner event for the company's devices.",
    "We're expecting the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 to be the centerpiece of the show, a teaser suggested, though that may not be it for foldables - there are also rumors that the clamshell foldable Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is slated for a late 2021 launch date, suggesting it could be showcased at the event, too.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is also heavily rumored to appear at the event, though reports disagree on whether we'll see the more affordable flagship Samsung Galaxy S21 FE launch during Unpacked, too.",
    "Given Samsung's preorder hint, we're guessing it'll be that phone over the Samsung Galaxy Note 21, given all the rumors of the latter's cancellation."
