    "Brazil's Jefinho - known as the Paralympic Pele - is a star to watch out for. Though perhaps the biggest of them all is 13-time champ Jessica Long, an irresistible force in the pool for the US.",
    "China has topped the medal table at five consecutive Paralympics, but the gap between the best and the rest is getting steadily narrower, with Great Britain, Ukraine, Australia and the US looking to finally halt that streak.",

    "Without wishing to state the obvious, the Paralympic Games is a huge global event, and there should be a way to watch no matter where you find yourself during the gold-frenzy fortnight. But if you're abroad and struggling to see it - or if you just want the comfort and language of your home nation's coverage - then geo-restrictons may stand in your way of getting an Paralympics live stream in 2021.",
    "But there's a really easy way around that problem. By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home.

    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to All4",
    "Remember, VPNs aren't just about watching sport (or other TV shows when you're overseas). They also provide a handy layer of extra anonymity and security to your everyday life online, and can help you get around blocks websites, apps and services when you're in countries (or schools or offices) that have more stringent web rules, such as China, Cuba or the Middle East.",
    "Adding to the hundreds of events, there are two new sports added to the Paralympics schedule athletes can compete for. Badminton and taekwondo both debuted on September 1 and 2 respectively.",

    "As was the case at the Olympics, spectators will not be allowed to attend Paralympics events in the Japanese capital. That's because Covid-19 is still spreading rapidly in Tokyo, with mid-August seeing record numbers of serious cases.",
    "For the first time since 1964, Tokyo is the host city for the Paralympic Games.",
    "The '64 Paralympics was the second ever iteration of the event, comprising just nine sports. Great Britain topped the medal table with 18 golds.",
    "The Olympic Stadium in in Kasumigaoka, Shinjuku, is the centre of Tokyo 2020, and will host the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the athletics, but many of the events will be held elsewhere.",
    "When the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games was postponed last summer, an International Olympic Committee member said that a further postponement would have a knock on effect to the next Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics, which are both set to take place in Beijing, in February and March 2022.",
    "Things can change quickly, but it's growing increasingly likely that the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics will go ahead as originally planned.",
