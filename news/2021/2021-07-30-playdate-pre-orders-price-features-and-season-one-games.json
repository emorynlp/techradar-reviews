  "article": [
    "Update: Playdate pre-orders are still available, but shipments from here on out will arrive in 2022, according to the official website. Details below.",
    "The Playdate is a curious little thing. Created by video game publisher Panic, this delightfully retro handheld evokes a Game Boy-like aesthetic from both a hardware and software standpoint, while also offering modern conveniences like Wi-Fi connectivity and USB-C charging.",
    "It comes as a nice surprise and, hopefully, a worthwhile alternative to two upcoming handheld giants, those being the Nintendo Switch OLED and the Steam Deck \u2013 the former being an arguably minuscule upgrade to aging hardware, while the latter boasts impressive specs and Steam library portability at a relatively high price.",
    "The Playdate, then, might be something that\u2019s genuinely refreshing in the handheld space. It\u2019s more affordable than both the Steam Deck and Switch OLED, and comes with its own suite of tailor-made games. Interested? Read on to find out how you can pre-order the Playdate for yourself, as well as what to expect on the device, and when you can finally play it.",
    "Pre-orders for the Playdate handheld console opened on Panic's very own website on Thursday, July 29 at 10am PDT / 1pm EDT / 6pm BST.",
    "The initial cost is $179 (around \u00a3129 / AU$239) before shipping and, for that price, you\u2019ll get the console and access to 24 games as part of \u2018Season One\u2019 of the Playdate\u2019s library.",
    "You can also pre-order the Playdate Cover for $29 (around \u00a319 / AU$39). This clamshell-like cover folds over your PlayDate, and secures itself magnetically to the device, allowing you to protect your screen more efficiently.",
    "If you're just now catching onto the Playdate, mark your calendar for 2022. The late 2021 shipments for the console \u2013 some 20,000 units for 2021 says Playdate maker Panic \u2013 have given way to a 2022 delivery date.",
    "There\u2019s no word as of yet on the Playdate\u2019s official launch date, but it\u2019s expected to release sometime in 2021. With the Nintendo Switch OLED launching this October, though, Panic might want to get its handheld out there before Nintendo\u2019s mid-gen upgrade hits the market.",
    "A stereo dock is also in development for the Playdate, though no price or release date has been announced for it just yet. The dock will be able to charge your console and acts as a Bluetooth speaker and pen holder. Yes, really.",
    "On its website, Panic notes the Playdate is \u201cfamiliar,\u201d but insists that it\u2019s \u201cunlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d It may well be right about that, as the handheld certainly has an odd build, and some strangely unique features, too.",
    "Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s most important first, though: that lovely-looking 2.7-inch reflective monochrome screen. If that sounds a little on the smaller side, that\u2019s because it is. The Playdate is a tiny device, but much like Nintendo\u2019s oft-forgotten Game Boy Micro, games are sure to look remarkably sharp and clear on such a bespoke screen.",
    "In terms of controls, the Playdate features a simple D-Pad and two face buttons. There\u2019s a menu button located above the speaker and next to the screen, which may also be used to pause games or activate other ancillary features like putting the system to sleep.",
    "What sticks out the most though \u2013 literally \u2013 has to be the crank on the side of the Playdate. This crank folds outward and can be manipulated as a control method for certain games. It\u2019s easily mistaken as one of those kinetic charging functions \u2013 one that would let you charge up the battery by cranking the mechanism \u2013 but Playdate\u2019s website insists that isn\u2019t the case.",
    "Now onto the really interesting stuff. As mentioned, purchasing the Playdate will grant you access to 24 games, to be released on a consistent schedule of two games per week. You don\u2019t have to pay anything extra to access the games, and they\u2019ll be added to the system automatically each week.",
    "The Playdate website states that this is just the first season of games, too, with more planned in the future: \u201cWe\u2019re lining up more games, and we\u2019re working on cool ways to distribute them.\u201d",
    "Here's the list of currently confirmed season one games:",
    "If you\u2019re the creative type, the Playdate could be a perfect match for you, too. The Playdate SDK will be made available for free sometime after launch. When paired with Playdate\u2019s browser-based Pulp game maker, you\u2019ll be able to develop and test your own Playdate games and side-load them directly onto the console.",
    "We\u2019re definitely impressed with what we\u2019ve seen so far with the Playdate handheld console. There\u2019s a ton of handhelds out there that are just shoddily made, but we don\u2019t get that impression from the Playdate. The console looks sleek and professionally made, and we love its distribution model featuring entirely unique games released on a regular basis.",
