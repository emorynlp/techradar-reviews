  "article": [
    "It's not just cheap appliances you'll want to be looking out for in this weekend's Memorial Day sales, there are also great iPhone deals to be had - especially over at Verizon.",
    "Take the still-amazing iPhone 11 for example. iPhone deals on this great flagship are pretty rare at big red but right now you can score a free additional device when you purchase the first with a new plan. Before you ask, yes - we have seen this particular promo before on a range of devices, the iPhone 12 included, but it's been literally ages since it's been available on the 11. The iPhone 11 is $100 cheaper than the 12-series from the offset, so the barrier of entry is pretty low here as well.",
    "Speaking of the 12-series, however, there are also some fantastic Verizon iPhone deals to check out in this weekend's Memorial Day sales for those devices too. The standard iPhone 12 can be picked up with either that same buy-one get-one promo, or potentially for free with an eligible trade-in and new plan. Switching over? You'll also score an additional $200 on either of those deals - which can be used to pay off your plan bills, very handy.",
    "And, we've also thrown in an additional wild-card Verizon iPhone deal to check out this weekend on the iPhone 12 Mini. This device is going for completely free right now for those porting their number over to big red. Is it a niche promo? For sure, but if you're making the switch then you're really in luck here.",
