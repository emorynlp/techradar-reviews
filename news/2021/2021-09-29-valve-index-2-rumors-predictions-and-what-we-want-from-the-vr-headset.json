  "article": [
    "Right now, finding the best VR headset is hard. This isn\u2019t like choosing a new phone or headphones \u2013 there aren\u2019t many options available. But the Valve Index virtual reality headset is hands-down one of the top VR headsets you can buy today \u2013 and one of the best VR experiences you can get at home.",
    "With the success it\u2019s seen in the VR space since it was first launched in 2019, it\u2019s a safe bet that a follow-up Valve Index 2 headset could already be in development. There\u2019s been no verified confirmation yet. However, we\u2019re already seeing hints of what it could contain ahead of an official unveiling. For example, it might be a wireless, standalone VR headset, like the Oculus Quest \u2013 and there's mounting evidence that Valve is quietly iterating on its next VR product.",
    "According to official figures at the time of writing, more than 16% of all Steam VR users own a Valve Index. That makes it the third most used VR headset right now behind the Oculus Quest and Quest 2. With that kind of success, we\u2019d expect Valve will want to come back for more with a follow-up that improves on the already brilliant original. But given the original Valve Index is only two years old, we might have to wait a while.",
    "Keep reading to find out everything we currently know about Valve\u2019s future VR plans, as well as what we\u2019d want to see from a Valve Index 2.",
    "There is currently no official information as to when the Valve Index 2 could be released, so guesses are just stabs in the dark right now. We do know the original Valve Index came out in 2019, so given that other headset iterations have taken at least two years we could expect an announcement later this year.",
    "However, thanks to disruptions caused by Covid-19 in 2020, it\u2019s more likely that an announcement would come in 2022 or later. A release date next year also feels like the best we could hope for.",
    "Once again there isn\u2019t anything solid about how much a Valve Index 2 would cost but we can make some educated guesses. Given that the Valve Index was priced at $999 / \u00a3919 (about AU$1,425), we\u2019d expect an improved headset to cost at least as much - though we wouldn\u2019t say no to a price drop if possible.",
    "We also know that the Oculus Quest 2 and Oculus Rift S - both much cheaper VR options - are the most popular headsets on Steam. Their collective 43% share of the market is one Valve likely wants to eat into, so we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it release a budget competitor.",
    "This could mean that Valve will release two separate headsets \u2013 one targeting the high-end, one a more accessible all-in-one mobile device. But while rumors suggest that isn\u2019t out of the question, we won\u2019t know what it is planning until an official announcement.",
    "Here is where we start to build a picture of what the Valve Index 2 and other Valve VR products could look like, based on patents and some SteamVR files that appear to reference a standalone VR headset.",
    "Wireless capabilities",
    "Patents filed in early 2021 show that the Valve Index 2 could be wireless, with wired capabilities becoming optional for some version of the headset. The patent shows three different headsets that explore different options between being wireless and standalone (like the Oculus Quest 2), or wirelessly connecting to a PC.",
    "The patent also details new comfort options, such as new methods for distributing heat and weight more effectively for each design of VR headset.",
    "With all patents we have to take the information with a pinch of salt \u2013 there\u2019s no guarantee that it means Valve will produce a headset with these features \u2013 but it shows that the company is continuing to develop VR tech.",
    "Evidence of an in-development model",
    "The latest rumors come from VR reporter and YouTuber Brad Lynch, who was tipped off as to 'Deckard' codename in some public SteamVR files, which seems to refer to an in-development VR headset at Valve.",
    "Lynch points VR fans towards \"a Lighthouse driver file\" that cites a \"Deckard POC-A\" device in a file released back in January, with POC likely referring to 'proof of concept' \u2013 and a \"POC-C\" model cited in June documentation instead, suggesting Valve has been working on refined iterations of its device over the past six months, and ensuring SteamVR stays up to date with supporting it.",
    "There are other tidbits to dive into in Lynch's video, including a mysterious 'Prism' function and a VR Link file that points to a Wi-Fi 6 connection for a wireless headset \u2013 alongside VR headset patents we reported on back in March.",
    "While the Valve Index is a fantastic VR headset, it\u2019s by no means perfect. Here are a few areas we\u2019d like to see improved in a Valve Index 2.",
    "Better game selection \u2013 straight from Valve\u2019s teams",
    "While this isn\u2019t a direct issue with the last Valve Index headset, games are nonetheless an important factor for all gaming hardware. There are some fantastic VR games out there like Valve\u2019s own Half-Life: Alyx, but a platform can\u2019t be built on just a couple of titles.",
    "If Valve wants to commit to VR we don\u2019t just want to see a brilliant device, but we want them to make more games to play on it. Be that a Half-Life: Alyx sequel, a VR adaptation of another IP like Portal, or a completely new IP from the studio. The quality of the games will also be important, but a bit more quantity wouldn\u2019t go amiss.",
    "In an interview with us the Half-life Alyx Robin Walker director mentioned wanting to make an XCOM VR game - so maybe we could have something like that to look forward to?",
    "Hand tracking",
    "Facebook recently unveiled its plans for a controller-less AR experience using hand tracking, and we\u2019d like to see similar tech come to VR too. The hand tracking looks like it was ripped straight out of a sci-fi world and we\u2019d love to see something like it be introduced in every VR headset going forward.",
    "While it\u2019s more likely that we\u2019d see it in future Oculus devices - such as the rumored Oculus Quest 3 - Valve could be developing their own version of the tech for a future headset.",
    "No more base stations",
    "Base stations are devices that help the Valve Index, and other headsets like the HTC Vive, track users, their headset and their controller in a room-scale virtual environment. While they made the headset perform well in our review, we hope that a Valve Index 2 would drop them.",
    "Base stations aren\u2019t the worst things in the world, but if you ever want to change up your room - or just dust it and you nudge one of the sensors - you have to go through the whole recalibration process again. It\u2019s tedious and we could do without having to put up with them, especially as other headsets like the Oculus Rift S do fine without base stations.",
    "Higher-resolution screen",
    "The Valve Index used two screens that have 1440 x 1600 pixels - one for each eye. While the image is ultra-crisp, better screens wouldn\u2019t be unexpected, especially given that the Apple VR headset is rumored to be using dual-8K screens - that\u2019s 7680 x 4320 pixels.",
    "We feel like 8K is a bit overkill, but there\u2019s a nice sweet spot between that and what we currently have which would be nice to see on a Valve Index 2.",
    "Customizable headset size",
    "All people are made differently, so a one size fits all headset is difficult to pull off and make comfortable. With that in mind, we\u2019d like Valve to go deeper into the ergonomics of a Valve Index 2, adding new straps and features to make it more customizable. This would let everyone tweak the headset to their needs, and make sure more VR experiences can be enjoyed.",
    "More Haptics",
    "The Valve Index\u2019s controllers included some haptic feedback and clever designs to make the virtual world feel more realistic. Though while it\u2019s good we\u2019d like to see it go further in the future.",
    "Apple has patented haptic socks that could be compatible with its VR and AR devices so we know that some companies are already thinking about this stuff. A few extra haptic peripherals for the Valve Index 2 could be an awesome way to dial the realism of VR up to 11."
