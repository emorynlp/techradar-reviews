    "Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has expressed confidence in Halo Infinite but says it\u2019s not a \u201cmake or break\u201d title in terms of the future of the Xbox franchise.",
    "When asked how much is riding on Halo Infinite in terms of the future of the franchise during a recent episode of IGN\u2019s Unlocked podcast, Spencer responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think about it that way. Like the future of the franchise, I think, Halo will be here ten years from now. Is Infinite the lynchpin on whether it survives that long? Absolutely not.\u201c",
    "\u201cThe game has such a rabid fanbase and such a history and lore that it\u2019s just an IP that\u2019s going to be with us. We don\u2019t take that for granted, but I definitely believe in my core that that is true.\u201d",
    "That\u2019s not to say that Spencer is apprehensive about Halo Infinite. In fact, he seems confident in its success and said he was happy with the reception the game\u2019s multiplayer received during the E3 2021 showcase. He is clearly reluctant, however, to put too much pressure on the team at 343 Industries, adding, \u201cI never want to put a team in a position where they feel, \u2018hey this one\u2019s got to land or who knows\u2019.\u201d",
    "\u201cI'm not one of these dire prediction people,\u201d Spencer continues, \u201cI think game teams, whether it\u2019s our teams or any team out there, they put enough pressure on themselves in delivering for customers and when you\u2019re on a franchise that\u2019s as big as Halo with such focus on every step and every word that\u2019s said. I trust the team, I trust the progress they\u2019re making, and I have confidence in Halo infinite and I think that\u2019s all that needs to be said there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a make or break, I just don\u2019t believe that.\u201d",
    "Spencer, who says in the interview that he\u2019s been testing Halo Infinite \u201conce a month\u201d, praised the game\u2019s Arena experience and placed creating and perfecting \u201ca really great Halo multiplayer experience\u201d above things like re-imagining multiplayer or adding a battle royale mode. \u201cIf you don't get that right,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don't get permission to do anything else.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith a lot of the innovations and evolutions that have happened in FPS multiplayer over the years, there was something very pure about coming back to a Halo Arena experience and how clean it was and how tight the gameplay loop was...Right now on our platform there are not a lot of games that are going back to that tried and true formula and perfecting what they have, and I think that's what the goal of this team is.\u201d",
    "Since the game\u2019s multiplayer reveal, we\u2019ve heard a little more about how its seasons will be structured and the team\u2019s aim of creating a \u201cplayer-first\u201d battle pass via a Halo Waypoint blog post. In terms of modes, Spencer teased the team \u201cis going to do more. I don\u2019t want to say there\u2019s one multiplayer mode\u201d but he couldn\u2019t be drawn on revealing any more.",
    "As far as a release date is concerned, Spencer reiterated what he said last week, confirming that the game is on track for its Holiday 2021 window but that they\u2019re \u201cnot quite there on the exact day.\u201d That, he said, is the \u201cnext thing\u201d and added we\u2019ll hear more about the exact release date in the \u201cnot too distant future\u201d."
