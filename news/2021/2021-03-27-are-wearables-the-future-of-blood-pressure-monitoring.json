  "article": [
    "It\u2019s estimated that one in four men and one in five women around the world have high blood pressure, known as hypertension. This can put them at a higher risk of heart attack and stroke.",
    "There are symptoms of hypertension, including headaches and vision changes, but many people don\u2019t have any, which means diagnosis and treatment is often left too late. This is why it\u2019s crucial that everyone has their blood pressure measured regularly \u2013 especially those who are high risk.",
    "The standard way to detect hypertension is to use a blood pressure monitor cuff or, more officially, a sphygmomanometer. This is a cuff that\u2019s attached to a small device with a screen. The cuff is worn on your upper arm and tightens to restrict bloodflow. This allows pressure sensors inside to measure the strength with which your blood pushes on your arteries as it\u2019s pumped around your body \u2013 your blood pressure.",
    "This method is relatively easy and accurate, so why do we need new solutions?",
    "Experts recommend people with hypertension measure their blood pressure twice a day. But a 2020 survey from wearable sensor company Valencell found that 31 per cent of US adults with hypertension measure their blood pressure only once a month, another 31 per cent admit to measuring it once a year. This could be because patients forget, don\u2019t have the equipment they need at hand or there\u2019s a lack of resources.",
    "\u201cWe often don\u2019t have time or ability to perform perfectly accurate blood pressure readings or frequent blood pressure readings,\u201d says Dr Jordana Cohen, an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in hypertension research.",
    "For example, if a patient starts a new medication they\u2019d ideally need to take multiple readings on the same day and over the next few days to assess how they respond \u2013 but this often isn\u2019t possible.",
    "Dr Cohen explains there are also a number of specific conditions to consider that make traditional blood pressure monitoring imperfect. These include white coat hypertension, which is when someone\u2019s blood pressures are elevated around doctors, but not at home. Masked hypertension, when readings might be fine in a doctor\u2019s office but elevated at home. Or nocturnal hypertension, which is when blood pressures are elevated while sleeping.",
    "You could buy one of the standard cuff blood pressure monitors for use at home. This is the reality for many people currently living with hypertension and there are a range of options available to buy, like the top-performing Omron Evolv ($89.99 / \u00a396.02, about AU$120).",
    "Those with ongoing hypertension might also need what\u2019s called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). This is when a doctor provides them with a portable blood pressure monitor with a cuff throughout the day. The cuff takes a reading every half an hour or so and stores them for later.",
    "But cuff blood pressure monitoring, whether in a health setting or at home, isn\u2019t convenient for many reasons: it can\u2019t be taken at night, might elevate blood pressure levels when the cuff inflates and could be difficult to wear during the day for those who work, are on-the-move, disabled people or older adults.",
    "This is why wearable tech companies are developing methods that could make a reading as simple and unobtrusive as wearing a fitness tracker-style device on your wrist that takes measurements throughout the day \u2013 less stress, no cuff.",
    "Dr Ghalib Janjua, a lecturer in electronic and electrical engineering at Robert Gordon University who specializes in bioengineering and cuffless blood pressure monitoring, tells me there are already a number of cuffless monitoring solutions being researched and developed. These use a number of different metrics, including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity.",
    "However, Dr Janjua warns: \u201cthese are all limited in accuracy and require frequent calibration against the sphygmomanometer devices.\u201d This means that athough some devices are able to take cuffless readings right now, you also need a device with a cuff \u2013 a sphygmomanometer device \u2013 to check their accuracy regularly.",
    "Only recently have some of these methods been developed in ways that make cuffless blood pressure monitoring a viable option for us all to carry out at home. Most of these make use of the PPG (that\u2019s photoplethysmography) sensor you can find on the underside of an Apple Watch or Fitbit Versa that\u2019s usually used to track heart rate. But it can also take optical readings of your arteries to estimate blood pressure.",
    "Search Amazon and you\u2019ll find a number of different wearables and fitness trackers that claim to be able to use a PPG sensor to track your blood pressure. However, many of these are estimations and aren\u2019t certified medical devices but instead lifestyle wearables aimed at building a general picture of your overall health \u2013 not diagnosing serious problems. But all that could soon change.",
    "One significant example of this technology stepping up comes from a recent update to the Samsung Health Monitor app. This now allows you to use the PPG sensor already in your Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 or Galaxy Watch Active to take a blood pressure reading.",
    "This is a spot check, which means you decide when you want to take one \u2013 it doesn\u2019t happen automatically like tracking your heart rate. Although this does need to be checked against a cuff reading every so often.",
    "There have been lots of rumours that other wearable brands, including Fitbit and Apple, might soon introduce similar features. This could mean using data from PPG sensors, like Samsung, or using similar pressure sensor technology found in a blood monitor cuff. For example, in 2020 Apple registered a patent that described how to measure blood pressure using pressure sensors in the wristband of a wearable.",
    "It\u2019s also worth knowing that cuff-based blood pressure measuring has had a wearable upgrade. Take the Omron HeartGuide as a best-in-class example. This does use a cuff, it\u2019s just very small and within the strap of a fairly slim wearable, which makes it look like a smartwatch. At $499/\u00a3499 (about AU$650), the cost of this device is quite prohibitive, but it\u2019s from top health tech company Omron and can provide accurate, on-the-spot blood pressure readings when you ask it to.",
    "Aktiia is a new addition to the wearable blood pressure monitoring space (it\u2019s available to pre-order now for \u00a3159.99 in the UK with international availability coming soon). This is a cuffless device that\u2019s worn around your wrist.",
    "We\u2019ve had a hands-on with a sample unit of the Aktiia and can confirm it\u2019s even slimmer than a fitness tracker and more comfortable too \u2013 the big difference is it doesn\u2019t have a screen. I love seeing data in real-time, but understand why a more subtle approach is not only more appealing for a wider audience but lessens the anxiety some people feel when thinking about and taking their blood pressure.",
    "Aktiia takes a blood pressure reading around every 90 minutes during the day and throughout the night using a PPG sensor. The results are then sent to your phone, where you can look at them. You do need a cuff for initial set-up \u2013 this comes in the box with the Aktiia \u2013 to ensure everything is working correctly, but the idea is you\u2019d rarely need one to \u2018check\u2019 Aktiia\u2019s readings after that.",
    "We know that devices with a cuff work by constricting blood flow in order to analyse the pulse that travels along your arteries. Aktiia\u2019s technology does the same thing \u2013 but without the cuff.",
    "\u201cOur technology also analyses pulse waves traveling along the arteries to generate estimations of blood pressure,\u201d Dr Josep Sola, founder and CTO of Aktiia tells me. \u201cBut instead of using pressure sensors, Aktiia's algorithms leverage optical sensors that analyse the changing diameter of the arteries at the wrist.\u201d",
    "One of the main benefits of Aktiia is that readings are taken continuously. This means there\u2019s no worrying about your readings, which might cause blood pressure levels to elevate. You don\u2019t need to press a button, sit still or even be awake for it to work.",
    "\u201cIt helps physicians make a more accurate diagnosis, provide more tailored treatment plans and evaluate the efficacy of therapy,\u201d Dr Sola tells me. He also explains 24/7 measuring can give people real-time insights into the impact what they eat, how often they work out, how well they sleep and how they manage stress has on their blood pressure.",
    "Aktiia has big ambitions. \u201cAktiia\u2019s goal is to help 100 million people over the next 10 years better understand and manage their blood pressure,\u201d Dr Sola tells me. Although the primary goal is selling people a new device, the data it collects could have a bigger, positive impact. \u201cWe are building the largest, longitudinal, 24/7 blood pressure dataset in the world, which will enable significant improvements to the current standard of care, including diagnosis, treatment and monitoring,\u201d Dr Sola says.",
    "What\u2019s more, Aktiia\u2019s tech might soon be used more widely. Although no details are concrete yet, Dr Sola tells me the team is in talks to bring its software and services to more third-party wearables.",
    "The future is promising for Aktiia. It\u2019s now officially classed as a medical device, which means it meets health and safety standards in Europe.",
    "But the big question concerning not only Aktiia, but every cuffless blood pressure monitoring device in development is: how accurate are they?",
    "\u201cAktiia and all existing cuff-based blood pressure monitors generate estimations of blood pressure, instead of directly measuring it,\u201d says Dr Sola.",
    "However, devices designed to be worn on your wrist could present problems. The American Heart Association currently only recommends that blood pressure readings are taken from the upper arm. Other places, like your wrist or your finger, it claims, might not be as accurate.",
    "\u201cIn clinical settings, blood pressure is measured whilst the subject is in a stationary seated posture, which keeps the blood pressure constant in the brachial artery,\u201d Dr Janjua explains. \u201cIn the wearable device, the signal is acquired at the radial artery at the wrist and/or finger location, which is lower than the heart level and can result in hydrostatic variation. These variations cause poor blood pressure estimation.\u201d",
    "A blood pressure monitor you wear might feel more convenient and allow you to collect more readings, but taking these measurements from your wrist could mean they\u2019re not as accurate.",
    "What\u2019s more, cuffless monitors might already be at a disadvantage. \u201cWithout the cuff, many assumptions need to be made by device algorithms to try to estimate what the results of using a cuff might have shown,\u201d says Dr Jordana Cohen.",
    "\u201cWhile upcoming technologies may be able to eventually overcome this challenge, we need careful studies to be performed to ensure that they are consistently valid in a wide range of patients, using appropriate and rigorous methods that are developed by experts in this area,\u201d says Dr Jordana Cohen. \u201cIncluding those who do not stand to profit from sales of these devices.\u201d",
    "The answer? More testing, more data collection and more validation. There are lots of different international organizations that determine whether a device can be used to accurately assess blood pressure and they will all need to be shown that cuffless, wearable devices are as accurate as they claim. This might happen soon, but patience and precision is important.",
    "\u201cWhile these may prove to be an exciting and helpful new way to monitor blood pressure in the future, we need to be mindful of the dangers of acting on blood pressure readings that could be highly inaccurate,\u201d says Dr Cohen. \u201cPeople\u2019s hypertension can end up significantly over- or under-treated, potentially resulting in serious harm.\u201d",
    "Could these technologies take over cuff-based blood pressure monitoring? The experts I spoke to were both hopeful yet cautious. \u201cThis is the beginning of a modernization of century old technology,\u201d Dr Janjua says. \u201cIt\u2019s an area which is showing encouraging results.\u201d",
    "Home solutions address accuracy concerns by encouraging people to check readings on both a cuffless and cuff-based device. But expecting people to own and use two separate methods feels more inaccessible, not less.",
    "So don\u2019t throw away your cuff-based blood pressure monitor just yet. But we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more Aktiia devices in the not-so-distant future, as well as more blood pressure monitoring smarts coming to a wearable near you."
