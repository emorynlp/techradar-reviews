    "It\u2019s been a while since the last good zombie movie, hasn\u2019t it? Not too long ago, television was up to its neck in infected creepers, but Disney\u2019s own horde of sci-fi and superhero movies have since hoovered up audience figures and left the undead, well, dead. Aside from the occasional masterpiece like One Cut of the Dead, of course.",
    "It\u2019s fitting, then, that Zack Snyder should be the one to stoke the fires of renaissance for the zombie genre. Fresh off the re-release of his own superhero movie, Justice League, the director\u2019s Army of the Dead arrives on Netflix this weekend to get the gore going again.",
    "That\u2019s not all there is to watch, though. The likes of Amazon Prime, HBO Max and Disney Plus are all getting exciting new additions over the next few days. Below, we round up seven of the biggest highlights \u2013 from gritty crime dramas to star-studded anthologies. We'll explain how to watch each in the US and the UK.",
    "After a tumultuous few years for the director, Zack Snyder deserves a win. Thankfully, Army of the Dead is a big one. A bombastic casino heist thriller set in a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas, the movie arrives on Netflix to add some much needed zombie-killing madness to the streamer.",
    "As chaotic as it might seem, though, Army of the Dead is also the best showcase of the director\u2019s distinct style to date. His trademark slow-motion shots, gratuitous violence and classic rock song-sequences have never worked so well as they do here \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty damn funny, too.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "A new Marvel show debuting on Hulu? Bet you didn\u2019t see that one coming. In fairness, it\u2019s probably unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before from the superhero treasure trove.",
    "Marvel\u2019s MODOK follows the adventures of an egomaniacal supervillain struggling to maintain control of his evil organization. It\u2019s a stop-motion adult comedy, so don\u2019t expect the Avengers to show up, but this Patton Oswalt-led series is based on a fairly notable Marvel Comics character of the same name.",
    "Now available to stream on Hulu in the US and Disney Plus in the UK",
    "If nothing else, Amazon\u2019s new seven-episode anthology series looks promising because of its cast. Solos features performances from \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Anne Hathaway, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Anthony Mackie, Constance Wu and Dan Stevens, to name just a few stars on the cast list.",
    "From the mind of David Weil (Hunters), the series aims to explore \"the deeper meaning of human connection\" with stories involving time travel, smart homes, memory transplants, artificial intelligence and plenty more sci-fi subjects.",
    "Smart homes? Sounds right up our street, to be honest.",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video",
    "You think Solos has star power? The Me You Can\u2019t See features the likes of Oprah, Prince Harry, Glenn Close and Lady Gaga.",
    "In all seriousness, though, this new Apple TV Plus docuseries sees some of the world\u2019s biggest stars open up about their struggles with mental health. Asif Kapadia, the man behind the award-winning documentaries Amy and Senna, directs, and Winfrey herself produces.",
    "Expect talking heads, tears and a few lessons in self-worth.",
    "Now available to stream on Apple TV Plus",
    "Season 4 of the excellent Italian crime series, Gomorrah, lands on HBO Max this weekend. Based on Roberto Saviano's book of the same name, the show follows the dirty dealings of the Neapolitan mafia as they push pills and crack skulls. But who doesn\u2019t, right?",
    "It\u2019s bounced around a fair few streaming services since beginning in 2014, but Gomorrah has lived on HBO Max since January 2021, and season 4 arrives to continue the misadventures of the Savastano clan. UK viewers can already watch it on Sky.",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max",
    "In keeping with Disney\u2019s fondness for going behind-the-scenes of its most famous properties, Inside Pixar: Unpacked continues on Disney Plus this weekend to offer a closer look at the animator\u2019s iconic villains, cars and side characters.",
    "All five new episodes are directed by either Erica Milsom and Tony Kaplan, Pixar\u2019s in-house documentarians, and offer viewers exclusive access to the studio\u2019s filmmakers, creative processes and shiny California headquarters.",
    "Now available to stream on Disney Plus",
    "The Emmy Award-winning Master of None returns to Netflix after a four-year hiatus this weekend, chronicling the intricate relationship between Denise (Lena Waithe) and her partner Alicia (Naomi Ackie). Series co-creator Aziz Ansari also returns to direct (and reportedly cameo), with critics praising the show\u2019s faithful portrait of marital struggles, infertility and fidelity.",
    "Plaudits have rained upon Ackie, in particular, for her commanding portrayal of Alicia \u2013 which is promising news for her forthcoming turn as Whitney Houston in the anticipated biopic, I Wanna Dance with Somebody.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix"
