    "Nespresso machines are some of the best coffee makers around but for me, the coffee is just never quite hot enough. Normally when you make a coffee, you\u2019re programed into giving it five minutes or so to cool down before you take that first sip, but every time I do that with my Nespresso coffee, I\u2019ve left it too late and my drink is on the cool side.",
    "There is science behind the temperature of Nespresso coffee though, and that\u2019s because the brand claims it\u2019s just the right temperature for the coffee to be brewed properly without burning the coffee grounds, which can leave you with a nasty bitter taste.",
    "So, is there a way to make Nespresso hotter, and how do you do it? Well, in my quest to not have to drink my coffee within seconds of brewing it, I discovered the easiest Nespresso hack that is a complete game-changer.",
    "There\u2019s a whole army of Nespresso buffs on YouTube that devote their days to testing out machines, but A2B Productions filmed a video with a tip so ridiculously easy, we don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t try it before.",
    "If you want hotter Nespresso drinks, all you need to do is make sure there are no pods in the machine and that there\u2019s plenty of water in the reservoir. Then, take a mug and place it on the cup holder before switching on the machine so that it runs hot water through the machine.",
    "Running the hot water cycle first gives the machine longer to heat up and increases the temperature of the brew you make after \u2013 something you might have noticed if you make two coffees in a row. We tried this handy hack and it works, every time.",
    "Of course, there are drawbacks and that\u2019s because you essentially have to wait the time it takes for the water to run through the machine before you can actually start making the coffee you\u2019re going to drink. Plus, this simple little trick only works if you have one of Nespresso\u2019s Original machine, as the newer Vertuo models don\u2019t let you run a hot water cycle unless you\u2019re deep cleaning the machine \u2013 and that cycle takes several minutes. On most Nespresso machines you can\u2019t adjust the temperature of the coffee you\u2019re making and Nespresso will argue there\u2019s good reason too, because increasing the temperature of your espresso can affect the taste.",
    "Let\u2019s be clear, your Nespresso coffee should never be cold (unless you\u2019re making an iced coffee, of course) so if you\u2019re getting a cold brew each time it\u2019s likely that your machine is in need of some maintenance. Try descaling your machine so that all the parts are clear of any limescale which builds up over time. For tips and advice on this, head to our feature on how to clean a Nespresso machine.",
    "Brewing your Nespresso into a cold cup will make it cool down quicker so warming the cup first will also help. If you follow the steps for running a water cycle first that we mentioned above, you can leave the hot water in the mug for a few minutes so that it\u2019s nice and warm for when you brew a coffee into it."
