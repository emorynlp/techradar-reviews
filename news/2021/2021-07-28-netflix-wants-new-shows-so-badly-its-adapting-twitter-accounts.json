    "It\u2019s no secret that Netflix\u2019s output has waned of late. Shows are being canceled left, right and centre, while more and more downright bizarre projects are being signed off on every week. And with the streamer\u2019s latest announcement, that trend looks set to continue.",
    "Netflix has confirmed its next animated adult comedy series will be based on a popular Twitter account \u2013 called Chicago Party Aunt, after which the show will also be named \u2013 and will focus on the dysfunctional life of character Diane Dunbrowski.",
    "The parody account, which belongs to Chris Witaske and boasts 45,000 followers, commentates on life in the city of Chicago, Illinois through the eyes of Dunbrowski, a hard-partying middle-aged woman.",
    "Chicago Party Aunt will debut as 16 half-hour episodes, with comedian Lauren Ash providing the voice of the titular Diane. Rory O\u2019Malley, RuPaul Charles, Jill Talley, Ike Barinholtz, Jon Barinholtz, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph and Katie Rich will all star alongside Ash, too.",
    "There\u2019s no word yet on what ground the show will cover, but it\u2019s a safe bet to assume we\u2019ll see episodic recreations of Diane\u2019s tweet-based adventures through the city \u2013 which have included trashy eatery experiences and troubled relationships.",
    "The cast list also confirms that characters including Diane's nephew (Daniel), sister (Bonnie) and rival business owner (Gideon) will all feature, while Big Mouth producer Titmouse will be behind the show\u2019s animation.",
    "Given the decidedly left-field source of inspiration for the show, it\u2019s easy to dismiss Chicago Party Aunt as a stab in the dark for Netflix even before its first episode airs.",
    "But while it\u2019s true the streamer\u2019s library has suffered of late, its collection of animated shows has always been ahead of the pack when compared to those produced by other streaming rivals like Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV Plus.",
    "The likes of BoJack Horseman, F is for Family and the aforementioned Big Mouth have all gained something of a cult following in recent years, and there\u2019s no reason why Chicago Party Aunt couldn\u2019t match those successes.",
    "With Witaske, original owner of the account, on hand as the show\u2019s creator, too, it looks set to remain as faithful as possible to its already-popular source material \u2013 so existing Chicago Party Aunt fans should be happy, at least.",
    "The show is set to premiere on Netflix on September 17. Stay tuned to TechRadar for our thoughts when it lands."
