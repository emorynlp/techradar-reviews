    "As part of my ongoing running challenge to run or walk nearly 2,300 miles in two years, I\u2019m having to use smartwatches, fitness trackers and running watches to account for all the journeys I make. Short run? Track it. Walk to the store? Slap that band on. Walk to the toilet? Let\u2019s get those steps in.",
    "The one area I haven\u2019t been monitoring as much with these devices is my sleep. That\u2019s in part because big watches can be annoying to wear at night; partly because some trackers can be poor at accurately judging when you go to bed; and also because I just didn\u2019t know what to do with the sleep data collected.",
    "I\u2019ve come to regret this decision, though \u2013 because it turns out that sleep is even more important for working out than I\u2019d thought (of course I know sleep is important, but I just didn\u2019t know how important it is).",
    "After wearing the Polar Vantage M2 for a few weeks, using it to track runs, long-distance walks and my sleep, I spoke to psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist Dr Meeta Singh, who analyzed my sleep data. Using her expertise in the field, she pointed out some key learnings from my data that I wish I\u2019d known sooner.",
    "I\u2019m a night owl: someone who\u2019s most productive late into the night, and struggles to rise early as a result. Having to work 9-5pm doesn\u2019t change this, even though 7am wake-ups are the norm; it just means I get fewer hours of sleep. I thought forcefully changing my circadian rhythm to fit the normal work day was my only recourse \u2013 but it turns out, this isn\u2019t the case.",
    "In fact, one of Dr Singh\u2019s first bits of advice was to obey your body clock: \u201cBeing a night owl or a morning person, it is something that\u2019s intrinsic. When [sleep specialists] are talking to people, we want them to try to sleep according to their biological clock.\u201d",
    "It isn\u2019t only sleeping hours that are affected by your circadian rhythm, though; your peak exercise time is too. \u201cThe time of the day that you\u2019re best at exercising really depends on your chronotype,\u201d Dr Singh told me. \u201cThere is a certain time during the day where we\u2019re biologically wired to be at our best. For somebody who goes to bed at 11pm and wakes at 7am, that's between 4pm and 7pm in the evening.\u201d",
    "I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m an evening person, but using the timing stats from the Polar watch helped me to work out exactly how much of a night owl I am, and as a result figure out my optimal running times. It turns out, just before dinner is best for me \u2013 which is perfect timing to earn that pizza.",
    "My sleep data also revealed to Dr Singh that I was chronically sleep-deprived. I was getting an insufficient amount of sleep in the five days through the week and then compensating for that at the weekend, playing catch-up and sleeping extra.",
    "But it turns out that this is a big \u2018no-no\u2019 \u2013 according to Dr Singh, it\u2019s \u201creally bad for you\u201d. Oops.",
    "So why is this? Surely it could only result in me feeling a little more tired? Much worse, it seems: \u201cDoing this on a regular basis can cause cardiovascular or cardiometabolic side effects. The glucose metabolism gets impaired, so it makes it more difficult for people to lose weight.\u201d",
    "\u201cIf you're chronically getting maybe only five or six hours of sleep a night, then it affects the way your body utilizes glucose\u2026 you become hungrier, and you crave fatty carbohydrate-rich food.\u201d Maybe that pizza dinner isn\u2019t such a good idea, after all.",
    "The adverse health effect isn\u2019t the only issue, though. Dr Singh mentioned something that will be familiar to those who have worked nights. \u201cIt\u2019s called social jetlag\u201d, she told us. \u201cIf, on a regular basis, I went to bed at 10pm and woke at 5am, but then on the weekend I go to bed at 2am and sleep until 10am or noon, it would almost be like every weekend, I had decided to go to California, which is three hours ahead.\u201d",
    "Regular social jetlag can apparently exacerbate the cardio metabolic side effects of chronic sleep deprivation, making you tired, and stopping your fat-burning workouts from being as effective. And if you\u2019ve ever tried functioning while jetlagged, you\u2019ll know it can affect your performance.",
    "So what\u2019s the remedy? Quit working, so you don\u2019t have to wake up at the crack of dawn? Actually, the solution isn\u2019t all that dramatic.",
    "\u201cI would say that if you could get a little bit more sleep, even on the days you're working, that would be great. Instead of waking up at 6.30am, you could sleep until about 7am.\u201d Dr Singh told us.",
    "And while that may sound like a pipe dream, it is actually achievable. By showering, preparing my overnight oats for breakfast, and pre-deciding on which of my identical-looking shirts I\u2019d wear the night before, I have managed to get my \u2018bed-to-door\u2019 routine down to just 10 minutes.",
    "There\u2019s something else worth trying, too. Something that I previously thought was an exclusive activity for babies, cats sitting in the sun, and students who haven\u2019t yet discovered Red Bull: napping. \u201cBecause of the busy lives that most people lead, sometimes the only way to accommodate that extra half-an-hour or so [of sleep] is via a nap,\u201d Dr Singh explained.",
    "There are some caveats, though. \u201cYou don't want to nap too close to your bedtime, since that will make it difficult for you to fall asleep at bedtime. Those people who have difficulty sleeping shouldn\u2019t take a nap, either, because that would further worsen their ability to sleep at night.\u201d",
    "Is there a \u2018best\u2019 time to take a nap? \u201cThere is usually a dip in the mid-afternoon for most people, when they feel less alert. That\u2019s the time to take a nap.\u201d Maybe your experience may vary, but when Dr Singh said this I immediately knew when that \u2018dip\u2019 was for me. \u201cIt's related to your circadian rhythm. And so that's a good time to take a nap.\u201d",
    "The recommended daily amount of sleep is seven to nine hours, and as my fitness tracker noted, I was usually falling short. Perhaps by amending my wake-up routine or finding an extra half-an-hour, I could bump that number up.",
    "Throughout our conversation, Dr Singh mentioned a number of reasons that sleeping is vital for fitness fans in particular. \u201cYou need sleep for muscle recovery to happen; your muscles actually store up to 70% of the glucose that's in your bloodstream, and most of the storage function happens while you're resting.\u201d",
    "Your sleep doesn\u2019t just affect your muscles: \u201cYour heart, your lungs, your digestive system; everything has a nightly reset, and that happens while you're asleep.\u201d In fact, \u201cthere isn\u2019t a single aspect of any human performance that isn\u2019t affected by not getting enough sleep.\u201d",
    "Some fitness trackers let you view a breakdown of the type of sleep you get and, according to Dr Singh, deep sleep is key: \u201cDeep sleep is what is most restorative; that's the time muscle recovery tends to happen.\u201d",
    "In fact, sometimes sleep is more important than exercise. \u201cPeople will ask me, \u2018should I wake up early to exercise or should I get an extra half-an-hour of sleep?\u2019. Of course I'm biased,",
    "but I\u2019d say that it's more important to make sure you're well-rested, because sleep is biological and it\u2019s a matter of balance\u201d.",
    "Fitness trackers and their sleep-monitoring functions can be super-useful for understanding your habits, then \u2013 and they obviously were in my case \u2013 but it helps not to overthink the stats.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to look at a [fitness tracker] without becoming anxious about the data, then it\u2019s a win-win situation. You get some information from it, which you can use to make some changes in your life.",
    "\u201cBut there is actually a disorder, where some people become anxious about their sleep. When they use any sort of monitor to keep an eye on their sleep, it becomes worse.\u201d This disorder is called Orthosomnia, and a piece in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine describes how people can self-diagnose sleep problems based on feedback from gadgets, regardless of the accuracy of the data.",
    "There\u2019s a delicate balance, then, between using fitness trackers to improve your fitness, and incorrectly analyzing the data they collate to potentially harmful effect.",
    "As such, it\u2019s best to use this data as something to consider, rather than solid life guidance. If you use a fitness tracker then you might notice you\u2019re waking earlier than you want, so could find a way to rise later. Or maybe you\u2019ll spot that, like me, your sleep patterns are too irregular. But if you think you could have an actual sleep disorder or condition, it\u2019s best to see a doctor.",
    "I\u2019m going to continue using fitness trackers to monitor my sleep \u2013 now that I know what I should be looking for. I think it will be easier to spot any changes, and therefore optimize my sleep to fit my workouts. But this might not be the route for everyone.",
    "Through my conversation with Dr Meeta Singh, we discussed a few other aspects of sleep that didn\u2019t fit so easily into this article. If you\u2019re interested, the key points are listed below:"
