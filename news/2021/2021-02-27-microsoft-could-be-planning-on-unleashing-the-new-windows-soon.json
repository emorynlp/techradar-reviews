  "article": [
    "Rumor has it that Microsoft is getting ready to deploy what it\u2019s calling \u2018the new Windows\u2019 in the near future.",
    "This comes from well-known Microsoft leaker WalkingCat on Twitter, who tweeted that this \u2018new\u2019 Windows \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 is coming next month. Although a follow-up tweet quickly clarified that \u201cit\u2019s coming, but maybe not next month, sorry\u201d.",
    "Of course, that means that \u2018maybe\u2019 it could still turn up in March, and seemingly March but more likely April are the months to watch for the debut of what is presumably Windows 10X, Microsoft\u2019s incoming lightweight version of Windows.",
    "The release date of Windows 10X Microsoft is aiming for is spring 2021, going by the rumor mill, so April is a good fit with that.",
    "However, some of the denizens of Twitter have chimed in that this might be referring to the revamp of Windows 10 known as project \u2018Sun Valley\u2019, which is promising to be a big overhaul of the desktop interface, but it seems less likely that this could be called the \u2018new Windows\u2019 rather than the new look for Windows.",
    "Furthermore, Sun Valley isn\u2019t expected to be implemented until the second half of 2021 in the H2 update, which will be the big feature update for this year \u2013 and obviously that\u2019s nowhere near happening (we\u2019ve not even seen the minor H1 update arrive yet).",
    "That said, the leak could point to Microsoft teasing Sun Valley in the near future in some manner, but still, it feels like Windows 10X is the more likely project being referred to here.",
    "If indeed all this means anything at all \u2013 this is an unsubstantiated rumor, so as ever, treat with a good deal of caution.",
    "Windows Latest, which spotted the above tweet, further adds that according to its sources, Microsoft is set to hold a \u2018What\u2019s new for Windows\u2019 event in either April or May, or perhaps it\u2019ll be a session at the big Build 2021 conference (the latter hasn\u2019t yet had a timeframe announced, but could happen as soon as May).",
    "As an aside, Microsoft reportedly also has a \u2018What\u2019s new for gaming\u2019 event which it\u2019s planning for March 23, as Paul Thurrott noted on Twitter, and the Windows event will supposedly happen after that."
