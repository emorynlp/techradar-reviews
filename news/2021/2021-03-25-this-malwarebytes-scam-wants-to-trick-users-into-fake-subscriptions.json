    "The objective of the fraudulent email is to grab the attention of innocent users, making them call the helpdesk numbers to dispute the charge.",
    "During the call the malicious users request the victims to download remote desktop access apps such as TeamViewer. They then sweet talk the victims to share their credentials, which they then use to commandeer the machine. They also install another program (SupRemo), which allows them to re-establish the remote connection without further details for the victims.",
