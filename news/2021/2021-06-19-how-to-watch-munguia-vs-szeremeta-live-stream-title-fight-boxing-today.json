  "article": [
    "Former WBC junior middleweight champion Jaime Munguia continues his step up to the 160lb division as he takes on Kamil Szeremeta in this WBO Intercontinental middleweight title showdown. Read on to discover the fight time, full card and your best Munguia vs Szeremeta live stream options to watch, with DAZN the main broadcaster around the world.",
    "Mexican star Mungia is seen as one of boxing's brightest hopes, but has been left frustrated waiting for a fight since October. The 24-year-old had been slated to fight the more fancied Maciej Sulecki, only for the Polish fighter to pull out of the bout on two occasions through injury.",
    "A replacement fight against D\u2019Mitrius Ballard following Sulecki's first withdrawl in April was also nixed. So his opponent tonight is another experienced Polish fighter Kamil Szeremeta, who has stepped in at short-notice.",
    "Munguia is itching to one day challenge the likes of big guns Jermall Charlo, WBO titlist Demetrius Andrade and Gennadiy Golovkin and a bout against the highly-rated Sulecki would perhaps have provided a clearer picture of where he stands against the division's best fighters.",
    "Neverthless, having held the European middleweight title from 2018 to 2019, Szeremeta should still provide a stern enough test for the Mexcican.",
    "Follow our guide below to catch this big fight - here's how to watch Jaime Munguia vs Kamil Szeremeta online and get a Munguia vs Szeremeta live stream, no matter where you are in the world.",
    "You can watch Munguia vs Szeremeta for free - but only in certain parts of the world. And you can at least get the fight dirt cheap in other countries.",
    "The cheapest of the cheap sees DAZN UK available for just \u00a31.99 a month! It's also equally cheap to watch Munguia vs Szeremeta in Australia or New Zealand, where DAZN is currently being offered for the introductory discount price of just $2.99 a month, compared to the steeper DAZN US price of $19.99 a month.",
    "Boxing fans in Canada are also in luck, as while it costs 20 bucks in the Great White North, you can get a FREE trial of DAZN in Canada, as well as in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Brazil and Japan.",
    "Coverage of the main card starts at the somewhat early time of 3.30pm ET / 12.30pm PT in the US and Canada, 8.30pm BST in the UK, and 5.30am AEST in Australia and 7.30am NZST in New Zealand on Sunday morning.",
    "The headline act is expected to start around 6pm ET / 3pm PT on Saturday evening/afternoon in the US, which is 11pm BST on Sunday night in the UK, 8am AEST Down Under, and 10am NZST in New Zealand - though this of course depends on how long the earlier fights last.",
    "Pronounced 'Da Zone', DAZN is a sports-centric streaming service that launched in 2016 and is now available in over 200 countries all around the world including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "Its offering varies by region, but as an idea, it owns the rights to the Premier League, Champions League, NFL, cricket, snooker, rugby union and more in Canada - one of its original and biggest markets.",
    "It's also seeking to challenge the pay-per-view boxing hierarchy, and is landing an increasing number of coups.",
    "As we say, DAZN has this wrapped up pretty much everywhere. But if you're abroad and discover that your coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that is showing the fight.",
    "The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Munguia vs Szeremeta anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "However, those looking to subscribe to DAZN for the first time may find the service manages to effectively block certain VPNs at the point of creating an account. VPNs most notably encounter obstacles starting from scratch with DAZN Canada, though in other places like the US our general sports VPN recommendation was working fine in 2021.",
    "And if you've already got an account, a VPN should work wherever you are to help you regain access to pre-existing subscriptions.",
    "Widely considered the best up-and-coming boxer in the world, Mungia has seen his dramatic ascent through the ranks stunted since moving up to middleweight following a succession of cancelled fights and deals falling through.",
    "The Tijuana native is 36-0 with 29 knockouts and is a former junior middleweight champion.",
    "Munguia\u2019s last fight came back in October, when he stopped Tureano Johnson in the 6th round with an unstoppable uppercut that busted his opponents top lip wide open.",
    "Polish fighter Szeremeta (21-1, 5 KO) has primarily built his boxing CV on the European circuit, having won and twice defended the EBU title.",
    "Having earned top IBF contender status, Szeremeta was given a crack at the legendary Gennadiy Golovkin in his last fight back in December, but provided no match for GGG, who pounded him into submission in the seventh round in somewhat brutal fashion.",
