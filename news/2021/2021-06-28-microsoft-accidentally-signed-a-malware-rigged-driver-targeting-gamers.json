    "Responding to what first appeared to be a false positive, cybersecurity researchers caught hold of a malicious driver that was officially signed by Microsoft.",
    "Karsten Hahn, a malware analyst with security vendor G Data blogged about Microsoft\u2019s faux pas, while sharing his observations about the driver\u2019s malicious activities.",
    "Analysis revealed that the driver, named Netfilter, was in fact a rootkit that redirected traffic to Chinese command and control (C&C) servers.",
    "\u201cLast week our alert system notified us of a possible false positive because we detected a driver named 'Netfilter' that was signed by Microsoft\u2026In this case the detection was a true positive, so we forwarded our findings to Microsoft who promptly added malware signatures to Windows Defender and are now conducting an internal investigation,\u201d wrote Hahn.",
    "Hahn explains that, since the launch of Windows Vista, all code that runs in the kernel space needs to be tested and signed by Microsoft. Simply put, any driver that doesn\u2019t bear the official seal of approval from Microsoft cannot be installed \u201cby default.\u201d",
    "As per Hahn\u2019s analysis, the Netfilter driver was flagged because it didn\u2019t appear to provide any \u201clegitimate functionality\u201d and was exhibiting non-normal behavior by communicating with China-based C&C IPs.",
    "According to Bleeping Computer, Microsoft has confirmed it accidentally signed the malicious driver, which is being distributed within gaming environments.",
    "Hahn states that Microsoft is actively investigating how the driver managed to pass the signing process.",
    "Bleeping Computer adds that the software giant hasn\u2019t found evidence that the driver was signed by stolen code-signing certificates. This would seem to suggest the malicious actor got the seal of approval following due process.",
    "This is an even more worrying prospect, as it points to chinks in Microsoft\u2019s driver signing process that might have been exploited to poison the software supply chain, with potential ramifications for businesses of all sizes."
