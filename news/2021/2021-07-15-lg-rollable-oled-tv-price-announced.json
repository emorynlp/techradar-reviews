  "article": [
    "LG recently announced that finally, three years after its debut at CES 2018, the LG Rollable OLED TV R is finally available for folks to purchase.",
    "The asking price? A cool $100,000 (around \u00a372,000, AU$135,000). I\u2019m not sure what your bank account looks like, but mine certainly doesn\u2019t have that many zeros in it.",
    "The good news here is that, even if you\u2019re not Richard Branson or Elon Musk who can afford these types of lavish purchases, you\u2019re not actually missing much in terms of performance: although the rollable part of the screen is novel and unique, the panel itself is similar to the one we\u2019ve seen on the LG W-Series OLED for the last two years, and this year\u2019s newest Gallery Series OLED \u2013 the LG G1 OLED \u2013 has an even brighter panel.",
    "Long story short, even though it certainly won\u2019t raise as many eyebrows at your next dinner party, the plain ol\u2019 LG C1 OLED that came out earlier this year is as competent a 4K TV as the LG Rollable OLED and will deliver the same picture performance.",
    "Well, LG Display \u2013 LG's subsidiary company that specializes in panel design and fabrication \u2013 seems to be heading toward brighter screens. That's a great thing since OLED TVs have always been a bit dimmer than QLED TVs.",
    "The benefit of these new OLED panels is that they'll retain the perfect black levels you know and love about OLED \u2013 just with a higher peak brightness when it comes to really intense action scenes, explosions and sunlight.",
    "Another way up the proverbial mountain of picture performance is something called QD-OLED or Quantum Dot Organic Light Emitting Diode screens that take the color saturation provided by a Quantum Dot film over an OLED panel. That's something that Samsung is reportedly hard at work engineering at the moment, but not something we've seen for ourselves.",
    "The last innovation we'll see for OLED moving forward are new form factors like the Rollable OLED TV R. In fact, LG teased a whole bunch at this year's online-only CES like a transparent OLED that sits at the bottom of your bed.",
    "We're hoping, however, that when LG eventually does release that bed it won't cost more than our house..."
