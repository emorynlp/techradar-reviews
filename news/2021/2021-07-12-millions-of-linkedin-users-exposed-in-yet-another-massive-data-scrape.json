  "article": [
    "Threat actors have once again managed to scrape data from over 600 million user profiles on LinkedIn, and have put it up for sale for an undisclosed sum, according to reports.",
    "This incident, says CyberNews, is the third time in the past four months that data scraped from millions of its user\u2019s public profiles has been posted for sale.",
    "According to samples posted by the unscrupulous user, the latest round of data scraped from LinkedIn includes the member\u2019s full name, email addresses, links to their social media accounts, and other details users have voluntarily shared on their public profiles.",
    "As mentioned by the threat actor, the information in the scraped data is available for anyone to see in the user\u2019s public profile. All they\u2019ve done is used automated tools to crawl through LinkedIn and compile the data from millions of profiles in an easily readable format.",
    "CyberNews adds that while the data isn\u2019t deeply sensitive, it could still put users at risk of spam and expose them to phishing attacks. It adds that the details can also be used by \u201cmalicious actors to quickly and easily find new targets based on the criminals\u2019 preferred methods of social engineering.\u201d",
    "\u201cMembers trust LinkedIn with their data, and any misuse of our members\u2019 data, such as scraping, violates LinkedIn terms of service. When anyone tries to take member data and use it for purposes LinkedIn and our members haven\u2019t agreed to, we work to stop them and hold them accountable,\u201d LinkedIN claimed reacting to last month\u2019s data scraping incident.",
    "Notably, LinkedIn is engaged in a legal battle with talent management company hiQ Labs, which scrapes public data from LinkedIN in order to analyze employee attrition.",
    "While in the lawsuit, hiQ contends that a ruling against data scraping could \u201cprofoundly impact open access to the Internet,\u201d the recent incidents of scraped data being made available on underground forums highlights how the technology can also be used by threat actors to identify new targets.",
    "LinkedIn didn\u2019t immediately respond to TechRadar Pro's email asking for comments."
