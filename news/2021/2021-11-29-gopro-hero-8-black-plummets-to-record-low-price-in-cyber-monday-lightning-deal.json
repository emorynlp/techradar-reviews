    "Looking for a bargain action camera? The clock is ticking on this year's best Cyber Monday GoPro deal, with a Lightning Deal taking the GoPro Hero 8 Black down to its lowest-ever price. But if you want to grab, there are now just a few hours left before the deal expires.",
    "We've seen some pretty good deals on the Hero 8 Black already during Black Friday, including a now-expired $249 Walmart bundle that included three batteries. But the new Amazon Lightning Deal, which only runs for 12 hours until 18:55pm PT on Monday, 29 November in the Cyber Monday offers, takes the action cam down to a record-low price $231.99.",
    "Considering the Hero 8 Black is still one of the best action cams around, that's excellent value \u2013 and lower than the $279 it costs direct from GoPro with a Subscription.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "The Hero 8 Black might now be two generations old, but we still think it sits in a sweet spot in GoPro's lineup. This is because the Hero 9 Black introduced a lot of new features, including a brand-new sensor, that collectively had a slightly detrimental effect on its user experience.",
    "While we like the front-facing screen on the Hero 9 Black and Hero 10 Black, this does come with a slight hit on battery life and, on the Hero 9 Black, the speed of its in-camera menus, too. If you don't regularly shoot to camera or need to see how you're framed in the shot, this is arguably an unnecessary extra \u2013 making the Hero 8 Black better value.",
    "The 4K/60p footage from the Hero 8 Black is also just as impressive as on the Hero 9 Black, as is its HyperSmooth stabilization. Because the Hero 8 was the first GoPro to be compatible with the company's new Mod accessories, it's also relatively future-proofed if you want to add accessories like the Media Mod for an external mic.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the GoPro Hero 8 Black from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
