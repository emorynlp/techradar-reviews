  "article": [
    "Apple has updated iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, which expands \u2018Find My\u2019 feature support to third-party accessories, improves HomePod mini handoff, allows the camera to recognize smaller QR codes, fixes bugs, and addresses some potentially potent security flaws.",
    "New in the \u2018Find My\u2019 app is \u2018Find My Items,\u2019 which lets third-party accessory manufacturers use Apple\u2019s device network to track down items. So far, only one product \u2013 a new version of Belkin's true wireless earbuds that will be released soon \u2013 is known to support the feature, but more could become compatible in the future.",
    "Apple\u2019s improved the handoff experience between iPhones with the U1 ultra wideband chip and HomePod mini \u2013 the latter can now better sense the direction and distance of the former, and your iPhones will vibrate with greater intensity the closer they get to the HomePod mini until the handoff is complete. Neat!",
    "There\u2019s also another new security feature, but only for iPhone 12 models: if the phone detects that its rear lenses have been swapped out with non-Apple versions, it\u2019ll alert the user. This should help anyone worried about sending their phone in for servicing and unknowingly having their valuable camera lenses switched for inferior look-alikes.",
    "There are several other improvements and fixes, including a Direct Touch feature in Accessibility that was previously released, but now works as planned, in the update.",
    "The iOS 14.4 / iPadOS 14.4 update also fixes three security flaws \u2013 one in the OS kernel and two in WebKit \u2013 though it\u2019s uncertain if any have been or were currently being actively exploited.",
    "While Apple didn\u2019t indicate how many users had been affected, the company\u2019s admission of the vulnerability to iPhone and iPad users is rare enough, as TechCrunch pointed out. Device owners are advised to update as soon as they can.",
    "Otherwise, the update included a variety of bug fixes for issues ranging from image artifacts in HDR photos taken with iPhone 12 Pro, Fitness widget not updating information, keyboard issues, News app audio stories not resuming after interruptions in CarPlay, and more.",
