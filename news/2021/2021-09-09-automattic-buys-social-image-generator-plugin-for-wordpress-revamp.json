    "Speaking on the recently announced acquisition, Post said: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited to join Jetpack and Automattic so I can continue to grow Social Image Generator and help more people in the WordPress community improve their social media presence and get their message out to their fans.\u201d",
    "Post will also be joining Jetpack to continue developing Social Image Generator and integrating it with Jetpack\u2019s social media features.",
