    "There are a ton of SSDs on sale for Amazon Prime Day, but the Samsung 980 Pro is a special case. This is one of the fastest SSDs you can buy right now, and you can save up to 27% right now.",
    "You can get the 2TB version of the Samsung 980 Pro for just $313, which sounds like a lot until you realize that it's usually $429. And, if you don't need that much space, and want something that you can just load up your most frequently used games, you can get the 500GB version for just $99, down from that one's usual $149 price.",
    "While there are a lot of PCIe 4.0 SSDs out there right now, the Samsung 980 Pro has consistently been one of the fastest we've used. We were able to easily get sequential read and write speeds of 6,783 and 4,909MB/s, respectively, making it one of the fastest SSDs on the market right now.",
    "To take full advantage of those speeds, though, you will need to make sure you have an AMD Ryzen 3000-series and newer, or an Intel 11th-gen Core processor. It will work on an older processor that doesn't have PCIe 4.0 compatibility, but it will operate at PCIe 3.0 speeds \u2013 and you can definitely find a cheaper drive for that.",
    "If you're not in the US, we've included the best SSD Prime Day deals down below, so you can get an awesome deal wherever you are.",
    "TechRadar is rounding up all the top deals over the Prime Day sales period, and we\u2019ve put all the best Prime Day deals in an easy-to-navigate article to help you find the bargains you\u2019re looking for."
