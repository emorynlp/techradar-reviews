  "article": [
    "Returnal has divided PlayStation 5 gamers with its punishing difficulty level, lack of traditional save system, and $70 / \u00a370 / AU$124.95 price point. But no matter which side of the debate you\u2019re on, the consensus around Sony\u2019s latest PS5 exclusive is pretty clear cut: Returnal is a rip-roaring good time \u2013 especially if you\u2019re a fan of roguelikes.",
    "It helps that developer Housemarque\u2019s third-person action game is a spectacular showcase for the PS5, of course. It takes full advantage of the PlayStation 5\u2019s unique features, which makes Returnal\u2019s labyrinthine and hostile alien world seem all the more convincing. The PS5 DualSense controller\u2019s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are used to effectively convey environmental effects, such as the feeling of raindrops hitting the ground, and the game\u2019s 3D audio is easily the best implementation of Sony\u2019s proprietary sound technology to date.",
    "However, there is one aspect of Returnal that exposes an annoying flaw in how the PS5 is designed, at least when compared directly against the Xbox Series X.",
    "Just like on PS4, the PS5 only lets you have one game active at a time. You can open a media app without closing a game, but if you try to play anything else, you\u2019ll be told that your current game session will need to close. This was par for the course during the last generation, with Xbox One operating in exactly the same way.",
    "The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S changed all that, though, with Quick Resume. You can now suspend and resume multiple games at a time and pick up exactly where you left off, as if by magic. It even works if you unplug the console, which boggles the mind a little.",
    "Quick Resume is something that I\u2019ve found continually surprises me, especially if I\u2019ve been playing a handful of other titles and revisit a game that I haven\u2019t played in a while. Suddenly, I\u2019m right back where I was, and I don\u2019t have to deal with any splash screens, menus or extra load times.",
    "Now, I haven\u2019t really missed this time-saving and user-friendly feature on PS5 as of yet. PS5 games load up extremely fast, and often I\u2019m more than content at playing one game at a time \u2013 it\u2019s been this way since consoles were first invented, after all. Inadvertently, however, Returnal really is the perfect advert for Microsoft\u2019s game-switching technology, and it's made me wish that Sony will implement something similar on PS5 in the future.",
    "Because Returnal doesn\u2019t feature traditional save points (there are actually only two areas where you will consistently restart in the entire game), you\u2019re left with no choice but to commit to playing Returnal \u2013 and only Returnal \u2013 on your PS5. If you want to stop midway through a run, which tends to involve hours of hard work, you\u2019re at the mercy of the PS5\u2019s Rest Mode functionality.",
    "Initially, this didn\u2019t feel like the biggest compromise in the world, but the limitations soon became apparent as I fought to reach the end of the game. The PS5\u2019s Rest Mode isn\u2019t 100% reliable for a start, with many users reporting crashes that have unceremoniously ruined a run they were hoping to continue. And although I was lucky enough to avoid any crashes during my playthroughs, I did personally encounter what appeared to be some sort of memory leak issue. The game became horribly choppy, almost slideshow-like during battles, after placing the game in a suspended state numerous times over the course of a few days.",
    "Once I reached a point where I knew I could safely stop (again, there aren't many), I rebooted the console and the issue thankfully disappeared. I dread to think how difficult the final boss would have been had I not been able to rectify this problem, though, and it did make me feel unnecessarily anxious about future runs.",
    "Another thing that makes Rest Mode an uneasy proposition is that the PS5 will also download and install updates for your game when it's in this suspended state. And guess what? Some people\u2019s precious Returnal runs were ended prematurely when the latest update dropped for the game. Once the PS5 applied the new patch, it closed the game as a result.",
    "I can only sympathize with those who were greeted with that kick in teeth when they returned to play, but there is thankfully a workaround to avoid this from happening to you, and it's one which even developer Housemarque is actively highlighting to players.",
    "To turn PS5 auto-updates off, head to Settings > System > System Software > System Software Update and Settings. Then turn off Install Update Files Automatically to stop your PS5 from installing updates while in Rest Mode. You'll also want to head to Settings > Saved Date and Game/App Settings > Automatic Updates and turn off Auto-Download or Auto-Install in Rest Mode.",
    "The fact that the PS5 can't suspend and resume multiple games at a time has resulted in some fans demanding that Housemarque implement a save feature that will allow players to save their progress, and return at a later date. However, others argue that having such a backup would go against Returnal\u2019s entire game design. If Returnal was on Xbox Series X or S, though? Well, there's a chance that this debate wouldn\u2019t even be taking place as the game could have supported Quick Resume.",
    "While there\u2019s no right or wrong answer to whether Housemarque should have included a more traditional save feature \u2013 it\u2019s their creative vision after all \u2013 it does highlight what a forward-thinking Microsoft\u2019s Quick Resume feature really is. Being able to take a break from Returnal would certainly make the game slightly more forgiving for players who are struggling, and at the very least, it wouldn't lock you into hour-long play sessions with the only release being if you succeed or fail. And there's a high probability it will be the latter."
