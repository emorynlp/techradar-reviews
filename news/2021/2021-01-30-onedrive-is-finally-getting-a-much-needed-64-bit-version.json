    "First released back in 2007, Microsoft's cloud storage solution OneDrive is finally catching up with the times with the release of a new 64-bit version of the software.",
    "Up until now, users could only access a 32-bit version of the app to store their files, photos and other documents even if they were running a 64-bit version of Windows 10. The problem with running 32-bit software on a 64-bit version of Windows is that 32-bit programs can only access 4GB of system memory even on systems with higher amounts of memory.",
    "By making OneDrive available as a native 64-bit application, users will likely see a performance increase as the software can now use more of their available RAM.",
    "In an update to the Microsoft 365 roadmap, the software giant explained that \u201cOneDrive is now available as a 64-bit install for AMD64-based devices\u201d.",
    "If you're running a system with an Intel chip don't worry as AMD owns the 64-bit architecture and all AMD64 updates are applicable to both AMD and Intel based systems, according to WindowsReport.",
    "Users interested in downloading and installing the new 64-bit version of OneDrive can find the software here.",
