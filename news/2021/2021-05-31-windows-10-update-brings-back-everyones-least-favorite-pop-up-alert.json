    "Microsoft has pushed out an update that appears to have triggered the return of an infamous Windows 10 pop-up alert.",
    "In recent days, Windows 10 users have started receiving a pair of new alerts promoting Microsoft Bing, the company\u2019s search engine. \u201cMicrosoft recommends different browser settings. Want to change them?\u201d the pop-ups read.",
    "The Bing alerts are thought to have been reintroduced as part of an update for web browser Microsoft Edge, which recently graduated to version 91, and are being served to Windows 10 users that do not search via Bing by default.",
    "Microsoft has long struggled to gain a foothold in the search market with Bing, which has always played second (and sometimes even third) fiddle to Google.",
    "According to the latest data from Statcounter, just 2.29% of search queries are made via Bing worldwide, as compared with the dominant 92.26% share enjoyed by the market leader.",
    "With Windows 10 now installed on more than one billion devices worldwide, Microsoft is aiming to capitalize on the operating system\u2019s massive install base to give Bing a boost in the rankings.",
    "The new Bing pop-ups reportedly promote a handful of different attributes and features. The first focuses on the newsfeed and security features, while the second claims users can save money by using Bing, courtesy of an integration with the Microsoft Rewards program.",
    "The alerts give users the option to either temporarily dismiss the pop-up or make the switch to Bing, but do not provide a simple way of disabling future pop-ups of this kind.",
    "To do so, users will need to launch into Microsoft Edge and enter \u201cedge://flags\u201d into the URL bar, which will open up a list of \u201cexperimental\u201d features. To block future notifications, deactivate the \u201cShow feature and workflow recommendations\u201d flag.",
