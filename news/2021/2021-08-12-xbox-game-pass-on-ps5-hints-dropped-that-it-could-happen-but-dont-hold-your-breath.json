    "The head of Xbox at Microsoft, Phil Spencer, wants Xbox games to be playable on any platform, anywhere, even dropping hints that maybe this could be a reality for rival consoles \u2013 or at least that he\u2019d be open to exploring that avenue.",
    "This revelation came as part of a beefy interview with our sister site GamesRadar in which Spencer talked more broadly about the philosophy of Xbox not being a console, but a gaming platform to be enjoyed across multiple devices. As a measure of how serious Microsoft is about this, we can of course see the recent announcement of the Xbox Game Pass coming to smart TVs.",
    "GamesRadar grilled Spencer on the prospect of an Xbox app coming to the Nintendo Switch \u2013 something which has been rumored to be a possibility on the boil before \u2013 to which he replied: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s the right question because people usually ask me about releasing one individual game or another. And what I say is I want the full Xbox experience to be something that we deliver.",
    "\u201cWe have no plans to bring it to any other kind of closed platforms right now, mainly because those closed platforms don\u2019t want something like Game Pass. There\u2019s a ton of open platforms out there for us to grow in: the web, PC, and mobile. So all of our focus, frankly, is on those platforms.\u201d",
    "Spencer further clarifies: \u201cThat\u2019s not a slam on anybody else who has a system that works for them. I can see why the disruption of Game Pass is not something that they want right now.\u201d But then he adds: \u201cIn the end, when we say we want everybody to be able to play on Xbox, we really mean if we can bring that full experience to a device that players want, we are totally open to those discussions.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s not much to go on here, then, but there\u2019s certainly a hint that it isn\u2019t ruled out that Xbox Game Pass might eventually end up on the Switch, or even the PS5. Is that really ever likely to come to fruition, though?",
    "We wouldn\u2019t hold our breath regarding Xbox games being playable on the Switch or PS5. Don\u2019t get us wrong, it\u2019s great to hear Microsoft continuing to push forward with an open philosophy when it comes to Xbox Game Pass. But to expect rival consoles to get an Xbox app feels like way in the future stuff \u2013 if any \u2018stuff\u2019 at all.",
    "We\u2019ve heard the merits of a possible Microsoft and Nintendo hook-up before, with it making sense in terms of giving gamers a way to play Xbox titles on the go, and granting Nintendo a whole raft of games beyond its staple franchises. However, it still seems like a very distant pipe dream currently \u2013 indeed, more recent rumors fairly firmly assert that there\u2019s no interest from Nintendo in an Xbox Cloud app arriving on Switch \u2013 and the PS5 is an even less likely prospect, of course.",
    "Still, Spencer\u2019s most recent comments do represent a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, the future of video games could be a far more open arena than we can currently imagine."
