    "After its unveiling way back at CES 2021, LG has finally put a release date to its brand-new gaming soundbar, the LG UltraGear Gaming Speaker GP9.",
    "The speaker is due out in September in South Korea, the US and parts of Europe. While we still don\u2019t know the price, LG has given us all the specs and features \u2013 some of which sound absolutely amazing for gamers, cinephiles and audiophiles alike.",
    "Among the newly announced features are LG\u2019s proprietary 3D Gaming Sound technology that utilizes a special HRTF (head-related transfer function) algorithm to simulate virtual surround sound that you\u2019d hear from a gaming headset in a two-channel soundbar. It\u2019s also DTS:X Headphone-certified which means you\u2019ll be able to hear some spatial audio effects in movies as well.",
    "We also now know that the GP9 will use a built-in Hi-Fi Quad DAC (ES9038PRO) and supports Hi-Res Audio, which is perfect for audiophiles who want to get in a listening session between matches, as well as a built-in microphone that allows you to talk with your teammates without putting on a headset. For gamers, that alone could be a real game-changer.",
    "LG obviously designed the GP9 to be paired with one of its UltraGear monitors \u2013 like, say, the stunning LG UltraGear 38GN950 \u2013 but there\u2019s no feature that\u2019s exclusively locked to LG hardware. If you want to pair it with a different monitor, go right ahead.",
    "In fact, according to LG, the soundbar works with both PCs and the latest gaming consoles via a USB-C and optical audio cable, but there\u2019s also Bluetooth if you want to stream music from your phone or tablet, too.",
    "LG isn\u2019t the first to make a gaming soundbar by any means \u2013 Creative, Panasonic and Polk have all made a gaming-specific model \u2013 but LG\u2019s does seem to be the most robust yet, and to our knowledge it\u2019s the only one that supports Hi-Res Audio.",
    "While it's unlikely to overtake your living room's surround sound anytime soon, if it's priced appropriately the LG UltraGear Gaming Speaker GP9 could be a great alternative to standard PC speakers and a replacement for your constantly breaking gaming headset."
