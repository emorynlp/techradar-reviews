    "We enjoyed the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 when it came out in August, and fans who have been waiting to pick one up have even more reasons to buy now that Samsung has added more colors for buyers to customize their own clamshell foldable.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, as it\u2019s called, lets buyers choose the color of the top and bottom sections as well as the hinge between. The Bespoke Edition adds blue and yellow to the existing white, black, pink, and cream color options along with the silver and black hinge choices \u2013 all told, there are 49 possible combinations, per Samsung.",
    "You\u2019ll have to pay a bit extra for the privilege: the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition price starts at $1,099 / \u00a31,049 (about AU$1,500), which is above the $999 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,499 base pricetag.",
    "And while there's no Samsung Galaxy Fold 3 Bespoke Edition, fans should stay tuned: starting with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, Samsung will expand this initiative to other devices moving forward, the company told TechRadar over email.",
    "Sadly, the rumors weren't true: the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE isn't launching yet, though fans of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 will at least get a new update that includes some new watch faces, a gesture control feature, and enhanced fall detection.",
    "And the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 isn\u2019t the only device getting special editions. There are new versions of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 themed to Paris-meets-Tokyo brand Maison Kitsun\u00e9.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition has Moonrock Beige straps with a cutout shaped like the brand\u2019s fox logo and engravings, as well as a Stardust Gray strap. There are Maison Kitsun\u00e9-themed watch faces, too.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition come in similar colors \u2013 Moonrock Beige for the earbuds and a Stardust Gray leather case, which is emblazoned with the fox logo. The right earbud features the fox head, while the left has a fox tail, and there's a theme for your paired smartphone, too.",
    "Both special editions are pricier than their standard versions: the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition in 40mm is priced at $399 (around \u00a3290 / AU$530), which is above the 40mm Galaxy 4\u2019s pricetag of $249.99 / \u00a3249 / AU$399.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Maison Kitsun\u00e9 Edition costs $249 (around \u00a3180 / AU$330), which is above the standard Buds 2 price of $149.99 / \u00a3139.99 / AU$219."
