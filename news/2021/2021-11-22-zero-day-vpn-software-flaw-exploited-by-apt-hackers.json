    "An advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been actively exploiting a zero-day flaw in FatPipe\u2019s software that powers its virtual private networking (VPN) devices, the FBI has warned.",
    "While the FBI hasn\u2019t shared details about the attackers, its cybersecurity sleuths have discovered that the group has been using the flaw since at least May 2021.",
    "\u201cThe vulnerability allowed APT actors to gain access to an unrestricted file upload function to drop a webshell for exploitation activity with root access, leading to elevated privileges and potential follow-on activity,\u201d notes the FBI in its advisory.",
    "Interestingly, analysis of the group\u2019s activity has shown that the threat actors took various steps to cover evidence of their break-in, including wiping their session activity to avoid detection.",
    "According to the FBI, the bug hasn\u2019t yet been assigned a CVE number, but has been fixed by FatPipe.",
    "Explaining the bug in its own advisory, FatPipe notes that it exists in the software\u2019s web management interface.",
    "\u201cThe vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checking mechanisms for certain HTTP requests on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to the affected device,\u201d explains FatPipe.",
    "The vulnerability affects all FatPipe WARP, MPVPN, and IPVPN device software prior to the latest version releases, 10.1.2r60p93 and 10.2.2r44p1. Since there aren\u2019t any known workarounds to the bug, both the FBI and FatPipe urge users to upgrade to the latest patched release without delay.",
