  "article": [
    "The common wisdom goes that, regardless of musical proclivities, you should buy the best headphones you possibly can.",
    "While we'd recommend models like the Sony WH-1000XM4 if you're looking for a pair of excellent all-rounders, not all headphones are created equal. In fact, some are better suited to handling the extremities of different music genres than others.",
    "Those headphones with bass that makes your bones wobble, for example, may not bring out the best in pastoral folk music. And if you only listen to classical music, you might want to avoid headphones designed for punchy hip-hop beats.",
    "With that in mind, we\u2019ve created a list of the best headphones, broken down by genre, so you can be sure that you (or the music lover in your life) is getting the most out of your favorite records.",
    "We haven\u2019t distinguished between wireless and open-back / closed-back models here, instead focusing on identifying the real star players for each genre, so keep that in mind when doing your research.",
    "Pop music is, of course, a broad church, and you\u2019ll generally want to choose a solid all-rounder that will be able to handle a wide variety of sounds, and will ensure that vocals are kept crystal clear even when paired with a bassy thump.",
    "The GT220 may not be the most customizable pair of wireless earbuds on the market \u2013 there\u2019s no companion app, for example, and no settings that will allow you to tweak the EQ \u2013 but they more than make up for it with their sheer dynamic range, ensuring that everything from heavy beats to stratospheric choruses will be dealt with expertly. One of the main plus points for the GT220 is that vocal and instrumental details are rendered with immense clarity and spaciousness, meaning that you won\u2019t miss a single note, even in busy pop productions.",

    "While they aren\u2019t necessarily the sexiest-looking headphones around, the DT1990 are super-serious cans that have an audio profile particularly well-suited to pop music. As we mentioned in our review, they have a sonic \u2018playfulness\u2019 particularly well-suited to pop music, featuring \u2018sparkling highs\u2019 sure to make huge choruses pop, while still retaining an impressive level of resolution. For the more discerning pop fanatic in your life.",

    "Rock fans will want headphones that maintain a good balance between being able to handle killer bass and being able to handle treble.",
    "Marshall are already well-known for their guitar amps, and the sleek design and iconic logo emblazoned on these headphones definitely give them the cool factor. Perhaps predictably, the Marshall Monitor II is particularly well-suited to guitar music - their strong, full-bodied mids and warm tone makes raw, grungy rock music sound great, while a surprisingly broad soundscape ensures that distinct sounds don\u2019t get too muddled up.",

    "Grado are known as *the* headphone manufacturers for rock music. With their powerful bass, they can take some getting used to, but their singularity has gained them a cult following. There\u2019s no better use for Grados than blasting out some classic rock, though \u2013 and while the GW100 do have a super powerful bass response, they're also good all-rounders, with excellent mid-ranges and the capacity to provide an impressive level of sonic detail.",
    "Read more: Grado GW100 review",
    "At the other end of the musical spectrum, folk and acoustic music requires a little less oomph than rock and pop. You\u2019ll want to go for headphones that are balanced and neutral, offering a level listening experience and as much sonic detail as possible.",
    "The USP for the DT880s is that they offer a \u2018loudspeaker-like\u2019 performance, with no particular factors boosted. This is ideal for acoustic fans -\u2013 these headphones sound clean, open and completely faithful to the recordings, allowing simple guitar-picking and sparse arrangements to shine.",

    "The Shure AONIC 50 sport a wireless, active noise-cancelling over-ear design, selling at a premium price to compete with the likes of the Sony WH-1000XM3 and Bose NC 700 Headphones.",
    "Their playback offers a smooth, open quality which makes them a natural for listening to films and voice recordings, as well as faithfully rendering the intricacies of acoustic music.",
    "Read more: Shure AONIC 50 review",
    "Vocal detail is particularly important here \u2013 you\u2019ll want to catch every word of your favorite rapper\u2019s flow, while a little oomph on the bass is always appreciated for those heavy hip-hop beats.",
    "It\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9, but there\u2019s no denying that Beats by Dre are one of the coolest-looking headphones out there. With the Solo Pro, Beats have toned down the extreme bassiness which has garnered criticism from some corners, but this model still packs a powerful punch.",
    "An improvement from earlier Beats models, the Solo Pro is more refined, and has greater spatial clarity, which is great for the new generation of rappers who are more likely to experiment with electronic flourishes and minimalist sound palettes.",
    "Read more: Beats Solo Pro review",
    "They\u2019re pricey, but the LCD-1 offer a level of sonic detail that will ensure you don\u2019t miss a single word, while their bass is deep and will lend hip-hop beats a satisfying thump. Word of warning, though \u2013 the LCD-1 leak sound like \u2018a sonic colander\u2019, and that little old lady sitting next to you on the train may be less than thrilled to hear Wu-Tang blasting across the carriage. But while the work from home era continues, you can sit back and vibe.",

    "Like folk, classical music really needs space to breathe. Headphones that can offer a flat profile and a super-wide soundstage will allow you to sit back and imagine you\u2019re in a grand concert hall rather than, you know, trapped in your living room like the rest of us.",
    "Sennheisers obviously have a fantastic reputation amongst audiophiles, and these are a particularly well-balanced pair for classical music fans on a budget. The HD 560 S has the perfect sound profile for classical music \u2013 they combine a flat sound profile with crystal clear audio, and have an impressively wide soundstage.",

    "Listening to classical music is supposed to be luxurious, right? For the very discerning classical fan in your life, these are quite simply one of the best pairs of headphones we\u2019ve ever used. The Focal Stellia offer decadence and detail, and are able to render individual notes crisply, while the surprisingly powerful bass means those dramatic crescendos will have a little extra body.",
