  "summary": "The release of Oculus Quest 2 has seen VR revenues sky rocket",
  "article": [
    "Has virtual reality finally reached a tipping point? The numbers coming out of Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR division suggest so \u2013 cash is flowing into its coffers, as user numbers soar and spend.",
    "Following the October launch of the excellent Oculus Quest 2, business is booming on the VR headset\u2019s storefront.",
    "\u201cAt Facebook Connect, we shared that over 35 titles on the Quest platform had generated revenue in the millions,\u201d said Oculus\u2019s Mike Verdu, VP of Content in a blogpost.",
    "\u201cAbout four and a half months later, that number is now more than 60 titles generating revenue in the millions, nearly twice as many as a few months ago.",
    "\u201cPut another way, that\u2019s one in three paid apps on our store making over $1M in revenue. Developers of all sizes are seeing meaningful revenue growth on the Quest Platform, thanks in large part to Quest 2\u2019s technical capabilities and the winning wireless form factor.\u201d",
    "During last week\u2019s Facebook earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg also stated that Quest 2 had been \u201cone of the hot holiday gifts this year.\u201d Its strong sales had pushed a large chunk of the company\u2019s $885 million Q4 non-advertising revenue, with Facebook\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg stating that this year-over-year increase of 156% was \u201cdue to strong Quest 2 holiday sales.\u201d",
    "Individual development teams are also doing well out of the growing interest in VR. Verdu points to Onward developer Dante:",
    "\u201cOnward was a multiplayer Rift game that came over to Quest and has made over $10M in revenue on Quest alone. Dante\u2019s story\u2014from being a one-man dev team, to building a studio and making over $10M in revenue on Quest\u2014is a remarkable example of dev success on the platform.\u201d",
    "The post also notes similar success for the makers of Population:One, Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted, Supernatural, FitXR and Beat Saber.",
    "It\u2019s encouraging stuff. Not only is it great to see hardwork pay off for developers with hard cash, but it grows confidence in Oculus (and by extension, VR) as a platform. With a healthy and engaged player base, you can expect to see more adventurous VR experiences developed, and more developers willing to take a chance on the platform. Established names and franchises can join the fray, without their gatekeepers believing their work is being sent out to die in a void.",
    "It\u2019s no wonder then that Zuckerberg alluded to an incoming Oculus Quest 3 headset arriving sooner rather than later.",
    "We\u2019ve been skeptical in the past over whether or not virtual reality would ever reach a mass audience, but the numbers now are starting to show that it\u2019s possible. Finally, virtual reality may have its mainstream platform \u2013 and we can\u2019t wait to see what sort of experiences and hardware leaps that will drive."
