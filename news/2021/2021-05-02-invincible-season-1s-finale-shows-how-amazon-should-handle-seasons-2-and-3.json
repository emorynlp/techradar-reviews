  "article": [
    "Spoilers follow for Invincible season 1.",
    "Invincible season 1 has ended on Amazon Prime Video \u2013 and, oh boy, is its finale a visceral gut-punch.",
    "The R-rated animated TV series has been largely enjoyable, but Invincible episode 8 took proceedings to a whole new level. It was a violent, tragic and, at times, pretty humorous end to the TV show\u2019s first outing which, after a slow start, found its feet and proved to be a solid adaptation of Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley\u2019s graphic novels.",
    "More than that, though, Invincible season 1\u2019s finale laid down a marker for how Amazon has to approach Invincible season 2.",
    "Invincible has been renewed for two more seasons and, judging by the responses to the announcement, Invincible\u2019s fanbase is delighted. The TV show\u2019s popularity, too, has proved a boon for its source material, with 100,000 copies sold since the series\u2019 debut in March. With plenty of story left for Amazon\u2019s adaptation to explore, it\u2019s unsurprising that seasons 2 and 3 have been greenlit.",
    "Still, Invincible hasn\u2019t been without its problems. While I\u2019ve been largely impressed, I\u2019ve had issues with Amazon\u2019s adaptation. Season 1\u2019s finale, though, gives me hope that these issues can be rectified, and it offers a template for how seasons 2 and 3 should be approached.",
    "Like Nolan Grayson, aka Omni-Man, teaching his son Mark how to use his Invincible superpowers, season 1 needed to walk before it could run. In less analogous terms, TV shows like Invincible need to introduce its characters and world slowly, so audiences don\u2019t feel overwhelmed or confused about who\u2019s who or what\u2019s going on.",
    "This element of Invincible, though, remains for the series\u2019 first few episodes, which makes its pacing feel sluggish. Admittedly, it\u2019s admirable that Invincible\u2019s creators wanted to maintain a 45-minute runtime for each episode. It\u2019s annoying when TV shows, such as Amazon Prime Video horror series Them, arrive in episodes with dramatically different lengths which, in that show\u2019s case, didn\u2019t allow its plot to flow particularly well.",
    "Invincible season 1, though, might have profited from some episodes being shorter than others. The pilot introduced us to Invincible\u2019s universe, while the finale wrapped up season 1\u2019s main story arc. These entries should have longer runtimes, then, in order to book-end the first season\u2019s overarching plot.",
    "Episode 8, in particular, benefits from its 45-minute length. In it, Omni-Man finally tells Mark/Invincible the truth about the Viltrumites. Basically, they\u2019re a race of arrogant superpowered beings who want other civilizations to live under their rule \u2013 or face annihilation. This revelation, coupled with Nolan\u2019s cruel assertion that he considered Mark\u2019s mother Debbie to be nothing more than a pet, causes Mark to become enraged.",
    "He refuses to join his dad\u2019s cause to enslave humanity, and the pair fight. What ensues is the destruction of the city of Chicago, countless innocent lives lost (in gratuitous detail, too) and Omni-Man almost pummeling Invincible to death. To Mark\u2019s credit, he tries to save as many people as possible but, ultimately, he\u2019s outmatched by his father\u2019s strength, will and brutality.",
    "Episode 8\u2019s devastating events, then, require a lengthier episode to do them justice. We need to hear the real reason behind Omni-Man\u2019s arrival on Earth, to witness his barbaric assault on Mark and Chicago in detail, and \u2013 as viewers \u2013 have the time to wrestle with the ramifications of the pair\u2019s actions. Mark\u2019s efforts are noble \u2013 sacrificial, even \u2013 but his decision to turn on his father only leads to more death and ruin. As Kirkman pointed out to us ahead of the series\u2019 debut, Invincible reckons with the consequences of superpowered individuals and their actions. To do so, the TV show requires episodes with more minutes to convey this.",
    "Other episodes, however, feel stretched out by their 45-minute runtimes. It isn\u2019t necessary to see Mark and Amber squabble numerous times in the same episode, nor to witness the Flaxan aliens\u2019 invasion of Earth four times in episode 2. Sure, such moments offer drama and action aplenty but, ultimately, they slow the flow of episodes down.",
    "Heading into seasons 2 and 3, I\u2019d like to see Amazon\u2019s adaptation take a different approach. Let the first and final episodes breathe with longer runtimes, but restrict other entries to a maximum of 30 to 35 minutes. It would mean cutting five to 10 minutes' worth of content out of each episode, but it would help to make episodic tales tighter, and flow better.",
    "By and large, Invincible\u2019s animation is terrific. The blend between 2D and 3D is superb, fights are viscerally savage, and there\u2019s even a nostalgic hint of old 1990s animated superhero TV shows, such as Batman: The Animated Series, within.",
    "There are, though, moments where I\u2019ve been pulled out of episodes by certain scenes. One such instance takes place in the pilot, when Mark tells his parents that his powers have finally begun to emerge. As Nolan responds to Mark, his movements lack polish and seem unfinished, which felt less immersive to me. In episode 2, again, the Flaxans\u2019 attacks are something of a letdown. It doesn\u2019t feel like there are enough alien soldiers present on screen to properly convey the increasing scale of each invasion, especially in wide shots, and doesn\u2019t present a true reflection of how overwhelmed Mark and the Teen Titans become during the Flaxans\u2019 final assault.",
    "Thankfully, later episodes mostly iron out these problems, which brings me back to season 1\u2019s finale. The magnitude of destruction is better realized due to the field of view in certain scenes (the Chicago skyscraper sequence, for instance), as is the ferocity of Omni-Man\u2019s attacks, such as that harrowing subway scene. Add in the various locations where Mark and Nolan\u2019s battle occurs, and you really get a feeling of scope and reach in episode 8.",
    "Close-up shots are also improved. Characters\u2019 movements are more flexible and, even though it\u2019s an animated series, appear authentic.",
    "With a season under their belts, the various production departments will have a clearer idea of what works from art and animation standpoints. In my view, seasons 2 and 3 can only benefit from the finale\u2019s blend of aesthetics and styles \u2013 and if this blueprint is retained, Invincible\u2019s next two instalments will only look better with time.",
    "Invincible season 1 is only the beginning for Amazon\u2019s animated adaptation. It got off to a rough start but, like its comic-book cousin, it\u2019s improved with each instalment.",
    "The first season only seems to have covered the first 23 issues of Invincible as well. With 144 comics in total, there are a lot more stories to be told, characters to introduce, and sadistic battles to endure between now and the TV series\u2019 last-ever episode.",
    "Judging by the season 1 finale thread on the Invincible sub-Reddit, and the high social media engagement for episode 8, fans won\u2019t get tired of the TV adaptation anytime soon.",
    "I include myself in that group. Invincible episode 8 did enough to show me that the series\u2019 producers have learned from its teething problems and, like The Boys, Invincible has the capacity to become a major superhero hit for Amazon. The superhero movie and TV landscape is becoming increasingly congested, however, so Invincible seasons 2 and 3 have to build on the foundations laid by the season 1 finale.",
    "If it does, my interest won\u2019t waver. Right now, I\u2019m excited to see how Amazon adapts the rest of Mark\u2019s story, and the wider Invincible universe, in future seasons. As long as Amazon, Skybound, and everyone else involved maintains the stellar work showcased in Invincible season 1\u2019s finale, the only way for the show, as for Mark, is up.",
    "Invincible season 1 is available to stream in its entirety on Amazon Prime Video now."
