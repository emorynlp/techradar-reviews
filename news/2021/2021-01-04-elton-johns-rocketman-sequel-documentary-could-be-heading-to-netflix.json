    "Sir Elton John is in talks with Netflix over a feature-length documentary sequel to 2019\u2019s Rocketman.",
    "Sources suggest the follow-up will include behind-the-scenes footage that didn\u2019t make it into the star\u2019s original biopic and detail his tours across the 1970s, featuring never-before-seen footage of the singer and John Lennon when they partnered for a Madison Square Garden concert in 1974.",
    "The documentary is reportedly titled The Pillars of Hercules \u2013 taken from John\u2019s middle name \u2013 and is the enduring project of his long-time guitarist, Davey Johnstone, who has been working to produce the film for years and is now in talks with Netflix.",
    "Discussing the project on the Greatest Music Of All Time podcast, Johnstone was quick to clarify that he had received the seal of approval from both John and his husband, David Furnish, to produce the documentary.",
    "\u201cQuite honestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI would never do anything, especially of a documentary nature, about anything we did without them being OK with it. So with this documentary we are in the throes right now of putting together all the last things we need.\u201d",
    "Johnstone also suggested that the sequel would be a grittier, more realistic showcase of John\u2019s career, and a contrast to the more upbeat nature of Rocketman: \u201cWhere that was cautious, reverent and chaste, this is fearless, honest and sexy (yes, it\u2019s a film about a famous gay man with scenes of actual gay sex). It\u2019s much closer in mood to Fletcher\u2019s wonderful but little-seen Proclaimers musical Sunshine On Leith, a film that was bursting with the joy of existing.\u201d",
    "Recording for the documentary is expected to conclude in January \u2013 \u201cthere are two more interviews we are looking to get\u201d, Johnstone says \u2013 meaning a likely release date of Easter following the post-production process.",
    "The news comes amid a renaissance for documentary filmmaking, as viewers flock to real-life stories en masse in the hope of uncovering the private lives of celebrities, the hidden mysteries of murder cases and the wonders of the natural world.",
    "Netflix, in particular, has found great success in its recent documentary ventures \u2013 Tiger King and The Last Dance, for example, were the talk of the internet for many months in 2020.",
    "The streaming behemoth has also signed a \u00a3112m documentary deal with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, while the Beckhams, too, have penned a \u00a316m contract for the platform to share unseen footage of their private lives.",
    "If The Pillars of Hercules is as revealing and authentic as Johnstone suggests, viewers can expect a captivating insight into the heyday of one of Rock and Roll\u2019s most famous figures."
