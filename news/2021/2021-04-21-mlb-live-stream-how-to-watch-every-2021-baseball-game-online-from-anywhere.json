    "After a heavily truncated season last year, Major League Baseball is back in full swing! We're looking destined for a battle for the ages between old rivals in the Dodgers and the Yankees. Follow our guide for all the best and easiest ways to get a MLB live stream and catch every 2021 baseball game online wherever you are in the world.",
    "For the first time in more than 30 years, the Los Angeles Dodgers are the reigning champions, having defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in game six of the World Series after finishing the regular season with a 43\u201317 (.717) record, the best in MLB.",
    "Curse finally lifted, the champs are the early favorites to advance to the World Series from the NL, but big things are also expected from NL West rivals the San Diego Padres.",
    "Meanwhile, the Dodgers' old enemies, the New York Yankees, are the front-runners from the AL. But the AL East is stacked, and the Yanks will need to better the Toronto Blue Jays and last season's runners-up, the Tampa Bay Rays, if they're to secure their first World Series championship in more than 10 years.",
    "Whatever unfolds over the coming weeks and months, our guide has your covered - here's how to get an MLB live stream this season and catch every 2021 Major League Baseball game online from anywhere on Earth.",
    "A VPN is becoming an essential bit of kit for baseball fans for two reasons. Firstly, MLB blackout rules mean that you can't use its otherwise comprehensive MLB.TV streaming service to watch teams within your own market - fine for Yankees fans living in Seattle, not so great for those in the Bronx.",
    "It's a real pain for cord-cutters, but fortunately, VPNs help you get around this by allowing you to relocate your IP address to a different location. This means you can still be sitting in your NYC apartment, but your computer will be rerouted to a server in a different part of the country - thereby allowing you to watch the Yankees (or Mets) just like you would if you had a fancy cable package.",
    "Secondly, if you find yourself abroad at all during the 2021 MLB season, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual baseball coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
