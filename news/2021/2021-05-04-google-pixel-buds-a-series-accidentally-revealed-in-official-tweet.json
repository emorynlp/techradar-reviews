    "The Google Pixel Buds A (or \u2018A-Series\u2019 as they\u2019re named) may have been confirmed twice over by Google itself \u2013 first in a supposed tweet (already deleted) from an official account, as well as on its German site, adding more support to the possibility that a new, more affordable version of the true wireless earbuds are coming.",
    "The tweet came from the official @Android account, and was supposedly live for all of 10 minutes before it was summarily taken down. It refers to \u2018The new Pixel Buds A-Series\u2019 and mentions \u2018one-tap Bluetooth pairing with the updated Fast Pair experience.\u2019",
    "The tweet also shows an image of the Buds A-Series (as in the attached image above), which reveals true wireless earbuds and a recharging case that looks identical to the previous Google Pixel Buds (though in an all-white design with white trim). But aside from the look and the \u2018Fast Pair\u2019 feature, the tweet doesn\u2019t show anything else about the new earbuds.",
    "This in itself is remarkable, but the Pixel Buds A-Series was also supposedly seen in a Google search \u2013 specifically, the name itself was mentioned in suggested results below the German Google store, according to German tech site Cashys Blog. While we couldn\u2019t find the same, suggesting it could have been taken offline, it\u2019s still a bit more official support for the Google earbuds.",
    "What little we\u2019ve heard about the Google Pixel Buds A suggests they\u2019ll look much like the Google Pixel Buds that launched last year, though they may have a lower price tag while retaining features like touch controls for adjusting music playback and accessing Google Assistant.",
    "We\u2019d originally heard a rumor that the Buds A would launch in April, but as that date has come and gone, we\u2019d expect them to be announced alongside the Google Pixel 5a during Google IO 2021, which runs from May 18-20, with a mid-2021 release date.",
