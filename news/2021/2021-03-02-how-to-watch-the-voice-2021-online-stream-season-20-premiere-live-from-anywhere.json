    "The swiveling red chairs aren't the only things returning to our screens as a new season of The Voice get under way in the US. Star judge Nick Jonas is back after a one-season hiatus, replacing Gwen Stefani, who led Carter Rubin to victory last year - after replacing Nick Jonas. Read on as we explain how to watch The Voice 2021 online and stream every new Voice season 20 episode live from anywhere in the world, including tonight's second straight evening of Blind Auditions action.",
    "The 'Jealous' singer reclaims his spot alongside the familiar faces of Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton - all of whom have mentored winning contestants, unlike Jonas.",
    "This being the 10th anniversary of the show (which first debuted in 2011), you can expect all the stops to be pulled out as the nation's next major singing sensation vies for that life-changing recording contract.",
    "As ever, The Voice 2021 kicks off with the Blind Auditions - the funnest and the purest section of the series for many, which separates the talent based on their vocals alone. And as well as those iconic swiveling chairs, our judges are now armed with a button that lets them block one rival coach from recruiting a specific artist.",
    "It's more competitive than ever before - and you can expect plenty of fireworks with Nick on the hunt for his first crown.",
    "Country music icon Blake is king of the judges, having led artists to victory on seven different occasions, most recently in season 18. Kelly, meanwhile, has three triumphs to her name (seasons 14, 15 and 17), with John trailing behind with just one win, from season 16.",
    "So, are you Team Blake, Kelly, John or Nick? Follow our guide below for how to watch The Voice 2021 online and stream every episode from season 20 of the hit US version of the competition - catch all the action live with or without cable, no matter where you are in the world right now.",
    "If you're abroad right now and unable to access the streaming services you normally use, there's a reason for this: geo-blocking, a common digital annoyance that means certain content can only be viewed in certain parts of the world.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream shows like The Voice online anywhere. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home.",
    "Alas, The Voice is quite a region-specific signing competition so countries like the UK and Australia have their own versions of the show - and therefore don't offer the US one either on TV or via streaming.",
    "The only exception is for folks from North America abroad. As outlined above, they can still tune in to The Voice US from outside the country by using the VPN route to regain access to the subscriptions and streaming services they normally enjoy at home."
