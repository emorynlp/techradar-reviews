    "The Looney Tunes squad are back playing a spot of basketball as NBA star Lebron James finds himself stuck in an evil AI's Serververse, with only one way out - they must take to the court and win. Bringing together the stunning animation of Bugs Bunny, Tweety, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and other Looney Tune icons, this new instalment of Space Jam receives both a theatrical and streaming release. Here's everything you need to know on how to watch Space Jam: A New Legacy with a HBO Max subscription, or elsewhere around the world.",
    "It's Tune Squad vs Goon Squad in this standalone sequel to the 1996 comedy caper. It's part animated, part live action and 100% outrageous, a family disagreement escalating wildly, with rogue AI Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle) kidnapping LeBron's son before forcing the king to play ball to get him back.",
    "But who needs terrifying opponents when you've got teammates like Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam and Tweety?",
    "Trading isn't an option, so LeBron's going to have to work with what he's got, though it's not all bad, thanks to Lola Bunny and Granny.",
    "Featuring cameos from Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul and one particularly special guest, Space Jam: A New Legacy looks like a worthy follow-up to the original. Here's how to watch Space Jam: A New Legacy online, streaming on HBO Max until August 15.",
    "This live action/animated spectacular will be rolled out to cinemas across the world \u2013 where it\u2019s been deemed safe to do so, anyway. In Canada, Space Jam: A New Legacy will be available in theaters on July 16, the same day as it\u2019s released in the US. That's also when it reaches UK audiences, though it lands in Australia a day earlier, on July 15.",
    "At the moment, there\u2019s no confirmation of whether Space Jam: A New Legacy has been procured by any of the major VOD platforms in these territories. However, many of the 2021 Warner Brothers films released on HBO Max \u2013 like The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It \u2013 have been made available internationally to rent as PVOD (premium video on demand) titles, on services like Amazon Prime Video, Apple iTunes, and Google Play Store. While we don\u2019t know for certain yet, it\u2019ll be worth checking these websites to see if that holds true for Space Jam: A New Legacy."
