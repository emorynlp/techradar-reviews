    "Spoilers for WandaVision follow.",
    "Wanda Maximoff has been known as the Scarlet Witch since she first appeared in Marvel comics in the 1960s \u2013 but you won\u2019t have heard any of her fellow Avengers using the moniker on screen.",
    "When Agatha Harkness referred to Wanda as the Scarlet Witch in \u2018Previously On\u2019 \u2013 WandaVision\u2019s eighth episode \u2013 she became the first character to mention the name in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The way she said it, however, suggested it\u2019s much more than your average superhero alias.",
    "The episode features strong hints that Wanda\u2019s Thanos-bashing powers were created by a mysterious entity lurking inside one of the Infinity Stones \u2013 and that she\u2019s one of the few beings capable of wielding a mythical source of energy known as Chaos Magic.",
    "Whatever it all means, it has huge implications for the MCU. So we\u2019ve taken a deep dive into WandaVision and Marvel comics to explain what the Scarlet Witch and Chaos Magic could mean for the season finale, Wanda herself, and upcoming movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.",
    "While we don\u2019t understand much about its mechanics \u2013 yet \u2013 we now know that Chaos Magic is the reason Wanda Maximoff has been able to transform the New Jersey town of Westview into a living, breathing sitcom.",
    "Having spent the entirety of WandaVision trying to understand how Wanda was able to get a whole town interacting together in \u201ccomplex storylines\u201d over large distances, witch Agatha Harkness finally cracked the puzzle in episode 8.",
    "Holding Wanda\u2019s twin sons \u2013 Billy and Tommy \u2013 hostage, Agatha told Wanda that, \u201cYou have no idea how dangerous you are. You\u2019re supposed to be a myth, a being capable of spontaneous creation, and here you are, using it to make breakfast for dinner. Your children, and Vision, this whole little life you\u2019ve made\u2026 This is Chaos Magic, Wanda. And that makes you the Scarlet Witch.\u201d",
    "In the Marvel comics, Scarlet Witch is Wanda Maximoff\u2019s superhero alias.",
    "Although they eventually became Avengers, Wanda and her twin brother Pietro originally came to prominence as members of Magneto\u2019s X-Men-bothering Brotherhood of Evil Mutants \u2013 they later learned that Magneto was their dad. This version of Wanda was given the Scarlet Witch nickname by the angry residents of a village she\u2019d accidentally burned down.",
    "The name has different meaning in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
    "Although the screen incarnation of Wanda has long been referred to informally as Scarlet Witch, the name wasn\u2019t used in any of the MCU movies or TV shows until Agatha mentioned it in WandaVision\u2019s penultimate episode \u2013 in fact, Agent Jimmy Woo assured SWORD director Hayward in episode 5 that Wanda has no \u201cfunny nickname\u201d.",
    "The way Agatha tells Wanda that she\u2019s the Scarlet Witch suggests this is a specific \u2013 and possibly unique \u2013 entity possessing immense power in the MCU.",
    "We know that Wanda\u2019s abilities are a mixture of the innate powers she was born with, and her exposure to the Mind Stone, the Infinity Stone that was housed in Loki\u2019s Scepter.",
    "\u2018Previously On\u2019 confirmed that a 10-year-old Wanda used a probability hex to save Pietro and herself from an unexploded bomb in Sokovia. Years later, when she volunteered for HYDRA\u2019s top-secret experiments to create superpowered humans, her powers (almost definitely) protected her from the Mind Stone \u2013 its energy had killed everybody else who\u2019d come near it. The Mind Stone subsequently magnified Wanda\u2019s abilities exponentially.",
    "We\u2019re not entirely sure how this power transfer happened, but it seems probable that the Scarlet Witch is an entity that lived inside the Mind Stone. When Wanda looked at the Stone, she saw a female figure, wearing the crown-like headpiece Scarlet Witch has traditionally worn in the comics \u2013 it was also part of Wanda\u2019s Halloween costume in WandaVision\u2019s sixth episode, \u2018All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u2019.",
    "We\u2019re guessing that the Scarlet Witch saw Wanda as the ideal vessel for her energy, and possessed her, sharing her immense powers in the process. Alongside her previous skills, Wanda now had strong telepathic and telekinetic abilities, as well as the power to manipulate matter \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen in WandaVision. This is presumably the reason Wanda is one of the only beings in the MCU strong enough to take on Thanos. (Like Captain Marvel \u2013 who sits alongside her at the top of the superhero power league \u2013 her skills are the result of exposure to an Infinity Stone.)",
    "Indeed, the way the Scarlet Witch manifests is reminiscent of how the Phoenix Force appears to the X-Men\u2019s Jean Grey. In the comics, both Wanda and Jean are Nexus Beings, possessing the ability to influence probability. Knowing that 10-year-old Wanda unwittingly wielded a probability hex \u2013 and episode 7\u2019s hints that the MCU Wanda also has ties to the Nexus \u2013 suggests that her abilities made her the ideal host for the Scarlet Witch, and all that reality-altering power.",
    "The question is, can Wanda control this Chaos Magic? Jean Grey always had issues with the Phoenix, and even a witch as strong as Agatha Harkness believed (and maybe even hoped) that Chaos Magic was a myth. Great power traditionally requires great responsibility, but can Wanda handle it?",
    "It\u2019s already clear from WandaVision that the MCU strain of Chaos Magic is a ridiculously powerful form of magic, giving its wielders the power to reconstruct reality how they see fit \u2013 you\u2019re not going to transform an entire town into a sitcom with a few cheap conjuror\u2019s illusions.",
    "In the comics, Chaos Magic goes back millennia. Chthon was one of the Elder Gods and a demon who used his Chaos Magic skills to subjugate the Earth, where he was known as the God of Chaos. He was overthrown by a group of mages, who managed to trap him inside Mount Wundagore in the Eastern European country of Transia.",
    "Thousands of years later, this is where the comic book version of Wanda Maximoff was born, and some of Chthon\u2019s Chaos Energy passed into the infant. This enhanced Wanda\u2019s natural mutant abilities, much as the Mind Stone enhanced the MCU Wanda\u2019s skillset. That means there\u2019s a reasonable chance that the MCU\u2019s Scarlet Witch entity will play a similar role to Chthon in the comics.",
    "In the comics, Agatha Harkness trained Wanda to get the most out of the Chaos Magic she\u2019d previously been using instinctively. We\u2019re not yet sure about the MCU Agatha\u2019s motives \u2013 while her efforts to work out the source of Wanda\u2019s power seem sinister, there\u2019s a chance her goal is protecting the Earth from a dangerous magical force \u2013 but she may also offer to take on Wanda as a pupil.",
    "Whether or not Agatha has a role to play in the MCU beyond WandaVision, the Sorcerer Supreme \u2013 aka Doctor Strange \u2013 will be duty bound to take an interest in Wanda\u2019s abilities, and ensure they don\u2019t threaten the Earth.",
    "In the comics, Strange was initially sceptical about the existence of Chaos Magic, but now that a giant energy field has turned a town\u2019s residents into sitcom characters, the MCU incarnation is going to have to take notice. Maybe the upcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (which will definitely include Wanda when it arrives in 2022) will feature the Sorcerer Supreme training Ms Maximoff to make the most of her Scarlet Witch abilities?",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
