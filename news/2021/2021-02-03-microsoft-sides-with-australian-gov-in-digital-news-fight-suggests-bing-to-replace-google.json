    "The battle surrounding Australia\u2019s contentious new media laws just got a new participant.",
    "Following Google\u2019s threat to exit the Australian market last month, Microsoft has suggested it\u2019s ready and waiting to step in to become Australia\u2019s search engine of choice, offering up its own service Bing as a replacement.",
    "Microsoft has today (February 3, 2020) publicly thrown its support behind the Australian Federal Government\u2019s efforts to pass a proposed media bargaining code, which would require tech giants such as Google and Facebook to pay Australian news organizations for their content.",
    "In a statement issued today, president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, said the Government's proposed code \u201creasonably attempts to address the bargaining power imbalance between digital platforms and Australian news businesses\u201d.",
    "Smith went on to acknowledge that, \u201cwhile Microsoft is not subject to the legislation currently pending, we\u2019d be willing to live by these rules if the government designates us\u201d.",
    "It\u2019s a vastly different outlook when compared to Google\u2019s response to the proposed law, which in its current form the company has described as \u201cunworkable\u201d.",
    "While Google has threatened to remove its search service from Australia, Microsoft\u2019s president stated that it was committed to the Australian market and that \u201cMicrosoft will never make such a threat\u201d.",
    "In the statement, Microsoft said it had put forward its own search engine, Bing, when Smith and Microsoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, met with Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the country\u2019s communications minister last week.",
    "During the conversation, Microsoft said it was willing to increase its investment into Bing to ensure it can adequately compete with other players in the market.",
    "If Google follows through with its threat, Microsoft also said it will help small businesses transfer their online advertising to Bing \u201cwith no transfer costs\u201d."
