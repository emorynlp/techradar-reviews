  "article": [
    "We already know that Steam\u2019s Big Picture mode, the UI that gives you a console-like (and controller-friendly) experience on the big screen, is due to be replaced by Steam Deck\u2019s interface, and we\u2019ve just caught sight of how that revamped UI will look on the desktop (following the release of Steam Deck dev kits as revealed earlier this week).",
    "Some grabs were shared by Pavel Djundik, the founder of SteamDB (who was involved in the early leaks around the Steam Deck), showing the interface running on a Windows PC, and looking pretty much like you might expect \u2013 in other words, much the same as the UI on the handheld itself.",
    "On Twitter, Djundik further notes that an image of SteamOS 3 has leaked, with some folks already installing it on other portables aside from the Steam Deck (although no hardware is actually named), and that we should bear in mind that what we see here isn\u2019t the finished interface, as work is still ongoing \u2013 but at this point, it\u2019s likely to be pretty close to what we can expect at the launch of the Steam Deck.",
    "Of course, we\u2019ve already seen the SteamOS 3 interface in Valve\u2019s previously released press shots anyway, so there are no big revelations here \u2013 though it\u2019s obviously interesting to see how the Big Picture replacement is shaping up. With Big Picture mode now being seriously out of date \u2013 in fact it hasn\u2019t been updated since 2015, so it\u2019s beyond old at this point \u2013 a refresh is obviously most welcome, even if it has been a very long time coming.",
    "Regrading the leak of SteamOS 3 which is apparently floating around online somewhere, likely in dubious corners of the net, those who have come across it would do well to exercise a great deal of caution. Obviously it\u2019s not something that you should be contemplating downloading anyway, not just from a legal standpoint, but also when you consider that it could be loaded with malware or other nastiness (there may well be fake copies of it out there before long, too).",
