    "Two years ago, the Royole FlexPai landed at CES 2019 as the first working foldable phone, and now getting even more screen is a feasible goal. But how? Rollable phones are the next frontier, but have just been concepts and possibilities \u2013 until CES 2021, when we saw multiple brands commit to Rollables, including one pledged to hit the market this year.",
    "And I didn\u2019t understand why companies would try so hard to make them a reality\u2026 until we saw rollables land at CES 2021 in a big way.",
    "Why would phone companies bet on rollable phones? Because they have the technology to supply them \u2013 the companies pitching rollables have already experimented with rolling screen tech, oddly enough, in TVs. And it\u2019s also because consumers have received foldables warmly enough to be hungry for even more screen area, especially as we hit the upper limit on static display sizes. Some are breaking that seven inch barrier, and that\u2019s arguably where \u2018phablet\u2019 starts turning into \u2018tablet.\u2019",
    "Voila, rollables: get more screen by unrolling it into a larger display, then roll it back up for the phone to return to pocketable shape. Presumably, rolling but not folding the display doesn\u2019t crease the screen, but there\u2019s also the advantage of not having to crack open a foldable at all. Conceivably, rollable owners can just hold a phone and it will change in their hands.",
    "There\u2019s that kind of ease I appreciated about the LG Wing 5G \u2013 the capability to keep your eyes trained on the screen and whatever Netflix show or Twitter feed you\u2019re watching as the display expands. Phones, seamlessly transforming. In comparison, foldables seem a little archaic.",
    "Except foldables are a reality (if an expensive one) while we\u2019re still waiting for the first rollable to hit shelves. After CES 2021, we\u2019ve learned that we won\u2019t have to wait long: both LG and TCL are expected to launch their own flexible screen phones sometime this year. Whereas the folding phone felt like a tough-to-pull-off gimmick, rollable phones seem like a more tangible possibility.",
    "Given how few foldable phones have actually come out in the two years since they debuted, rollable phones could be a better bet.",
    "Phone formats are a risk, especially now that the \u2018black rectangle\u2019 has become an intractable standard that designers fear to veer from. We\u2019ve seen some brands show interest in rollables or other phone types before, but TCL was the first to put its concepts in our hands in March 2020 \u2013 though the model we held was a paper-and-plastic approximation of the final design.",
    "Since seeing that rollable \u2018concept\u2019 in person, rumors sprung up throughout 2020 about TCL\u2019s rollable tech, and later, LG\u2019s name started popping up with a potential rolling-screen phone of its own, which we\u2019ve come to call the LG Rollable. Not to be left out, Oppo released a rendered video of its own rollable concept phone, the Oppo X 2021. Even Samsung teased it was toying with the idea of a rollable phone in a blog post about future handset concepts.",
    "Finally, the dam burst at CES 2021: first LG confirmed that its rollable is real and coming later this year, then TCL admitted it had a flexible screen phone \u2013 either a foldable or a rollable, though we\u2019d bet on the latter given how much more we\u2019ve heard the rumor mill point in that direction.",
    "In any case, both LG and TCL are betting on foldables enough to show them off in their CES 2021 company presentations. The phones are almost certainly coming. But it\u2019s the rollables concept, their serious advantage, that wasn\u2019t clear until now. Let\u2019s show you in a simple animation, which simulates how the LG Rollable will work in your hands when it\u2019s finished:",
    "That could be someone watching a show or YouTube video or Twitch stream until they suddenly have to go, and pocket the device, no folding or unfolding. But that\u2019s not the only way you have to roll, so to speak: in TCL\u2019s presentation, they showed off another rollable phone concept.",
    "The concept had a demonstration showing a larger 6.7-inch display that extended vertically to 7.8 inches \u2013 which is just a bit longer than the 7.6-inch unfolded center screen of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. Again, the phone extends in your hand while you\u2019re watching it, which I believe looks like much more of a seamless user experience than a foldable. Rollables could stretch from the sides or the top, giving users and phonemakers more flexibility.",
    "We know next to nothing about how rollable phones will actually operate, but they could have design advantages over foldables \u2013 without the hinge, the design could be more robust and less prone to dust or water obstruction. There are a lot of questions, of course, but what's clear: for once, brands like TCL and LG have the advantage over the biggest names in phones.",
    "It seems obvious in hindsight. Why not try new phone formats? Why was I skeptical? Concepts don\u2019t always lead to market-favoring products; heck, we\u2019re still waiting for word of the affordable foldable TCL pitched us on in October 2019. Tons of factors influence whether companies turn concepts into mass-market products, but mostly, it\u2019s about whether there\u2019s enough demand for consumers to want a new concept and whether it\u2019s profitable to develop it.",
    "Two things should have tipped us all off that brands would take rollable phones seriously. First, after much hype, LG actually released its rollable TV this year, albeit only in Korea (and TCL showed off its rollable TV concept). Scaling the tech down to smartphone size could be a more feasible task for both companies than, say, if they had to develop rollable screen tech from scratch.",
    "The second thing is the phones industry itself, which has pushed foldables so successfully that consumers are open to the idea that they can have more screen area, even if it takes some funky mechanisms to get there. Rollables could be where consumer appetite meets the niche expertise of these TV-producing brands, and it\u2019s clear that big names like Samsung and Apple aren\u2019t leading the charge to develop the format.",
    "Both LG and TCL are ideally situated to sprint for rollable phones, too: LG has spent years releasing new phone formats to market, from the Dual Screens on the LG G8X and the LG V60 to the multi-screen LG Wing 5G, while TCL is just starting its phones brand and has plenty of room to experiment. At CES 2021, we saw both brands claim to be coming out with flexible-screen phones in 2021, and now, I think they\u2019ll make it happen."
