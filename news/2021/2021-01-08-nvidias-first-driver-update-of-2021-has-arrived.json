Nvidia may have dropped lots of exciting new GeForce hardware last year, but with the 461.09 update we won\u2019t be seeing any game-specific optimization or support for any of the new video cards. A security bulletin is available with details on the security updates, but most of the actual bug fixes are more specifically relevant to GTX 1080 Ti users than other GeForce hardware, who have been experiencing many of the below-mentioned bugs.",
    "If you\u2019re not currently experiencing any issues with your Nvidia GPU (graphics processing unit) then you can actually skip this altogether for now, a rarity for Nvidia driver updates.

New Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Drivers usually come out about once a month, though they can occasionally coincide with the launch of popular new games so that the included updates optimize specific performance. For more information on Nvidia driver updates (and why you shouldn't usually ignore them), head on over to our guide to keeping your GeForce hardware updated. You can download the 461.09 update yourself over on the Nvidia site, as well as read the full list of patches and bug fixes, as well as the accompanying release notes. We've included a handful below:",
