    "The new AMD Radeon Adrenalin Driver 21.2.1 is optimized for Bloober Team\u2019s recently-released physiological dual-reality game, The Medium.",
    "After reports that the mystery-thriller is struggling to run effectively on even the most powerful hardware, AMD graphics card users can now expect an update that boosts the title\u2019s 4K performance on High Settings by up to 9% on AMD RX 6800XT GPUs when compared to machines using the previous driver.",
    "AMD has also addressed several other performance issues with this release, including fixes to screen flickering when using MSI Afterburner, recording features failing to enable on AMD Radeon HD 7800 series graphics products, and several additional patches for games including Doom Eternal and Metro Exodus.",
    "The Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 21.2.1 optional driver can now be downloaded via the Radeon Settings app in Windows 10 or via the links on the official release notes page, where you can find the full list of fixes and known issues.",
    "Given that, in our review, we described The Medium as an \u201cunnerving psychological horror\u201d, it\u2019s only right that players experience the game on the most optimized hardware.",
    "With AMD\u2019s new driver, you\u2019ll be able to fully realise the terrifying, dual-reality world of Bloober Team\u2019s psychological title, which is bolstered by its unsettling characters, a tailor-made score and often unpredictable story.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that AMD lists Hitman 3 as another game in need of a performance update, with the company acknowledging issues with application crashes in the Apex Predator mission on Radeon RX 6000 series graphics products.",
