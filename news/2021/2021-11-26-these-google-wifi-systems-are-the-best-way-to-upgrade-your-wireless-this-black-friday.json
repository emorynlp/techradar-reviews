    "Great news for anyone looking for a great Black Friday Wi-Fi deal \u2013 there are some amazing bargains to be found across the Google WiFi and Google Nest range of mesh wireless extenders, reputed as some of the very best products on the market.",
    "We've already seen Black Friday deals coming in thick and fast, but if your connection at home sucks then it's understandable if improving the coverage in your home is the first thing on your list of things to add to your basket.",
    "Thankfully, there are some great savings on both sides of the pond, with $50 off a triple pack of Google WiFi AC1200 routers, down from $199.99 to $149.99. Similarly, you can get the same triple pack in the UK for \u00a3132.99, down from \u00a3189.99 at Currys. (Not in the US or the UK? Scroll down for deals in your region). These Google WiFi extenders are mesh networks, allowing you to replace any broadband router you already have at home with a specialist networking device and also set up extra units around your home. This is fantastic for increasing the signal around larger homes, through thicker brick walls, heavy plaster or reaching traditional dead zone areas far from your router like basements.",
    "If you have a large home then the triple pack might be your best option, but there are also plenty of bargains to be found on double packs or even single routers for anyone living in a compact home. After all, the size of your abode shouldn't dictate if you have a fast, reliable internet connection.",
    "Take advantage of the latest Google WiFi prices for the set of three below and you could make a significant saving over buying them individually.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Google WiFi from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
