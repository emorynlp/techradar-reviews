    "Sony is a top-tier TV maker, and it's offering a host of brilliant Black Friday OLED TV deals in time for the massive sales event.",
    "There are great offers to be snapped up while the Black Friday deals. In the US, that means a $400 discount on the 55-inch Sony A80J, while UK shoppers can benefit from up to \u00a3700 off the Sony A90J at its largest sizes. And if these screens are still too costly for you, you can nab the X80J for just $750 with this brilliant $250 saving.",
    "Sony OLED TVs tend to be a touch pricier than some screens out there \u2013 like the budget LG A1, which is likely the cheapest OLED you can buy over Black Friday \u2013 but they do offer a modicum of quality not always found elsewhere.",
    "You'll get brilliant upscaling, especially with the Cognitive XR processor found in Sony's new A80J and A90J screens \u2013 both of which have seen great price cuts below.",
    "These OLED models also feature a version of Sony's Acoustic Surface Audio technology, meaning the TV's glass panel literally vibrates to emit sound. 4K HDR, Dolby Atmos passthrough, HDMI 2.1, and the new Google TV smart platform are all included, too.",
    "If you want to see what's on offer from competing TV makers like LG and Samsung, though, Sony is far from alone in offering great discounts \u2013 as you'll see in our Black Friday TV deals guide.",
    "You can see more TV deals with our Best Buy Black Friday deals guide. You can also shop more bargains with our roundup of the best Walmart Black Friday deals and the best Amazon Black Friday deals."
