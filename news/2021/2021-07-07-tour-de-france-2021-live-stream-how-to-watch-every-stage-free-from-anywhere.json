    "The epic hill climbs; the intense time trials; the quaint cobbled streets; the famous yellow jersey. Just mentioning the words 'Tour de France' conjures up a whole gallery of nostalgia and excitement. Here we explain how to get a Tour de France live stream and watch cycling online from anywhere - including for FREE in some countries! We also have info on this year's Tour de France stage times and dates.",
    "After last year's unforgettable climax, the race for the iconic maillot jaune returns as Tadej Poga\u010dar and Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d make France their battleground once more. Will the Slovenian stars dominate the mountains, hills and roads of La R\u00e9publique again? It's so far so good for the reigning champ, with the 22-year-old responding superbly to being the man to beat.",
    "Outside of that, Mark Cavendish has perhaps been the story of the Tour so far, staging a remarkable comeback in 2021 to start racking up the stage wins. Australia's Ben O'Connor has also taken many pundits and casual fans by surprise, with a strong opening week.",
    "This year's Tour features three summit finishes, 10 mountain stages and eight flat stages, as well as bringing back a second individual time trial. The riders will enter the Alps on the second weekend of the race, but Stage 17 is where the race is likely to be lost or won, as the Pyrenean Col de Peyresourde, Col d\u2019Azet-Val Louron and Col du Portet separate the men from the boys.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a 2021 Tour de France live stream from anywhere, as well as the countries where you can watch absolutely free.",
    "One of the best things about the Tour de France is that it's completely free to watch in lots of countries around the world. For example:",
    "UK - ITV4 and ITV Hub streaming service / S4C and S4C on BBC iPlayer",
    "France - France TV Sport",
    "Belgium - RTBF",
    "Italy - Rai Sport",
    "Australia - SBS",
    "As discussed above, if you're desperate to watch the Tour de France but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
    "Use a VPN to get a Tour de France live stream from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to ITV Hub and watch the cycling as if you were back at home!",
    "The Tour de France is the oldest - and, depending on who you ask, the most difficult and prestigious - of cycling's three Grand Tours, the other two being the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a.",
    "This year's race is the 108th edition of the Tour, which is affectionately known as La Grande Boucle (the big loop), and unlike last year's event, which was fully contained within the borders of La R\u00e9publique, this year's edition will stray into neighbouring Andorra.",
    "The Tour de France is split into into 21 stages, each of which is completed every day - and there are two days set aside for the riders to rest. Stage 1 takes place on June 26 and Stage 21 is scheduled for July 18, with the breaks in the action set for July 5 and July 6 (both Mondays).",
    "At the end of each daily stage, the rider who crosses the finish line first is the 'Stage Winner', while the cyclist with the quickest overall time from the very start of the first day of the race gets to wear the iconic Yellow Jersey.",
    "The overall winner of the Tour de France is the rider with the quickest time for all the stages put together.",
    "However, two of the stages are individual time trials (Stages 5 and 20), during which each of the riders will race to set the fastest time, without their teammates helping out by creating slipstreams.",
    "There are several secondary competitions and prizes at stake too, including the points classification (leader indicated by a green jersey), mountains classification (polka dot jersey), young rider classification (white jersey), team classification (numbers on a yellow background rather than white), and combativity award (red bib).",
    "The opening stage, known as the 'Grand D\u00e9part', of the 2021 Tour de France will take place in Brest on June 26, while the the 21st and final stage sets off from Chatou and finishes in traditional style with a sprint down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris on July 18.",
    "The 2021 Tour de France covers approximately 3,417.5km (2,123.5 miles). There are eight flat stages, one hilly stage, 10 mountain stages (four of which are described as \"medium\" mountain stages), two individual time trials, and two rest days. For the second consecutive year, there's no team time trial.",
    "At 249.5km (155 miles), Stage 7 on July 2 is the race's longest stage, and the longest leg of the Tour de France in 21 years. The Stage 5 individual time trial on June 30 will be the shortest, at 27.2km (16.9 miles).",
    "Tadej Poga\u010dar and Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d thrilled us last year, and it's difficult to look past the Slovenian duo at the 2021 race.",
    "Rogli\u010d had the general classification in the bag, until a heroic performance from his fellow countryman on the penultimate day saw Poga\u010dar storm his way to the yellow jersey, which he took along with the white jersey and polka dot jersey too.",
    "It was heartbreaking for Rogli\u010d, and we can't wait to see them duke it out again."
