    "Drone maker DJI has released a new educational flying machine for students: the DJI RoboMaster Tello Talent. Its latest programmable robot aims to expand students\u2019 understanding of coding by giving them a new way to see their skills in action.",
    "DJI\u2019s Tello Talent can be coded using languages like Swift, Python, and Scratch. Using their own commands, students will be able to manipulate the Tello Talent\u2019s LED screen to create simple patterns and effects.",
    "More advanced users will be able to put their coding skills to the test by giving a swarm of drones custom maneuvers and formations to carry out \u2013 so students will be able to create their own light show displays, too.",
    "DJI also announced that the Tello Talent includes support for third-party accessories to incorporate facial and gesture recognition as well as hand tracking. New teaching resources and software can be found now from DJI at the DJI Education Hub, and will work with pre-existing DJI RoboMaster S1 and RoboMaster EP models.",
    "We know what you\u2019re thinking, and DJI has thought ahead about bringing a drone into a classroom. For one, the DJI RoboMaster Tello Talent is fairly small, so there should be plenty of room in a typical classroom for a couple of these things to fly around.",
    "On top of that an inbuilt time of flight (TOF) sensor \u2013 much like the ones found in the Mavic 2 Pro \u2013 the Tello Talent will have environment detection up to 1.2m and can employ simple obstacle avoidance.",
    "It will also come with propeller guards to keep its blades protected from damage just in case the drone does happen to fly into something.",
    "If you\u2019re interested in picking up a DJI RoboMaster Tello Talent for yourself, it\u2019s available to purchase right now for \u00a3235 (around $332 / AUS$430) through retail options and can be bought through EDU dealers."
