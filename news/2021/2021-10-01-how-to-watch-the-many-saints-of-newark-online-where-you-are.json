  "article": [
    "Perhaps the greatest TV series ever made, The Sopranos (1999-2007) won dozens of awards and cemented HBO\u2019s reputation as a producer of impeccably crafted drama. Now, 14 years after we said goodbye to the dysfunctional mafia family, this feature-length film takes us back to 1960s New Jersey to chart the making of made man Tony Soprano. Below we explain how to watch The Many Saints of Newark online, available to stream with an \u2018Ad-Free\u2019 HBO Max subscription.",
    "Co-written by Lawrence Konner and series creator David Case, the film is a fascinating origin story and thrilling period piece too. Set in New Jersey during the 1960s and \u201870s, it centers around Tony\u2019s revered uncle Richard \u201cDick\u201d Multisanti (Alessandro Nivola), whose efforts to raise a family while being part of a crime syndicate takes place against a backdrop of gang warfare and racial tension, which erupts in the deadly Newark riots of 1967.",
    "In an ingenious bit of casting, Michael Gandolfini \u2013 the late James Gandolfini\u2019s son \u2013 plays the young Tony Soprano, while cinematic bad boy Ray Liotta is Dick\u2019s father Aldo and his incarcerated twin brother Sal. Leslie Odom Jr (award-nominated for One Night in Miami) features as Harold McBrayer, the head of a rival African American gang, while Vera Farmiga is Tony\u2019s overbearing mother Livia, whose uncanny resemblance to the mafioso\u2019s future wife Carmella just confirms his troubling mommy issues.",
    "So, who made Tony Soprano? This crime prequel provides an enthralling and highly entertaining answer. Read on below as we explain how to watch The Many Saints of Newark online now.",
    "Only in the US can you stream The Many Saints of Newark currently, as international territories are required to wait until the end of the film\u2019s theatrical run before viewing it elsewhere \u2013 roughly about 4 months.",
    "Whadayagunnado? Well, it\u2019s currently having a theatrical run in the UK, having recently been released on September 22, while Canadian fans of the New Jersey-set drama can watch it from October 1, the same day as their American neighbors.",
    "Its cinema debut in Australia, however, won\u2019t be until November 4: in all likelihood due to the widespread state of lockdown there at the moment caused by Covid.",
    "As to whether The Many Saints of Newark will be procured by any of the major VOD platforms in these territories? Many past 2021 Warner Brothers movies released on HBO Max \u2013 for example, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It \u2013 have been made available internationally to rent as premium video on demand (PVOD) titles, on services like Amazon Prime Video, Apple iTunes, and Google Play Store.",
    "So, while we can\u2019t say for certain, it\u2019ll be worth checking these websites to see if that holds true for The Many Saints of Newark.",
    "As well as instant access to new Warner Bros. blockbusters \u2013 Denis Villeneuve\u2019s highly anticipated sci-fi epic Dune is up next on October 22 \u2013 you\u2019ll get over 13,000 hours of prime content: choice picks from the Warner Bros. archive and subsidiary companies like New Line Cinema, Studio Ghibli\u2019s animated masterpieces, DC Entertainment blockbusters like Wonder Woman: 1984",
    "And \u2013 the clue's in the name \u2013 watch every iconic HBO series ever made. Enjoy The Sopranos, Euphoria, Mare of Easttown and The Wire, plus all 10 seasons of iconic sitcom Friends, addictive HBO Max Originals like Gossip Girl, and so much more."
