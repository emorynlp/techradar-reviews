    "Spoilers for the first two episodes of Loki follow. Watch them first before reading this.",
    "Superheroes may be the dominant force in popular culture right now, but their current screen success is a mere flash in the pan next to the longevity of the detective drama. By merging the two genres in spectacular, wise-cracking fashion, however, Loki episode 2 may have found one of the most potent forces in the universe.",
    "Where last week\u2019s debut episode, \u2018Glorious Purpose\u2019, spent much of its runtime establishing the monochrome world of the Time Variance Authority and how it fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u2018The Variant\u2019 plays out like a fully-fledged police procedural. The idea of law-enforcement authorities hiring a criminal mastermind as an unlikely consultant has been used everywhere from Hannibal to Lucifer, and while it\u2019s a plot device that can occasionally slip into clich\u00e9, it\u2019s an irresistible proposition when it works. Particularly when the two bickering leads work together as well as they do in the Loki TV show.",
    "Loki and Mobius may come from different worlds, with totally opposing views on life, the universe and pretty much everything, but the MCU is a better place when they\u2019re together. Did you hear the one about the god of mischief and the TVA agent? The answer is frequently hilarious and played to perfection, with Tom Hiddleston\u2019s Shakespearean delivery finding its perfect foil in Owen Wilson\u2019s laidback Texan drawl.",
    "Crucially, you\u2019re never quite sure which of the duo has the upper hand. Anyone who can send a flamboyant god of mischief out into the world in a drab, standard-issue TVA jacket with \u201cVariant\u201d emblazoned across the back in big orange letters \u2013 \u201cVery subtle\u2026 Well done,\u201d says Loki \u2013 clearly wields a degree of control Thor\u2019s brother has never encountered before. Indeed, Mobius already knows exactly how to get under the Asgardian\u2019s skin with his taunts about the fugitive Loki Variant being the superior model.",
    "And yet, every time you think Mobius has clipped Loki\u2019s wings, the god of mischief will push back with a clever delaying tactic, a spot of casual backstabbing (it\u2019s a speciality), or outright deceit \u2013 a drinking game inviting you to down a shot every time Loki tells a lie would be downright danger to your health.",
    "While Mobius often gives the impression he sees past Loki\u2019s scheming, there are plenty of times his prisoner/partner gets the better of him. The question is, who needs the other more? Mobius\u2019s tease of a possible face-to-face meeting with the Time-Keepers (aka the \u201cthree magic lizards\u201d) has clearly piqued Loki\u2019s interest \u2013 they\u2019re his best route back to his timeline, after all \u2013 but is the reward big enough to persuade Loki to bury his face in a TVA case file?",
    "Is Loki\u2019s less by-the-numbers approach to the mystery, an unconventional way of thinking that leads him to realize that the rogue Variant is using apocalyptic events to hide from the Time Variance Authority, the more valuable commodity? Even Mobius has to admit that Loki is \u201cvery clever\u201d.",
    "There\u2019s also the growing sense that there\u2019s a grudging respect developing between the pair, and maybe even some common ground. Mobius\u2019s faith in the \u201cglorious purpose\u201d of the TVA has remarkable parallels with Loki\u2019s belief that residents of Asgard are deities \u2013 though, as far as we\u2019re aware, Loki is yet to express any interest in jet skis.",
    "The biggest reason this episode works so well, however, is that you could put Loki and Mobius in the most mundane of environments and they\u2019d still be engaging company. That this particular case takes them to assorted destinations in space and time \u2013 from Ancient Rome to 2050 Alabama \u2013 only serves to make show more infectious.",
    "Especially when the Loki/Mobius bickerfest isn\u2019t really the main event. The entire episode is built around the hunt for the mysterious rogue Loki, and the slow-build to a very big reveal is a masterclass in direction.",
    "\u2018The Variant\u2019 makes no secret of the fact the hooded figure we saw at the end of \u2018Glorious Purpose\u2019 is the other Loki, but has loads of fun with the tease. From possessing Hunter C-20 to take down an army of Minutemen (soundtracked by Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u2018Holding Out for a Hero\u2019) to watching CCTV screens in a giant future supermarket, Loki 2.0 is a constant, malevolent presence.",
    "And even when they step into the spotlight, they maintain a taste for the theatrical by taking over the bodies of Hunter B-15 and other unfortunate souls, before spurning Loki Prime\u2019s offers of an alliance and revealing an unexpected female face. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you,\u201d she tells male Loki, as she unleashes an audacious plot to \u201cbomb the Sacred Timeline\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a big enough deal to get Ravonna Renslayer out of her trinket-packed office.",
    "With two Lokis now on the loose in the space-time continuum, all bets are off \u2013 chaos is, after all, what Loki (or Lokis) tend to do best.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Up there with the very best episodes of WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, \u2018The Variant\u2019 is loads of fun from start to finish \u2013 a triumph of writing, acting and direction.",
    "Although the premiere episode suggested that Loki may have been reformed when he learned his fate in the Sacred Timeline, he\u2019s back at his hilarious, double-crossing best here \u2013 particularly when he\u2019s sparring with the similarly brilliant Agent Mobius. But the big news is the arrival of a female Loki who \u2013 on the evidence of her brilliantly implemented evil scheme \u2013 may actually be the superior version of the trickster god, as Mobius suggests.",
    "After an episode that does a brilliant impression of a cop show, the fact that two Lokis are now on the run hints that \u2013 entirely appropriately for the character \u2013 the show may be about to shapeshift into something entirely different again.
