    "The first of this season's March Madness Final Four games sees overall No. 2 seed Baylor take on overall No. 8 seed Houston in an all-Texas affair. This is the first time the Bears have made the National Semifinals since 1950, while the Cougars haven't got this far since 1984 - and they haven't played against each other in nearly 20 years! Read on as we explain how to get a Baylor vs Houston live stream and watch March Madness from anywhere in the world.",
    "The South Regional champions have won all but one of their four March Madness games by double-digits and have the best 3-point shooting percentage in the country (41.1%), but guard Davion Mitchell has been their main man, steering them past Villanova and Arkansas.",
    "Perhaps harshly, the Coogs still have a point to prove, having only faced double-digit seeds so far. They\u2019ve been excellent at neutralizing their opponents' top scorers, and in Quentin Grimes, who's averaging 18 points per game, they have a serious weapon of their own.",

Follow our guide below to tune into a March Madness live stream and watch Baylor vs Houston online from anywhere - including some great ways to watch March Madness free online in certain countries, if you draw up the right play.",

    "A VPN is perfect for this, as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in your country of residence, where you usual streaming services and subscriptions are based. You may be surprised by how easy it easy to get started using one, too.",
    "In some countries, you may be baffled by the fact that NCAA college basketball is just as popular as the NBA among some fans.
