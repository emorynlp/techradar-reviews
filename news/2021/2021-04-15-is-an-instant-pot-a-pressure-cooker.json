    "We\u2019re all about appliances that aim to make cooking a whole lot easier and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve rounded up our favorites in the best Instant Pots guide, but what do these cookers actually do? We\u2019ll be explaining what an Instant Pot is and whether it\u2019s the same as a pressure cooker. There\u2019ll also be some handy hacks for what you can cook in an Instant Pot.",
    "The first ever Instant Pot was invented by Dr Robert Wang, along with two friends in 2010, and it was designed to be a combination of Wang\u2019s interests in computer algorithms and cooking. Fast forward over a decade and the Instant Pot brand is now a household name.",
    "If you\u2019ve never heard of the Instant brand and you\u2019re wondering what these cookers do, we\u2019ve got all the information you need here.",
    "Instant Pots have an inner pot that generates steam when it heats up and it\u2019s this steam that cooks food quickly. The inner pot is made of stainless steel and has been designed so that heat is evenly distributed around it. A heating element and sensors beneath the inner pot work in tandem to regulate the temperature inside the cooking pot. As well as that, the lids on Instant Pots have super tight seals and lock into place so that no pressure can escape while the machine is working.",
    "Pressure cooking isn\u2019t the only function that Instant appliances have, and some models have as many as 10 functions in one. These features include yogurt making, air frying, rice cooking, steaming, searing, and more. Cooking times are usually quicker than conventional cooking because of the high temperature and pressure that these appliances use.",
    "With a pressure cooker or Instant Pot, you\u2019ll be able to create a wide range of dishes and without long cooking times either. Everything from stews and soups to chicken wings and barbecue ribs can be cooked in a pressure cooker.",
    "Instant Pots are designed to combine the work of multiple cooking appliances into one machine, so you\u2019ll be able to prepare entire meals without using your oven or cooktop. You can make homemade fries, slow cook meat, create tasty desserts, and perfect fluffy rice.",
    "If you want to get the most out of any multi-cooker, however, it\u2019s important to consider its capacity and whether that\u2019s going to be big enough for the size of your household."
