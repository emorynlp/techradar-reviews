    "Toulouse are looking for a repeat of their success as Antoine Dupont and his men return for a defence of the 2021/22 European Rugby Champions Cup. The Top 14 champs, led by world player of the year Dupont, have been drawn in a tantalising Pool B along with Premiership winners Harlequins, for whom last season's tournament proved utterly pointless. Cross your fingers for more action than we got a year ago, and read on as we explain how to watch a European Rugby Champions Cup live stream online for every 2021/22 game wherever you are.",
    "Pro14 supremos Leinster are shaping up as the top dogs in Pool A, which also features Challenge Cup reigning champions Montpellier, last season's beaten European Rugby Champions Cup finalists La Rochelle, plus 2020 winners and runners-up Exeter and Racing 92.",
    "Last season's pool stage was heavily curtailed by Covid, which continues to swing back and forth like a wrecking ball. Assuming EPCR's plans remain intact, each team will play four matches in the pool stage, before the teams ranked 1-8 progress to the round of 16, and those ranked 9-11 go into the Challenge Cup knockouts.",
    "As Europe's premier club competition, the European Rugby Champions Cup isn't simply a showcase of the greatest teams and players on the continent, but also an all-out scrap for bragging rights between leagues and nations, with France's Top 14 currently in rude health.",
