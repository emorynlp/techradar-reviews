    "It goes without saying but, if you haven\u2019t seen WandaVision episode 8 yet, turn back now. Spoilers follow.",
    "Like episode 7, WandaVision episode 8 has a mid-credits scene \u2013 but unlike last week's episode, this one is much heavier on plot. Featuring the return of Vision (sort of, anyway), the sting suggests that WandaVision episode 9 is heading towards a gigantic MCU battle within Westview.",
    "Below, we'll explain what the mid-credits scene in WandaVision episode 8 means, and how the image of a 'white' Vision has origins in Marvel's comics. We'll also take a few guesses at what next week's finale will entail.",
    "Once the main credits have rolled, we\u2019re reunited with SWORD\u2019s acting director Tyler Hayward (Josh Stamberg) in his new temporary base outside of the Hex. A soldier informs Hayward that something is ready to be \"launched\" (which was hinted at in episode 7), and we follow Hayward and his underling into a nearby tent.",
    "Hayward comments on the fact that SWORD has tried to put something back together millions of times without success, but that has now changed thanks to a new power supply \u201cdirectly from the source\u201d. The camera pans to the Stark Industries drone that Wanda destroyed back in episode five, which is still glowing with her chaos magic.",
    "Hayward instructs his team to turn an elaborate machine on, which siphons chaos magic from the drone and feeds it into a glass cabinet that houses a mysterious, white figure. The camera pans up, and, surprise surprise, it\u2019s none other than a more android form of Vision. The colorless version of the synthezoid powers up before white Vision\u2019s eyes open. The \u2018newborn\u2019 Vision looks down at his hand as Hayward and co. look on before the screen cuts to black.",
    "White Vision is the product of Hayward\u2019s Project Cataract. In WandaVision episode six, Dr. Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) hacked into SWORD\u2019s database and uncovered secret files that were only viewable to Hayward and his inner circle.",
    "Now, we know what the real motive behind this project was. As we witnessed in WandaVision episode 5, SWORD was experimenting on Vision\u2019s dead body when Wanda seemingly broke into the facility and stole his remains. Of course, one of episode eight\u2019s flashbacks shows that Hayward had doctored that security camera footage to make it look like Wanda had illegally entered SWORD\u2019s premises and violated Vision\u2019s living will to steal his body back.",
    "In fact, Wanda didn\u2019t forcefully take Vision\u2019s dead body to reanimate him. She couldn\u2019t feel his presence when she entered SWORD\u2019s laboratory and used her magic on the hole in his head where the Mind Stone should be, so she left peacefully. As a result, Hayward was able to continue his experiments on Vision\u2019s remains and bring him back online \u2013 albeit with a different complexion and apparently no memories of who he was.",
    "White Vision, or Gray Vision as he\u2019s sometimes known, has appeared in Marvel\u2019s comic books in the past. WandaVision\u2019s new aesthetic for the character is based on a well-known 1989 comic arc called 'Vision Quest'. During this storyline, Vision is abducted and dismantled by rogue United States government agents led by a character named Cameron Brock. It seems that Hayward is based on Brock but, unlike his comic counterpart, Hayward doesn\u2019t appear to have been manipulated by a time traveling entry called Immortus.",
    "The Avengers are able to recover Vision\u2019s remains, and Dr. Hank Pym is able to reassemble him. However, Simon Williams \u2013 who also goes by the superhero alias Wonder Man \u2013 refuses to help bring back Vision\u2019s old personality. Wonder Man\u2019s own brainwaves had originally been used as the foundation for Vision\u2019s emotional makeup and, given that this was done without Wonder Man\u2019s consent, Williams is dead against the idea. With no emotions to speak of and a discoloration brought on by his dismantling, Vision is resurrected as an emotionless, colorless synthezoid.",
    "White Vision ends up fighting alongside the Avengers in the comics, and his silver and purple complexion does return after he\u2019s rebuilt again down the line. We aren\u2019t sure if that will be the case for the MCU\u2019s interpretation of white Vision, but we have our thoughts on how that could work later on.",
    "Why wasn\u2019t Vision brought back as gray Vision? Well, we\u2019ve already seen Vision as a lifeless, gray version of himself in the MCU. That\u2019s the color that remained once Thanos had ripped the Mind Stone out of Vision\u2019s head in Avengers: Infinity War. It makes sense that WandaVision opted for a white version of the character, then, to prevent any confusion between these two iterations.",
    "With the white Vision now online, it appears that we\u2019ll get a three-way battle between various factions. We have Wanda, Vision and Monica on one side, Hayward and this other Vision on another, and Agatha Harkness and 'Quicksilver' at the third point of the triangle. So we can expect a typical MCU throwdown in the final episode.",
    "We didn\u2019t see Wanda\u2019s recreation of Vision in episode 8, but we know that he\u2019s en route back to her after he left Darcy in episode 7. Right now all signs point towards Vision and white Vision duking it out while Wanda and Agatha have their own skirmish, with Monica and Pietro involved in some capacity too. The mid-season trailer had a brief scene where Vision says to Wanda \u201cSo let\u2019s fight for it\u201d, which hints that the duo will battle for the town of Westview \u2013 or Wanda\u2019s altered reality version of it \u2013 so we know an MCU-style battle is coming.",
    "It\u2019s unclear what powers White Vision will possess, but he is a by-product of Wanda\u2019s chaos magic, so it stands to reason that he\u2019ll have similar powers to her or Vision. We can expect him to have superhuman strength and speed, the ability to fly, and potentially phase through objects like Vision can. What we don\u2019t know is whether white Vision has a Mind Stone-esque beam ability, as witnessed in Vision's past appearances. The mid-credits scene shows that he has an icon where Vision\u2019s head-based Mind Stone is, but it remains to be seen if that houses a superpower that white Vision can use or not.",
    "It\u2019s also possible that white Vision could be the future of the MCU\u2019s version of the character. He\u2019s already powered by Wanda\u2019s chaos magic, so she may be able to talk him round to their side. Alternatively, Wanda may find a way to transfer Vision\u2019s consciousness into white Vision, which would allow him to continue existing in the MCU post-WandaVision.",
    "That is unless this Vision imposter has to be destroyed. Given that it is Hayward\u2019s creation, he might have installed something that prevents Wanda or Vision from convincing white Vision to join their cause.",
    "If white Vision remains a foe, it may need to be killed in order to save Westview and the world, and bring Wanda some form of closure from the trauma she has endured. We\u2019ll find out how WandaVision ends, and whether Vision will be part of the MCU going forward, when the series finale releases on March 5."
