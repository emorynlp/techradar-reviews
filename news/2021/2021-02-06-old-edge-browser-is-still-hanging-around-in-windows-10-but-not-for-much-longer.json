  "summary": "Microsoft confirms that legacy Edge is being killed off in April",
  "article": [
    "Windows 10 still carries two versions of Edge as well as Internet Explorer, but the headcount of Microsoft\u2019s browsers is about to be trimmed from three to two, as the software giant has officially confirmed that it\u2019s about to kill off the old Edge.",
    "The two spins of Edge are the new Chromium-based one, and the legacy Edge that came with Windows 10 when the OS was first launched. Even if you\u2019ve already moved to the shiny new Chromium-powered Edge, the old Edge is still hanging around in the background of your system \u2013 essentially it\u2019s present, but hidden.",
    "However, with an incoming cumulative update, Microsoft has said that this legacy Edge browser will finally be completely removed from Windows 10, and those who are still using it will be compelled to switch to the new version of Edge.",
    "Clues to this happening have already been spotted earlier this week, thanks to a language pack discovered in Windows 10 21H2 preview builds, which led us to speculate that perhaps the legacy Edge was going to be ditched when that second update of 2021 arrived, later in the year.",
    "However, old Edge will get its comeuppance much sooner than that, with April 13 being the official date Microsoft has given.",
    "In a blog post flagged up by C-Net, Microsoft confirmed that official support for Edge is ending on March 9, and that: \u201cTo replace this out of support application, we are announcing that the new Microsoft Edge will be available as part of the Windows 10 cumulative monthly security update \u2013 otherwise referred to as the Update Tuesday (or \u201cB\u201d) release \u2013 on April 13, 2021.",
    "\u201cWhen you apply this update to your devices, the out of support Microsoft Edge Legacy desktop application will be removed and the new Microsoft Edge will be installed.\u201d",
    "The same thing will also happen for those who install the preview cumulative update (or \u201cC\u201d release) for March, which is an optional update.",
    "Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve already installed the new Edge \u2013 the patch won\u2019t mess with your current browser installation, or reinstall Chromium-based Edge; it will only remove the legacy Edge from Windows 10, freeing up a bit of drive space and getting rid of some system clutter."
