    "Security firm Sophos has revealed how using pirated software was the cause of a major ransomware attack that cost a major scientific organization a week\u2019s work and a lot of money.",
    "A student working at a European biomolecular research institute was allowed to use expensive data visualization software. However, he wanted a version of that software for his own device, but the license was most likely too expensive - so as a workaround, tried to install a cracked copy he found online.",
    "The crack triggered a malware warning from Microsoft Defender, which he not only ignored, but decided to disable the antivirus tool, as well as the firewall, instead. Fast-forward a few weeks later, and the incident response team from Sophos learned that the crack was actually info-stealing malware.",
    "The info-stealer was in use by a malicious third-party for a few days, doing what it does best - gathering keystrokes, stealing browser cookies, clipboard data and such. Somewhere along the way, Sophos explained, it found the student\u2019s access credentials for the institute\u2019s network.",
    "Once enough data was gathered, Ryuk ransomware was deployed. It encrypted all of the data it found on the network, and most likely demanded payment in cryptocurrency.",
    "While Sophos did not go into details how much money the operators asked for, or whether or not the institute paid the ransom, it did say that the organization lost a week\u2019s worth of data, given that its backup wasn\u2019t up to date.",
    "The institute also suffered operational impact, as all computer and server files needed to be rebuilt from the ground up, before any data could be restored.",
    "\u201cPerhaps the hardest lesson of all,\u201d Sophos says, \u201cwas discovering that the attack and its impact could have been avoided with a less trusting and more robust approach to network access.\u201d",
    "It also said that the same group that placed the info-stealer probably wasn\u2019t the same one that installed Ryuk. The most likely scenario is, once access was established, that it got sold on the dark web to the highest bidder.",
    "Pirating software is not only illegal, but also dangerous, Sophos concluded."
