    "Valve\u2019s Steam service is currently the most popular gaming platform on PC, and it may be able to extend its lead care of consoles (of all sources). A newly registered patent suggests that you could be gaming sooner in the near future, outlining a mechanic called \u201cinstant play.\u201d Players would be able to boot up their newly purchased game before it fully downloads from the client.",
    "The mechanic allows for \u201ctrack read operations,\u201d according to the patent document first spotted by SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik. This would enable game data to be read and accessed before it finishes downloading on a PC.",
    "Other features include freeing up space by discarding unused blocks of data, and \u201clocal prefetching of game data for reducing latency during gameplay.\u201d",
    "Prefetching is a method for speeding up fetch operations by beginning one whose result is expected to be needed soon, meaning that Steam games will run faster. Both of these secondary features could be especially useful for gamers, and make for a far more enjoyable gameplay experience.",
    "The concept of playing a game before it downloads is something consoles have already started, with both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems debuting the idea and PS5 and Xbox Series X continuing the tradition.",
    "Normally, there\u2019s the caveat of that game only being partially playable until the download completes. But the patent mentions an interesting phrase: \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d",
    "Though it hadn\u2019t been extrapolated on within the patent, this could be an indication that \u201cinstant play\u201d will allow for a game to be fully playable before a complete download. However, this is all mere conjecture, as Valve's announcement of its plans hasn\u2019t been, let\u2019s say, instant."
