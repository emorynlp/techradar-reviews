    "Spoilers for WandaVision follow.",
    "1970s-style credits introduce Wanda and Vision\u2019s current circumstances. \u201cWe\u2019ve got something cooking and it\u2019s looking good\u2026\u201d says the theme music, as Wanda and Vision are the model of a modern suburban lifestyle, riding tandems, cooking on the barbecue and hanging out with friends. The credits pick up the story of Wanda\u2019s sudden pregnancy, as the couple head to the shops to buy baby paraphernalia. The show is also \u201cnow in color\u201d.",
    "At Wanda and Vision\u2019s house, a doctor examines Wanda and confirms she\u2019s definitely pregnant. Vision explains how surprised they were, asking: \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d",
    "As the doctor goes into the old, \u201cwhen a man and a woman love each other very much\u2026\u201d routine, Wanda says, \u201cwe\u2019re just tickled pink\u2026 or blue.\u201d",
    "The doctor says she\u2019s about four months into her pregnancy, and \u2013 in an era-appropriate display of mansplaining \u2013 says, \u201cwe let the little ladies keep tabs on their growing babies with fruit. Makes it simple for them.\u201d Vision asks what size the fruit would be at, say, 12 hours. \u201cI think this line of questioning is fruitless,\u201d says Wanda.",
    "As the doctor leaves, he reveals that he\u2019s about to go on holiday to Bermuda. Vision asks if he can keep Wanda\u2019s pregnancy a secret from the neighbors, because everything\u2019s happening so quickly.",
    "Next door, Herb is cutting the hedge \u2013 creating a hole that\u2019s just the right size for a neighbor to peek through \u2013 and his trimmer has got stuck in the visibly fake wall underneath.",
    "Vision gets inside the house and is about to explain the weirdness of Herb\u2019s hedge-cutting mishap, when he notices that Wanda\u2019s pregnancy has advanced rapidly.",
    "Wanda uses her magic to prepare the nursery, decorating the room as Vision reads pregnancy books. Wanda accidentally brings the butterflies on the mobile to life, and one lands on Vision\u2019s nose.",
    "They discuss possible names for the children \u2013 Vision wants Billy (named after William Shakespeare, of course), while Wanda wants a \u201cclassic all-American name\u201d like Tommy. The only solution to the debate, Wanda suggests, is that they have a girl. Vision calculates that at the current rate of growth, the baby is due on Friday afternoon \u2013 just three days away.",
    "As Vision practises putting diapers on a doll, Wanda starts having Braxton Hicks contractions. They cause all the electricity and water in the kitchen to go haywire, before the power is knocked out across the whole block. Neighbor Phil is relieved when the darkness prevents him from answering his wife, Dottie\u2019s, loaded \u201cDo these earrings make me look fat?\u201d question.",
    "If a \u201cfake\u201d contraction can do all that, Wanda wonders what giving birth will do to the neighborhood. She also worries that the people of Westview are on the verge of discovering their secret. Vision agrees, but says there\u2019s more to it than that \u2013 after the dinner with Mr and Mrs Hart, and the hedge weirdness with Herb, \u201cI think something\u2019s wrong here, Wanda.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s a sudden, jarring cut and the episode jumps back to Vision agreeing with Wanda. This time, however, he doesn\u2019t talk about anything being wrong. He just says they\u2019re in uncharted waters, and admits he\u2019s anxious too. Wanda wonders if the baby will be human or synthezoid \u2013 or a bit of both.",
    "Wanda\u2019s contractions start for real and Vision rises into the air. Wanda calms him down and he\u2019s back on the ground.",
    "It starts raining in the sitting room \u2013 \u201cI think my water just broke,\u201d says Wanda.",
    "Commercial break! A stressed mom contends with a soccer ball in her breakfast, the dog peeing on the floor, a burned cake and an exploding blender. \u201cDo you need a break?\u201d asks a voice. The ad cuts to the mom in a bath on an idyllic balcony, being fanned by a servant \u2013 it\u2019s an ad for a bubble bath called Hydra Soak.",
    "Back in the living room, Wanda and Vision hide under the table until the rain stops \u2013 Wanda dries everything with a gust of wind. Vision tries to call Dr Nielson but the phones are still out. He hopes to get there before the doctor goes on holiday \u2013 when Wanda asks how the physician can go away at a time like this, Vision points out that the baby is nine months early. Vision runs out of the door at super speed.",
    "As Wanda\u2019s contractions continue, she hears bird noises coming from the nursery. Before Wanda can check them out, the door rings, so she hides her baby bump in a coat. It\u2019s Geraldine, who\u2019s looking for a bucket to bail out the house after leaking pipes have flooded it with water. Wanda goes into the kitchen to grab the bucket, but another contraction transforms her coat into a rain jacket, then a fur coat.",
    "A stork enters the living room. As Geraldine tries to leave, Wanda \u2013 now hiding her bump behind a bowl of fruit \u2013 distracts her by asking about her new temp job. Wanda tries to magic the bird away, but it doesn\u2019t work \u2013 and when the stork chatters, Wanda claims it\u2019s the new icemaker in the fridge. The deception works \u2013 Geraldine doesn\u2019t even notice when the stork grabs her trousers in its beak.",
    "Having explained she\u2019s getting a promotion at work, Geraldine wanders into the spare room looking for office supplies. She\u2019s surprised to see it filled with baby gear, but doesn\u2019t notice the stork, now returned to its original place as a painting on the wall. Wanda drops the vase and tells Geraldine the baby\u2019s coming.",
    "Conveniently, Dr Nielson\u2019s car has broken down before he can head off to Bermuda. Vision puts the doctor on his back and runs away at super speed.",
    "Geraldine helps Wanda as her magic turns the interior of the house into a telekinetic scene from The Exorcist. The baby arrives and it\u2019s a boy, but Vision and the doctor get there just too late to see the birth. Geraldine takes the doctor into the kitchen, and Vision turns back to his natural form to meet his son \u2013 Tommy. Wanda\u2019s contractions start again \u2013 she gives birth to another baby boy. The doctor thanks Geraldine for her help and, adopting his patronizing tone from earlier, tells her she \u201cmight have what it takes to be a nurse\u201d. Vision walks the doctor home in time for his vacation. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get away after all. Small towns, you know\u2026 So hard to escape.\u201d",
    "Vision sees Agnes and Herb gossiping. He asks them about the power cut \u2013 Agnes says that \u201cRalph looks better in the dark, so I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d She also asks if Geraldine is inside with Wanda.",
    "Wanda tells Geraldine that she\u2019s a twin as well, explaining that she had a brother called Pietro. She starts singing to the babies in Sokovian. \u201cHe was killed by Ultron, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d asks Geraldine. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d replies a confused Wanda.",
    "Outside, Herb points out that Geraldine is brand new in town. Agnes adds that she has no family, no husband \u2013 no home.",
    "Wanda pushes Geraldine about the Ultron question, and asks her to go. Before Geraldine leaves, Wanda spots her necklace \u2013 it features the SWORD logo.",
    "Vision asks what they mean when they say she has no home. Herb says \u201cshe came here because we\u2019re all\u2026\u201d but despite several attempts, is unable to get any further.",
    "Recognizing the SWORD symbol, Wanda asks what it means, and who Geraldine is.",
    "Herb tries to explain again, but Agnes tells him to stop and leaves in a hurry. Herb returns to his hedge trimming, tell Vision he\u2019ll \u201ccatch him on the flip side\u201d.",
    "Back in the house, Vision asks where Geraldine is. Wanda says she had to rush home.",
    "The aspect ratio morphs into full anamorphic widescreen. We see a modern version of the \u2018Welcome to Westview\u2019 sign, and a person is thrown out of a forcefield that looks like a distorted cathode-ray television picture. It\u2019s Geraldine, still dressed as she was in the \u201970s.",
    "As she lies on the grass, \u2018Daydream Believer\u2019 by the Monkees plays on the soundtrack. She\u2019s immediately surrounded by the government agents. As the camera pans out we see military buildings and floodlights pointing at the giant TV forcefield, still crackling.",
    "PLEASE STAND BY.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Three episodes in, it\u2019s no surprise that WandaVision\u2019s homage to \u201970s sitcoms is just as pitch-perfect as its odes to the \u201950s and \u201960s. From the bright, vibrant colors and unlikely fashions to the delivery of the gags, much of this episode feels like it could have been made more than four decades ago. Even the matte painting backgrounds making a TV studio look like a suburban street seem authentically dated.",
    "But despite the faithful recreation of TV past, there\u2019s never been a sitcom episode quite like \u2018Now in Color\u2019. While Wanda\u2019s rapid pregnancy and its powerful impact on the front room are what drives the narrative (the baby\u2019s growth being illustrated by carefully placed fruit), this instalment is as much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe beyond the sitcom stage.",
    "Some of the hints are subtle \u2013 Dr Nielson pointing out that small towns are \u201chard to escape\u201d, Herb\u2019s abortive attempts to explain why there\u2019s something odd about Geraldine \u2013 but by the end of the episode it\u2019s clear we\u2019re not in Kansas any more.",
    "The WandaVision publicity machine has long since confirmed that Teyonah Parris is playing Monica Rambeau in the show, so it\u2019s hardly big news that there\u2019s more to Geraldine than meets the eye. Even so, her Ultron slip-up is a really powerful moment \u2013 as is her arrival back in the 'real' world.",
    "It\u2019s now confirmed that the sitcom worlds of WandaVision exist on the other side of some kind of televisual forcefield, and government forces \u2013 presumably SWORD? \u2013 clearly know something\u2019s up. As for what\u2019s causing Wanda and Vision's trip through TV nostalgia, your guess is as good as ours \u2013 especially as the series has already picked up the habit of teasing Marvel villains like the Grim Reaper and Superia.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
