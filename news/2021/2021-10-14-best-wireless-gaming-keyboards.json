    "Only a few devices stand out as the best wireless gaming keyboards even in 2021. That\u2019s despite the fact that there are so many excellent gaming keyboards and wireless technology has come a long way since it was first implemented on gaming peripherals. Not that there aren\u2019t a whole lot of options out there, but because there is only a small number of them that can truly deliver the level of performance ideal for gaming.",
    "The upside is that it makes picking the ideal wireless gaming keyboard for you a whole lot easier. And, if you\u2019re seriously considering going wireless for gaming, you\u2019ll be glad to know that these select few offer the kind of speed, accuracy, and reliability worthy of their wired counterparts. Combine those with the convenience of being cable-free and portable, and you\u2019ve got yourself a whole different experience when playing the best PC games \u2013 one that won\u2019t anchor you to any desk or setup.",
    "Take a look at the best wireless keyboards for gaming below. While we haven\u2019t reviewed all of them, we have tested every single one, whether personally or professionally, so we can certainly attest to their gaming prowess. And because wireless gaming keyboards aren\u2019t going to be cheap, we\u2019ve also included our price comparison tool to help you score a cheap deal.",
    "It may not be the best option if you\u2019re on a budget, but trust us when we say that the Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro is worth the splurge. This full mechanical keyboard comes with all the premium trimmings, making it worth the money. It\u2019s got an impressively robust build thanks to its aluminum construction and doubleshot keycaps so you know it\u2019ll last you for years to come. At the same time, it also has your comfort in mind thanks to its satisfying keys and incredibly plush wrist rest. It\u2019s also very versatile with a Razer HyperSpeed wireless and three Bluetooth connections, all of which are equally reliable in range and responsiveness. For gaming, there is no wireless keyboard better than this.",
    "Logitech\u2019s G915 TKL Lightspeed is one of our favorite gaming keyboards, and that\u2019s not just because it\u2019s one of the best looking ones out there. This wireless gaming keyboard is already thin and light, but it\u2019s even more portable thanks to its tenkeyless format. It hasn\u2019t compromised on comfort or performance either. This keyboard is incredibly satisfying to use while staying impressively fast and responsive with its 1000Hz polling rate and 1.5 mm actuation distance. With a battery life of 40 hours at 100% RGB brightness, you can rest assured you can enjoy all that immersive gaming for longer.",

    "Out of all the mini keyboards we\u2019ve tested that came out recently, Razer\u2019s BlackWidow V3 Mini might be the best one yet. It\u2019s extremely comfortable to use while also oozing in style, quality, and performance. But, that\u2019s not all. For a compact keyboard, it\u2019s also very versatile, with three connectivity options \u2013 two wireless, one USB-C \u2013 and fully programmable keys with on-the-fly macro recording, which means that you won\u2019t have to use Razer\u2019s software to create and program macros. For a fun design spin, Razer has rolled out its Phantom Edition whose keys come with translucent sides to give it more of a floating keys effect that allows its already stunning RGB lighting to really shine.",

    "At less than an inch thick and 36.2 ounces, the Logitech G915 Lightspeed is not just portable, it\u2019s extremely travel-friendly. Combine that with its wireless nature, onboard memory that lets you store three sets of G-keys macro profiles, and top-notch performance, and this is the gaming keyboard you want to take with you if you want to game on the go with a full-sized keyboard. That\u2019s especially because it\u2019s an absolute stunner as well with its brushed aluminum deck, floating low-profile keys, and bright RGB lighting. For more convenience, it also comes with media controls and dedicated buttons that will let you toggle quickly between the two connections.",
    "The Corsair K63 Wireless might be a bit of an oldie, but it\u2019s most certainly still a goodie. It\u2019s not only completely devoid of input delays and drop-outs, delivering an impeccable gaming performance that will make you forget that it\u2019s wireless, but it also delivers up to 75 hours of battery life when you have backlighting turned off. Better yet, it lets you assign macros to any key, which you can then take with you everywhere you go due to its onboard memory. What\u2019s more, unlike other offerings on here, it\u2019s less than $120/\u00a3120, which makes it a great choice for budget-minded gamers.",
