    "Another day, another frustrating attempt to connect headphones to a smart TV.",
    "As a TV reviewer, a lot of screens come my way, and the biggest pain of the testing process is no doubt getting my various gear \u2013 games consoles, streaming devices, audio accessories, and streaming service accounts \u2013 all set up and good to go. And I can\u2019t help but wonder why connecting wireless headphones, in particular, is usually so much of a bother.",
    "While some smart TVs these days still come with cabled headphone outputs, it\u2019s an increasingly rare sight \u2013 and rightly so, given the rise of wireless audio and the fact that wired headphones rarely come with a cable long enough to watch TV comfortably at the same time.",
    "There are plenty of wireless headphones to choose from, including dedicated headphones for TV watching that can carry 5.1 (or even 7.1) channel audio as well as active noise cancellation to keep out the sound of your family, friends and home. But it\u2019s perfectly possible to connect bog-standard wireless earbuds or over-ear cans and enjoy some solo audio time.",
    "It\u2019s possible, that is, but not always intuitive. I\u2019ve had plenty of issues just trying to find the correct settings \u2013 which tend to be hidden far away from the Audio settings you\u2019d think they would be housed in. Anker projectors like the Nebula Solar Portable (which features Android TV) keep the connection options under Remotes & Accessories, rather than Audio \u2013 while new Panasonic OLED TVs with HomeMyScreen keep them under a Setup submenu (Setup > Bluetooth Setup > Bluetooth Audio) rather than Sound.",
    "If you\u2019re familiar with this quirk of connection settings, it\u2019s not too hard to figure out what to do \u2013 though even then the experience isn\u2019t always seamless.",
    "TV reviewer and calibration specialist Vincent Teoh, from HDTVTest, says that \u201cI don't think it's a priority for TV manufacturers,\u201d and that \u201cif it's not a priority, TV manufacturers generally won't allocate resources to implement it.\u201d",
    "That somewhat echoes the official response from Anker, which tells us that \u201cBluetooth isn\u2019t an essential feature,\u201d with only \u201caround a quarter\u201d of their customers tending to use it with their projector range.",
    "When connecting to Panasonic TVs, it\u2019s important to set the sound to 'Bluetooth Only' to ensure the TV remote is controlling the headphones themselves. But we found that the touch controls on our high-end, over-ear Sony WH-1000XM4 cans simply wouldn\u2019t work when they were connected to the Panasonic JZ2000, which felt like an odd ability to lose in that context.",
    "And it\u2019s clear that the lack of interest in Bluetooth connectivity in TVs \u2013 partially from manufacturers, and partially from users, most of whom don\u2019t use the feature regularly if at all \u2013 is causing occasional blind spots like these, where compatibility with headphones only goes so far. Sometimes, as with the LG E9 OLED we reviewed back in 2019, the Bluetooth connectivity simply won\u2019t work at all.",
    "To Panasonic\u2019s credit, it did include a new dual Bluetooth feature in its 2021 TV range, allowing you to have separate volume settings for two connected headphones \u2013 and dual connection is now the norm on the new Apple TV 4K for the Apple AirPods too.",
    "But there\u2019s clearly a long way to go before Bluetooth implementation in smart TVs is as seamless and easily accessible as it is to switch between picture presets at the press of a button.",
    "For those who want to watch TV and films with their headphones, there are avenues available to do so \u2013 just don\u2019t expect it to be as simple as it should be for a good while yet."
