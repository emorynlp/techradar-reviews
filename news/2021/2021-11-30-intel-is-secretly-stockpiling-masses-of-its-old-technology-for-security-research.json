  "article": [
    "Computing giant Intel reportedly operates a warehouse somewhere in Costa Rica where it stockpiles its older chips, and makes them available remotely to internal cybersecurity researchers.",
    "Sharing details about Intel\u2019s Long-Term Retention Lab, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) notes that Intel had the idea of having one in mid-2018, and had it up and running before the end of 2019.",
    "Explaining the need for the facility, WSJ says that it helps Intel ensure that its older silicon, which might still be in use in the real-world, isn\u2019t vulnerable to attacks.",
    "Anders Fogh, a Germany-based senior principal engineer at Intel, told WSJ that the lab has become an integral part of his work, and helps him replicate security flaws reported to Intel by outside researchers through its bug-bounty program.",
    "According to WSJ, the warehouse stores around 3,000 pieces of hardware and software, going back about a decade.",
    "Fogh shares that the facility can help him create an exact replica of the system that a security researcher used to find and report a vulnerability.",
    "\u201cI can make an exact replica of the submitting researcher\u2019s system. Same CPU, same operating system version, microcode, BIOS,\u201d said Fogh.",
    "However, sourcing some components was a challenge when Intel originally planned the lab. One such hard to get platform were the Sandy Bridge microprocessors, discontinued in 2013.",
    "\u201cWe had to actually go on eBay and start looking for these platforms,\u201d Mohsen Fazlian, general manager of Intel\u2019s product assurance and security unit told the WSJ.",
    "The facility has now become a fundamental part of Intel\u2019s product development, with technical documentation boldly announcing decade-long support for new Intel chips owing to the lab. In fact, Fazlian claims that new chips are sent to the lab even before they are released.",
