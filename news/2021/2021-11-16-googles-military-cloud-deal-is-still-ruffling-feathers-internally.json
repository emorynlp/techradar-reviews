  "article": [
    "Google has confirmed it is still pursuing a multi-billion-dollar contract with the US Government\u2019s Department of Defense (DoD).",
    "During a recent all-hands company meeting, a question was raised that more than 1,000 of Google\u2019s employees said they wanted answered: whether or not Google is actively pursuing the US government\u2019s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) program; and what makes this program different from the previous Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program, for which Google said it didn\u2019t want to bid for as it conflicted with its AI principles.",
    "Explaining the difference, cloud boss Thomas Kurian said the company would be \u201cproud\u201d to work with the DoD, CNBC reported.",
    "\u201cIf selected as one of the compliant vendors, we are proud to work with the DoD to help modernize their operations,\u201d Kurian reportedly said. \u201cThere will be many areas where our product capabilities and our engineering expertise can be brought to bear with no conflict to Google\u2019s AI principles.\u201d",
    "Google\u2019s AI principles state the company will not pursue technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm; weapons, or other technologies designed specifically to hurt people; surveillance tech that \u201cviolates internationally accepted norms\u201d, or technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law.",
    "Whether or not the majority of Google\u2019s employees oppose this idea is yet to be seen. What we do know, is that Google\u2019s employees are vocal and politically charged, and have no problem voicing their opinion or even quitting their job in protest.",
    "Google\u2019s Project Maven, for example, prompted the company\u2019s employees to sign petitions against it, while some quit. Maven allowed the U.S. government to analyze drone video with AI.",
    "\u201cWe understand that not every Googler will agree with this decision,\u201d Kurian said. \u201cBut we believe Google Cloud should seek to serve the government where it is capable of doing so and where the work meets Google\u2019s principles and our company\u2019s values.\u201d",
    "Further explaining the company\u2019s position in a blog post, Kurian said the JWCC was \u201cessential to the success of the Department and the government in reducing costs, driving innovation, increasing productivity, and enhancing cybersecurity.\u201d",
    "As the government is yet to issue a request for a proposal, the details are scarce and Google hasn\u2019t put in a bid just yet.",
