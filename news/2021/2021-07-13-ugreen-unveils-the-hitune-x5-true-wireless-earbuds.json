    "UGREEN has brought a ton of electronic accessories to the consumer tech market from power adapters and USB hubs to styluses and wireless earbuds, and the company has just introduced the latest product to its lineup of True Wireless Stereo (TWS) solutions: the HiTune X5 Wireless Earbuds.",
    "The HiTune X5 True Wireless Earbuds ($49.99) offer a unique design and come at an affordable price point, but they still squeeze in a Qualcomm QCC3040 SoC with aptX to deliver higher-fidelity audio. Best of all, they\u2019ve been designed to meet the needs of every user.",
    "With low-latency transmission, a dependable Bluetooth 5.2 connection, CVC 8.0 Noise Cancellation and up to 28 hours of playtime, the HiTune X5s are ready for whatever situation comes their way, whether that\u2019s lengthy calls, marathon streaming sessions or frantic mobile gaming.",
    "The HiTune X5s are powered by a Qualcomm QCC 3040 SoC, providing them with the benefits of the aptX codec. That means you\u2019ll get a greater depth of sound and a more precise audio experience, whether listening to music, making calls or gaming on the go.",
    "That audio will come through a pair of 10mm dynamic drivers with dual-flexible diaphragms, boost performance in mid-to-low frequencies. Also, UGREEN's signature Superbass Low-frequency Enhancement Technology pumps up the audio experience for rock, rap, and hip-hop tracks. Together these two features provide a punchy bass well beyond what you\u2019d normally expect from a compact earbud.",
    "Performance and immersion are taken to the next level with a low latency of just 70ms and dependable Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, so your audio and video stay in sync and the sound doesn\u2019t drop out.",
    "The HiTune X5s have been designed to deliver an audio experience that\u2019s as comfortable as it is immersive. The X5s provide a smart middle-ground between conventional buds and short-stemmed earphones, aiming for improved ergonomics with a shorter, oval-shaped stem that provides stability. Meanwhile, their 30-degree in-ear angle ensures a snug fit that matches the natural contours of the ear.",
    "As TWS earbuds have become more than a utility and are something of a fashion accessory, the HiTune X5s add a touch of elegance with a signature design reminiscent of a starry night sky.",
    "The latest Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity offers large upgrades in audio stability and video synchronization with reduced interference. And with it comes Qualcomm TrueWireless Mirroring technology to ensure the Bluetooth connection automatically adjusts from one earbud to the other, for a superior experience free from audio dropouts.",
    "The HiTune X5 True Wireless Earbuds offer ultra-clear call quality thanks to built-in ENC noise cancellation using four MEMS microphones and an advanced CVC 8.0 (Clear Voice Capture) algorithm. These technologies combine to effectively filter out 91% of ambient sounds and echoes, so you can make crystal-clear calls no matter the background noise.",
    "No matter your plans, the HiTune X5s will last as long as you need. A single charge of the earbuds can let you listen for about seven hours non-stop, and the portable charging case will let you get a total of 28 hours of battery life. The USB-C charging case takes only 90 minutes to fully recharge, and a quick 15-minute charge will let you get an hour of playback if you\u2019re crunched for time.",
    "On top of that extensive battery life, UGREEN\u2019s latest TWS earbuds are IPX5 rated, ensuring sweat and water splashes from your gym routine or outdoor activities won\u2019t stand in the way of your jams.",
    "UGREEN\u2019s HiTune X5 True Wireless Earbuds launched globally on July 6 on the UGREEN official website, Amazon, AliExpress, Lazada, and Shopee at a recommended retail price of $49.99.",
    "If you jump on them during the first two weeks after launch, you can snag a 30% launch discount. You can register your interest on UGREEN\u2019s official website to claim the offer.",
