    "The Asus ROG Phone 5 could be one of the best gaming phones of the year, and it\u2019s launching very soon, as Asus has confirmed that it\u2019s being unveiled on March 10.",
    "The company has posted a countdown timer on its website saying as much, and the Asus ROG Phone 5 name is mentioned, so there\u2019s no mystery about what\u2019s being announced. This is surprisingly early for it though, as the Asus ROG Phone 3 wasn\u2019t unveiled until July of last year.",
    "If you\u2019re wondering what happened to the ROG Phone 4, you\u2019re not alone. Asus recently confirmed that it was skipping that number, and while it didn\u2019t say why, it\u2019s likely because the number four is considered unlucky in some regions.",
    "So what can you expect from the Asus ROG Phone 5? Well, other than the name and the announcement date we don\u2019t know much for sure, but leaks and rumors suggest it will have a 6.78-inch screen, a 6,000mAh battery with 65W charging, a top-end Snapdragon 888 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and a 64MP main camera.",
    "All in all then it sounds like it could be a true gaming powerhouse, which is exactly what we\u2019d expect, given that we felt the same about the Asus ROG Phone 3 in our four-star review.",
    "We\u2019ll know for sure what the Asus ROG Phone 5 is set to offer soon, and TechRadar will cover the announcement in full, so check back on March 10 for all the details.",
