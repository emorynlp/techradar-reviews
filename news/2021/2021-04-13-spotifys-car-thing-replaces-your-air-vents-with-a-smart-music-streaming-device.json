    "Spotify has announced that its Car Thing experiment will become an official product that will ship to selected Spotify Premium customers.",
    "Car Thing, an unfortunately chosen name for a streaming media player, works by syncing up with your car\u2019s stereo system, either via Bluetooth or with an included 3.5mm aux cable. The idea is that Car Thing will work with all older cars that don\u2019t use CarPlay or Android Auto, and still rely on older head units for their audio.",
    "When it\u2019s synced, Car Thing displays your favorite music, podcasts, playlists and trending content on Spotify, which can then be selected using touch controls, the dial, four quick select buttons or the built-in voice assistant that can be summoned by saying \u201cHey Spotify\u201d.",
    "The player is expected to cost $79.99 (around \u00a360, AU$100) when it\u2019s available to the public, but Spotify will make it available for just $6.99 (the shipping cost in the US) for Spotify Premium subscribers who sign up on Spotify\u2019s website to get one during the limited window. Unfortunately, though, it's available only in the US for now for a limited time and Spotify has yet to announce global availability.",
    "Spotify made the announcement about Car Thing on its blog, emphasizing that the device was made in response to the issue that its everyday users face \u2013 namely, getting Spotify to play on older cars for their morning commute. To that end, Spotify says, don\u2019t expect it to turn into a hardware company overnight:",
    "\u201cOur focus remains on becoming the world\u2019s number one audio platform \u2013 not on creating hardware \u2013 but we developed Car Thing because we saw a need from our users, many of whom were missing out on a seamless and personalized in-car listening experience.",
    "\u201cNo matter the year or model of your vehicle, we feel everyone should have a superior listening experience,\u201d Spotify said in the blog post.",
    "Admittedly, smartphones can do a lot of what the Car Thing can do \u2013 like play music on Spotify using a voice assistant over Bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable \u2013 but Spotify's player is certainly a unique solution that gets a lot of style points."
