  "article": [
    "It feels like we\u2019ve been hearing about the Apple Glasses for decades. Or at least that\u2019s how it seems. Patents date back to 2015 detailing software and hardware that could lead to consumer-facing smart glasses.",
    "Since 2019, the Apple Glass rumors and leaks have streamed in. It feels like every few months we get another big report detailing a possible release date and features. But so far, we\u2019re not all wearing Apple-branded smart specs.",
    "Right now it looks like the Apple Glasses will be announced in 2022, but could be released in 2023 or even after. But this is just the most recent of a long string of posited windows, so it's hard to really know the truth.",
    "Meanwhile, Apple continues to release its typical suite of iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Macs, and Apple TVs. Heck, aside from the cancelled AirPower charging mat, there's no hint that Apple is even developing anything beyond its current lineup.",
    "We might not even see Apple Glasses from the company soon. A recent rumor suggested that Apple will release a pricey VR-focused headset first with some AR elements potentially in 2022, with the AR-focused headset we presume to be the Apple Glasses following by 2023 at the earliest.",
    "So there's a lot of confusion and debate around when or even if we'll get Apple glasses or these various rumors all refer to the same headset. However, the latest leaks suggest they might be announced within the next year, but don\u2019t expect them to hit stores until a lot later.",
    "While you try and get your head around all that, let's take a look at all the Apple glasses leaks and rumors, as well as Apple's augmented reality background and why AR specs seemed like the next big move for the tech giant.",
    "The biggest leak on that front has detailed a lot of things. According to Jon Prosser (a reliable leaker), the Apple Glasses will be called Apple Glass and will be capable of displaying information on both lenses, with a user controlling them via gestures both on and in front of the frames.",
    "All the processing would apparently be handled by a connected iPhone, and Apple Glass supposedly wouldn't have conventional cameras but would have a LiDAR scanner to power AR experiences. A rumor in early 2021 reaffirmed that LiDAR would be part of the Apple Glass \u2013 along with six lenses, though it was unclear if this referred to layered glass or camera lenses.",
    "Other details from the source include that there apparently won't be a sunglasses version, as the display doesn't work with tinted lenses, that observers won't be able to tell the lenses are displaying anything, and that the frame - at least in a prototype - is made from plastic.",
    "The same source also said that Apple is experimenting with a special Steve Jobs Edition version of the glasses. That would act like an Apple Watch Edition where the company sells a certain style of its product for a higher price.",
    "Another source for Apple leaks - Mark Gurman at Bloomberg - has also said the previous information isn't correct though, so take all of this with a big pinch of salt. A later report from him cites sources claiming the AR glasses are still in very early development and won't come out until at least 2023, but will be preceded by an Apple VR headset that could come in 2022.",
    "Beyond that, Apple has been busy picking up companies with an interest in AR, which suggests it's prepping a product of its own \u2013 and recently Cook said that Apple had several new products in the pipeline that could \"blow you away\".",
    "We've also seen a bunch of Apple patents appear recently, explaining how specially-designed lenses could be used to cast images on a user's eye, and how a touchscreen surface (like an iPhone or an iPad) could be used as a controller.",
    "One patent points to glasses with adjustable opacity, which might help add focus to a video, for example, or aid visibility on a particularly bright day.",
    "Apple also filed a patent for a catadioptric optical system \u2013 a series of lenses designed to project images into a user\u2019s eyes \u2013 in early February this year.",
    "In fact, Apple has been granted 53 patents, covering its AR wearable, 3D mapping technology, and a more intelligent iPhone Home screen, amongst others, as discovered by Patently Apple.",
    "Perhaps most telling of all is a leaked injury report out of Apple\u2019s Cupertino headquarters, which suggests Apple is working on a \u201cprototype unit\u201d which has resulted in eye injuries for two users.",
    "Apple has also made a number of key AR talent hires over the years. According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple has poached a leading employee of Nasa for the project, hiring Jeff Norris, founder of the Mission Operations Innovation Office of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab.",
    "He is said to be working as part of an augmented reality team being headed up by another poached talent, Dolby Labs executive Mike Rockwell.",
    "That team is apparently 1,000 people strong, and the AR glasses they're working on are said to have a high-resolution display, cameras, 3D scanning, and \"advanced human detection\". They're also apparently working on an AR headset, which could launch first with a design like the Oculus Quest, but a lightweight, comfortable build.",
    "In May 2020, Apple confirmed it had acquired NextVR, a startup that produced virtual reality content from the likes of the NBA and Fox Sports. While it's unclear how this could impact the Apple AR Glasses, it's logical the startup's expertise will contribute to product design in some way.",
    "While the glasses weren't announced during the iPhone 12 launch in October 2020 as was rumored, we did hear a rumor from display expert Ross Young that they'd use Sony half-inch microOLED displays with 1280 x 960 resolution, combining for a pixels-per-inch (ppi) density over 3000.",
    "You're familiar with the concept of virtual reality, right? Popping on a headset and having software transport you to an interactive, 360-degree, left, right, up, down, all-encompassing virtual world?",
    "Augmented reality works a bit like that but with one big difference. Rather than giving a window into an invented world, it uses either screens or transparent lenses to place digital items on top of the real world around you \u2013 'augmenting' what you can already see.",
    "The most popular example of this in action would be the lenses and filters available on Instagram and Snapchat \u2013 the ones that make it look like you have a squashed face, a dog's tongue or hearts coming out of your eyeballs.",
    "Another great example of well-executed and mainstream AR is Pok\u00e9mon Go which puts Pikachu and co into your world through a combination of your phone\u2019s camera and screen.",
    "Both see your real world 'augmented' by software on your smart device. Essentially, AR lets you get context sensitive digital information overlaid onto your real world surroundings \u2013 look at a subway station and get train times automatically displayed, for instance, or walk down the aisles of a food store and have the specs recommend a recipe. The applications could be exciting and used for games and entertainment or just extremely boring and extremely practical.",
    "Augmented reality could also get a significant boost thanks to the advent of 5G. In fact, many believe 5G could prove instrumental to augmented reality finally hitting the mainstream \u2013 at least for those in the UK.",
    "First launched back in 2017, ARKit was Apple's way of sticking its flag down into the augmented reality landscape, an attempt to claim the space as its own.",
    "First revealed at WWDC 2017, ARKit is a new set of APIs to let developers build augmented reality applications for Apple devices. They can now create apps that use the cameras, processors and sensors in your iPhone or iPad and use this information to overlay virtual objects onto the real world.",
    "It's now in its third version, with the latest iteration arriving with iOS 13 in September 2019.",
    "Users don't necessarily know that an app has been created with ARKit \u2013 there's no label \u2013 but they'll see a fun, AR experience. For example, the IKEA app allows you to hold up your iPhone and 'preview' how furniture will look.",
    "Apple ARKit is already bringing augmented reality to the forefront of consumer technology \u2013 but it's just a platform. It's long been suggested that the real future of Apple\u2019s augmented reality road map would be AR glasses.",
    "After all, Apple\u2019s in need of a new product category. The last time the tech giant launched an inarguably successful new product line was the iPad \u2013 and even that has proved difficult to maintain momentum in.",
    "AR is an exciting new area, and one in which Apple (at least in hardware terms) wouldn\u2019t have much competition in, at least in the present with a mainstream and consumer focus.",
    "Tim Cook has sung the praises of AR tech, going so far as to say augmented reality use will become as common as \"eating three meals a day\".",
    "\"A significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day,\" he said during the 2016 Utah Tech tour, before casting shade on VR.",
    "\"I can't imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you're sitting in here with me,\" said Cook to those assembled for the Utah talk.",
    "\"AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there,\" he added.",
    "\"But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.\"",
    "Recent reports suggest Apple's VR headset and AR Glasses might not be here yet, but Apple already plans to focus on VR, AR and MR (that's mixed reality) in a big way in the future.",
    "Regular Apple analyst and insider Ming-Chi Kuo has shared new details about the company\u2019s mixed reality ambitions, detailing a first generation device that will set the bar for premium virtual reality and augmented reality hardware to come. There could then be a quick turnaround for a follow-up, second generation device shortly after. What we're saying is, whatever Apple cooks up in the next few years will be only the beginning of its mixed reality ambitions.",
    "Right now, there are a number of augmented reality glasses already on the market from companies like Vuzix, Epson and Vue. But many of them are reserved for enterprise use (in big businesses), are being used by developers or have been built for a rather niche purpose.",
    "There are also mixed reality headsets, like the Microsoft Hololens 2, which sits somewhere between VR and AR. As well as one of the most exciting AR headsets, the Magic Leap One.",
    "The main difference between these devices and the promise of AR glasses made so infamous by Google Glass, is AR glasses were tipped to be smaller, slimmer and could easily be mistaken for regular glasses. The Magic Leap One is an extraordinary piece of kit, but not exactly what Apple would have in store with AR specs.",
    "There could also be mounting competition from other big tech giants. For example, in July, details were leaked about a patent, which suggests Samsung might be working on its own pair of AR specs.",
    "Spotted by Patently Apple, the filing shows a fairly standard design for a pair of glasses with added smarts on board. They're going to be foldable, apparently, so you can pop them in your pocket when you're not being wowed by AR.",
    "What's more, according to a patent filed by Huawei at the World Intellectual Property Organization (and spotted by LetsGoDigital), the company is experimenting with a pair of AR glasses that are lightweight but only work when you insert your smartwatch into them.",
    "It's also not a surprise to hear that Facebook, which owns Oculus, has also been rumored to be working on its own AR eyewear.",
    "According to a 2017 patent, Facebook's AR glasses could use a \u2018waveguide display' to combine computer graphics with the real world \u2013 essentially an advanced method of giving the illusion of depth on specs right in front of your face.",
    "Based on the patent images, the AR glasses could look just like a regular pair of glasses, which means there will be lot of complex, miniaturized technology to get right before they can be released.",
    "This means Apple may not be releasing its own AR glasses anytime soon, but its competitors might be just a year or two away.",
    "Of course we can't talk about AR specs without mentioning the legacy of Google Glass. These advanced smart glasses were tipped to change everything, from tech to the way we live, by overlaying layers of information onto the real world. But thanks to public perception, financial problems and design challenges they never fully materialised \u2013 apart from for a small number of developers and testers.",
    "Well, at least not how they were meant to. Google Glass is still around, but exists as the Glass Enterprise Edition aimed at business use.",
    "Although the troubled story of Google Glass may sound like a bit of a failure (at least when it comes to consumer traction), it actually taught tech companies a great deal about building AR, tech-enabled eyewear and the challenges of bringing a whole new product category to market."
