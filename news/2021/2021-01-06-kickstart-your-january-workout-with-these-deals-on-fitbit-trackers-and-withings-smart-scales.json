    "Everyone knows it's hard to commit to your workout goals - not only do we lead incredibly busy lives, but it's just difficult to find a plan and stick to it. Thankfully, a wide array of fitness tech deals - from smart scales to trackers - can help motivate us by giving a little bit of impetus and order to our workouts. Sure, they can't actually get us up off the sofa, but they do help motivate us by letting us track our progress effectively.",
    "This Withings Body+ smart scale for $79 at Amazon for example is an excellent way to get accurate measurements of your BMI and muscle mass, plus an accurate log of your progress over time. It's currently ranked our best smart scale over here at TechRadar and what's more, it's $20 off its original price right now, making it a great time to pick one up.",
    "Fitbit deals like the Fitbit Inspire 2 for $78.95 (was $99) and Fitbit Versa 2 for $149.95 (was $179) at Amazon are also fantastic additions to any setup too. Again, these are some of the best Fitbits available currently, and regardless of whether you're looking to track your runs, workouts, rides, or any number of activities, they'll give you really effective metrics to gauge your progress and overall fitness. They'll even measure how effective your sleeping patterns are - an integral part of your workout recovery and overall health.",
    "Lastly, we've got a few more bonus fitness deals we've included in more detail just down below. If you're looking for some appropriate headphones, sportswear, or even an excellent deal on a massage device, then they're well worth checking out.",
    "We also have plenty of other fitness guides elsewhere on the site that will help you achieve your goals this year. The best running watches will help you track your progress, for example, while the best home workout apps will motivate you to keep moving while you can't get to the gym."
