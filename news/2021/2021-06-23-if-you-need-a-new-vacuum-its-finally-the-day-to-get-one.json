    "Amazon's Prime Day is all over for another year, and most of the substantial savings we saw have now finished. However, there are still some bargains to be had when it comes to vacuum cleaners if you know where to look. We've pulled together a list of the best deals that are still running on June 23 and beyond.",
    "During Prime Day we saw some of the lowest prices we\u2019ve ever seen on leading brands such as Shark, Bissell, and, iRobot Roomba. It wasn't just older, and perhaps not as popular models that were reduced either. There were deals for models that are bestsellers and perform exceptionally well for users and in our tests.",
    "If your old vacuum is looking worse for wear or you just need something more powerful to clean your home, press that Buy Now button as soon as possible, as we don't know how long these deals will be around. Alternatively, get ready for the next big sale event and bookmark our Amazon Black Friday deals page.",
