    "Substack has announced an expansion to its email marketing services with some exciting features to jazz up your newsletters.",
    "From today, Substack users will be able to make use of various customization options as part of a new Themes feature. With Themes, it is now possible to adjust your newsletter welcome page, homepage, post, and accent colors, as well as select from a few different font styles. There will also now be two different homepage layouts to choose from.",
    "While the options aren\u2019t exactly extensive, they will give Substack users a few more options to help them stand out from one another. Previously, there was little difference in the appearance of Substack newsletters, save for the profile pictures and link colors. Users can edit their newsletter theme from the \u2018Settings\u2019 page.",
    "The addition of Themes is not the only update announced by Substack. During the company\u2019s one-day virtual conference Substack On, it was also confirmed that writers will soon be able to create sub-lists of followers so they can tailor their output. These could be long-term followers or new readers, for example.",
    "Substack also confirmed the launch of a \u2018multipub\u2019 tool that will allow users to combine multiple newsletters and other content into a single publication. This feature is expected to launch next month. Of course, Substack doesn\u2019t just cater to writers\u2019 needs. Last month, the platform also added Substack Reader, a new space to help readers manage all their newsletters.",
    "Since its launch in 2017, Substack has attracted some pretty high-profile writers, many of whom run their own subscription publications. They\u2019ll no doubt make use of the new Themes feature to help differentiate themselves, as well as the other writer-focused features that Substack is planning for the future.",
