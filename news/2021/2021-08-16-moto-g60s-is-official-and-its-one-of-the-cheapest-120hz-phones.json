    "Motorola is a champion when it comes to cheap phones, and the new Moto G60s \u2013 which has now been confirmed to be coming to the UK - is a prime example of that.",
    "Hitting stores in the coming weeks and starting at \u00a3219.99 (around $305 / AU$415), this has a 6.8-inch Full HD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a big 5,000mAh battery that you can apparently get 12 hours of power from with just a 12-minute charge thanks to 50W charging.",
    "It also has a MediaTek Helio G95 chipset, 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and a quad-lens camera, with a 64MP main sensor joined by an 8MP ultra-wide and a 5MP macro lens, alongside a 2MP depth sensor, plus 128GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a dedicated Google Assistant button.",
    "The Moto G60s also includes the brand\u2019s ThinkShield for Mobile platform, designed to offer enhanced security, and it comes in Iced Mint and Ink Blue shades.",
    "Those specs for that money sound decent on paper, with the refresh rate and battery size being particular highlights \u2013 though cheap phones often have big batteries anyway.",
    "There's no 5G and the amount of available RAM sounds less impressive, particularly the 4GB version, but compromises always have to be made with cheap phones. So if your priorities are battery life and screen quality then the Moto G60s seems on paper to be a promising choice. Or at least in the UK it does \u2013 at the time of writing there\u2019s no word on if or when it will come to the US or Australia.",
    "It was only a few years ago that a 120Hz refresh rate was considered a premium feature on a phone. Now though, phones like the Moto G60s have this spec. But while it\u2019s less premium than it once was, there aren\u2019t many phones quite this cheap that have a 120Hz refresh rate.",
    "This isn\u2019t quite the most affordable of them, with the Xiaomi Poco X3 NFC also having a 120Hz display and costing just \u00a3199 (about $250, AU$360). But that\u2019s an outlier \u2013 most 120Hz phones are more in the mid-range and above.",
    "In fact, even some high-end phones still don\u2019t have a 120Hz refresh rate. The iPhone 12 range for example doesn\u2019t, so having this on the Moto G60s gives the phone a major selling point."
