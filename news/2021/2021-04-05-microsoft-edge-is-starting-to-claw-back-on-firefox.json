    "Mozilla\u2019s Firefox internet browser is bleeding users, and it appears many are switching over to Microsoft Edge. According to a report from market analysts StatCounter, Edge has a global market share of just above 8% for the desktop platform, and holds the number three position, behind Google Chrome (67%) and Safari (10%).",
    "While StatCounter\u2019s report doesn\u2019t necessarily show that Edge\u2019s success came at the expense of Firefox, a separate report from Windows Latest suggests just that.",
    "Analyzing the data on browser usage for the past year, the publication said that Edge has been steadily growing in size, while Firefox kept losing users.",
    "If Microsoft Edge continues adding new users at this pace, it could even overtake Safari this year and become the world\u2019s second-biggest browser - albeit only for the desktop platform.",
    "When adding mobile and tablet markets to the mix, Firefox is still doing better than Edge and the rise could take a bit longer. However the report suugests that Firefox has been steadily bleeding users on those platforms as well.",
    "Microsoft Edge, together with the fabled Internet Explorer, have generally been perceived as failures in modern browser wars, with the latter inspiring countless internet memes. As a result, they were never considered strong contesters in the war, until late 2018, when Microsoft announced it would adopt the open-sourced Chromium, to further develop Edge on that platform.",
    "The original goal was, Microsoft explained back then, was \u201cto create better web compatibility for our customers and less fragmentation of the web for all web developers.\u201d It also pledged to become a \u201cmajor contributor\u201d to the Chromium project so that Microsoft Edge \u2014 \u201cbut other browsers as well\u201d \u2014 perform better on both PCs and other devices.",
    "It is also worth highlighting that legacy Internet Explorer has quite a stubborn userbase, as these 1.7% of users have been switching to Edge \u201cat a slow pace\u201d.",
