  "article": [
    "The new season of the excellent Love, Death and Robots anthology series has arrived on Netflix, and pretty much picks up where the robot-malfunctioning, alien-shooting debut collection left off.",
    "Not all of the season 2\u2019s whacky stories hit the heights of those in the first, but Love, Death and Robots continues to prove that less is often more when it comes to engaging TV.",
    "In this list, we rank every episode \u2013 across both seasons \u2013 from worst to best, bearing in mind their quality of animation, storytelling and ability to keep our eyes wide and mouths open. Descriptions for each will become more detailed as the list ascends \u2013 because there\u2019s only so much to be said about sentient yoghurt overlords.",
    "And so we begin with the When the Yoghurt Took Over, an absurdist, if entirely inoffensive, tale of a society dictated by sentient yoghurt. It\u2019s suitably bizarre, but also only four minutes long \u2013 not one that stays long in the memory, if we\u2019re honest.",
    "Sucker of Souls throws up the question of what makes good animation. It\u2019s pretty to look at, for sure, but doesn\u2019t quite fit the motion-heavy sequences that fill this story of a giant Dracula-inspired monster hiding in a tunnel system. A later episode in the show, Blindspot, hits this balance more effectively.",
    "In a rare live-action outing for the series, Ice Age sees a young couple move into a home not knowing of the miniature civilization that resides inside their fridge. Topher Grace and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are a funny duo, at least, but it\u2019s not the most original of Love, Death and Robots\u2019 stories.",
    "Season 2\u2019s opener seems like a sequence plucked straight from the script of Despicable Me or Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs \u2013 which is a compliment. The problem is, Automated Customer Service doesn\u2019t do anything we haven\u2019t seen before, and its premise wears thin as soon as you realize where its killer-vacuum-robot plot is headed.",
    "It feels a little harsh placing Alternate Histories so far down on this list, since it deserves credit for its unique 2010-era-internet-game animation style \u2013 but it just doesn\u2019t make much sense. It follows the alternative ways Adolf Hitler might\u2019ve died, including one scenario where he suffocates after being encased in a giant jelly\u2026 Enough said, really.",
    "Save for its slightly unexpected ending, The Dump is a pretty bland affair. A giant garbage monster emerges from \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a giant garbage dump, and proceeds to exist alongside an old-timer who lives among the trash. The animation is gorgeous, but that doesn\u2019t hold much value in a series where every episode is adorned with pretty computer work. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of love, death or robots to it, either.",
    "Fish Night packs a glorious final few minutes, but is let down by committing two thirds of its run-time to an uninspired conversation between a pair of travelers stranded in the desert. It doesn\u2019t half look like a Borderlands game, though \u2013 and the Great White Shark reveal is awesome.",
    "Ice is probably the most anime-like of any episode in either season, and benefits from this stylistic approach. It does a great job of cultivating its dystopian, ice-ridden environment, and is a nice breather from the ultra-realistic animation of several other stories in the series. That said, it\u2019s a little unsure of what it wants to say \u2013 genetic modification is bad, but good, but also bad?",
    "Sonnie\u2019s Edge is a tricky one. Its monster-battling premise is thrilling to behold, and the use of bright lights and neon colors makes for hypnotic viewing, but the episode is let down by a misguided use of sexual assault as a plot device \u2013 which is problematic, to say the least. Ultimately, placing it here feels like a solid compromise.",
    "The Drowned Giant is something of a marmite episode for the series. It follows a scientist\u2019s existential musings after a giant washes up on an English beach, and swaps the death and destruction of previous entries for a slower-paced, dialogue-heavy examination of a decaying BFG. It\u2019s got a cool Death Stranding-esque feel to it, though.",
    "Helping Hand is best described as everyone has already described it \u2013 Gravity meets 127 Hours. The story here is simple, but it\u2019s an effective suspense episode following the plight of a drifting astronaut. It\u2019s also definitely not for the squeamish.",
    "The hyper-realistic extension of Automated Customer Service before it, Life Hutch sees Michael B. Jordan do battle with a malfunctioning maintenance robot. The episode is a clear win for animation \u2013 the facial effects here are some of the best ever seen \u2013 but beyond that, it isn\u2019t anything to write home about. Still, it\u2019s genuinely a challenge to separate the digital from the real in this one \u2013 seriously, are we sure it\u2019s actually animated?",
    "A neat idea, well executed. Shape Shifters is a bloody and violent story of two Marines with supernatural powers which utilizes a great score and some pretty character models. As with Fish Night, though, it spends a little too long getting to its juicy parts. Soldier werewolves are bloody cool, mind.",
    "Good Hunting deserves praise for daring to be different. Its story of a shape-shifting fox is unique and beautifully realized, and its steampunk-style locales bear more than a few Studio Ghibli hallmarks. The episode is unnecessarily horny, though \u2013 multiple topless women and a cyborg sex toy is a little much, isn\u2019t it?",
    "The Tall Grass is really cool. It follows an unnamed protagonist\u2019s wanderings through a creature-infested field after his train breaks down, and utilizes an awesome art style designed by Dreamworks animator Simon Otto. It\u2019s got a real Lovecraftian feel to it, we just wish it lasted a little longer.",
    "It\u2019s a testament to the power of anthology storytelling that Lucky 13 is able to cultivate a real sense of connection between a pilot and her ship despite such a short run-time. Similar to Life Hutch, it's hard to tell whether a motion-captured Samira Wiley is indeed an animation in this one, which utilizes hyper-realistic rendering to great effect. It\u2019s not particularly original, but the episode is an easy, enjoyable watch nonetheless.",
    "Love, Death and Robots\u2019 answer to The Grinch, All Through the House follows the curiosity of two siblings desperate to catch a glimpse of Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Suffice to say, St. Nick doesn\u2019t exactly turn out to be the friendly old man they were expecting \u2013 but all's well that ends well. The stop motion animation gives this one a real homely feel, and the episode is ultimately better off for toning down the sci-fi and going somewhere unexpected.",
    "Possibly the funniest of any episode in either series, Three Robots\u2019 (surprise!) three robots are brilliantly voice-acted and have a great chemistry between them. Their wanderings through a post-apocalyptic city throw up some clever criticisms of humanity, but this one is mostly geared towards offering some lighthearted relief from the madness of other episodes.",
    "In Blindspot, a gang of cyborg thieves stage a high-speed heist of an armored convoy, and it absolutely leaves you clamoring for a full-length series. Like the show\u2019s best episodes, it touches on all three themes \u2013 love, death and robots \u2013 to provide a thrilling glimpse of what could so easily be an established animated franchise. To achieve that in less than seven minutes is remarkable. Once again, there\u2019s more than a few shades of Borderlands in this one.",
    "One of the anthology\u2019s longer episodes, Suits tells of a farming community forced to don mech-suits to fend off a horde of alien creatures. It\u2019s got heart, humor and great set pieces, and reminds us of a top-down mobile defense game in how events play out. The art style, too, isn\u2019t one seen elsewhere, and really works for the episode\u2019s intense action sequences. Oh, and the last shot is really cool.",
    "The most Cyberpunk 2077 of any episode in the show, The Witness is a vibrant and colorful tale of an unsuspecting murder witness pursued by the supposed murderer. Sure, things take a turn for the seedy, but that doesn\u2019t negate the impact of its animation style \u2013 which is, for our money, unlike anything you\u2019ve seen before. The Witness also plays with time in interesting ways, too, and seems like one of those stories only Love, Death and Robots could tell.",
    "Snow in the Desert is a visual marvel, and pushes the capabilities of CGI to new heights. It follows a genetically-enhanced bounty hunter as he evades capture in the desert, and had us wishing for the return of The Mandalorian more than most other shows out right now. The episode merges shades of so many beloved universes \u2013 Star Wars, Dune and Guardians of the Galaxy among them \u2013 to form 15 minutes of engaging, distinctive television. The end reveal is a little trite, but Snow in the Desert is undoubtedly one of the series\u2019 best entries.",
    "Guns! Aliens! Russians! The Secret War is as chaotic as it is beautiful, and imposes the show\u2019s overused horde mode plot on a World War 2 setting in a way that still manages to seem unique and refreshing, even though it isn\u2019t. Think of it as the story of Viktor Reznov leading the 300 Spartans \u2013 with about as much shouting and shooting as you\u2019d expect from that scenario. There\u2019s nothing particularly surprising about it, but The Secret War gets away with sticking to its guns (good, right?).",
    "Yes, Beyond the Aquila Rift has a very long sex scene. No, that\u2019s not why it\u2019s number three on this list. Unlike some of the gratuitous erotica elsewhere in the series, this episode uses the passion of its sexual encounter to make its suspenseful, horrifying reveal all-the-more shocking. It manages to pack the character-building depth of a feature-length movie into a fifteen-minute run-time, and tells its story of a stranded space crew with pitch-perfect pace. Also, its giant skeletal spider alien is creepy as heck.",
    "It was a welcome surprise to see a story totally lacking in sex and violence become the best episode of Love, Death and Robots\u2019 first season. Zima Blue follows the rise of a mysterious artist who uses the color blue as a hallmark in his work, and shouldn\u2019t be nearly as gripping as it turns out to be. It\u2019s almost cathartic. The art style is simple, the plot unremarkable, but the episode ends up posing thoughtful questions about the nature of life and consciousness more effectively than many big-budget Hollywood flicks out there.",
    "And so we reach our pick for the best episode of Love, Death and Robots. With very little exposition, Pop Squad drops you straight into the mental struggle of a cop charged with fighting overpopulation in a dystopian city \u2013 he\u2019s a child assassin, basically. Both the score and art style merge tropes of movies like Blade Runner to form a mightily-effective examination of humanitarian responsibility and the meaning of life, while some triple-A voice acting keeps the episode\u2019s characters feeling as human as possible. Check out the rain effects in this one, too \u2013 talk about creating an atmosphere. Pop Squad is what Love, Death and Robots was commissioned for."
