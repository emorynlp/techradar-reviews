  "article": [
    "Call of Duty: Warzone will be graced with DLSS support later this week, going by an Nvidia newsletter which was highlighted on Twitter.",
    "Wccftech spotted that Leonardo Leal tweeted that the latest weekly newsletter from Nvidia flags up the full launch of Nvidia Reflex for Overwatch, but in the subject line also mentions that DLSS will be out for Warzone on April 22, this Thursday.",
    "Take this with some caution until we hear it officially from Nvidia, of course \u2013 there\u2019s been no official announcement anywhere else, or any other indication save for this purported mention.",
    "However, we did already know that Call of Duty: Warzone was slated for DLSS support back in January (at the same time that the feature was announced as coming to Outriders).",
    "We mentioned Nvidia Reflex becoming available for Overwatch recently, and as you may know, that latency reduction tech is already available with Warzone (in fact, it was introduced last September).",
    "So those with an Nvidia GPU will not only get the benefit of reduced input lag, but also frame-rate boosting via DLSS (it\u2019s one of Nvidia\u2019s best features on the graphics front, and something AMD doesn\u2019t have a rival for \u2013 at least not yet, though Team Red is working hard on it).",
    "DLSS essentially upscales the resolution, so you can run at what looks like 4K, or close to it, for example, while making 1440p demands of your GPU, hence getting much faster frame-rates than running natively in 4K (without much difference to the image, or that\u2019s certainly the theory \u2013 and the tech works very well overall).",
    "A growing number of PC games support DLSS, with many more coming, one way or another. Indeed, if you\u2019re interested, we\u2019ve compiled a roundup of the best DLSS-powered games which is well worth a look."
