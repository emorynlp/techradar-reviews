  "summary": "\u2018Improved CPU cache for gaming\u2019 is purportedly part of Intel\u2019s plans",
  "article": [
    "Intel Raptor Lake could be the chip giant\u2019s follow-up to Alder Lake processors, and has been spotted in what\u2019s seemingly a leaked roadmap indicating that the potential 13th-gen CPUs might arrive in 2022 complete with an ace up the sleeve for gamers.",
    "Now, start grabbing your buckets of salt for this one, which was reported by VideoCardz, because as the site notes, this is clearly an old Intel roadmap \u2013 assuming it\u2019s genuine in the first place \u2013 as it indicates that Rocket Lake was supposed to launch in (late) 2020 (which was always a shaky seeming theory on the grapevine way back when, as you may recall).",
    "The roadmap has Alder Lake down as 2021, which is still the case \u2013 12th-gen chips are rumored to perhaps debut in September, and Intel has said it\u2019s aiming for the second half of the year \u2013 but the following generation is Raptor Lake, according to this leaked material.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first mention of Raptor Lake we\u2019ve seen, and as previously suggested in a major leak around Lunar Lake (purported 14th-gen chips), this will simply be a refresh of Alder Lake (remaining on 10nm).",
    "The new leak indicates that Alder Lake will be honed for better performance with Raptor Lake, doubtless with IPC (instructions per clock) improvements, with another very interesting snippet of information regarding desktop Raptor Lake stating that there will be an \u201cimproved CPU cache for gaming.\u201d",
    "If this is correct, Intel has plans to further boost gaming performance by beefing up (or otherwise revamping) on-board cache, which should hopefully deliver some extra oomph for Raptor Lake when it comes to running the latest and greatest titles smoothly.",
    "The potential launch date of 2022 makes sense, of course, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard before from the rumor mill. VideoCardz suggests that if Raptor Lake is 13th-gen, then Meteor Lake would be 14th-gen and Lunar Lake 15th-gen.",
    "The latter was also the subject of recent speculation, floating the idea that Lunar Lake will be 14th-gen \u2013 maybe pitching up in 2023 \u2013 and that Meteor Lake is not going to appear on the desktop. In other words, Meteor Lake will be mobile CPUs for laptops, much like Tiger Lake is right now (running in parallel to Comet Lake).",
    "All of this is just so much guesswork based on unproven leaks and rumors, mind you.",
    "Another nugget worth bearing in mind with this leak is that Raptor Lake mobile chips will supposedly support LPDDR5X memory, a step forward from Alder Lake\u2019s LPDDR5 RAM. The 13th-gen mobile chips will also apparently use \u2018DLVR power delivery\u2019, although exactly what that might be is unknown at this point."
