    "Christmas is finally here, which must mean it\u2019s time to give Love Actually its annual airing. This Richard Curtis rom-com is packed with heartfelt humor and seasonal goodwill, as well as a jaw-dropping cast, so curl up by the fire with someone special \u2013 human or feline \u2013 as we detail how to watch Love Actually online from anywhere today.",
    "Set predominantly in London and threading together the amorous entanglements of eight different couples in the run-up to December 25, it\u2019s the perfect way to get into the festive spirit: unapologetically optimistic and cheesier than a Boxing Day buffet.",
    "Two of the film\u2019s most memorable scenes involve Hugh Grant shaking his booty around 10 Downing Street to the Pointer Sisters \u2018Jump (For My Love)\u2019, and Andrew Lincoln pledging his undying devotion to Kiera Knightly via cue cards while her unwitting husband (Chiwetel Ejiofor) waits inside. Which will either have you gagging on your turkey or cheering at the TV.",
    "Like many Yuletide tales, though, it\u2019s got darker elements that belie its saccharine reputation. When Laura Linney\u2019s character finally brings her handsome office-crush home (Rodrigo Santoro), the demands of caring for her mentally ill brother mean that filial affection trumps romantic love. There are numerous infidelities too. But the film\u2019s executed with such open-hearted exuberance and fun that you can\u2019t help but be charmed.",
    "It was a box-office smash when it was released in 2003, raking in $248 million worldwide. No wonder really, with that jaw-dropping cast and the Midas touch of rom-com king Richard Curtis (Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, Notting Hill). Ready to enjoy the ultimate holiday treat? Then read on as we explain how to watch Love Actually online from anywhere in the world.",
    "If you're away from home over the holidays, regional restrictions will prevent you from streaming content from your usual streaming platform \u2013 potentially robbing you of your annual dose of Love Actually.",
    "Thankfully, the solution is pretty simple. Downloading a VPN will let you change your IP address - meaning you can connect to a server based back home and watch geo-blocked content no matter where you are.",
