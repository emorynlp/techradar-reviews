    "If you\u2019re excited for Forza Motorsport on Xbox Series X, developer Turn 10 Studios has announced that more playtest sessions are on the way.",
    "The first Forza Motorsport playtest took place on May 8, and those who were selected got to sample a small part of the upcoming racing sim, specifically the game\u2019s multiplayer mode. Players were able to experience the work that\u2019s gone into revamping and deepening the game\u2019s physics, as well as the core gameplay.",
    "But if you happened to miss out on the first playtest, fear not. Speaking on the Forza Monthly show for May, Forza Motorsport\u2019s creative director Chris Esaki shared that another playtest will take place this summer (between June and September), and that the team will continue to have many open conversations with the Forza community during this time.",
    "Esaki said the first playtest resulted in a \u201cton of great feedback\u201d from the community, and that based on that Esaki is pretty sure everyone is \u201csuper hyped and energized\u201d by what was shown. He also explained that the reason why only small parts of the game are being tested is so that the team can get \u201ccritical feedback\u201d on \u201cfocused areas\u201d.",
    "Esaki stressed that conversations with the community will be ongoing, and will be core to developing Forza Motorsport. \u201cWe really can\u2019t get where the team and community wants to be without doing this all together,\u201d Esaki said.",
    "Esaki also shared details on how Forza Motorsport\u2019s physics have evolved from Forza Motorsport 7, which was released on Xbox One in 2017. \u201cTo put the physics work into perspective\u2026 the changes we made from Forza Motorsport 7 till now, is more than the changes we made from [Forza Motorsport] 4 through [Forza Motorsport] 7. It\u2019s basically a huge generational leap coming to the game.\u201d",
    "The tires in Forza Motorsport, and the way they interact with the road, has been dramatically increased too. According to Esaki, the tire collision model from the first game to Forza Motorsport 7 had a single point of contact with the track surface and refreshed at 60 cycles per second (60Hz). In Forza Motorsport, there are now eight points of contact with the track surface, and the engine will refresh at 360 cycles per second (360Hz). That\u2019s a 48x fidelity jump for a single tire collision. Esaki said that this results in the car\u2019s handling better, and you can \u201cfeel\u201d the track surface a lot more.",
    "But that\u2019s not all. When Esaki was asked how else the physics will improve the driving experience overall, Esaki said: \u201cAnother example of how the physics work that has resulted in subtle but noticeable changes in the road surface are curbs. Our curbs in the past have often been viewed as somewhat coarse or unsettling, and I think that\u2019s been dramatically changed. They can be approached with confidence, and I think the playtest confirmed this. As simple as that may be, the curbing is night and day to where it\u2019s been in the past.\u201d",
    "Multiple tire compounds have also been confirmed for Forza Motorsport, a first for the series. There has always been tire wear in previous games, but tire compounds such as hard, medium and soft will deepen the gameplay and racing strategy. Each compound has its own grip and wear characteristics, which Esaki said will lead to \u201cexciting new gameplay decisions during a race.\u201d",
    "Environmental factors will also need to be taken into account in Forza Motorsport, and have the potential to make each lap feel different, according to Esaki.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re working on things like track temperature and how it affects things like grip and tyre pressure, and tyre wear. In addition, you can imagine how changes in the time of day and weather, along with the new tyre wear modelling and all of the new compounds lead to a much deeper driving and racing experience.\u201d",
    "Forza Motorsport is the eighth entry in Turn 10\u2019s racing sim series, but it isn\u2019t called Forza Motorsport 8. Esaki admitted that there\u2019s some confusion regarding the game\u2019s name, and clarified that the eight has been dropped.",
    "\u201cI just wanted to reaffirm that the name of the game is Forza Motorsport. There\u2019s no sequential eight after the title. It really is an all-new Forza Motorsport experience.\u201d",
    "Forza Motorsport is set to release on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC."
