  "article": [
    "Could 2021 be the year of rollable phones? It\u2019s possible, as not only has LG revealed the LG Rollable, but now TCL has given us a closer look at a rollable phone it has in the works \u2013 as well as confirming that it will launch a phone with a flexible display this year.",
    "Stefan Streit, general manager of global marketing for TCL's phone business, said as much to CNET, but wouldn\u2019t confirm whether this phone was foldable or rollable.",
    "As such, we suspect it will probably be a foldable phone, since a number of companies already sell them \u2013 most notably Samsung with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. On top of which TCL itself showed off a foldable phone concept over a year ago, so it\u2019s had plenty of time to turn it into a commercial product.",
    "That said, we definitely wouldn\u2019t rule out a rollable phone, especially as TCL has now provided a clear look at its rollable concept device, dubbed an \u2018AMOLED Rollable Display\u2019. In the video below you can see that when held in portrait orientation the screen can extend upwards at the press of a button, taking it from 6.7 inches to 7.8 inches.",
    "The device is apparently less than 10mm thick, meaning it shouldn\u2019t be much thicker than a typical smartphone \u2013 giving it an edge over foldables, which can be quite chunky when they\u2019re folded shut.",
    "The phone also seems to have a mirror-like back, and supposedly the interface will adapt when you change the display size. It\u2019s not clear exactly what TCL means by this though \u2013 whether, for example, it just means apps and videos seamlessly change size, or whether the interface appearance and ways you interact with the phone actually change.",
    "Even more ambitiously, TCL has also shown off a \u2018Printed Flexible OLED Scrolling Display\u2019 that apparently feels like a piece of paper, is just 0.18mm thick, and can be unrolled from a narrow tube-like shape to a 17-inch screen \u2013 we think we can confidently say that it won\u2019t be going on sale this year though, as it looks seriously futuristic."
