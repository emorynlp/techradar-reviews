    "Between software, hardware and services, it\u2019s the latter that holds most of the market (88%). Hardware is expected to grow the fastest in the next couple of years, with AI services expected to take over from 2023 onward.",
    "Looking at the AI Software category itself, AI applications bring in almost 50% of all revenue, while AI platforms have the strongest five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) - 33.2%. The AI services market, estimated to bring in $19.4 billion last year, is growing faster than hardware and software, IDC says, expecting a 19.3% growth rate this year, and a CAGR of 21% for the next half a decade.",
    "IDC analyzed the work of almost 190 companies for its report, and found that under IT services for AI, the top three companies in 2021 were IBM, Accenture and Tata Consultancy Services, making up 26% of the market share, and each having more than $1 billion in revenue.",
    "In Business Services for AI, the top three were Ernst & Young, Accenture and Deloitte, taking up almost half (46%) of the market share. AI Hardware, with just 5% of the overall AI market, is the smallest category, but it is expected to grow the fastest this year, at 29.6% year-on-year.",
