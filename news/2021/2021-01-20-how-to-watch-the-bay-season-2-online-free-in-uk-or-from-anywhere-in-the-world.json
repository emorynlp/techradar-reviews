    "We've had to wait longer than expected, but Morven Christie is back on our screens as Police Family Liaison Officer DS Lisa Armstrong, who needs to rebuild her career, repair her reputation and prove herself all over again after the events of season 1. There's a fresh murder case that needs solving in Morecambe Bay, but Lisa has a mystery demon of her own to contend with. Here's how to watch The Bay season 2 online from anywhere \u2013 including 100% free for anyone in the UK with ITV.",
    "Lisa's misdemeanors have presented Taheen Modak's DC Med Kharim with a golden opportunity to progress his own career, so much so that the chance to play second fiddle to him on a shocking new murder case is just too good a chance for Lisa to miss.",
    "It's a huge and unexpected step up from the menial work she's been having to do, but Lisa's struggling to come to terms with the new power dynamic and it's affecting not only her relationship with colleagues, but also her work, and she can't afford to let this opportunity pass her by.",
    "But work becomes the least of her problems when Lisa and her kids become the target of a stalker with an axe to grind. Get ready to be gripped all over again, as we explain how to watch The Bay season 2 online from anywhere.",
    "While fans of gritty crime dramas in the UK can enjoy The Bay season 2 online with ease, regional restrictions mean that tuning in from anywhere else in the world will be near impossible. That means that anyone based in the UK currently travelling abroad \u2013 and having paid for an annual TV license \u2013 won\u2019t be able to connect to ITV Hub either.",
    "Luckily, downloading a VPN provides a simple solution. This nifty bit of kit changes your IP address, allowing you to connect to your favourite on-demand services and watch all its premium content regardless of where you\u2019re streaming from."
