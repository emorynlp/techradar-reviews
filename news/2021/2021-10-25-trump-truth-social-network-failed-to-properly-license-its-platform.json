    "When former Presdient Donald Trump\u2019s new social media platform, TRUTH Social, ran a test version recently, it violated a licensing agreement and now has 30 days to fix the issue or lose the rights to the underlying software, completely.",
    "The site came about after the ex-President vowed to build his own website to express his opinions after being banned from pretty much all meaningful social media platforms during the height of the pandemic and the violent protests on Capitol Hill.",
    "The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), a company working on the idea, used Mastdodon - a free and open-source software, allowing anyone to run self-hosted social networking services. The problem with Mastodon is that whoever uses it needs to comply with AGPLv3, the software license governing its code.",
    "And AGPLv3 says that whoever uses the platform, must share the source code with all users. TMTG, as you might imagine, failed to do so in the short time frame while the test version of the site was up.",
    "\u201cThe license purposefully treats everyone equally (even people we don\u2019t like or agree with), but they must operate under the same rules of the copyleft licenses that apply to everyone else,\u201d the SFC said in a blog post.",
    "TRUTH Social now has 30 days to comply or it will permanently lose access to the website building software needed to build the platform out.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s how AGPLv3\u2019s cure provision works \u2014 no exceptions \u2014 even if you\u2019re a real estate mogul, reality television star, or even a former POTUS,\u201d the SFC said.",
    "Soon after notifying the company, TRUTH Social was pulled down. While speculation started circulating that it was defaced, SFC believes this not to be the case.",
    "\u201cOnce caught in the act, Trump's Group scrambled and took the site down,\u201d it said. \u201cIt's worth noting that we could find no evidence that someone illegally broke into the website. All the evidence available on the Internet indicates that the site was simply deployed live early as a test, and without proper configuration (such as pre-reserving some account names).",
