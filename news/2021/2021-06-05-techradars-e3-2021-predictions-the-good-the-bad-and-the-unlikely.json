  "summary": "Here\u2019s what we want to see at E3 2021",
  "article": [
    "E3 2021 is just around the corner and, here at TechRadar, we\u2019re seriously starting to feel the buzz. While E3 will look a bit different this year, taking the form of a digital event rather than an in-person expo, that hasn\u2019t dampened our spirits (too much).",
    "After E3 2020 was canceled, we\u2019re more than ready for a season of big gaming announcements, reveals and teases. It\u2019s like Christmas Day for gamers. And one of the best parts of preparing for E3 is predicting what we\u2019re going to see.",
    "So we\u2019ve rounded up the TechRadar team\u2019s E3 2021 predictions. While some of these predictions are likely, and others possible, there are plenty that are just downright wishful thinking. But it\u2019s all a bit of harmless fun and it\u2019s E3 after all: anything could happen.",
    "Vic Hood, Gaming Editor",
    "I\u2019m a huge Fable fan and when Fable 4 (officially just called \u2018Fable\u2019) was revealed back in 2020, it\u2019s fair to say I was a tad excited. We may have only got a few-second teaser trailer but that was enough to get me hyped.",
    "I\u2019m hoping that this E3, we get a closer look at what we can expect from the new Fable: where it\u2019s set, what creatures we can expect to see, whether it\u2019ll still focus on heroes and whether the rumors about time-traveling are actually true. Even if it\u2019s just a cinematic trailer \u2013 please, Microsoft. Give me something.",
    "Axel Metz, News Writer",
    "Some sort of Skate-related project is in the works over at EA, that much is clear. It\u2019s been 11 years (11!) since the release of Skate 3, and back in June last year the game\u2019s developers sent fans of the franchise into delirium after announcing that they were \u201cback\u201d \u2013 whatever that means.",
    "Could we see Skate 4 officially (and finally) announced at E3 2021, then? It\u2019s not a game we expect to be able to play any time soon \u2013 what\u2019s another few years after a decade-long wait, right? It would, however, be awesome to see EA swap shooters for skateboards for at least a few minutes.",
    "Daryl Baxter, Software & Downloads Writer",
    "It\u2019s finally happening. Free Radical is coming back with original founders David Doak and Steve Ellis, with the sole aim of creating a new TimeSplitters game.",
    "It\u2019s not looking likely that we\u2019ll see this anytime soon, which is why I'd love to see an HD remaster of the original trilogy, or just the second entry, announced at E3 2021.",
    "Especially with the Switch Pro about to be announced, playing TimeSplitters 2 on this handheld, in online multiplayer, is something that could very well while we wait for the new game to arrive.",
    "Samuel Roberts, Senior Entertainment Editor",
    "My best gaming experience during 2020's pandemic was replaying RTS games from the 1990s. EA resuscitated Command and Conquer and Red Alert for a well-priced, beautiful update in last year's Remastered Collection \u2013 and now it's time for two more games in the series to get similar treatment.",
    "I'd love to see EA announce it's going to do the same with Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun, two more classics that would benefit from having new sprite art, animations and UI tweaks. Sure, I could predict something like 'Elden Ring appears at the Xbox conference' instead as a more exciting E3 prediction \u2013 but isn't everyone else on the internet basically saying that already?",
    "Rhys Wood, Staff Writer",
    "Square Enix has a few big Final Fantasy titles in the works, as we know: Final Fantasy 14: Endwalker, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade and Final Fantasy 16. It\u2019s been a while since we heard from the next major installment in the Final Fantasy series, so I think E3 would be the perfect opportunity to debut a new trailer for the much-hyped FF16. It would also be great to see rumors of a Dark Souls-inspired Final Fantasy come to fruition, and would certainly make for a bumper year for Square Enix\u2019s flagship series.",
    "Hamish Hector, Staff Writer",
    "Activision might have built itself a reputation as the Call of Duty factory, and it hasn\u2019t done itself any favors given the recent Toys for Bob layoff news, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll use E3 to remind us it has many other IPs under its belt. My favorite of those is Spyro, and I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll finally see a follow-up to 2018\u2019s Spyro Reignited Trilogy announced this year.",
    "While the publisher hasn\u2019t given any concrete plans for E3 yet, its name has been listed on the official list of companies attending the event so it's sure to have some kind of presence, preferably one involving everyone's favorite purple dragon.",
    "John McCann, Global Managing Editor",
    "Okay, this one is a stretch \u2013 I know. And it\u2019s certainly a case of my heart over my head.",
    "It\u2019s been eight long years since the launch of GTA 5, marking the longest stint we\u2019ve ever had between major installations of the hugely popular, open-world game. GTA 6 rumors are worming their way onto the web, and while some are being debunked, it feels like things are slowly building to a head.",
    "Rockstar doesn\u2019t have an E3 press conference and tends to steer clear of the event altogether, but imagine if it dropped a teaser image or even a short trailer for GTA 6 during the gaming expo? It would be the biggest story of the week. Yes, please.",
    "Henry St Leger, Home Cinema Editor",
    "2021 is the 35th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda franchise. While the game we\u2019re all keenest to hear about is Breath of the Wild 2, I expect that Nintendo is going to save that game to close off the year\u2019s celebrations, and that we\u2019ll have a few more remake and remaster announcements to get through before we get a good look at it.",
    "We\u2019re close enough to Skyward Sword HD, releasing on the Switch in July, that Nintendo should start pointing towards what\u2019s next on the horizon. Remasters of the GameCube/Wii classic Twilight Princess, or the cel-shaded Wind Waker \u2013 possibly as a two-game collection \u2013 seem likely, while a renewed trademark for Phantom Hourglass suggests the beloved DS game could get a makeover in the vein of 2019\u2019s Link\u2019s Awakening. With a back catalog like Zelda\u2019s, there\u2019s a lot Nintendo could be planning.",
    "We may well get a BOTW 2 release date to close off Nintendo\u2019s E3 presentation, but likely not too many details or in-depth gameplay \u2013 and I do think Nintendo will try to stoke nostalgia with a few more remakes before we really know what we\u2019re getting in the next mainline Zelda game.",
    "John Loeffler, Computing Writer",
    "It\u2019s been nearly 10 years since Skyrim was released and, with Fallout 76 getting some legs under it, there\u2019s every reason to expect Bethesda to pivot to Elder Scrolls 6. And now with Microsoft\u2019s merger with Bethesda, E3 could give us our first real details about the highly-anticipated RPG.",
    "We got a very lame teaser a couple of years ago with a brief video showing what looked like highlands, leading many to guess at the province of High Rock as the game\u2019s setting.",
    "On New Year\u2019s Eve last year, The Elder Scrolls official account tweeted out a photo of a map of Skyrim with some candles and other items on a table, with one of the candles placed right underneath the word Hammerfell to Skyrim\u2019s southwest. Pretty much the entire internet takes this as confirmation that Hammerfell will be the setting for Elder Scrolls 6, and since High Rock is to the north of Hammerfell (and the border region between these two provinces was the setting for Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall), there\u2019s no reason why both Provinces couldn\u2019t be wrapped up into Elder Scrolls 6.",
    "Personally, I don\u2019t see how you do a proper Elder Scrolls game set after Skyrim in the series' timeline. If you support Jarl Ulfric and cast off the Imperials in ES5, then Nords would theoretically be out of the Empire for ES6, which wouldn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019d also be sad for Bethesda to decide which side wins the Stormcloak Rebellion for canonical purposes. The easy way to get around this is to set it further back in the Empire\u2019s past, and Hammerfell has a lot of lore opportunities that they could explore.",
    "Adam Vjestica, Senior Gaming Writer",
    "It\u2019s easy to forget that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was basically a spruced-up re-release of Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, a game that was released in 2014. That means it\u2019s been seven long years since we got a brand new entry in the series, and I can\u2019t wait any longer.",
    "It\u2019s time, then, for Nintendo to wow us at E3 2021 with a Mario Kart 9 announcement.",
    "Even though I\u2019m sure Nintendo will figure out a way to make the next Mario Kart feel suitably fresh, I\u2019d like to see even more faces from the company\u2019s classic franchises this time around. Let me race around as Samus Aran, inhale rivals as Kirby, or skid around the track as Captain Olimar. There are so many characters that deserve to cross the finish line, so Nintendo should stuff Mario Kart 9\u2019s roster full of fan favorites, just like it did for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.",
    "Sadly, as much as I want Mario Kart 9 to be announced, I still don\u2019t think it will happen. If Nintendo released some more DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, though, that would at least keep me, and many others, content for a little while longer."
