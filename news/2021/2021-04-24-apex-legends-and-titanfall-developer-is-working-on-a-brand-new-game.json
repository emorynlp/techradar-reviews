    "Respawn Entertainment, the development studio behind games such as Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Titanfall, has revealed that it's in the early stages of developing a new game.",
    "The news was revealed by programmer at Respawn Entertainment, Steven Kah Hien Wong, who tweeted out a job advertisement for a software engineer, in which it's confirmed that the role is for a \"brand new IP\". This was then retweeted by Respawn\u2019s studio head Vince Zampella, who called the new project \u201csuper exciting stuff\u201d.",
    "It\u2019s clear that the new game is still in the very early stages of development; not only is Zampella inviting applicants to \u201cget in early\u201d, programmer Steven Kah Hien Wong stated that the development team currently comprises only five people, with the new hire to be the sixth.",
    "At this early stage, we can probably figure out more about what the game isn\u2019t than what it is. As a \u201cnew IP\u201d that\u2019s being built \u201cfrom scratch\u201d, it seems safe to say that this title isn\u2019t going to be another Star Wars game or that highly-desired third Titanfall game (sorry Titanfall fans).",
    "The only thing that's close to a hint in the job advertisement for the game is that whoever is hired will be part of a team that's aiming to \u201cPioneer new ways to enable \u2018adventuring until the heat death of the universe\u2019\", which sounds exciting and ambitious but isn\u2019t particularly enlightening. Does that mean space? Procedural generation? Game as a service? None of the above? We imagine we won't find out for a while.",
    "While this new IP is in development, Respawn Entertainment still has plenty on its plate with Apex Legends. The game\u2019s ninth season, called Legacy, is fast approaching for console and PC players, while the first regional beta tests for Apex Legends Mobile are kicking off later this month with plans to expand to \u201cmore regions and more players around the world\u201d through 2021",
