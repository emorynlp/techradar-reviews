    "It feels like a long time since Joe Root's double hundred and that remarkable win in the first Test. Three crushing losses and a T20 series defeat later and England have the chance to leave India on a high with a tantalising ODI series decider. Read on as we explain how to watch an India vs England ODI live stream and catch all the cricket action online, wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "The hosts, led by Virat Kohli, wrapped up their five-leg T20 clash in style last weekend. They went straight on to a 66-run win in the 1st ODI, inspired by a Bhuvneshwar Kumar seaming masterclass and an emotional debut for Krunal Pandya. Before Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes thumped England back to level pegging on Friday.",
    "This all followed a dominating 3-1 victory for the hosts in last month's Test series, and the Men in Blue will be bursting with confidence for the final leg of England's tour, with Eoin Morgan having lost star fast bowler Jofra Archer to the treatment room.",
    "India are in fine shape ahead of this year's T20 World Cup, with strength in depth and new faces like Suryakumar Yadav stepping up to the plate spectacularly, the Mumbai Indians batsman having taken the T20 series by storm.",
    "England are without Joe Root as well as Archer, but where there's Ben Stokes there's hope. Jos Buttler, whose dismissal turned the T20 decider in India's favour, is back and there will be plenty of eyes on the wicketkeeper-batsman after his spat with Virat.",
