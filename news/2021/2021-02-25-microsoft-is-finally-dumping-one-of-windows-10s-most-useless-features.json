    "If you\u2019ve always wondered what the 3D Objects folder is for in Windows 10, you\u2019ll soon never have to see it again, as Microsoft is finally getting rid of it.",
    "A few years ago, 3D seemed to be all the rage, and Microsoft littered Windows 10 with all sorts of 3D apps and features, such as Paint 3D, and adding 3D effects to the Photos app.",
    "However, Microsoft\u2019s enthusiasm for all things 3D wasn\u2019t reciprocated by its users, and the company has been quietly removing them from Windows 10. However, the 3D Objects folder, once used by these unloved features, stubbornly remained.",
    "Not only was it useless, it\u2019s hard to ignore as well. Whenever you open up File Explorer, you\u2019re greeted with a shortcut to it. It also appears in the Quick Access bar I",
    "If you like to keep your PC clutter free, having a folder that you don\u2019t use \u2013 but can\u2019t easily remove \u2013 is extremely annoying.",
    "Thankfully, with the upcoming Windows 10 21H2 update, which is expected towards the end of the year, the 3D Objects folder will no longer appear.",
    "Weirdly, Microsoft isn\u2019t completely getting rid of the folder \u2013 it\u2019ll be hidden, and can still be accessed through File Explorer. It\u2019ll reside in your Users folder.",
    "It seems Microsoft can\u2019t quite bring itself to get rid of 3D Objects completely, even though it is hardly used. The good news is that as an empty folder, it won\u2019t take up any space on your hard drive, and by hiding it, it will stop bugging users.",
