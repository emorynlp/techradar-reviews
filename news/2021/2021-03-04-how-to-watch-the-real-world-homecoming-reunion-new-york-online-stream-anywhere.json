    "As it did nearly 30 years ago, everything starts out with hugs and pleasantries, but it isn't long before they stop being polite...and start getting real again.",
    "Norman was The Real World's first openly gay cast member, and the Homecoming series sees him open up on what he went through on the show and after it, including a heartbreaking segment on how he was abandoned by many of his friends.",
    "One of the elements of the original show that would be most uncomfortable to watch today was Kevin's candid thoughts and perspectives on issues of race and discrimination, over which he clashed courageously with numerous housemates, most memorably Julie and Becky.",
    "Without giving too much away, all these years later and in today's social climate, not everyone is seeing eye-to-eye. Julie, Heather and Andre are also back - and yes, Andre's hair is still magnificent - but Eric Nies is only appearing via video link, for reasons that will become clear during the series.",
