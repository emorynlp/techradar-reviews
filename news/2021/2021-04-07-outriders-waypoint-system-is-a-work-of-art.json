    "Outriders might seem like an amalgamation of games we\u2019ve already played before, but there\u2019s one gameplay mechanic that Square Enix\u2019s new looter shooter has totally made its own: the waypoint system. And as daft as it may sound, it\u2019s honestly worth celebrating.",
    "We\u2019ve seen games handle waypoints differently throughout the years, from simple distance counters that tick down the closer you get in Halo to the overhead, guiding beam found in The Division \u2013 a personal favorite of mine that I previously regarded as the pinnacle of waypoint systems, just so you know.",
    "All of these were equally effective in their own right, but none of them come close to the majesty, almost hypnotic beauty of Outriders\u2019 waypoint. In a game that\u2019s frequently asking you to jump to new locations, talk to mysterious strangers and navigate a savage land, it\u2019s a relief that it works so wonderfully well. I can\u2019t help but nod respectfully every time I use it.",
    "Like a spiritual creature gliding through the air, pressing up on the D-pad in Outriders unleashes a little white blob that shoots off into the distance. It leaves a clear painted path in its wake, one that\u2019s almost begging to be followed. As it dips, curves and boldly sets off on its destination, the path slowly disappears over time, encouraging you to chase after it before it\u2019s gone for good. It really is a satisfying sight to behold.",
    "No matter where your destination may lie, be it at the bottom of several flights of stairs, over war-torn barricades, through dilapidated buildings or amid a bustling hub of traders and quest givers, Outriders\u2019 waypoint never fails to find its target. To quote Bethesda\u2019s Todd Howard, \u201cIt just works.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s a good thing it does, too, as the large medal-like icon which also shows you where to go in Outriders is extremely underwhelming in comparison. Sure, it\u2019s clear enough, and practically screams \u201cGo here\u201d. But it\u2019s basic, boring and soulless. That little waypoint, though? Marvelous.",
    "For a game that borrows heavily from the likes of Destiny 2, Gears of War and other successful series, Outriders initially feels like it has an identity problem. However, as I\u2019m slowly discovering the more I play, it\u2019s actually a game that has some really great ideas of its own. The waypoint is but one example: being able to pick up all the loot on the battlefield with a single button press is handy, as is marking multiple items that you\u2019d like to disassemble. It\u2019s also a testament to how to do cross-play and cross-progression right (when it works, of course).",
    "Torrid server issues and save-breaking bugs may be dominating the conversation around Outriders at the moment \u2013 and it\u2019s this litany of problems that have significantly derailed our review of the game. But if there\u2019s one thing that developer People Can Fly has got right \u2013 no, downright perfected \u2013 it\u2019s that incredibly alluring waypoint. Just look at it go..."
