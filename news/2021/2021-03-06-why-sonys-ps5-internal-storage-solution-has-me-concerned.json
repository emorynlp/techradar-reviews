  "summary": "Opinion: Sounds like a noisy compromise",
  "article": [
    "Are you running out of space on your PS5 internal storage? Actually, let me rephrase that: would you like to increase your PS5\u2019s internal storage space? Of course you would.",
    "With only 667.2GB of usable space, the PlayStation 5\u2019s internal drive is rather restrictive for those who like to have more than a handful of games installed. And if you\u2019re a fan of Call of Duty games, you can certainly kiss goodbye to those precious gigabytes.",
    "However, unlike Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S, which both support the Seagate 1TB Storage Expansion Card that Microsoft made available at launch, Sony still doesn\u2019t give users the option to add more PS5 storage. Microsoft lets users store Xbox Series X and S optimized games on external hard drives, too, although you\u2019ll need to move them to the internal drive or Storage Expansion Card if you wish to play them.",
    "You can attach an external hard drive to your PS5 and store your PS4 games on it, but when it comes to finding a home for all your shiny-new PlayStation 5 games, you're at the mercy of the internal drive only.",
    "That\u2019s about to change, however. Sony is reportedly about to unlock the internal NVMe SSD bay found behind the console\u2019s front faceplate. This is great news for those who want to significantly upgrade the PS5\u2019s storage capacity: simply pop off the faceplate (carefully), slot in a NVMe SSD and screw it into place.",
    "At least, it should be that simple. We don\u2019t yet know which drives the PS5 will support; Sony has said it will make clear which NVMe SSDs are compatible in the future. And while some users may be comfortable wielding a screwdriver, it isn\u2019t exactly consumer-friendly, especially next to the plug and play nature of the Xbox Series X 1 TB Storage Expansion Card.",
    "But this isn\u2019t my main concern; having built a gaming PC from scratch, I\u2019m certainly not scared of a couple of screws. No, it\u2019s the concerning revelation that the upcoming firmware that unlocks the PS5\u2019s ability to run the additional internal drive will also enable higher cooling-fan speeds.",
    "This might not be a surprise to those who are already up to speed on NVMe SSDs. Unlike regular hard drives, they can often become extremely hot. It\u2019s the reason so many models come with their own heatsink, which can be placed over the top to help keep performance optimal.",
    "The PS5, it appears, might struggle to accommodate a drive that comes with an accompanying heatsink, and since the SSD found inside the console is extremely fast, you can bet the drive you\u2019ll need to buy will become quite toasty when in use.",
    "The SSD bay does include a metal lid that could effectively act as a heatsink, but Sony's compatibility list will obviously determine which drives will work with the PS5.",
    "One of the best features of the PS5, in my opinion at least, is how much quieter it is than the PS4 and PS4 Pro, which were both rightly compared to sounding like an aircraft leaving the runway whilst playing certain titles. The knowledge that the PS5\u2019s fans may kick up a stink once you've installed additional storage is, in all honesty, extremely annoying.",
    "I don\u2019t wish to be punished twice by Sony\u2019s decision to supply such a meager amount of storage space: the first being the high price I\u2019ll inevitably have to pay for a top-end SSDs; and then to be potentially subjected to a far louder console than I\u2019ve become accustomed to.",
    "It\u2019s even more frustrating when Microsoft\u2019s storage solution is seemingly so obvious and well executed in comparison. It\u2019s essentially a memory card, something that Sony itself made synonymous with the PlayStation brand, which slots into the back of the console. It delivers identical performance to the Xbox Velocity Architecture used when playing games that have been optimized for the Xbox Series X and S.",
    "The large metal surface area of the Seagate 1TB Storage Expansion Card allows the spreading and routing out of heat from the device. This heat is dissipated away from the chip inside, and pushed out by the Xbox Series X or S\u2019s fans.",
    "Installing a PS5 NVMe drive will be a bit of gamble, then \u2013 at least for now. We don\u2019t know to what degree the PS5 fans will ramp up to deal with the additional heat generated by the extra storage. It could be minimal, of course, but they\u2019ll certainly do something, judging by Sony\u2019s need to unlock faster speeds.",
    "Is this an oversight on Sony\u2019s part, then? Maybe, but I\u2019m not prepared to pay the price of a louder console for more storage space, at least not yet."
