    "After love got put on hold thanks to the panny-D, the summer 2021 has been doubly blessed as we've been able to watch the blossoming romance both sides of the Atlantic with Love Island UK and USA airing simultaneously. While season 3 of Love Island USA has wrapped for another year, we've got Love Island UK's finale to look forward to. Wherever you're coupling up from, here's how to watch Love Island 2021 online.",
    "If the last year has let you down in all of its miserable glory, the long awaited return of this heroic dating show will have been music to your ears! It has got pretty hot and steamy up in here this summer as both Love Island UK and Love Island USA returned to our screens within weeks of each other.",
    "And even now the current seasons of Love Island UK and USA are ending and a winner has been crowned, we have Love Island Australia to look forward to as its third season is expected to touch down later this year when summer hits down under.",
    "Bringing together tanned and toned twenty-something boys and girls looking for love, they'll be cooped up in a villa in an idyllic location, likely to either pull or get pied across the coming weeks. All in the name of true love, there's also a pretty tempting cash prize at the end of it for the winner(s).",
    "From getting involved in sexy, somewhat absurd challenges, to screaming \"I've got a text!\" at the top of their lungs, let's see who's prepared to move mad and step on toes to recouple up with 'the one'. Keep reading on to get all the deets on how to watch Love Island UK, USA, and Australia in 2021.",
    "They've had their final Love Island dates and met the family. Now it's time to put all the muggy behaviour behind them as this 'sanitized sex bubble' is well and truly popped, with Laura Whitmore set to crown our winning couple of 2021 tonight. Eleven OG islanders are now down to just four couples. But who will win? Keep reading to find out how to watch Love Island UK.",
    "We've detailed how you can watch Love Island from the UK, but bear in mind that if you're abroad at any point during this year's summer of love, you won't be able to watch Love Island 2021 from abroad.",
    "Don't get mugged off by geo-restrictions, which prevent you from being able to access certain services and content to specific parts of the world. You can get around geo-blocks by using a VPN. It's legal, very affordable and easy to use - and it also encrypts your browsing, offering protection against cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Love Island from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's stream - head to ITV Hub and start watching Love Island as if you were back at home",
    "Unfortunately, it looks like those in Canada miss out on an official broadcaster for Love Island UK. Don't miss a moment of the islander action as our boys and girls couple up, heads are turned, and another is dumped from the villa.",
    "The only way you'll be able to watch Love Island is with a VPN, which spoofs your device into thinking you're browsing from elsewhere and bypass geo-restricted content.",
    "Completely missing out on our dose of Vitamin D and the Love Island summer class of 2020, we're long overdue beach frolics and outrageous dates. That being said, with the pandemic still trying to rain on everyone's parade, many questioned what health and safety precautions would be in place.",
    "However, Love Island 2021 is being filmed at its usual location at the Love Island villa in Majorca, though there were reports it had a backup location in Jersey if the Covid-19 situation in any way hindered travel.",
    "It has also been reported a large proportion of production will take place in London rather than Majorca, including Iain Stirling's voice over. Gutted. Much of the show's other safety precautions will take place behind the scenes, with little to know obvious changes on screen.",
    "Aside from the obvious elephant in the room (that pesky pandemic), Love Island has had other pressing matters to deal with.",
    "In recent years it has come under fire for its lack of safe-guarding of its contestants in preparing them for the barrage of fame and ridicule after appearing on the TV show. With the loss of Sophie Gradon in 2018 and Mike Thalassitis in 2019, both to suicide, there has been pressure for Love Island to do more.",
    "This year, a duty of care protocol has been introduced in order to look after the mental health of contestants and better prepare them for live after the reality show. These measures also include support before and during filming.",
    "Outlined on ITV's website, all contestants will receive:",
    "The third season of Love Island USA has drawn to a close after, this year, taking place in Hawaii with Arielle Vandenberg returning to host the dating show. The initial line-up saw 16 islanders arrive in the villa, all hoping to find love and secure that tasty $100,000 cash prize. Want to go back and watch the series and find out the winner? Keep scrolling for all the details on how to watch Love Island USA season 3 online.",
    "Whereas Love Island UK always takes place in Majorca (aside from its recent new winter iteration which took place in Cape Town in South Africa), the Love Island USA villa finds itself in new exotic locations each season.",
    "From Fiji to Las Vegas in seasons past, Love Island USA third season is taking place in Ninole in Hawaii for the Class of 2021 lovebirds.",
    "Throughout its three seasons, Love Island USA has been hosted by Arielle Vandenburg, with Matthew Hoffman offering his witty narration as voice-over for the reality TV show.",
    "Love Island fever has reached across the other side of the world, with young, eligible Australians on the hunt for romance in the villa. With two seasons aired so far, a third series is set to air at the end of the year when summertime hits in the southern hemisphere, with the villa location confirmed to be on home turf this year - Port Douglas in Queensland, Australia.",
    "Just like Love Island in the UK and USA, love had to take a backseat thanks to the ongoing pandemic. However, Love Island Australia will return for its third season in 2021, with the location of the villa set to be on home turf this year in Port Douglas, Queensland. This gives us a pretty good indication of when we can expect Love Island Australia season 3 to launch.",
    "While its first season took place in the same location as the UK iteration in Majorca, with the second and third season located in the Southern Hemisphere, spring arrives in September. We therefore imagine it'll be taking place come October time, with stunning scenic shots of the Great Barrier Reef.",
    "Each season of Love Island Australia has seen couples loved up with differing backdrops. Season 1 took place in the same location as its UK counterpart in Majorca, Spain, while season 2 took place in Fiji.",
    "Season 3 will be taking place in Port Douglas, Queensland on home turf this year.",
    "As we get into the thick of the bombshell arrivals, recouplings, and serious mugging off, ensure you don't miss a moment of islander action. Catch up with our comprehensive list of all the episodes so far, allowing you to click straight through and have your head well and truly turned by Love Island UK, series 7 this summer."
