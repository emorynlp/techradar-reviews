    "If League of Legends fans enjoyed getting a mobile version of the game, Wild Rift, earlier this year, they\u2019re probably overwhelmed by the explosion of new content following the release of the Netflix series Arcane (based in the same universe starring its most famous characters). Among them is Hextech Mayhem, a new game that\u2019s available now on Nintendo Switch and PC \u2013 which is also coming to Netflix.",
    "Hextech Mayhem is a bit of a hybrid: a side-scrolling runner featuring rhythm-like mechanics, which sees players jumping and diving to the beat of the soundtrack. The beat prompts, in whimsical League of Legends fashion, are explosions: players control the tiny but chaotic Ziggs as he bombs his way through the industrial city of Piltover while trying to evade the orderly and naysaying Heimerdinger.",
    "Both characters are among the hundred-plus champions in the original League of Legends, but take center stage in Hextech Mayhem, which is one of several spinoffs currently being produced by Riot Forge, the publishing arm of Riot Games. And while there\u2019s no date set for its release on Netflix, Hextech Mayhem gives us an idea of what the streaming giant\u2019s plans are for expanding into gaming. In short: what makes a Netflix Game?",
    "The answer isn\u2019t clear-cut, at least right now. Rather, it seems Hextech Mayhem has several qualities that ended up fitting Netflix Gaming\u2019s appeal: it draws from the world of an already-established IP with a tie-in show on Netflix, and has casual gameplay that likely appeals to streaming service subscribers.",
    "In other words, both giant companies are reaching to frontiers of entertainment that are new to them, and it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that their demographics overlap. Streaming content fans are also gamers \u2013 especially if the show they\u2019re watching has a tie-in game playable without leaving the app.",
    "Riot Forge selected Choice Provisions for its project that would become Hextech Mayhem, noting the studio\u2019s work on the BIT.TRIP series of lauded rhythm-based auto-runner games. While there\u2019s clear influence of the latter in Hextech Mayhem\u2019s gameplay, Riot Forge Creative Director Rowan Parker assured that the publisher worked with Choice Provisions but allowed the studio to find their own way to interpret League of Legends to its gameplay.",
    "\u201cThe game wasn't decided when we first met though, it was after a long period of discovery that we eventually arrived at Hextech Mayhem, which translated perfectly to some good light-hearted fun,\u201d Parker told TechRadar over email. \u201cThe result in Hextech Mayhem is something that stays true to League's universe and champions, but has the heart of a Choice Provisions game.\u201d",
    "That \u2018heart\u2019 involves taking simple core gameplay \u2013 auto-running and rhythm prompts \u2013 and making it compelling without making it more complex. The studio has \u201chistorically taken casual genres and \u2018hardcored\u2019 them,\u201d as Choice Provisions Co-Founder and Design Director of Hextech Mayhem Alex Neuse put it. Over email to TechRadar, he and the studio\u2019s other co-founder Mike Roush, Creative Director of Hextech Mayhem, explained what went into making the new game \u2013 including implementing some key parts of old games. The Quake III rocket jump, one of Roush\u2019s favorite mechanics, inspired the bomb jump used by players to navigate and engage the rhythm system of Hextech Mayhem.",
    "Not that Neuse would call Hextech Mayhem a rhythm game \u2013 it's more accurate to call it a 'Music Game' tying your inputs to the melody, verses, and more, as he explained in a featurette:",
    "The studio also found their muses among League of Legends\u2019 roster of colorful characters. While Netflix\u2019s Arcane tells a more somber story rife with betrayals and tragic backstories, Choice Provisions pitted two of the sillier stars of Riot\u2019s MOBA against each other for the right whimsical tone they wanted for their auto-runner...which is also the tone around Choice Provisions.",
    "\u201cOur studio also has an aesthetic that leans cute and wacky. Ziggs fit into this mold perfectly with his explosive nature and stunning personality. Heimerdinger is of course part of the package, being the antithesis of Ziggs,\u201d Roush said. \u201cHaving Ziggs come up from Zaun to Piltover to basically troll Heimerdinger gave us a lot of opportunities to expand their relationship and I think fans are going to love it.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe also wanted to expand the League of Legends oeuvre to include forays into less serious territory. If we\u2019re expanding the universe, let\u2019s go where it has never gone before, you know?\u201d Neuse said.",
    "A game like Hextech Mayhem seems like such an obvious fit for Netflix\u2019s nascent gaming platform, which launched in early November, that it must have had the service in mind since its creation. But the game was already in development when discussions started with Netflix, according to Leanne Loombe, Head of Riot Forge \u2013 and talks started in the same way the studio began them with Microsoft, Sony PlayStation, and Nintendo.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk to the platform holders early and often so we can understand which platforms the games make sense to release on based on the type of players that play each type of game. Ultimately, our games will go wherever players are playing, including PC, Console and Mobile,\u201d Loombe told TechRadar over email, noting that not every game would be released on all platforms. \u201cWe aim to ensure that each of our games is designed with the right platform in mind for the best possible player experience.\u201d",
    "The streaming platform has been in talks with Riot and Riot Forge over the past year, a Netflix spokesperson told TechRadar over email. The timing is auspicious: Netflix gaming launched with only five games, two of which are tie-ins to Stranger Things, one of the streaming platform\u2019s most popular original series. It\u2019s not clear when Hextech Mayhem will be added, but it\u2019s the only other game we know is coming to Netflix Gaming.",
    "Netflix did say that its gaming offerings won\u2019t all be spinoffs of its popular shows, though they do hope to find more opportunities for fans to engage with content they love. Given Netflix Gaming is only available on Android (and soon iOS) phones and tablets, there\u2019s little likelihood you\u2019ll be able to play them via remotes on a smart TV or Apple TV. We can probably expect more games that play well on smaller screens with simple yet compelling mechanics, like Hextech Mayhem \u2013 and there are plenty of other Netflix shows we can imagine fans would love to explore in tie-in games."
