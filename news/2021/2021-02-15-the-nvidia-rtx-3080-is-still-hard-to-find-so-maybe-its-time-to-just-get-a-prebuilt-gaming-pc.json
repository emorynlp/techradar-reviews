    "Recently, you may have noticed that it\u2019s a bit difficult to buy one of the best graphics cards or processors. A combination of the re-emergence of cryptocurrency, a global semiconductor shortage and the fact that everyone is stuck at home playing the best PC games, means that everyone is trying to get their hands on a shiny new Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. And, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be easier to get a new GPU any time soon.",
    "However, if you really want to get your hands on the latest graphics tech, there is still an option \u2013 and, no, I\u2019m not going to suggest supporting the \u201cmisunderstood\u201d scalpers.",
    "The best gaming PCs, that is, prebuilt gaming rigs, haven\u2019t seen a major price increase, and are probably the best way to get a new rig right now, especially if you were planning on building a whole new machine yourself anyway.",
    "Most of the time, I\u2019m a huge proponent of building your own PC, if that\u2019s something you\u2019re comfortable doing. Not only is it fun, but it makes it easier to troubleshoot any problems that arise in the future. But no matter how much fun I have messing around with PC hardware, it\u2019s not for everyone, even in the best of times.",
    "One of the biggest arguments I see thrown around the PC gaming community is that it\u2019s cheaper to build a new gaming PC than it is to buy one pre-built. And, really, that makes sense. Go on PC Part Picker and select the parts you want to build, and at MSRP, it absolutely is cheaper to build it yourself.",
    "But PC components aren\u2019t really going for MSRP prices right now are they?",
    "While you might be one of the lucky people to pick up an RTX 3080 within seconds of a restock being announced via Newegg\u2019s Twitter account, scalpers are kind of controlling the market right now. On StockX, one of the biggest aftermarket retailers, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition is selling for $1,645 (about \u00a31,190, AU$2,121) at the time of writing.",
    "That\u2019s nearly three times the $699 (\u00a3649, about AU$950) price that Nvidia launched the graphics card for back in September 2020. Hell, when I reviewed the card at launch, one of the biggest things I praised the graphics card for was its affordability, especially compared to the RTX 2080 Ti.",
    "I know that the level of performance that the RTX 3080 offers is tempting, and I can tell you from experience that it is a true generational leap. But there is no universe where it\u2019s worth dropping almost two grand for just a graphics card.",
    "If you\u2019re willing to drop that much cash to upgrade your gaming situation, you might as well get a full system upgrade. Right now, you can find gaming PCs equipped with the RTX 3080 for not much more than the current market value of that card.",
    "Alienware PCs have a reputation for being really expensive, but you can get an Alienware Aurora R11 right now for $2,587 that\u2019s packed with a 10th-generation Intel Core processor and an RTX 3080. At iBuyPower, you can get basically the same specs as the Alienware for $2,227, with a chassis that\u2019s less of a pain to upgrade later.",
    "That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of PC manufacturers out there that have PCs with Nvidia RTX 3000 graphics cards in stock. And, yeah, it totally sucks that you have to buy a whole gaming PC just to get your hands on the latest graphics card \u2013 I totally feel that.",
    "There\u2019s nothing better than picking up a new graphics card and simply slotting it into your PC to be able to play the latest PC games, without having to worry about setting up a whole new system.",
    "I have so many friends and family members who are constantly coming to me and asking when they\u2019re going to be able to buy an RTX 3000 or Radeon RX 6000 graphics card \u2013 or even an AMD Ryzen 5000 processor \u2013 but the truth is, I know as much as they do. With how fast all these components keep selling out, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to when they\u2019ll be in stock.",
    "I can\u2019t wait until I can tell them, and all of you, that it\u2019s finally time to head on over to Newegg to casually get yourself a GPU upgrade. But the reality of the situation, right now, is that the market is a total mess, and I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to get better. And, if you\u2019re still out there in the trenches, refreshing your browser over and over for the chance to get a new GPU, I\u2019m sending you my good vibes. Hopefully you can get one soon."
