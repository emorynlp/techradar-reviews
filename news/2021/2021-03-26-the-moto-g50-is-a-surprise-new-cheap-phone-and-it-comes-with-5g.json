    "If you're looking for a new cheap phone that's 5G-enabled, Motorola might have exactly what you're looking for.",
    "The Moto G100 is Motorola's big new 'budget' smartphone - well, it's a member of Motorola's low-end Moto G series, though its price isn't exactly low - but at the same time the company unveiled the Moto G50, which actually is a brand-new affordable device.",
    "The Moto G50, a specced-up version of the Moto G10 and G30, was unveiled at the Moto G100's launch event, and didn't exactly get an equal share of the spotlight, especially with Motorola's Ready For platform stealing some time too.",
    "We do know a bit about it though, like its price - the phone costs just \u00a3199 in the UK, which converts to around $275 or AU$360. At that price it's one of the most affordable 5G phones we've ever seen.",
    "We'll run you through the Moto G50's specs below, and will bring you a full review when we get it in our labs.",
    "The Moto G50 has the same screen as the G30 - that's a 6.5-inch 720 x 1600 display with a 90Hz refresh rate.",
    "The phone has 5G connectivity, unlike the G10 and G30, and it uses the Snapdragon 480 chipset. As with the other contemporary G-series phones, there's a physical Google Assistant button.",
    "There are three rear cameras here - the main is 48MP, which is a step down from the 64MP on the Moto G30, and it's joined by a 2MP macro and 2MP depth-sensing camera.",
    "We know the battery size is 5,000mAh, but the charging speed hasn't been confirmed. It's likely 10W-20W, though.",
    "We'll be sure to bring the Moto G50 into our labs so we can give it a full review, and see if it's the best affordable 5G phone for you."
