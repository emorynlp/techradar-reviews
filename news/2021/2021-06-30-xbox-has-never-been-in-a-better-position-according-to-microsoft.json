    "Xbox has \u201cnever been in a better position than we are right now\u201d, according to Microsoft\u2019s Phil Spencer, who also reiterated that Microsoft doesn't judge the Xbox division's success on retail sales or review scores.",
    "Speaking on the 500th episode of IGN\u2019s Podcast Unlocked, which also served as a celebration of Xbox\u2019s 20 year anniversary, head of Xbox Phil Spencer candidly answered a number of questions, including what his favorite year in Xbox history was, what the team\u2019s plans are for the future, as well as whether Xbox Game Pass is actually economically viable.",
    "When asked to pick his favorite year in Xbox\u2019s 20 year history, Spencer told Unlocked: \u201cI\u2019m always going to pick this year, because I\u2019m always looking forward. When I think about the vision that the team has \u2013 we just came out of an amazing Xbox Bethesda Showcase \u2013 I just really love how the brand is showing up right now.",
    "\u201c...I honestly can\u2019t remember a time when I think we\u2019ve been in a better position than we are now, with the studio capability that we have right now, where our hardware sits \u2013 with the two great consoles [Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S] \u2013 and our services continue to grow. I honestly believe we\u2019ve never been in a better position with Xbox than we are right now.\u201d",
    "However, Spencer also touched on how the Xbox One launch was a key moment in Xbox history. As challenging as it was for Microsoft, it helped pave the way for where the team is now.",
    "\u201cIt was such a seminal moment for the team in checking, \u2018what did we stand for? What did we want to be as we went forward?\u2019\u201d Spencer said. \u201cFor the brand, it was a challenging year, there was a lot for us to learn.\u201d",
    "The Xbox One launch was seen as disastrous by many gamers and analysts. Not only was the console more expensive than the PlayStation 4, it was also technologically inferior and shrouded in controversy due to the way it handled game ownership. Sony infamously made a video showing how to share used games, which only made Microsoft\u2019s stance look all the more foolish.",
    "Microsoft also focused on positioning the Xbox One as an entertainment hub first and foremost instead of a gaming focused machine. Thankfully, those missteps helped the company learn, the fruits of which we\u2019re seeing today.",
    "\u201cSo much of what we are today is from that first year of the Xbox One where we got a real cold dose of reality in focusing on not what the customers wanted but what we thought we needed,\u201d Spencer said.",
    "Spencer was also pressed on whether Xbox Game Pass is economically viable, and how Microsoft sees its subscription service moving forward.",
    "\u201cFirst of all, the goal around Game Pass has always been to make more games more accessible to more people. That is the goal,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to turn everyone into a subscriber. We wanted to be an option to people on our platform. We think a content-based subscription has a place in our industry, and I\u2019m proud of the work the team has done.\u201d",
    "But is Xbox Game Pass profitable for Microsoft? According to Spencer, it's not as simple as that.",
    "\u201cWhen we look at the economics of Game Pass, it\u2019s not just \u2018How many games is this subscriber playing in this subscription, and if they would have purchased these games, what\u2019s the trade off in purchase versus subscriber revenue?\u2019\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWe never really look at it that way. What we do is say \u2018are we growing the number of players on our platform, and are they playing more often. From that activity we see the business grow.\u201d",
    "According to Spencer, engagement is the most important metric for judging success on Xbox platforms.",
    "\u201cThe number one metric that we can look at to see if our business is actually growing is, 'are people playing more on the platform?' There\u2019s nothing about review scores, there\u2019s nothing about retail sales of consoles, or retail sale of games; the number one sign that our platform is healthy and growing is actually engagement on the platform,\u201d Spencer says.",
    "While it's hard to deny that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S aren't appealing consoles, the biggest criticism Microsoft has faced since the systems launched on November 10 is a lack of games.",
    "That's set to change, however, as six titles are arriving on Microsoft's platforms in the next six months, all of which launch on Xbox Game Pass on day one. Flight Simulator, Psychonauts 2, Back 4 Blood, Age of Empires 4, Forza Horizon 5 and Halo Infinite all launch this year, and should give Xbox owners plenty to play for the rest of the year."
