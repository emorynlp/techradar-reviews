    "Best Buy just dropped three great Chromebook deals this week that are perfect if you're looking for a machine that'll cover the basics without breaking the bank.",
    "First up is this 14-inch Asus Chromebook for $149 (was $249) - a compact laptop that's not only rocking a fresh $100 discount but also a very nice modern aesthetic that belies its low price point. Inside an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage also give it plenty of power for the basics.",
    "Another worthy consideration is this 14-inch HP for $169 (was $319), which features the same specs and power as the Asus above but also comes with a handy touchscreen. That's definitely a bonus rather than a necessity in our eyes, but it could be a nice little feature to have while sitting back and watching YouTube.",
    "Finally, we've got this 13.5-inch Acer Spin 713 for $329 (was $529), a pricier option but easily the most powerful machine on our list. Inside, it's got a 10th gen Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage, making it a better choice if you're looking to do more intensive tasks. Also, this one's fully convertible, so you can use it as both a laptop or a tablet.",
    "Chromebooks, in general, are a good choice if you value good battery life, a lightweight, and tend to use your laptop for browser-based tasks like emails or typing. They're particularly good as an inexpensive laptop for school or college, although that's not their only use - they're also great for streaming all your favorite content.",
    "Outside the US? See the best Chromebook deals in your region just below.",
    "We're rounding up plenty more of this week's cheap laptop deals here at TechRadar if you're more into Windows machines. Also worth checking out are this week's Amazon deals - which cover not only cheap laptops, but 4K TVs, headphones, and iPads."
