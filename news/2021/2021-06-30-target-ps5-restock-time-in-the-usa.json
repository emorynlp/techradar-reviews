  "summary": "The rumored Target PS5 restock didn't happen today, and we're not too surprised. Here's what our reporting tells us and how to follow PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider",
  "article": [
    "There won't be a Target PS5 restock today, according to the reporting of our 24/7 PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider, who will send you an alert when the PlayStation 5 console is in stock in the US \u2013 if you follow his account and turn on notifications. We're certain of the next time (but not the date) of the PS5 restock at Target, and you'll get notified as soon as it's in stock.",
    "Trust and credibility: Matt Swider has helped over 55,000 people buy a next-gen console in recent weeks from stores in the US when PS5 restock opportunities last just a few minutes. How? With his tireless 24/7 tracking, in-stock Twitter alerts and exclusive restock reporting.",
    "Click on this example of the Target PS5 restock from earlier this month to follow Matt Swider and turn on notifications (the little bell icon).",
    "The Target PS5 restock time is always in the morning at around 7:40am EDT, though we don't know the exact date of the next restock. We do know for a fact that the restock date has consistently been on a Wednesday or Thursday in 2021. Today, June 30, the usual restock time has come and gone, and we'll be tracking Target for a PS5 restock tomorrow morning as well as next week (we're anticipating it'll be the latter just after a bunch of 4th of July sales end).",
    "On-the-ground reporting: Target has been receiving PS5 consoles at its individual stores in the US, according to our sources and those of YouTuber Jake Randall. However, the inventory count, relayed to us by employees, is so small \u2013 around two or three PS5 Disc consoles per store \u2013 that today was always an unlikely scenario (still, we're checking so you don't have to).",
    "It's kind of backward, but we do know the expected Target PS5 restock time, even if the date remains a mystery. It's almost always at 7:40am EDT / 6:40am CDT / 5:40am MDT / 4:40am PDT.",
    "That's a very early restock time for everyone on the West Coast of the United States, but since the PS5 is bought online and picked up at your local Target store, you're competing with a bunch of neighbors \u2013 and on the West Coast, much of that competition is usually fast asleep.",
    "A quick note about being on time: the restock happens in waves and being the first to the Target website doesn't always mean it'll be in stock. In fact, most people who don't get it and immediately give up, often open the doors to others who snag the PS5 console 10 minutes later.",
    "There's more than just a Target PS5 restock on the agenda this week. We saw a Best Buy PS5 restock yesterday, June 29, but as we've reported, this was a leftover batch of consoles from last Thursday's Best Buy restock.",
    "Other retailers in the US that we're tracking include Sony Direct, Costco, Walmart (always on a Thursday in 2021) and GameStop. The most likely PS5 restock opportunity is at GameStop this week with bundles consistently being available from the retailer every 10 to 15 days (it's been 12 days so far).",
    "The ongoing PS5 restock shortage is to blame, however, we also did just see every single major retailer sell the Sony console in the last two weeks: Best Buy, Costco and Amazon last week, and Target, Walmart, Sony Direct, and GameStop the week before that. Essentially, retailers need to continue to amass their inventory."
