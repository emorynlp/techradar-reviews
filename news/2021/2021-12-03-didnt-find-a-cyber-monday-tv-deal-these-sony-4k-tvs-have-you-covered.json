    "Sony makes some top-tier TVs, so it's well worth paying attention when they're on sale. And despite Black Friday and Cyber Monday now being over, you can still get some very tasty discounts on one particular Sony screen.",
    "The Sony X85J is a mid-range 4K TV, boasting Ultra HD resolution, HDR support, and the new Google TV smart platform \u2013 an upgraded version of the Android TV OS previously used on most Sony sets.",
    "The 50-inch model has seen a great $100 discount, bringing it down to just $748 \u2013 the same price as the 43-inch size. So if you want to upgrade to a larger size at no extra cost, this is the Sony TV for you.",
    "You can save even more on larger sizes, of course, with a 55-inch X85J going for $848 after a $150 discount, and a 65-inch X85J going for $998 after $200 was slashed from the list price.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for the best 4K TV deals near you.",
    "Sony's 2021 TV range has largely course-corrected from connectivity absences the previous year, adding support for HDMI 2.1 across most of its LCD and OLED screens.",
    "That means you can get 4K/120Hz support when plugging in a Sony PS5, or even an Xbox Series X \u2013 though you should not that HDR gaming will revert to 1080p. It can't do everything, at least not all at once.",
    "You can see more TV deals that are still live with our Best Buy Black Friday deals guide."
