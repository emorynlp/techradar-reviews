    "Windows 10 might just be getting a Widgets bar that takes inspiration from a part of the Windows 8 interface, namely the Charms bar.",
    "If you\u2019ve used Windows 8 \u2013 or are perhaps still using it, seeing as the operating system still has a couple of years of support to run \u2013 you may well be familiar with the Charms bar, which is essentially just a fancy name for a menu that appears on the right-hand side of the screen carrying some commonly used icons (like the Start button, Settings cog and so forth).",
    "In Windows 8, this thin sidebar menu gets invoked by swiping inward from the right side of the screen \u2013 on a touchscreen, of course, but it can also be summoned by moving the mouse to a corner of the desktop on the right \u2013 and the purported Widgets bar for Windows 10 which Microsoft is apparently testing will work in the same way in that you\u2019ll slide it out.",
    "This is according to Windows Latest, with the website claiming that this new piece of the interface could be destined to arrive in Windows 10 this year, and if it does, it\u2019ll be part of the big Sun Valley interface (21H2 update) makeover (which of course makes sense). Obviously, take this with an appropriate amount of skepticism\u2026",
    "Rather than Charms, the bar will obviously contain widgets, although exactly what kind of widgets is anyone\u2019s guess. Windows Latest theorizes that it could be icons such as the \u2018News and interests\u2019 feature which is currently rolling out (and is present on the taskbar \u2013 but it\u2019s causing some trouble here and there), or perhaps widgets to access the likes of stock info or sports scores at a glance.",
    "Desktop widgets are, of course, another throwback for Microsoft in that this concept was used way back in Windows Vista (another version of Windows that\u2019s right up there with the popularity of Windows 8) with its desktop-based Gadgets.",
    "The suggestion of a Charms bar-style design for this supposed new element of the interface of Windows 10 could provoke some concern, given that one of the annoyances of Windows 8 (at least for us) was that it was too easy for the bar to accidentally pop up (when using a mouse on the desktop). Until we disabled it, that is \u2013 and presumably, this will also be an option in Windows 10 if Microsoft goes this route.",
    "There may be nothing to this report, of course, or this could simply be a concept that Microsoft is playing around with currently, and may discard down the line.",
    "What we are expecting with Sun Valley is the extensive use of rounded corners for menus and boxes, and floating menus too, with a contemporary modern look overall (still based on Fluent Design concepts). We can expect new fonts, refreshed desktop icons, plus tweaked animations and the like as well."
