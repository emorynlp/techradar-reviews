    "Star Trek: Section 31 will be fronted by her Most Imperial Majesty, Mother of the Fatherland, Overlord of Vulcan, Dominus of Qo\u2019noS, Regina Andor\u2026 But you know her best as Philippa Georgiou.",
    "Currently in development, the latest series in Paramount Plus\u2019s rapidly expanding fleet of Trek TV shows promises to give the brilliant Michelle Yeoh top billing as Georgiou. Having established herself as one of the standout players as Star Trek: Discovery mapped out the new frontier of the 32nd century, the former totalitarian ruler of the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire will be back in more familiar territory in this spin-off. She\u2019ll be returning to the ranks of Section 31, the morally questionable intelligence agency that operates in the shadows of the Federation.",
    "With Star Trek: Section 31 still waiting for a greenlight (and an official title), plot specifics are currently under wraps, but there\u2019s still plenty of information out there about a series destined to become the 12th Star Trek TV show.",
    "Here\u2019s everything you need to know about The Further Adventures of Philippa Georgiou, aka Star Trek: Section 31 \u2013 on a need-to-know basis, obviously\u2026",
    "While Star Trek: Discovery season 4, Picard season 2 and Strange New Worlds are already in production, Section 31\u2019s exact status is more of a mystery \u2013 who knows, maybe that\u2019s appropriate for an organization that deals primarily in secrets.",
    "In December 2020, Michelle Yeoh told TV Insider that, \u201cI know the EPs [executive producers] and writers and my team are still working very hard because we have a lot more stories to tell. I hope it will be very soon.\u201d",
    "A Star Trek: Section 31 release date may not be quite as soon as she hoped, however.",
    "When asked by Hollywood Reporter in April 2021 whether Section 31 was still on the Federation agenda, Akiva Goldsman (a co-showrunner on Picard and Strange New Worlds) said, \u201cI don't know. I believe so.\u201d He added that, \"Alex has a plan,\u201d referring to Alex Kurtzman, the executive producer charged with overseeing the TV branch of the Trek franchise.",
    "Meanwhile, Shazad Latif \u2013 who played Ash Tyler in the first two seasons of Discovery, and is likely to be one of the stars of Star Trek: Section 31 \u2013 has said that, \u201cIt\u2019s just been slight yeses, slight questions, but I've no idea. I think it's down to people's schedules.\u201d",
    "Hardly words that suggest production on the new show is imminent.",
    "In fact, we may be talking years rather than months. That\u2019s because Section 31 is part of streaming service Paramount Plus\u2019s grand, overarching strategy for the TV future of the franchise \u2013 and the new show is effectively waiting for an empty slot to appear on the roster.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re very careful about curating the pacing \u2013 the number of shows at any given time \u2013 and what those shows are, so that we make sure that it\u2019s always exciting when there\u2019s a new show coming out,\u201d Paramount Plus programming boss Julie McNamara told Variety in February. She added that the service is looking to debut \u201ca new Trek [show] a quarter\u201d, and that \u201cconversations\u201d about Section 31 are still happening.",
    "This suggests that Paramount Plus won\u2019t be looking to expand on the current Trek slate of Discovery, Picard, animated comedy Lower Decks, Strange New Worlds and upcoming kids\u2019 cartoon Star Trek: Prodigy until one of the existing shows runs its course. It therefore seems likely the Star Trek: Section 31 release date is still a long way down the line \u2013 our most optimistic guess is mid-to-late 2022, though it could be as far away as 2023 or beyond.",
    "That said, McNamara did hint that nobody at Paramount is expecting Star Trek: Picard to go on forever: \u201cPerhaps an older lead is only committed to a certain number of seasons and therefore we move on from that,\u201d she teased. If Picard runs its course in, say, three seasons, the turbolift doors would open for Section 31 much sooner.",
    "Expect to watch Star Trek: Section 31 on Paramount Plus in the US. With other Trek shows spread across Netflix and Amazon Prime Video internationally, it\u2019s still unknown where the new show will materialize in other star systems and territories.",
    "Section 31 is an undercover intelligence organisation in the Star Trek universe.",
    "Although the United Federation of Planets traditionally portrays itself as a benign, utopian society, there are darker forces operating behind the scenes. Formed under \u2018Article 14, Section 31\u2019 of the Starfleet charter, Section 31 was permitted to carry use \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d in the name of protecting the Federation\u2019s lofty ideals. In other words, morally dubious behaviour comes as standard.",
    "Section 31 made its first screen appearance in Deep Space Nine season 6 episode \u2018Inquisition\u2019, when Agent Luther Sloan arrived on the station, suspecting one of the crew of being a Dominion spy.",
    "It\u2019s since been revealed that Section 31 had been in operation for years, all the way back to the early days of Starfleet. In the pre-Kirk and Spock Star Trek: Enterprise, security officer Lt Malcolm Tucker turned out to be a Section 31 agent, while it was Section 31 who recruited John Harrison (aka Khan) to help beef up Starfleet\u2019s defenses in the alternative \u2018Kelvin\u2019 timeline of Star Trek into Darkness.",
    "The agency was also a major antagonist in Star Trek: Discovery season 2, when they investigated Spock\u2019s escape from a psychiatric hospital, and accused him of murdering three doctors. In fact, Section 31 was so persistent that the USS Discovery had to go rogue from Starfleet to protect Spock from their clutches.",
    "It later turned out that Section 31 was operating under directions from Control, the Federation\u2019s Skynet-like AI that would ultimately prove a threat to all life in the galaxy \u2013 until Discovery carried the vital \u2018Sphere Data\u2019 into the future.",
    "The new show will be built around Philippa Georgiou (played by Tomorrow Never Dies/Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star Michelle Yeoh), the former Emperor of the Terran Empire who crossed universes to join the Discovery crew \u2013 and became the most memorable, most quotable character on board the ship.",
    "\u201cThe truth is that for Section 31 the idea of doing that show, it was Michelle Yeoh\u2019s,\u201d Star Trek overseer Alex Kurtzman said in a 2020 Variety Screening Room Q&A (via TrekMovie). \u201cShe deserves all the credit for that. She actually came to me about it before we even aired the first season of Discovery. She loved playing the character and she said, \u2018I know that there are a lot of young women who grew up like I did and did not see somebody like me on screen and I want to be that person.\u2019 And I said, \u2018That sounds amazing! Let\u2019s do it.\u2019",
    "\u201cBut we didn\u2019t know if people were going to like Discovery, so I said, \u2018Let\u2019s see how it works, and if we can get there let\u2019s get there.\u2019 She killed it. She did amazing work on the show. And then in season 2, we really started digging into the mythology of Section 31, which had been dealt with on other shows. And we started seeing a way to do it. And so we got there.\u201d",
    "Yeoh\u2019s played two versions of Philippa Georgiou in Discovery. The first was the respected captain of Starfleet\u2019s USS Shenzhou, Michael Burnham\u2019s mentor who died at the \u2018Battle at the Binary Stars\u2019 that kickstarted a Federation/Klingon war.",
    "We met her doppelganger when Discovery\u2019s spore drive accidentally carried the ship into the Mirror Universe we\u2019d previously visited in the original Star Trek, Deep Space Nine and Enterprise. Here Georgiou was the Emperor of the totalitarian Terran Empire, an organization where any sign of weakness is punishable by death.",
    "After the Discovery crew took down her flagship, the ISS Charon, Georgiou offered to sacrifice herself to aid Burnham\u2019s escape \u2013 the pair share a bond across universes \u2013 but Burnham opted to take her back to her ship.",
    "Once the Mirror Georgiou was resident in the Prime Universe, Section 31 wanted to capitalize on her moral flexibility and unique set of skills, so recruited her to their ranks. This brought her back into Discovery\u2019s orbit, but she ultimately turned on her Section 31 masters when Control took, well, control. She remained on board Discovery when it travelled to the distant future of the 32nd century.",
    "This left many Trek fans wondering how Georgiou could possibly appear in the Star Trek: Section 31 spin-off, but luckily the Discovery showrunners had a plan. As Georgiou\u2019s body started to be torn apart in the future, phasing in and out of reality, future-Starfleet intelligence guy Kovich explained that the fact her molecules had crossed universes and travelled centuries through time had made her body inherently unstable. Unlikely salvation came in the form of Original Series portal/plot device the Guardian of Forever (from classic episode \u2018The City on the Edge of Forever\u2019), who offered her a chance to travel closer to the time she came from\u2026",
    "Beyond Yeoh, casting is TBC, though we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a return for Shazad Latif as Ash Tyler. The Klingon/human hybrid was in charge of Section 31 when Discovery blasted off to the future \u2013 he\u2019s also one of the few people aware of the ship\u2019s true fate \u2013 so it\u2019s logical that he\u2019d be Georgiou\u2019s first point of contact. Assuming, of course, the Guardian of Forever sent her back to her original time.",
    "That\u2019s the big question, because aside from the fact it\u2019ll feature Georgiou and involve Section 31, the new show is something of an open book.",
    "We do know it'll be different to any Trek we've seen before. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to have our shows feel unique and different from each other,\u201d Kurtzman told Variety. \u201cWe want to give everybody a reason to watch each show.\u201d",
    "He also added that, while there'll be an \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d between each Trek series, you won't have to watch everything to keep up as you do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe: \u201cOur goal is not to make it so insular that if you haven't seen the show you're lost when you watch another show.\u201d",
    "It seems most likely the Guardian of Forever sent Georgiou back to a time just after she and the Discovery crew travelled to the 32nd century. With Section 31 decimated by all those issues with Control, rebuilding will almost certainly be at the top of the agenda \u2013 and who better to help Tyler than Georgiou?",
    "\u201cI hope in the short time she was [in the future], being the amazing engineer and smart cookie she is, she would\u2019ve learned a lot about that time period that she would be able to take with her,\u201d Yeoh told TV Insider. \u201cCan you imagine what she could bring back to the past? Without changing the future, of course. Developments that could make a huge difference, and if it was Section 31, that\u2019s what Section 31 is all about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
    "In fact, her resum\u00e9 is going to be attractive to any 23rd century HR department. Not only does she have experience of the future and managing an interstellar empire, her time on board Discovery has softened some of her more psychotic edges.",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely had a change of heart,\u201d Yeoh explained in an interview with Bustle. \u201cShe had an awakening in the sense that she realized yes, you could rule with fear and tyranny, but only for a short period. This was what she learned from being in the Prime Universe. It\u2019s about compassion, about hope. It\u2019s about when people have nothing to lose, then they don\u2019t care anymore. And when you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t have a future.\u201d",
    "There may also be some rebuilding to do in the Mirror Universe, so don\u2019t rule out the prospect of Georgiou finding a way back to her original home. Indeed, after Kovich revealed that the Terran Empire had collapsed long before the 32nd century, she may see this as an opportunity to reshape it in her own image.",
    "\u201cThe Terran empire disappeared 500 years ago,\u201d Yeoh said in TV Insider. \u201cThere were no more crossings, we were never heard from again, and the only thing you can come away with that is that we destroyed ourselves. I think she realized that when she went back to Michael Burnham and she said, \u2018How many more times are people going to revolt against us? If we don\u2019t give the people some kind of peace and harmony, we are just going to kill ourselves.\u2019 She learned that just by killing, that was not the answer or the way to rule moving forward.\u201d"
