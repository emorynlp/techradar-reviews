    "The end of TCL\u2019s April TCL 20 announcement event had a special surprise for viewers...and the phones industry as a whole, really: the company revealed the TCL Fold N\u2019 Roll, the first device that is both a foldable and a rollable.",
    "The Fold n\u2019 Roll is more than just a concept combining the phones industry\u2019s top buzzwords of 2020 and 2021 \u2013 it could be a harbinger of a new era in phones, when flexible display handsets become readily available (and cheap) enough to hit the mainstream in the next two years.",
    "That\u2019s according to two TCL executives, who sat down with TechRadar to chat about what the normalization of these devices means to consumers.",
    "While other phonemakers have been first to market with pricey foldable phones, the executives suggested that TCL\u2019s mobile product strategy \u2013 releasing mid-range and budget-priced devices \u2013 is being applied to foldable production.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t feel pressured to come out very early with something like this,\u201d Stefan Streit, TCL General Manager of Global Marketing, told TechRadar. \u201cOur job is to bring this into a mass market.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s been no secret that TCL is looking into lower-tier foldables after the company revealed a cheaper clamshell foldable-looking concept device at CES 2020, but then again, it\u2019s given peeks at a lot of display types that will probably never reach the market.",
    "TCL was unclear how serious it was about developing cheaper flexible display devices... until now.",
    "Selling affordable flexible display devices, starting with a foldable device that TCL confirmed to CNET will be coming in 2021, has implications for the phones market as a whole. If TCL thinks they can make more affordable folding, rolling, and other kinds of flex-display phones, other companies will, too. And all that R&D will result in wild, new form factors.",
    "\u201cTo generalize, you will see a much bigger variety in a couple years of different product form factors \u2013 and it\u2019ll be very fun for you guys where you can talk about different use cases and such,\u201d Streit said. \u201cWe\u2019re probably just beginning to understand what is possible and we\u2019re trying to explore this. It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s no way to tell if the Fold N\u2019 Roll is one of the few TCL concepts that will reach the market as a cheap flexible display device. But it\u2019s proof that TCL is continuing to tinker with different display ideas and, given what we\u2019ve heard, the company is bringing some to market just as flexible display phones get big \u2013 starting, in 2021, with a foldable device.",
    "While the TCL Rollable was first teased at CES 2021 and first reports indicated it would launch later this year, the company had carefully stated that a flexible display device would come in 2021 \u2013 and it looks like they were referring to a foldable.",
    "Instead, the TCL Rollable could have a 2022 release date, Streit said: \u201cTo be clear, I wouldn\u2019t expect it as a commercial device in the first half of next year, not yet. But maybe this could be something in the second half of next year,\u201d he said.",
    "Even a TCL Rollable in 2022 would still catch the wave of more flexible display devices that TCL\u2019s executives predict will crest in a year and a half to two years time. That\u2019s when TCL expects it will figure out the thornier issues of hinges and screen-unfurling systems in foldables and rollables, respectively: they\u2019ve got the \u2018display\u2019 aspect figured out, it\u2019s the \u2018flexible\u2019 aspect that needs time to develop.",
    "\u201c[We feel] very comfortable for the panel itself that we can do that part, but the other challenge is to make the mechanics to do this, and also [develop] the user experience,\u201d Streit said.",
    "Some of those growing pains have largely been figured out for foldables, but for the Fold 'n Roll, and even basic rollables, there\u2019s another design challenge to solve for the still-novel mechanics involved in unrolling and retracting a display: durability.",
    "\u201cDust, water, all kinds of circumstances, drops, humidity \u2013 it\u2019s all part of the lab tests we need to do before we can bring something commercial to the market,\u201d Streit said. But he expects these issues to be worked out in time.",
    "\u201cThe internal progress we\u2019re doing and seeing these things come together gives us the confidence that, looking forwards one and a half to two years, you could see more of these technologies and kinds of products feasible for commercial thinking.\u201d",
    "But as you would expect, in two years, prices will probably drop for components crucial to flexible screens, especially as more rollable phones are released, which use similar parts.",
    "\u201cNext year, foldables and rollables will compete with each other, and because of that competition, we can push down our component prices,\u201d said Steve Kim, OLED Expert at TCL-CSOT, the department that develops displays for the company\u2019s various products. \u201cSo maybe next year we can get some relatively cheaper prices on our flexible devices.\u201d",
    "That leads to cheaper foldables and rollables. But TCL is no stranger to flexible display concept phones, and has shown off plenty in the short two-year period since it started releasing its own TCL-branded handsets. What\u2019s holding us back from moving beyond those?",
    "The Fold 'n Roll is novel, but it combines two relatively proven flexible display versions \u2013 and it may be the most we can do with today\u2019s phone technology due to the limits of materials science.",
    "As Streit and Kim explained, smartphone designers are largely held back by battery technology. Nearly every other part of a handset can bend but the battery, which is why you see so many flexible display ideas stuck at the concept stage \u2013 including the wrap-around-wrist devices that have shown up over the years.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m looking for a kind of flexible battery, but also, how much can we reduce the battery\u2019s thickness,\u201d Kim said, noting that the display panels are already thin enough \u2013 400 micrometers, even \u2013 to use in a rollable form factor. Thinner batteries, of course, could allow some of the more complex foldable designs, like the Z-shaped trifold concepts TCL and other phonemakers have teased.",
    "With today\u2019s tech, those are essentially three smartphones thick \u2013 which is too dense for the average user to fit in their pocket. Hence why the Fold 'n Roll is a tantalizing stopgap: it unfolds to a 10-inch tablet-sized display, but folds back up to a typical tall, narrow smartphone size that consumers are familiar with.",
    "It makes sense for TCL and other phone manufacturers to stay close to a form factor consumers are familiar with and can get the functionality they\u2019re used to while experimenting with new and interesting ways to use their devices. But there\u2019s still an inextricable draw to move beyond today\u2019s norm, and Streit thinks it\u2019ll happen when enough foldable and rollable (and Fold N\u2019 Roll-able) devices hit the market in the next couple years.",
    "And after that \u2013 what screen concepts come after flexible displays?",
    "\u201cNowadays we are seeing the three-dimensional [device], but in the future we are looking for some hologram technology,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible today, but we are looking for some kind of roadmap to see a three-dimensional imaging system, so for that matter, the flexible display is a very good device to achieve such a goal.\u201d"
