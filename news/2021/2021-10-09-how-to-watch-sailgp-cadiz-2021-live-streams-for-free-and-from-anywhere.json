    "Australia can consider themselves desperately unlucky to be trailing, having been hamstrung by persistent technical issues at Saint-Tropez, and now find themselves level-pegging with the US.",
    "But nobody had a worse weekend than France, who dropped down the pecking order into last place at their home race, Denmark leapfrogging them in spite of a broken jib sheet.",

    "With the next SailGP round scheduled for December, make sure you don't miss this one. Read on for full details of how to get a Spain Grand Prix live stream and watch SailGP Cadiz online this weekend - catch all the action from start to finish with the help of this guide.",
    "Because SailGP is relatively new, there are loads of ways to watch all of the action for free all around the world.",
    "The best way to tune in to the Spain Grand Prix is via the SailGP YouTube channel or the SailGP Facebook page, both of which are live streaming all of the action from Cadiz.",
    "However, the rights differ from place to place. For instance, in the UK the race is being live streamed on YouTube while Facebook is showing a replay afterwards, whereas in the US the race is being live streamed by both, and in Australia YouTube and Facebook can only show a race replay.",
    "Many big-name broadcasters are also showing the action, Fox Sports in Australia being an obvious example. Read on for country-by-country details of who has a SailGP Cadiz live stream.",

    "If you're abroad right now, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic SailGP coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you whizz around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred SailGP live stream. It's a very affordable workaround and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
