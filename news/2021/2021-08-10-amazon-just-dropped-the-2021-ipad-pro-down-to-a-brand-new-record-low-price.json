    "Update: Amazon is running out of stock on the cheapest 2021 iPad Pro deal we've ever seen, so you're looking at a two to three week delay already. However, there is still availability for this slightly delayed shipping, which may still be snapped up over the course of the day.",
    "This morning, Amazon released a new wave of incredible iPad deals, and among them is the best price we've ever seen for the 2021 11-inch iPad Pro. A record breaking $99 discount leaves us with an excellent $699.99 sales price- a fantastic offer considering this model has only been on the shelves since May.",
    "We've previously seen retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart tinkering with $50 discounts on this model over the last few weeks. In fact, we were celebrating that $749 sales price as recently as last week. We spotted this $699.99 price early this morning, so we don't know how long it will last. That means those who have been holding out for a iPad deals with a considerable saving such as this should strike while the deal is hot here.",
    "Of course, if you're splashing out on the larger 12.9-inch model, you'll find the same $100 discount available. We've seen this $999 price (was $1,099) for a few weeks now, but it still represents an excellent saving considering the power inside this device. Or, if you're looking for something a little cheaper, Amazon's iPad deals have also hit the 2020 iPad Air 4 once again, with a return to a record low $499.99 sales price (was $599).",
