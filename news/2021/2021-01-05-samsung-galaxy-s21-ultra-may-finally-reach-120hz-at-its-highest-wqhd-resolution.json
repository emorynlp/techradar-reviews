  "article": [
    "A new leak suggests the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra could achieve what its predecessors could not: reach 120Hz refresh rate at the phone\u2019s maximum WQHD+ resolution.",
    "The proof is in the screenshot: noted leaker @UniverseIce tweeted a capture of the settings page, allegedly taken on a Samsung S21 Ultra, which shows display options looking a lot like those on the Samsung S20 series of phones \u2013 except the \u2018Screen resolution\u2019 option is set to the phone\u2019s maximum (WQHD+, 3200 x 1440) while the \u2018Motion smoothness\u2019 is set to \u2018Adaptive.\u2019",
    "Last year\u2019s S20 phones only allowed the former if the latter was explicitly set to 60Hz; conversely, the screen refresh rate could be set to 120Hz if the resolution was dialed down to Full HD (2400 x 1080).",
    "Admittedly, that\u2019s not the most persuasive of screenshots \u2013 it would be nice to see whether the \u2018Adaptive\u2019 mode is the only option for maximum refresh rate \u2013 so we\u2019re relying on @UniverseIce\u2019s tweeted comments that the phone is capable of both 120Hz and WQHD+ at the same time. Given they had previously leaked in mid-2020 that the Note 20 Ultra would not be able to do both, it's possible @UniverseIce has more info than just the screenshot.",
    "What does that mean? S21 Ultra users will be able to have the sharpest screen resolution available in today\u2019s smartphones, and it\u2019ll have nearly the fastest refresh rate (the Asus ROG Phone 3 caps out at 144Hz) for silky-smooth browsing and gaming. It\u2019s unclear why last year\u2019s S20 line couldn\u2019t do both at once, but we expect that maxing out both features may drain the battery at a faster pace than if either was dialed back.",
    "And of course, the big question: will the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have this capability, too?",
    "Thus far, we can only speculate as to what exclusive features the S21 Ultra will sport to justify its expected premium pricetag.",
    "If it follows the Samsung S20 Ultra and Note 20 Ultra, the S21 Ultra will have slightly better specs and a bigger display. Rumors point to a 6.8-inch WQHD+ OLED display, a 5,000mAh battery, and if renders are to be believed, five rear cameras, including a 108MP main shooter and two telephoto cameras: one 3x optical and one 10x optical.",
    "Several rumors have suggested it will support an S Pen stylus, but a recent leak showed how: by clipping it into a folio case. In other words, the premium phone is nabbing the best feature of the Note 20 Ultra, meaning the S21 Ultra could truly be the most advanced traditional smartphone yet \u2013 though we\u2019ll know the truth when the phone launched on January 14.",
