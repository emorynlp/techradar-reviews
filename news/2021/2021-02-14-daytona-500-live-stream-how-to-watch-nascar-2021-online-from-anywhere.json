    "The drivers are revved up and ready for the annual NASCAR season curtain-raiser - and you don't have to miss a single turn of the racing action. Follow our guide below as we explain where to find an Daytona 500 live stream you can trust and watch NASCAR online today wherever you are in the world.",
    "Arguably the biggest American motorsports event on the calendar, this Sunday's race will once again see 40 drivers hurtle around the oval, 2.5-mile long Daytona International Speedway track in Florida",
    "Usually played out in front of a sell-out crowd of more than 100,000 fans, coronavirus restrictions mean that only an estimated 30,000 fans will be able to attend the season-opening race this time out.",
    "Also unfamiliar will be a number of big name drivers turning out for new teams, with Bubba Wallace now plying his trade for 23XI Racing, Kyle Larson moving to Hendrick Motorsports, and Christopher Bell shifting to Joe Gibbs Racing. Seven-time Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson won't be in the field, either, having retired at the end of the 2020 season.",
    "Instead, all eyes will be on last year's winner Denny Hamlin and this year's favourite, as he looks to become the first driver to win three consecutive Daytona 500 races - only the fourth speedster ever to have the chance.",
    "Defending Cup Series champion Chase Elliott will also be among the bookies favourites, while 2008 winner Ryan Newman makes a welcome return to the race, having suffered a horrifying crash at the end of last year\u2019s event.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a die-hard fan of NASCAR racing or just want to tune into the 63rd Daytona 500 this weekend, we\u2019ll show you how to live stream the race online from anywhere in the world.",
    "We've recommended some of the best places to live stream the Daytona 500 below. But you might run into a problem trying to tune in if you're abroad right now - even if you're fully registered and in all likelihood paying a subscription fee.",
    "This is because of something called geo-blocking - best thought of as a kind of digital border - but it's not nearly as scary as it sounds and we can help you get back to your preferred Daytona 500 live stream in no time at all.",
    "Simply follow our VPN advice below and you'll soon be up and running with a great bit of software that allows you to relocate your device back to your country of residence - thereby regaining access to all the streaming services and content you normally enjoy at home.",
    "And remember, if you're abroad right now you can hotwire a VPN to tune into the broadcast of your choice, no matter where are in the world."
