    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is one of the best phones available, as our 4.5-star review attests, but it\u2019s also very expensive, and if you\u2019re hoping to buy it in the US, the starting price is currently even higher than you might have expected.",
    "That\u2019s because at the time of writing you can only get the priciest model there \u2013 the one that comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That will cost you $1,069 (\u00a3929, around AU$1,400), and while a version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage has been announced for $969 (\u00a3829, roughly AU$1,250), that\u2019s not currently on sale in the country.",
    "This isn\u2019t just a case of the cheaper model being sold out, it\u2019s actually not listed at all, and while OnePlus has told Android Police that while this model will be available in future, no time frame has been given for it.",
    "Curiously, the reverse is true for the standard OnePlus 9, with only the cheaper $729 (\u00a3629 / around AU$940) model being listed in the US, and no sign of the pricier $829 (\u00a3729 / roughly AU$1,070) version.",
    "This isn\u2019t an issue in all countries though. In the UK, both models of both phones are available, though notably only in some colors, so there are still some slight restrictions on what you can buy. And of course, the OnePlus 9 range isn\u2019t available in Australia at all, as the company doesn\u2019t currently have much presence there.",
    "It\u2019s not clear why you can\u2019t currently get some models in the US. There is a global chip shortage that\u2019s affecting smartphones, so that could be the issue, but that\u2019s just a guess. In any case, for now, if you want the OnePlus 9 Pro there, it\u2019s going to cost you $100 more than you might have been expecting."
