  "article": [
    "In an extraordinary turn of events, half of Nominet\u2019s board has been voted out with immediate effect; the culmination of a long-drawn public campaign calling for the board\u2019s overhaul.",
    "Board members of the Internet infrastructure firm Nominet, which regulates UK domain names, had been under fire for several months now for their decisions to take the company away from its not-for-profit mission.",
    "\u201cI find it sad that we\u2019ve got to this point,\u201d said board chairman Mark Wood at the start of the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) as reported by The Register. \u201cIn the past, we clearly haven\u2019t listened well enough to our members. We know that many things we need to do better,\u201d said Wood, who was one of the members voted out, along with Nominet CEO Russell Haworth.",
    "The PublicBenefit.uk campaign, led by Simon Blackler, the CEO of web hosting company Krystal, took objection to several decisions taken by Nominet\u2019s board between 2016 and 2020 that were contrary to its Articles of Association.",
    "Their shenanigans came to naught as both men along with three other members were removed with a 52.7% majority vote in the EGM that had 53 Nominet members present and voting.",
    "While it isn\u2019t exactly clear what happens next, as things stand, non-executive director Rob Binns has been asked to serve as acting chair.",
