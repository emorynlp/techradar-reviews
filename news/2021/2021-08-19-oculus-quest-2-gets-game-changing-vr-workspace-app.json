    "Facebook has lifted the veil on a new Oculus Quest 2 app that allows professionals to generate a virtual meeting space.",
    "Called Horizon Workrooms, the app aims to allow colleagues to work together through the power of virtual reality (VR), giving Oculus Quest 2 owners the opportunity to collaboratively edit documents, brainstorm ideas or simply socialize with others.",
    "Facebook says Horizon Workrooms will work across both VR and the web, and is designed to improve a team\u2019s ability to collaborate, communicate and connect remotely in the absence of typical office spaces.",
    "The app will bring together features like mixed-reality desk and keyboard tracking \u2013 of the sort we\u2019ve seen tested recently \u2013 hand tracking, remote desktop streaming, video conferencing integration, spatial audio and all-new Oculus avatars. You can check it all out in action via the video below.",
    "It\u2019s the first time these technologies are being brought together in a way that creates a different kind of productivity experience, Facebook says, and it could mark a game-changer for the practical applications of mixed reality technology.",
    "The app will launch in beta soon, with sign-up instructions available on Oculus\u2019 official website, though it will be free to download to all Oculus Quest 2 owners worldwide when officially released.",
    "Only weeks ago, Facebook added a new feature to Oculus Quest 2 devices allowing developers to create augmented reality (AR) experiences using the headset\u2019s camera.",
    "Unsurprisingly, given that the Quest 2 is essentially a games console, the most immediate application of that technology has been in the gaming sphere. Not only have developers used the platform \u2013 called the Passthrough API Experimental \u2013 to create all-new mixed reality experiences, but some have ported existing VR games into AR, too.",
    "Facebook\u2019s launch of Horizon Workrooms, though, looks set to take that mixed reality experience beyond gaming and into the professional working environment.",
    "Given the necessity to work from home in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the app could give workers unable to venture into offices the space they need to accomplish tasks in a more collaborative \u2013 if not entirely traditional \u2013 manner.",
    "That\u2019s the theory, at least. It\u2019s hard to imagine scores of city-based professionals picking up a Quest 2 headset just to high-five their co-worker\u2019s avatar, but the promise of a hybrid approach \u2013 which will see the app work between both web and VR platforms \u2013 should ensure Facebook\u2019s latest bright idea gets the audience it deserves."
