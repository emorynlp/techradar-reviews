    "Apple\u2019s next Smart Keyboard for iPad could mimic backlighting, according to new patents. Unlike the more expensive Magic Keyboards, the Smart Keyboards have always lacked the feature and until recently it looked like they always would.",
    "The issue has previously been that backlighting normally requires holes in the keyboard, which would negate the Smart Keyboard\u2019s clean design and add space for dust and dirt in between the keys.",
    "However, the new patent reveals that this smart keyboard could use \u201cfabric items with thermally imprinted light-emitting regions\u201d rather than more traditional LEDs. Apple highlights some issues with its design though, saying \u201cif care is not taken, fabric-based items will not have visually appealing illumination, will be too complex to manufacture, or will not have desired patterns of illumination.\u201d",
    "As with all patent news we have to take it with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s very possible this design will never see the light of day - especially if it is hard to pull off. But it shows us that Apple is looking at ways to improve its iPad keyboard offerings. Perhaps this is linked to the new iPad Pro\u2019s M1 chip putting it on par with some top laptops on the market.",
    "Backlighting on the next Smart Keyboard would be a huge advantage for future iPad users, especially those who want to use it later into the evening, though it\u2019s not all the add-on was missing.",
    "For one we\u2019d like to see a trackpad introduced. This could either be an actual trackpad or through the use of vibration sensors detect your movements on a solid surface - and have been rumored for the Magic Keyboard. Currently the Smart Keyboard doesn\u2019t have a trackpad and so navigation isn\u2019t the most intuitive, as you have to use the screen and keys simultaneously.",
    "Our other gripe is protection. We\u2019d like a keyboard case that succeeds better at being a protective cover for our devices. The current options aren\u2019t likely to help you out if your iPad falls, so finding better ways to keep everything in one piece is vital.",
    "We\u2019ll have to see what Apple introduces with its next Smart Keyboard offering, and it might not be too long before we see it.",
