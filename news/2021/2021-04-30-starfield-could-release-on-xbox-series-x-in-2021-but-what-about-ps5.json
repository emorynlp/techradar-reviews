    "Starfield, Bethesda\u2019s highly anticipated space-based RPG, could release in 2021 and skip the PS5 entirely, according to rumors sourced by the Xbox Two Podcast.",
    "Reported by KitGuru, Xbox Two Podcast host Rand Al Thor 19 stated: \u201cI\u2019ve been told, by very reliable people, that Starfield was 100% an Xbox exclusive. I\u2019ve even made bets about it, and I don\u2019t bet unless I know I\u2019m willing to bet. So I\u2019m really, really confident that Starfield is only releasing on Xbox when it does.\u201d",
    "As well as the rumors surrounding Starfield\u2019s Xbox exclusivity, rumors of a 2021 release are still circulating, thanks to a Starfield trademark spotted on Zenimax\u2019s (Bethesda\u2019s parent company) official website.",
    "Starfield was first announced way back in 2018 during Bethesda\u2019s E3 press conference, and little has been known about the game since then, aside from some leaked footage that surfaced last year that allegedly came from an early build of Starfield.",
    "There\u2019s currently no confirmation on Bethesda or Zenimax\u2019s part that Starfield will miss out on a PS5 release. But given that both companies were acquired by Microsoft, it\u2019s entirely possible that Starfield will remain exclusive to Xbox consoles as well as PC, with a potential day-one Xbox Game Pass release being a strong possibility.",
    "Bethesda releasing a game soon after a big reveal isn\u2019t unheard of, either. Fallout 4 was announced in June 2015, and ended up releasing just five months later in November that year. A similar announcement-to-release window could be on the cards for Starfield, especially if Bethesda chooses to showcase the game at this year\u2019s E3 in June.",
    "Microsoft and Nintendo will both be present at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, but Sony, who missed last year\u2019s online-only conference, will not be present once again."
