    "Are you digging the new Nintendo Switch OLED? Well, don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not, because Nintendo\u2019s manager of product marketing has advised to \u201cstick with the current Switch\u201d if the Switch OLED doesn\u2019t light your fire.",
    "Nintendo made a surprise announcement of its redesign of the popular hybrid console on Twitter on July 6, and while some were undoubtedly pleased about the model\u2019s new 7-inch OLED screen, others haven\u2019t been impressed by the console\u2019s lack of technical upgrades, specifically that it won\u2019t output at 4K resolution when connected to a TV.",
    "When asked on Twitter by a user if the Nintendo Switch OLED runs games any better, Nintendo\u2019s manager of product marketing said \u201cNope. Not what\u2019s for [sic]. Stick with the current one if you\u2019re not digging the screen.\u201d (Thanks, VGC.)",
    "While Rodrigo certainly has a point \u2013 you don\u2019t need to rush out to upgrade to the Switch OLED if you already own the original Switch or a Nintendo Switch Lite \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly the type of bullish confidence you expect to see from a new product launch. It also strengthens that argument that the Switch OLED really isn\u2019t the significant upgrade that many were hoping for.",
    "The comment is reminiscent of the notoriously controversial Xbox One launch, which came under fire after its initial reveal for needing to be continuously online. Microsoft\u2019s Don Mattrick, who left shortly after the console\u2019s reveal, was asked by Summer Games Fest\u2019s Geoff Keighley at E3 2013 about the console always being online, to which Mattrick said: \u201cFortunately we have a product for people who aren\u2019t able to get some form of connectivity, and it\u2019s called Xbox 360.\u201d",
    "When Keighley said: \u201cSo stick with 360. That\u2019s your message if you don\u2019t like it?\u201d Mattrick responded by saying, \u201cWell if you have zero access to the internet, that is an offline device. I mean, seriously, when I read the blogs and thought about who\u2019s really the most impacted, there was a person who said, \u2018Hey I\u2019m on a nuclear sub\u2019. I don\u2019t even know what it means to be on a nuclear sub, but I\u2019ve got to imagine it\u2019s not easy to get an internet connection.\u201d",
    "Needless to say, Mattrick\u2019s interview did not go down well, and Microsoft later backtracked on numerous Xbox One features shortly before and after the console launched, including the need to be always online.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED launches on October 8, 2021. It features a 7-inch OLED screen, 64GB of internal storage, a wider kickstand and improved speakers and a redesigned dock with a dedicated LAN port. In terms of technical specs, it\u2019s an exact match for the original Switch, which means it outputs at 1080p when docked and has a 720p display."
