    "Judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan are back behind that famous panel for a new season of American Idol - the show that has unearthed superstar talent like Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson in previous years. Who will be the nation\u2019s next singing sensation? The search is underway, and we're here to tell you how to watch American Idol 2021 from wherever you are in the world today.",
    "New York singer-songwriter Just Sam was crowned the winner of last year's show ahead of runner-up Arthur Gunn. It was the strangest series we've ever seen, and one that culminated in a finale that saw Ryan Seacrest announce the winner via video-link - poor Sam having to celebrate alone in her bedroom, brandishing a tablet with a feed of her grandma on it.",
    "The new season looks much more like the pre-pandemic version of the show we all know and love, with special Covid-19 safety protocols in place to allow the contestants to perform in-person for the superstar judges!",
    "Keeping up with tradition, the early stages of the competition, including the auditions and Hollywood shows, are set to be pre-recorded. Then we'll switch to a live format when the judges have whittled our 2021 hopefuls down to just 20 acts. That\u2019s the plan, and hopefully they\u2019ll pull it off without a hitch.",
    "Ready for another helping of the bizarre and the breathtaking? Read on to discover how to watch American Idol 2021 online and stream new episodes every Sunday from anywhere on earth.",
    "If you're abroad right now and unable to access the streaming services you normally use, there's a reason for this: geo-blocking, a common digital annoyance that means certain content can only be viewed in certain parts of the world.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream shows like American Idol online anywhere. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home."
