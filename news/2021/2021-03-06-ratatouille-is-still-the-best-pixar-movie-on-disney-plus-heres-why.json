    "Few film studios can boast the commercial and cultural pedigree of Pixar.",
    "Whether through toys, bugs, fish, monsters or even actual human emotions, Disney\u2019s flagship animation house has rarely misfired in its near 30-year quest to capture the hearts and minds of adults and children alike.",
    "With Disney Plus being widely available, subscribers now have access to Pixar\u2019s entire library of movies and animated shorts on demand \u2013 and none are more worthy of a revisit than Ratatouille.",
    "Co-written and directed by studio mainstays Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava, Ratatouille tells the understated tale of Remy, a Parisian rat with a talent for cooking, in such a way as to elevate the medium of family animation to genuinely artistic filmmaking.",
    "It\u2019s not simply one of those Pixar classics that brings something to the table for viewers young and old, but rather a masterclass in storytelling, humor and cinematography that makes it, for me, the best of the studio\u2019s storied collection of animated pictures.",
    "My fondness of Ratatouille can be boiled down to this: it\u2019s the most remarkable of Pixar movies for being so effectively unremarkable. It\u2019s not full of songs and spectacle like some of its siblings, and it doesn\u2019t try to hit those big emotional beats that other Pixar movies have so effectively touched on to reduce grown-ups to tears.",
    "That\u2019s because the story of a sewer rat with a penchant for parsley is more subtle with its choice of themes, at least when compared to the saccharine-laced narratives we\u2019ve come to expect from the studio.",
    "Up, for example, is a tear-jerking tale of love and loss (who could forget that opening sequence?), Wall-E a didactic warning against consumerism and Coco a thoughtful examination of culture and death. Toy Story plays on identity and the inevitability of change, while Finding Nemo goes-for-broke on its message of trust and perseverance. All these movies, by the way, are excellent \u2013 but Ratatouille is unique because its resonance isn\u2019t bound by the age or experience of its audience.",
    "That\u2019s not to say Ratatouille lacks meaning \u2013 Remy\u2019s talent proves we shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover \u2013 it\u2019s just less reliant on the emotional engagement of the viewer. The themes explored here are universal, and they don\u2019t pre-occupy the entire narrative (despite how many times we hear Gusteau\u2019s old adage, \u201canyone can cook\u201d). If you\u2019ll allow the wordplay, when it comes to questions of sentiment and morality, Ratatouille provides food for thought without overcooking things.",
    "That means the movie finds other ways of maintaining the attention of its audience. First off, Ratatouille is gorgeous. Really, it\u2019s something of a visual marvel. Despite taking place almost entirely in the brass belly of a Paris restaurant, the Pixar animators did a fantastic job of capturing the romance of the French capital and, in particular, its culinary heart \u2013 from the warm yellow hues of bread and cheese to the rich red tones of grapes, tomatoes and wine. If Ratatouille\u2019s goal is to make you appreciate the beauty of food, it achieves this and then some. Who knew carrots could look so delicious?",
    "The score, too, is exceptional. Michael Giacchino\u2019s fast-paced, French-inspired music expertly complements the urgency of the kitchen among a typically-relaxed Paris, and serves to heighten the sense of danger when proceedings do occasionally leave the doors of Gusteau\u2019s. In one sequence, the crooked Chef Skinner (voiced by the late Ian Holm) chases Remy through crowded streets and into the River Seine in what is a perfect example of Ratatouille\u2019s seamless marrying of visuals, soundtrack and storytelling. It\u2019s almost James Bond-like in its construction, and goes to prove that the movie isn\u2019t only concerned with what goes on inside the kitchen.",
    "Ratatouille is also very funny, playing on humor that is more slapstick in tone than any Pixar entry before it. Linguine stumbles around with a goofy elasticity that adds to some of the movie\u2019s most laugh-out-loud moments. This old school approach to joke-making works to create genuinely hilarious scenes to be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of age, much in the same way its aforementioned themes don\u2019t only aim for the grown-ups.",
    "All these elements combine to form a family animation that truly is for all the family. Everything is simple-but-effective here \u2013 the story, the art style, the comedy \u2013 and is executed in such a way as to meet or exceed the best the studio has to offer elsewhere. Despite being about the plight of an ambitious rat, Ratatouille is a refreshingly human adventure, and a reminder that Pixar doesn\u2019t always need to make us reach for the tissues in its pursuit of an animated masterpiece.",
    "Hell, it\u2019s a movie about a rat that makes ratatouille \u2013 isn\u2019t that enough to make it the best?"
