    "Nvidia's takeover of Arm may be slightly tweaked after the former appeared to step back from hiring goals made by the latter.",
    "According to the Daily Telegraph, Nvidia is trying to avoid signing a pledge which would see the number of Arm employees double compared to 2016 figures.",
    "Arm is still saying it's on target, but in order to complete the mission, it would need to hire \u201cheavily\u201d, until September, the Telegraph report says.",
    "Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang hinted that doing so could be counter-productive, stating, \"the type of talent we would like to bring to the UK and invest in the UK, are not that readily available. They\u2019re not a dime a dozen...I will hire as many Einsteins as there are.\u201d",
    "The hiring issues could potentially halt the entire takeover deal, with the UK government set to deliver its own judgement as well. Nvidia is still negotiating with the government, and a deal isn\u2019t expected this year - but if the agreement appears to be a \u201cthreat\u201d to the UK, it may be halted.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t come across much enthusiasm for this deal in Cambridge,\u201d commented Daniel Zeichner, the Labour MP for Cambridge. \u201cThere is a genuine worry about jobs going from Cambridge.\u201d Nvidia promised to keep Arm's headquartered in Cambridge. \u201cWe would still want binding commitments - we need some kind of guarantee before we can welcome this deal.\u201d",
    "But the government is not the only issue Nvidia should worry about, as several other tech giants have voiced their concerns about the deal as well.",
    "Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm have all raised objections to the takeover, saying that Nvidia could change parts of the Arm ecosystem to benefit itself at the expense of other Arm customers. Besides these three, Apple, Samsung, MediaTek, Huawei, and many other companies rely on Arm chips for their products.",
    "Nvidia has said it planned on keeping Arm's open business model in the future.",
