    "Anyone planning to spend their summer enjoying some newfound freedom out of doors should take a close look at today's Prime Day deals on phone accessories. We've spotted some impressive deals on power banks, wireless chargers, charging stands and gaming accessories for keeping your smartphone at optimal performance throughout your day.",
    "Most of the deals are for Anker and Samsung devices, thanks partly to Amazon banning Aukey and RAVPower for a pay-for-reviews scheme. You can trust the branded tech below to work well, and for the reviews and ratings for these devices to be more reliable. Some are even powerful enough to charge up your laptop!",
    "Even better, most of the deals are substantial, saving somewhere between 30 and a nice 69 percent in most cases. But they all end by midnight PT tonight, so don't dawdle in choosing your favorite. Let's dive into the deals, starting with US accessory deals followed by UK deals.",
    "(Live outside of the US or UK? Scroll down to the bottom for deals in your region).",
    "We rated the Razer Kishi as one of the best mobile gamepads when playing your favorite mobile or cloud-streamed games. It fits most phones, is comfortable to hold, and runs off of your phone's power, so you won't need to charge it separately. Once you're done gaming, you take your phone out and collapse it down into a more travel-sized device.",
    "We don't see deals on the Kishi very often, and it's certainly worth buying at this price. Just make sure you buy the correct version for your operating system.",
    "You'll rarely find any of the above products at a lower price, so consider carefully what you need. If you need a power bank, take each bank's mAh battery capacity and divide it by your phone battery's mAh rating to see how many times it can recharge it.",
    "Keep in mind as well that higher mAh ratings typically equate to thicker, heavier power banks, so larger ones likely won't fit inside of a pocket.",
    "Higher wattage or USB-C ports will typically translate into faster recharging, but your phone must be capable of accepting the higher wattage. Double-check your device's capabilities before you buy a fast-charging power bank, because your phone may still recharge slowly, making this tech superfluous. The same obviously applies to whether or not your phone supports wireless charging.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for power banks, mobile gamepads, wireless chargers and other phone accessories from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
