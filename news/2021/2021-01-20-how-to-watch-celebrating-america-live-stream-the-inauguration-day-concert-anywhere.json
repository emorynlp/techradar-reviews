    "It's been a tense and draining few months for everyone, and the incoming administration is keen to kick off their term in office with a bang, a boogie, and a (hopefully uplifting) distraction.",
    "The lineup for Celebrating America is something of a mixed bag, the idea of the organizers appearing to be an attempt to cater to all possible musical tastes, and you can expect some classic rock, a bit of rap and a liberal dose of pop smash hits, all melded together with several hefty hunks of gooey cheese.",
    "But it'll surely be worth tuning for the headline act alone.",
    "The Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, is the banner name - and some of the other performers include Justin Timberlake, Jon Bon Jovi, Foo Fighters, John Legend, and Ant Clemons. Hollywood royalty Tom Hanks will be on hosting duties, and we can also expect to hear from actors Kerry Washington and Eva Longoria.",
