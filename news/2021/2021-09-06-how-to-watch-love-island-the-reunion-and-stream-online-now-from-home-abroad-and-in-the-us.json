    "Last night the class of Love Island series 7 got back together and got a good grilling from host, Laura Whitmore. Liam and Millie came face to face with Casa Amor bombshell, Lillie once again, while Hugo faced Amy's wrath once again. There was also a pretty disappointing no show. Get all the goss since the islanders left the villa and make sure you catch up and watch Love Island: The Reunion online now whether you're at home, abroad, or in the US.",
    "It was a long eight week stint of ridiculous challenges, pulling for chats, recoupling ceremonies, and plenty of muggy behaviour. But it finally came to an end as Liam and Millie were crowned the winners of Love Island UK 2021.",
    "With a total of 37 islanders arriving at the villa in Majorca, though, there was plenty of drama, and some may even have a bone or two to pick. How did Brad feel when Lucinda cosied up to Aaron after his tearful departure? Is Matthew still a bit peeved Kaz pied him for Tyler? And how are Liberty and Jake after they walked from the villa and went their separate ways?",
    "Laura Whitmore had them all on a sofa (minus one pretty significant absence) to get the answers we crave, and to give us one final dose of vitamin D before we can well and truly bid farewell to our Love Island cast of 2021 - or stalk them on Instagram for the foreseeable, anyway.",
    "Keep reading to make sure you know exactly how to watch Love Island: The Reunion online back and catch up where you are.",
    "We've detailed how you can watch Love Island: The Reunion from the UK, but bear in mind that if you're abroad, you won't be able to watch Love Island UK from abroad, or access ITV Hub.",
    "Don't get mugged off by geo-restrictions, which restricts certain services and content to specific parts of the world. You can get around geo-blocks by using a VPN, or Virtual Private Network. It's completely legal, very affordable and easy to use - and it also encrypts your browsing, offering protection against cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Love Island final from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location (a server in the UK in this case)",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's stream - head to ITV Hub and start watching Love Island as if you were back at home",
    "Unfortunately, it looks like those in Canada miss out on an official broadcaster for Love Island UK. Don't miss a moment of the islander action as our boys and girls couple up, heads are turned, and another is dumped from the villa.",
    "The only way you'll be able to watch Love Island is with a VPN, which spoofs your device into thinking you're browsing from elsewhere and bypass geo-restricted content.",
    "Completely missing out on our dose of Vitamin D and the Love Island summer class of 2020, we were long overdue beach frolics and outrageous dates. That being said, with the pandemic still trying to rain on everyone's parade, many questioned what health and safety precautions would be in place.",
    "However, Love Island 2021 was filmed at its usual location at the Love Island villa in Majorca, though there were reports it had a backup location in Jersey if the Covid-19 situation in any way hindered travel.",
    "It has also been reported a large proportion of production took place in London rather than Majorca, including Iain Stirling's voice over. Gutted. Much of the show's other safety precautions took place behind the scenes, with little to know obvious changes on screen.",
    "Aside from the obvious elephant in the room (that pesky pandemic), Love Island has had other pressing matters to deal with.",
    "In recent years it has come under fire for its lack of safe-guarding of its contestants in preparing them for the barrage of fame and ridicule after appearing on the TV show. With the loss of Sophie Gradon in 2018 and Mike Thalassitis in 2019, both to suicide, there has been pressure for Love Island to do more.",
    "This year, a duty of care protocol was introduced in order to look after the mental health of contestants and better prepare them for life after the reality show. These measures also include support before and during filming.",
    "Outlined on ITV's website, all contestants received:"
