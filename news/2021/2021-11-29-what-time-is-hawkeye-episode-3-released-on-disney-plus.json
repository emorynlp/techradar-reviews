    "Update: Hawkeye episode 3 is now available to stream. Go go go!",
    "Original story follows.",
    "Hawkeye episode 3 arrives on Disney Plus later this week. That's right, the next installment in the latest MCU TV show lands on the streamer on Wednesday, December 1, so we've only got a couple more days to wait for its arrival.",
    "Last time out, Clint Barton and Kate Bishop were left in a bit of a pickle. The former had turned himself over to the Tracksuit Mafia and was expecting to be interrogated by Echo \u2013 the deaf, highly skilled superhero, who appears to be working for someone else, and who was seen at the very end of episode 2.",
    "Kate, meanwhile, was attempting to save Clint from his captors. But her break-out plan goes awry and now the duo are likely to be questioned at length, and it'll be interesting (and no doubt amusing) to see what happens next.",
    "So you'll want to know what time episode 3 of Hawkeye will actually be released on Disney Plus. Before we get to that, though, what else may be in store?",
    "We're expecting to find out more about Echo's past and her motives, and we're also anticipating that car chase scene that's been promoted heavily throughout Hawkeye's trailers and TV spots. It's the Tracksuit Mafia who's in hot pursuit of Clint and Kate, after all, so hopefully, we'll get a big set-piece in this week's episode.",
    "But we digress. Read on to find out when Hawkeye episode 3 will launch, as well as a full release schedule for the Disney Plus series.",
    "Hawkeye episode 3 will be released on Disney Plus on Wednesday, December 1 at 12AM PT / 3AM ET / 8AM BST / 12.30PM IST / 5PM AEST.",
    "As with all other MCU TV shows, Hawkeye's release time will vary depending on where you live in the world. For those in the US, it'll be a late night. For others, such as UK viewers, it may mean an early start before your next work shift begins. Marvel shows are often discussed in the workplace, so you may want to get ahead of the curve in case someone drops any spoilers.",
    "If you can't watch episode 3 until late on Wednesday, you'll want to mute certain words or hashtags on social media. You should mute the likes of #Hawkeye, #Hawkeyespoilers, and #Hawkeyeepisode3 if you don't want anything ruined for you before you stream it.",
    "Here's the full release schedule for Hawkeye, including when episodes 3 to 6 will arrive on Disney Plus:",
    "With the series' first two episodes clocking in at 47 minutes and 49 minutes, we'd expect episode 3 to be of a similar length. Every other live-action MCU show's episodes have been that long, although What If...?, which was an animated series, was much shorter in comparison.",
    "After episode 3, we'll already be at the halfway mark for Hawkeye. That means there'll only be three more entries to catch before the show ends. That is, unless Marvel Studios decides to renew it for a second season, which it did previously with Loki.",
    "No, Marvel hasn't released a teaser for Hawkeye episode 3 on Disney Plus. If we're correct with our earlier assumption that episode 3 will see Clint, Kate, Echo, and the mafia engage in that car chase sequence, though, we've technically already seen some of the show's next entry.",
    "Given that we'll reach the halfway stage of Hawkeye's TV show with episode 3's arrival, though, we expect to see a mid-season trailer from Marvel soon. The studio has given us a glimpse at future episodes for its previous TV series, so we're confident that they'll do likewise here."
