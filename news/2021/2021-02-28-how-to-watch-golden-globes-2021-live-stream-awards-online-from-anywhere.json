    "Hollywood kicks off its 2021 awards season tonight at the Beverly Hilton with the Golden Globes, a celebration of the best cinema and TV of the past 12 months that will be held virtually for the first time in its decorated 78 year history. Follow our guide below as we explain how to watch the Golden Globes 2021 online and live stream the ceremony wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "As our guide to this year's Golden Globes nominations highlights, the 2021 awards is a bumper year for original content produced by streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, who are increasingly matching both the ambition and budget of major networks and film studios.",
    "Tonight's winners will be catapulted not only to the top of everyone's must-watch list, but also be installed as instant favorites for the 2021 Oscars - postponed until April this year due to Covid-19, just like the Globes themselves were delayed by two months.",
    "Sometimes dubbed the 'drunk uncle' of the Academy Awards because it sees the stars getting skewered as well as honored, the Globes is can't-miss TV precisely because of its unpredictable nature. This year, that extends to some of the shortlists, with James Corden somehow popping up in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) category, yet Michaela Coel's I May Destroy You failing to receive a single nod. Hmm....",
    "Still, most of the movies, shows, actors, and directors being celebrated tonight are thoroughly deserving of it, so read on as we explain how to watch Golden Globes 2021 awards action online tonight - live stream the virtual ceremony from anywhere today, even if you're currently in a country like the UK where there's no coverage (but would normally be able to tune in at home).",
    "For Golden Globes TV and streaming details for a number of major markets including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, scroll down - but the 2021 awards aren't being shown everywhere, with one particularly notable omission being the UK.",
    "Unfortunately, if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for streamers all over the world, but there's an easy solution.",
    "Taking over from deadpan British funnyman Ricky Gervais to host this year's Golden Globes are Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.",
    "The duo have host three times before, so we're in good hands tonight, last getting a chance to rip into some of the world's biggest stars back in 2015.",
    "Streaming services have been on the rise at awards shows for a few years now, and the trend very much continues at the 2021 Golden Globes - especially with the coronavirus pandemic prompting many major Hollywood studios to delay the release of some of their biggest films.",
    "With 10 nominations, Amazon Studios has also capitalized on the closure of cinemas around the world, with its Golden Globes charge led by Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and Small Axe, as has Hulu, which has 10 nominations of its own, with its hopes largely pinned on Palm Springs and Normal People. Disney Plus and HBO Max have also registered their first ever Golden Globe nominations.",
    "By way of some history, Netflix picked up its first ever Golden Globe Award in 2014 - and seven years on the streaming service is the dominant force at the show, with no fewer than 42 nominations across the film and TV categories, with Mank, The Queen\u2019s Gambit and The Crown expected to be some of the biggest hitters of all.",
    "The great news for fans of quality entertainment is that this means many of the Golden Globe winners will be available to watch right away!"
