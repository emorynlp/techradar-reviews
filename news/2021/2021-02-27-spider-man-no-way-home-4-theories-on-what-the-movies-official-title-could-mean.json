    "Spider-Man 3 finally has an official title. Spider-Man: No Way Home will swing into theaters \u2013 Covid-19 permitting \u2013 on December 17. There's a chance this could be a bittersweet moment: it's technically the last Spider-Man movie in the actor's contract with Sony, though he's open to more, and we'd expect to see him return.",
    "Plot details are naturally thin on the ground right now, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the internet rumor mill from going into overdrive about what Spider-Man 3\u2019s title actually means. No Way Home is an obvious nod to Spidey\u2019s previous MCU films \u2013 Homecoming and Far From Home \u2013 but there seems to be more to it than meets the eye. This is Marvel, after all, so there may be some hidden context behind the subtitle.",
    "With that in mind, we\u2019ve come up with some theories as to what the third Spider-Man MCU movie\u2019s title could mean. Our guesses below are based on what we know about the movie so far, Peter Parker\u2019s comic book history, and how Sony\u2019s own Spider-Verse could hold the key to Spider-Man\u2019s future.",
    "No Way Home could be a simply reference to Far From Home\u2019s mid-credits scene. After defeating Mysterio and taking MJ for a romantic swing through the city, one of New York\u2019s giant screens broadcasts a \u2018breaking news\u2019 segment. To our surprise, J.K. Simmons\u2019 J. Jonah Jameson \u2013 who was part of Sony\u2019s first Spider-Man adaptation \u2013 appears.",
    "Jameson broadcasts doctored footage of Mysterio, which suggests that Spider-Man killed the villain\u2019s real-world persona \u2013 Quentin Beck \u2013 and was the real culprit behind the London drone attack. Then, to Peter\u2019s shock, Jameson reveals his real name to the world.",
    "Naturally, such a revelation would force anyone into hiding, let alone a superhero who has tried to keep their identity secret. If Peter is on the run from the authorities and other supervillains \u2013 more on those later \u2013 then it makes sense why \u2018No Way Home\u2019 is referenced in the title.",
    "It just means that he can\u2019t return to Aunt May, and the normal life he craves after the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. There\u2019s literally no way for him to go home until he finds a solution to this problem. Still, if nothing else, it looks like MJ and Ned are on hand to help him seek one out.",
    "Alternatively, No Way Home may refer to rumors surrounding a possible Marvel Cinematic multiverse.",
    "During Mysterio's first meeting with Spider-Man, Beck mentions that he\u2019s from another version of Earth \u2013 Earth-833 \u2013 and not the MCU\u2019s Earth-616. Of course, Beck was bluffing as part of his plan to get hold of the Stark Industries technology that he needed for his drones, rather than telling the truth about his origins.",
    "Still, this Easter egg and WandaVision's choice to feature the X-Men movies' Evan Peters feel like hints at something larger \u2013 we know multiple universes are coming to the MCU, because it's literally in the title of next year's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.",
    "In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes TV, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has also stated that the multiverse will affect the MCU \u201cbefore and after\u201d Doctor Strange 2, which lends credence to the MCM being the next evolution of the MCU. Add in the potential for WandaVision\u2019s season finale to dive into some multiverse mayhem, based on what we learned about Wanda in episode eight, and we have ourselves a Marvel multiverse.",
    "How does this tie into Spider-Man: No Way Home? Reports have suggested that Jamie Foxx and Alfred Molina will reprise their roles as Electro and Doc Ock in the film, who each starred in Sony's previous two Spider-Man adaptations.",
    "This duo wouldn\u2019t have a route into the MCU without some multiverse trickery. If they have been transported to Peter's Earth from their respective worlds, No Way Home could be hinting that there isn't a way for them to get back to their own dimensions. This could be down to multiverse exits being closed after they arrive on Earth-616, and that it will be up to Spider-Man to defeat them here or find a way to return them to their realities.",
    "Of course, it could be the other way around, and Peter could end up in their universes \u2013 hence, No Way Home for him.",
    "It remains unclear if the MCU\u2019s Spider-Man would have help in the form of Tobey Maguire\u2019s and Andrew Garfield\u2019s iterations. Rumors have circulated that the pair will reprise their roles from Sony\u2019s other Spider-Man series, but Holland shot that speculation down in an interview with Esquire. If Holland is telling the truth, it looks like he\u2019ll be fighting No Way Home\u2019s villains alone.",
    "Comic book movies have always taken inspiration from their paper-based counterparts, and No Way Home is certain to chart a similar path. While we have no idea about which comics Spider-Man 3 could lift ideas from, the four-part One More Day arc could have an influence on its plot.",
    "In this storyline, Aunt May has been shot and Peter is desperately searching for a way to save her life. After an encounter with the demon Mephisto, Peter and Mary Jane agree to give up her marriage to save her. Mephisto also removes the world\u2019s collective memory of Peter\u2019s superhero identity, which he had personally revealed as part of the Civil War comic arc.",
    "One More Day was panned by fans and critics alike for destroying Peter and Mary Jane\u2019s marriage, as it went against what webslinger fans had come to love about the characters over recent years. Despite being largely hated, however, One More Day could form a base for what No Way Home means in this context.",
    "It\u2019s plausible that Peter comes across some nefarious way of eradicating the world\u2019s knowledge of his superhero identity. It doesn\u2019t have to be tied to Mephisto per se, but we do know that dark magic exists in the MCU based on the demonic-looking Dark Hold tome we saw in WandaVision episode 7. All it would take is for Peter to be double-crossed by a villainous sorcerer, who grants his wish to re-conceal his alias\u2019 identity but \u2013 in doing so \u2013 alters the world as Peter knows it.",
    "In that sense, there would be no home for him to return to, and he would need to seek out the help of another sorcerer \u2013 Doctor Strange, anyone? \u2013 to return things back to normal. Back in October, The Hollywood Reporter claimed that Benedict Cumberbatch was signed on to appear in Spider-Man: No Way Home, so it isn\u2019t out of the realms of possibility that he could be the one to help Peter out.",
    "Our final theory is a bit of a stretch, but hear us out. If the MCU does have gateways to alternate universes, it\u2019s possible that Holland\u2019s incarnation of Spider-Man may end up becoming trapped in another reality and, as such, be unable to return home. See? It would literally be 'No Way Home' for him.",
    "Spider-Man 3\u2019s climax could very well see Peter trying to return Electro, Doc Ock, or any other supervillains and characters to their respective dimensions. In doing so, he could have to make a major sacrifice in order to close a faulty portal.",
    "If the choice came down to it, we know that Peter\u2019s selflessness would mean he\u2019d do the right thing, make the ultimate sacrifice, and save Earth-616 from being overrun with villains. He\u2019s already seen the impact that outside influences can have on his world \u2013 we\u2019re looking at you, Thanos \u2013 so he wouldn\u2019t want a repeat of something that may end up hurting Aunt May, MJ, Ned, and other people he\u2019s close to.",
    "If this did happen, No Way Home could even appease fans\u2019 desires to finally see a Spider-Man vs. Venom movie. Holland\u2019s Spider-Man could end up in the same universe as Tom Hardy\u2019s Eddie Brock, and how amazing would it be to see the webslinger go up against one of his most famous foes?",
    "Sony and Marvel seem to have a good relationship when it comes to Spider-Man\u2019s inclusion in the MCU, so something like this doesn't seem impossible. And hey, if Marvel ever needed the wall crawler for a future Avengers film, we could always see Peter return back through a multiverse gateway. He\u2019s a smart kid, after all, so finding a way back to Earth-616 (if indeed it's called that in the MCU as it is in the comics) wouldn\u2019t be outside of his wheelhouse.",
    "Hopefully, it won\u2019t be long before we get an official trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home, which would help us hone our theories on what to expect from the threequel. For now, No Way Home could mean any number of things, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see if any of our theories turn out to be correct."
