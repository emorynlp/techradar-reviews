  "article": [
    "If something\u2019s been a hit in Hollywood, you can guarantee it won\u2019t be long before everyone else is trying to replicate its success. So as soon as Marvel proved that a rich guy with robot armor, a Norse God, a World War 2 hero and a green giant with anger issues could form a successful supergroup, shared universes were all the rage.",
    "Unfortunately, it\u2019s since turned out that wrangling numerous disparate characters into a continuous, interweaving story arc isn\u2019t quite as easy as the MCU repeatedly makes it look.",
    "Marvel\u2019s distinguished competition at DC abandoned their attempt to emulate the Avengers when the original Justice League floundered at the box office. Universal\u2019s Dark Universe, meanwhile \u2013 an ambitious plan to bring together Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, the Invisible Man and other classic literary monsters \u2013 didn\u2019t even make it past the Tom Cruise-starring The Mummy. Only the Godzilla/Kong fronted Monsterverse and the creepier, lower budget Conjuring movies (with their Annabelle, The Nun and The Curse of La Llorona spin-offs) could claim to have played at Marvel\u2019s game and won.",
    "But on the small screen, the rejuvenated Star Trek franchise (the flagship of the relaunched Paramount Plus) is showing there\u2019s another way to do a shared universe. Rather than trying to get every one of its TV series overlapping, with stars popping up in each other\u2019s shows, Trek has pursued variety \u2013 with different kinds of storytelling, set across a variety of time periods. And unless you\u2019re Marvel \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, conventional rules don\u2019t apply to the MCU \u2013 this may be the best way to ensure your franchise lives long and prospers.",
    "The current Star Trek crop of Discovery, Picard and Lower Decks \u2013 soon to be joined by the upcoming Strange New Worlds, kids\u2019 cartoon Prodigy, and (eventually) Section 31 and a rumored Starfleet Academy series \u2013 aren\u2019t Trek\u2019s first warp flight into shared universe territory. Back in the 1990s, Star Trek: The Next Generation spawned a couple of spin-offs that operated in the same period of Federation history, with the three shows\u2019 storylines operating concurrently.",
    "References to the events of the other shows were a regular occurrence, with characters like Q showing up on multiple starships and space stations. Captain Jean-Luc Picard had a cameo in the Deep Space Nine pilot, while bartender Quark found his way into both The Next Generation, and the Voyager pilot. Klingon officer Worf\u2019s post-TNG posting to Deep Space Nine subsequently forced the writers to deploy some narrative sleight of hand to get him back on the Enterprise for First Contact and the other movies. Kathryn Janeway even popped up for a brief appearance in Star Trek: Nemesis, though she probably regretted it later.",
    "But as great as this shared DNA was for Trekkies, the homogeneous approach proved to be the franchise\u2019s \u2013 albeit temporary \u2013 undoing. With each crew wearing similar uniforms, operating the same computer interfaces on broadly similar starships, everything started to feel a little samey.",
    "Not even Deep Space Nine\u2019s admirable experiment with a space station setting and more serialized plotting could mask the fact that after 14 years in the 24th century, we\u2019d seen a lot of tachyon pulses and malfunctioning holodecks. Even the composition of the crews \u2013 with their then-standard comedy alien sidekicks and characters who longed to be more human \u2013 had become formulaic.",
    "There\u2019s more than one way to expand a franchise, however, and the current wave of Trek TV is taking a much broader approach to universe-building \u2013 it\u2019s so logical that even Mr Spock would approve.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re aiming to have our shows feel unique and different from each other,\u201d Star Trek overseer (and former leading light on the short-lived Monsterverse) Alex Kurtzman told Variety in February 2021. \u201cWe want to give everybody a reason to watch each show.\u201d",
    "Discovery was the flagship that relaunched the franchise, and on the surface its first two seasons are pure Trek \u2013 but its arc plotting and more cynical tone made sure it brought the franchise into the 21st century. Picard then told the story of a Starfleet legend whose best years are way behind him, before Lower Decks became the franchise\u2019s first-ever comedy. The incoming Strange New Worlds, featuring the pre-Kirk Enterprise, promises to be another evolution, much more of a throwback to the original series\u2019 episodic mission to explore the cosmos.",
    "Crucially, the connective tissue between the shows is not the characters, stories or settings, but the vast shared universe they exist in. Indeed, while Kurtzman has said there\u2019s an \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d between the TV empire he oversees, he\u2019s not planning on telling an MCU-like story building up to an epic Avengers-style conclusion. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut our goal is not to make it so insular that if you haven\u2019t seen the show you\u2019re lost when you watch another show.\u201d",
    "In other words, there's no reason a fan of the anarchic, brash Lower Decks has to also follow the slower, more thoughtful Picard.",
    "Perhaps the most important part of the masterplan, however, is the prime directive to explore different periods in the Trek timeline.",
    "It\u2019s over five decades since Gene Roddenberry first launched the USS Enterprise on its famous five-year mission. The subsequent 800-plus TV episodes and 13 movies mean there's a hell of a lot of Trek canon out there, and that\u2019s something of a double-edged sword. Sure, it\u2019s great for fans if you can lean into existing stories \u2013 such the \u2018Guardian of Forever\u2019\u2019s pivotal appearance in Discovery\u2019s third season \u2013 but it\u2019s also a big showrunning headache if you want to avoid contradicting what\u2019s come before.",
    "Ultimately, it\u2019s about respecting canon without being a slave to it. And given the choice, why would you confine yourself to a tiny corner of a vast chronology when you have so much unexplored territory at your disposal? Just because every story Star Wars has ever told on screen has been confined to a comparatively brief, 70-year period doesn\u2019t mean that Trek has to do the same.",
    "Before Picard, for example, canon had never addressed what happened after the events of Nemesis \u2013 aside from the destruction of Romulus in JJ Abrams\u2019 first Star Trek movie. Now the Sir Patrick Stewart vehicle is plotting all-new co-ordinates in the 25th century. And while Discovery started out relatively close to the Original Series\u2019 sector of the timeline, it\u2019s now blasted off so far into the distant future that Kirk, Picard, Sisko and Janeway have been consigned to ancient history. Even Discovery spin-off Strange New Worlds will have the best part of a decade of empty space before it starts overlapping with the events of the Original Series.",
    "So there\u2019s no need for a Picard end credits sequence to tee-up Strange New Worlds, nor for Michael Burnham to have face-time with Jean-Luc, because these TV incarnations already exist in a fully functioning shared universe. Kurtzman and co are following a blueprint that allows Trek to continue boldly going where no Trek has gone before \u2013 and surely that\u2019s what storytelling, and successful franchises, are all about. Make it so.",
    "Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: Picard and Star Trek: Lower Decks are all available on Paramount Plus in the US. Viewers elsewhere can see Discovery on Netflix, and Picard and Lower Decks on Amazon Prime Video."
