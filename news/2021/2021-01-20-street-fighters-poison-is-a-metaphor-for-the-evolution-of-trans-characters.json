  "article": [
    "2020 will be remembered for a lot of things, most of them terrible. But last year, warts and all, will always have a special place in my heart as the year transgender characters joined mainstream gaming in a big way. We\u2019ve had Lev in The Last Of Us 2, Tyler in Tell Me Why, and Leo Baker in Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 and 2, as well as the many indie games continuing to do brilliant, queer work in small spaces as they have for years, like If Found.",
    "Not only are these three major examples in a single year, they\u2019re also spread across genres. Lev is a charismatic supporting character in one of the year\u2019s biggest releases, Tyler is the first trans lead for a major studio in a slow-burn narrative choice game, and Leo Baker becomes not only the first non-binary character in the Tony Hawk\u2019s series, but the first playable trans character in a sports game ever.",
    "These are hugely important steps for gaming and for popular media in general, and while they\u2019re not the endpoint, they show clear progress, and invite us to look back on where transgender characters in gaming started. This leads us back to Poison, originally of Final Fight and now of Street Fighter, whose evolution is one of gaming\u2019s most fascinating stories.",
    "Poison is actually the second mainstream trans gaming character, but while the first is far better known, she\u2019s had her transness eliminated. Birdo from the Super Mario series has trans roots, explicitly stated to be a \u201che who wants to be a she\u201d in her first appearance. This in itself is problematic phrasing, misguided at best and mean-spirited at worst, playing more into the idea that trans people are \u2018just confused\u2019 and unworthy of respect or dignity. When Birdo was a queer coded villain to be mocked, it was deemed acceptable by the developers to out them as trans. Now that she\u2019s been accepted into the main roster, any hint of representation has been wiped away. Poison, however, has held onto her transness through the decades, and has much more interesting tales to tell.",
    "In pure gameplay terms, Poison has barely changed since her first appearance in 1989\u2019s Final Fight. There, she was a beat \u2018em up enemy, and now she\u2019s a playable fighter, but aside from that she looks the same, exists in the same genre, and has the same basic biker chick background. However, when you look at the changes around Poison, such as the various comments developers have made about her across the last 31 years, and her shifting position in the fanbase, Poison comes to represent more than the sum of her parts; Poison\u2019s journey mirrors the journey of trans representation in media to the footstep.",
    "In 1989, when she made her debut, trans characters on screen were virtually non-existent, and when they were depicted they were shown as confusing, confused, and often deeply misunderstood by their own creators.",
    "Poison\u2019s origins are startlingly similar. She and her partner Roxy were originally designed as women; not particularly trans nor cis, just women. However, according to Akira Nishitani, one of Final Fight\u2019s designers, quoted in the book All About Capcom Head-To-Head Fighting Game, because \u201cin America, hitting women was considered rude\u201d there was a worry that playing as a man and beating up a woman would not go down well, so it was decided that both Roxy and Poison would instead be trans, referred to by Nishitani as \u201cnewhalf\u201d, a Japanese sexualized slang for \u2018transgender\u2019. It\u2019s frequently used in specifically pornographic situations, often interchangeably with \u2018futa\u2019, which is also used to sexualize and mock.",
    "Like many early trans characters in fiction, Poison\u2019s roots are steeped in violence, and wrapped around the idea that trans women are just men in dresses. We see this in Psycho, Dressed To Kill, and Silence Of The Lambs, where assigned male characters dressed as women are the violent ones, while in crime investigation shows such as Bones, CSI, and Dirty Sexy Money, trans women are the victims of violence. In many of these examples (and many beyond), the trans women are played by cisgender men dressed up.",
    "Even this unsympathetic characterization wasn\u2019t enough for the American distributors; Poison and Roxy were completely removed from the western release, but they remained in the Japanese version. Confusing the issue further, Poison\u2019s designer Akira Yasuda considers the western version of Poison to be trans, and the Japanese version cis, according to the book Street Fighter X Tekken: Artworks. Meanwhile, Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono claimed in a 2008 interview with EGM that Poison is transgender in every version, but is post-op in the West and pre-op in Japan.",
    "The terms post-op and pre-op are typically used to refer to whether a trans woman has undergone gender reassignment surgery, but also have a history of being used to sexualize, and problematically suggest that genitalia is the sum total of a trans character\u2019s being \u2013 and the fact that Ono claims Poison\u2019s body changes depending on the market further strips her of identity too, and makes her less a character and more an object.",
    "Trans characters\u2019 identities have often been disregarded in the media, with creators too afraid, embarrassed, or ignorant to navigate the diversity of what being trans means, revealing contradictory details in hushed, scandalous whispers. Poison is no exception.",
    "Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, if trans characters were discussed at all the conversation began and ended with their genitals, and they were frequently either depicted as sex workers, murder victims, or sex worker murder victims. We're often viewed as accessories to stories, rather than capable of having stories ourselves. We were seen as more object than person, and as such were given basic descriptors rather than backstories.",
    "You might be wondering at this point why it\u2019s \u2018Poison\u2019 rather than \u2018Poison and Roxy\u2019 getting mentioned, when the pair share the exact same origin. Throughout the pair\u2019s history, it slowly became canon that Roxy was cis and Poison her \u2018crossdressing\u2019 friend, as confirmed in the Final Fight section of the 2006 game, Capcom Classics Collection. Crossdressing and being trans are not the same thing, with the former being an activity or hobby, and the latter being a core identity that shapes who you are as a person at the deepest level. To have Poison officially labeled a \u2018crossdresser\u2019 while also claimed to be \u2018newhalf\u2019 and both \u2018pre-op\u2019 and \u2018post-op\u2019 again shows a complete lack of respect for Poison\u2019s identity, and a lack of understanding as to what it means to be transgender.",
    "The community has stepped in where Poison\u2019s lore was lacking, and have embraced her transness, though not always in a positive way. She has been further sexualized and defined by her gender identity, being mocked and exploited through a variety of cosplays, comics, and fan art, which often refer to her as a \u2018trap\u2019, yet another sexualizing slang for trans women from anime. While \u2018trap\u2019 is not always used specifically for characters who identify as trans, it literally means \u2018people who look feminine but have a penis\u2019, and again ties gender identity to genitalia. Much like the transgender sex workers in 90s television, her transness was a vehicle for others to tell stories, often stories which served to humiliate Poison, rather than for her own story to be explored.",
    "However, through this, transgender fans have also come to identify with her. Trans representation has increased in both quality and quantity in recent years, but for a long time our community has had to feed off scraps, and through trans-positive fan art, have been able to take Poison out of the sexualized, exploitive, gential-obsessed mold she had been repeatedly cast in. Through these, there\u2019s a version of Poison created collectively by the community, a version who, in turn, can give that community the representation that Final Fight and Street Fighter have often failed to provide.",
    "Right now there are far more nuanced trans characters in media and in gaming, characters that speak to my experience, strive to tell real trans stories, and offer both relatable and educational figures for players to look to. Poison is paper-thin, and perhaps isn\u2019t a great trans character in her own right; but in surviving everything thrown at trans characters and making it through the other side, she\u2019s definitely an important part of transgender history."
