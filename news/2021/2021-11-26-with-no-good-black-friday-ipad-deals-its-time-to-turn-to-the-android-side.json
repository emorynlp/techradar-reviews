    "The Black Friday iPad deals are never any good, but in 2021 they've somehow failed to clear that laughably low bar, and we've still been surprised by just how poor the Apple-tablet discounts are this year.",
    "Seriously \u2013 we're talking just $50 / \u00a350 off super-power iPad Pros, and sometimes no discounts at all on entry-level or Mini tablets \u2013 and this outlook very likely won't change for the Cyber Monday iPad deals. If you were wanting to buy a new iPad in the Black Friday sales, it might seem like you're plum out of luck.",
    "(Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "It's not all bad news though, not as long as you're willing to try new things (and aren't committed to the Apple ecosystem already). That's because there are a few worthy tablet Black Friday deals on Android slates that make them much, much more tempting than an iPad.",
    "Sure, sure, sure: if you were waiting for an iPad deal, you might be already shaking your head at the idea of buying an Android tablet instead. But you shouldn't, as Apple's once-great lead in the market segment isn't as big as it once was, and with the superior discounts, the following Android slates are better value-for-money now. And there are still plenty of ways to share work progress between iOS devices and Android tablets using the Google Suite and other apps on both platforms.",
    "Samsung, Amazon and Lenovo are the three biggest players in the Android tablet space, according to Statista, so you can't go wrong with one of their slates.",
    "If you want a low-cost entertainment slate, the Amazon Fire devices will be fine for you \u2013 they're tied to Amazon's software ecosystem but this means they're designed for Prime Video, Prime Music, Kindle and other similar services, though Spotify, Netflix and loads of games work too.",
    "Lenovo devices can be good iPad rivals for work or play, but the deals listed above are for its lower-cost devices - these might be good for work but again they're mostly useful for entertainment and on-the-go social media.",
    "Samsung's Galaxy Tab S models are powerful rivals to the iPad Air and Pro lines, with fast internals, good-looking screens and styli included (so you don't have to buy them separately like an Apple Pencil). They also tend to be more affordable than their Apple equivalents.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for certain Android tablets from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
