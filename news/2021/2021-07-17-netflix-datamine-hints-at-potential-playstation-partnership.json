    "A recent datamine of the Netflix app has reportedly uncovered some PlayStation imagery, suggesting some kind of partnership between the companies could be in the works.",
    "Dataminer Steve Moser (thanks VGC) claims that they\u2019ve found imagery related to PlayStation products in the code of Netflix\u2019s iOS app and has shared their findings on Twitter. The images show renders of DualSense controllers as well as artwork from Ghost of Tsushima and Moser uncovered them alongside a logo reading \u2018N Game\u2019 and a shark fin icon.",
    "According to Moser, \u2018Shark\u2019 is the codename for Netflix\u2019s gaming project and they suggest that these images together could potentially \u201cindicate a partnership\u201d with Sony. What form such a partnership could take, however, is unclear.",
    "Moser\u2019s findings have emerged alongside a recent Bloomberg report (which mentions Moser\u2019s datamining) that Netflix could expand beyond TV and film to add games to its catalogue within the next year, and that it\u2019s hired former EA and Facebook executive, Mike Verdu, in the role of VP of game development as part of this push. According to Bloomberg, games would appear as their own genre of content, much like documentaries and stand-up specials.",
    "Rumors of Netflix\u2019s interest in moving into gaming have been around for a little while now and as recently as May a Netflix representative told TechRadar the company is \u201cexcited to do more with interactive entertainment\u201c, citing the company\u2019s history with \u201cinteractive shows like Bandersnatch and You v. Wild, or games based on Stranger Things, La Casa de Papel and To All the Boys.\u201d",
    "In that vein, Netflix is hiring for a Director of Product Innovation, Interactive, hoping that this person will \u201cexpand our slate of interactive innovations and capabilities, including but not limited to new types of features, game-like experiences, and different ways of interacting with stories.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Netflix and Sony do already have a relationship, which could also have something to do with these images. Earlier this year Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment struck a deal which will see Sony\u2019s movies come exclusively to the streaming platform from 2022 onwards in the US when they're first available to stream. This includes the upcoming Uncharted movie and could even potentially involve Chad Stahelski\u2019s Ghost of Tsushima movie adaptation.",
    "Though these findings are interesting, at the moment Netflix\u2019s plans around gaming remain unclear so it\u2019s all a matter of speculation. Bloomberg\u2019s report states that Netflix \u201chas yet to settle on a game-development strategy\u201d so it might well be a case of having to wait and see where this goes."
