    "Customer shopping journeys vary from one shopper to another. Some people walk through your doors because they saw a great product on display. Others may find you while doing online research. Maybe you have customers referred to you by their friends.",
    "Regardless of how they find you, anyone who decides to buy from your store ends up in the same place: the point of sale (POS system). This is the point where the purchase is completed and you hand over the products to the customer.",
    "Needless to say, the point of sale is a critical step to any shopping journey, which is why it\u2019s important to give shoppers a great experience.",
    "Doing that starts with having the right POS system.",
    "And that is exactly what we\u2019ll discuss in this post. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the factors you should consider when shopping for a solution and how you can select the best POS system for your biz.",
    "Let\u2019s dive in.",
    "A POS system refers to the components that facilitate the point of sale process. It consists of the hardware and software you use to ring up sales.",
    "At its most basic level, a POS system functions as a cash register that lets you record sales, take payments and issue receipts. But point of sale systems have evolved over the years, and today many modern POS solutions come with inventory management, analytics, and CRM capabilities.",
    "Continues below...",
    "Investing in the right point of sale system can benefit you, your team, and your customers in the following ways:",
    "This is the system that holds the point of sale process together. Without a POS solution, there would be no checkout and you won\u2019t be able to record transactions. Needless to say, it\u2019s a system that\u2019s absolutely essential to ringing up sales, and your business won\u2019t function well without one.",
    "A POS system (a good one, anyway) may also have reporting capabilities that can surface useful insights about your products, sales, customers, and more. With the right solution, you can gain actionable insights and make smarter business decisions.",
    "This benefit applies to modern retail POS software and restaurant POS systems that have extended capab ilities like stock control, customer management, marketing, etc. Adopting a robust point of sale solution gives you access to powerful tools you can use to grow your business. For instance, if your POS software comes with a built-in loyalty program, that feature can be used to drive repeat business.",
    "Find out more about how a POS system works.",
    "Any business with a physical checkout process needs a POS system. Such merchants include:",
    "Retail stores. Shops that sell physical goods (e.g., boutiques, supermarkets, convenience stores, etc.) need retail POS software and hardware.",
    "Read this article if you're looking for specific advice on POS systems for retail stores.",
    "Restaurants. Sit-down restaurants, as well as quick-service restaurants like fast food chains, use restaurant POS systems.",
    "Try this article if you're looking for specific advice on POS systems for restaurants.",
    "Entertainment and hospitality. Establishments where people pay for experiences use POS systems. Examples of businesses in this realm include hotels, cinemas, museums, theme parks, etc.",
    "Service providers. Salons, spas, and other service-based businesses also use POS systems.",
    "On-the-go merchants. Retailers and service providers that operate on-the-go (e.g., merchants at events or service providers that do house calls) also need a POS solution to ring up sales.",
    "Try this article if you're looking for specific advice on POS systems for food trucks.",
    "Now that we\u2019ve covered the basics of point of sale systems and who they\u2019re for, let\u2019s look at some of the top considerations you should keep in mind when selecting a solution for your business.",
    "Iron out the needs of your business",
    "It\u2019s tempting to immediately jump into research mode and find POS companies to check out, but before you do that, it\u2019s best to do some internal research and figure out your requirements. Doing so will give you clarity on what you need (and what you don\u2019t), which will make your search much easier.",
    "Here are some areas to look at when determining your requirements:",
    "Existing system shortcomings",
    "If you already have a POS system that you\u2019re looking to replace, start by identifying its shortcomings. What features are missing from the solution? What are some tasks that you wish it would let you do? What are your pain points?",
    "Take note of the answers to these questions and use them when you\u2019re researching solutions in the market. For example, if one of your system\u2019s shortcomings is the inability to take gift cards, then that\u2019s something you could keep in mind when comparing solutions later on.",
    "It also helps to discuss your POS system with your team. Ask the above questions to your cashiers and associates and document their input.",
    "Hardware",
    "Point of sale equipment can be a big investment, so if you have an existing setup, and you\u2019re happy with your hardware, then set your sights on solutions that work with what you have.",
    "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re using iPads for your POS. In this case, you\u2019d want to look for solutions that function well on an iPad.",
    "Also, take note of devices like barcodes scanners, credit card terminals, drawers, and printers, and make sure that the POS system you choose works with those devices.",
    "Software or apps that you\u2019re using",
    "The same goes for the software or apps that you\u2019re using. If you\u2019re happy with your accounting software, CRM, ecommerce platforms, etc., see to it that the point of sale solution integrates with the apps in your business.",
    "Your roadmap",
    "Knowing your current needs is great, but you should also be cognizant of your future needs. What does your business roadmap look like? Are you planning to expand or do new things in the coming months or years? You\u2019ll need a solution that can grow and evolve with you.",
    "Let\u2019s say you intend to open new locations in the near future. If so, make sure your POS system has multi-store support and lets you manage several shops with ease. Or maybe you want to revamp your customer loyalty program and introduce new perks. If this is the case, see to it that your POS has loyalty features or integrations that can make that happen.",
    "Your budget",
    "For obvious reasons, you need a system that fits your budget. The cost and billing structures of restaurant POS systems and retail POS software vary from one provider to another.",
    "Some solutions charge a subscription fee which can range from $29 per month to well over $500+ a month. Other providers take a percentage out of your sales, and there are POS solution vendors that do both.",
    "The best POS system depends on your needs and budget. But generally, the fees that you\u2019ll pay will depend on factors like:",

    "Catalog management",
    "Whether you\u2019re selling physical goods or services, you likely have a menu or catalog that lists your offerings. When selecting a POS system, choose a solution that allows you to track and manage your catalog with ease.",
    "Here\u2019s a list of things to look at:",
    "Multi-channel capabilities",
    "If you sell through an ecommerce store, on online marketplaces, or on social media, choose a POS solution that can integrate with your other channels, so you can track and manage your sales from one place.",
