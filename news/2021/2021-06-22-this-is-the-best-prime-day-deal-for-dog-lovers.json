    "Usually $169, you can now get the treat-tossing smart camera for just $118 in the US, saving you $51. Meanwhile, UK buyers can get the Furbo camera for \u00a3126, a reduction of \u00a3116 compared to its \u00a3245 RRP.",
    "For those not familiar, the Furbo Dog Camera allows you to keep an eye on your pooch when you're away from home, and even fling treats remotely, thanks to a handy app. Peace of mind for you, and a little company for your four-legged friend.",
    "If we didn't already have the Furbo Dog Camera at home, this is the Prime Day deal we'd be snapping up today.",
    "With a stylish design that can blend into any home, this pet camera is perfect if your dog is a little anxious about being left at home \u2013 and it lets you check in on them if you feel nervous about leaving them, too.",
    "The Furbo Dog Camera boasts HD video and gives you a 160-degree view of your room; the camera feed does have a slight lag, but it\u2019s only a matter of seconds behind real-time. It also has night-vision, allowing you to see your pet in the dark \u2013 handy if you\u2019re leaving your pet at home for a night out.",
    "A built-in treat dispenser allowing you to fling treats towards your pet by swiping your finger in the Furbo app.",
