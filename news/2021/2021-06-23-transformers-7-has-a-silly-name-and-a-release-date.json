    "Another Transformers movie is on the way, and this one has a slightly odd title \u2013 it\u2019ll be called Rise of the Beasts.",
    "The name was revealed at a virtual press event, alongside a release date of June 24, 2022. The film will be helmed by Creed 2 director Steven Caple Jr, and take place in \u201890s New York.",
    "A press release suggests Rise of the Beasts, which will become the seventh mainline Transformers movie since 2007, will \u201cintroduce the Maximals, Predacons and Terrorcons to the existing battle on earth between Autobots and Decepticons.\"",
    "For the uninitiated, Maximals are a subgroup of animal-like Autobot ancestors, while both the Predacons and Terrorcons are Decepticons (though also typically transform into animal-like machines). Basically, you can expect robot dogs to appear in this one.",
    "Following the announcement, Fandom's Eric Goldman took to Twitter to share further details surrounding the project. In one post, Goldman claims its producers \u201cfelt like the previous movies had exhausted the Autobot vs. Decepticon battle on its own,\u201d hence the desire to \u201clook at different \u2018tribes\u2019 of Transformers.\u201d",
    "Goldman also added that Rise of the Beasts will avoid the timeframe of Michael\u2019s Bay\u2019s previous entries in the franchise, and that the studio is \u201cnot considering this a full reboot of what came before.\u201d",
    "Optimus Prime will, however, once again be the movie\u2019s main hero \u2013 as per information disclosed in the press event \u2013 and do battle with Scourge, its primary antagonist.",
    "Goldman\u2019s tweets suggest production art shown to event attendees revealed the villain has \u201cbig clawed hands and smoking exhaust ports on [his] shoulders\u201d \u2013 though, at this point, we\u2019re still in the dark about Scourge\u2019s motivations. We\u2019re betting it\u2019s one of either revenge or world domination, though.",
    "As for its cast, Rise of the Beasts will star In the Heights\u2019 Anthony Ramos as Noah, an army veteran, alongside Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse star Luna Lauren V\u00e9lez and Project Power\u2019s Dominique Fishback.",
    "Rise of the Beasts isn\u2019t the only Transformers movie currently in development, either.",
    "Another as-yet-unnamed project, directed by Charm City Kings' Angel Manuel Soto and written by The Defenders showrunner Marco Ramirez, is confirmed to be in the works \u2013 so expect a flurry of shape-shifting super soldiers over the next few years.",
    "Given that the last film in the franchise, 2018\u2019s Bumblebee, focused on the plight of a single Transformer, there\u2019s every chance that Soto\u2019s project will likewise centre around an individual Transformers character, though we don\u2019t have any plot details for that one just yet.",
    "In the meantime, we await the arrival of Rise of the Beasts with bated breath \u2013 or a mild degree of enthusiasm, at least."
