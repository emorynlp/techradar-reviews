  "summary": "Microsoft is ditching Windows 11\u2019s frustrating default browser controls",
  "article": [
    "Microsoft has changed the way Windows 11 handles switching default web browsers, thankfully, reversing an unpopular decision it made when the OS was still in pre-release testing (back in August).",
    "A fresh preview (testing) version of Windows 11 (build 22509) now lets you switch the operating system\u2019s default browser with a simple single click; which is just as it should be (and the scheme of things in Windows 10).",
    "So, what currently happens in Windows 11? Well, Microsoft concocted a rather convoluted method in the guise of offering users more fine-tuned control over what browser opens what files, which was, as we observed at the time of its inception, basically a nightmare (and it remains so).",
    "You get one chance to change your default browser away from Edge when you first install and fire up an alternative browser, like say Chrome or Firefox \u2013 and when you pick that alternative, you must remember to tick the \u2018Always use this app\u2019 box. If you don\u2019t check the box, you won\u2019t see this prompt again, and instead you\u2019ll have to go into Settings yourself and manually change the default browser.",
    "The problem is that currently with Windows 11, this involves having to stipulate Chrome (or whatever alternative you wish to use instead of the built-in Edge browser) for multiple file types: HTML, HTM, PDF, SHTML, WEBP, HTTP, HTTPS, and more. As we already noted, the theory pushed by Microsoft is that this allows for more granular control.",
    "But what it really represents for the overwhelming majority is a lot of clicking and changing, but fortunately, as Rafael Rivera tweeted (via The Verge) to point out, in a new test build, Windows 11 now has a simple \u2018Set default\u2019 button for browsers, bringing things back in line with how Windows 10 works.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s Aaron Woodman, VP of Windows marketing, told The Verge: \u201cIn the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22509 released to the Dev Channel on Wednesday, we streamlined the ability for a Windows Insider to set the \u2018default browser\u2019 to apps that register for HTTP:, HTTPS:, .HTM, and .HTML.\u201d",
    "Remember, this new scheme is only in testing now, but with any luck, the change should come to the full version of Windows 11 eventually. As we touched on above, Microsoft\u2019s argument about giving more fine-tuned control for default settings based on user feedback doesn\u2019t wash, at all. Clearly, this was \u2013 well, still is for the time being \u2013 a way of making sure Edge keeps getting pushed to the forefront.",
    "Along with all the various ads for Edge, which as we saw earlier this week, have reached new lows in terms of anti-Chrome pop-ups (including \u2018that browser is so 2008!\u2019).",
    "We\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019ll say it again: Microsoft, you aren\u2019t going to nag people into using your browser (or anything else), it\u2019ll just annoy them and likely have the opposite effect, if anything. Nobody would be too bothered about the occasional pop-up, perhaps, but the amount of promotional activity, combined with software changes like this whole debacle around defaults, is dangerous territory to be treading.",
    "At least this Windows 11 default browser decision has now been reversed, and we hope that the change comes through sooner rather than later."
