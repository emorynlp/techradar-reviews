    "The leaks around the GTA Remastered Trilogy are coming in hot like a six-star wanted level as we get closer to a possible announcement by the end of the year, and a new rumor might have given our first look at the GTA Remastered Trilogy system requirements \u2013 and they are something to behold for an almost 20-year-old game.",
    "GTA News was the first to pick up on a forum post from leaker alloc8or with the minimum and recommended spec requirements, and if they hold up, they tell us a lot about the game itself.",
    "Here is what the post claimed as the minimum and recommended setup:",
    "Minimum requirements",
    "Recommended Requirements",
    "If anyone was hoping for a full on rebuild in the style of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Resident Evil 2 Remake or Resident Evil 3 Remake, you're likely to be disappointed. The recommended specs are not all that powerful, so even though the game is rumored to be remastered in Unreal Engine 4, it doesn't look like the core gameplay mechanics or character models will have gotten much of a rework.",
    "The processor requirements don't suggest a whole new physics system with more complex damage or effects calculations. And, needless to say, while we might get some advanced dynamic lighting, we definitely aren't looking at ray-traced graphics here.",
    "The amount of recommended RAM, though, definitely stands out since it is the closest you get to a modern AAA game requirement, and it tells us that we could see 4k textures throughout using the original, or even modified 3D models. That would fit within the limits of the processor and graphics cards, which don't even approach Nvidia GTX 1050 territory, but texture files are highly dependent on available system memory to store them whenever a new map is loaded, and 4K textures eat up a lot of memory.",
    "This definitely points to a dramatic upscaling of the textures and some modified models to cut down on the more blocky features, but anyone hoping for a major overhaul is going to likely be disappointed.",
    "Still, these games are some of the most beloved of the PS2 gaming era, so it wouldn't surprise us if players of a certain age throw themselves back into the new remasters to relive their some of their favorite gaming moments all over again."
