  "article": [
    "German MEP Axel Voss, one of the strongest proponents of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) firmly believes that it\u2019s time to give it an overhaul.",
    "GDPR was passed in 2016 and is hailed as one of the most significant privacy-related legislations with equally vocal supporters and detractors. However in an interview with the Financial Times, Voss argues that that GDPR isn\u2019t ready to tackle the challenges of the current environment.",
    "\u201cWe have to be aware that GDPR is not made for blockchain, facial or voice recognition, text and data mining [ . . . ] artificial intelligence,\u201d Voss told FT.",
    "The timing of the interview is significant as it comes just ahead of a vote by the UK Parliament to celebrate GDPR as a \u201cgold standard for the world\u201d.",
    "In Voss\u2019 opinion GDPR requires \u201csome type of surgery\u201d to take into account the shift to the new work from home environment that\u2019s brought with it a new set of technical compliance challenges that didn\u2019t exist before the Covid-19 induced pandemic. He argues that GDPR is a compliance \u201cminefield\u201d for organizations that have a remote workforce.",
    "\u201cIf you have a home office situation and you\u2019re dealing with personal data, you are left alone with numerous legal obligations that are difficult to understand. What are the requirements for dealing with data protection in a private home?\u201d Voss reasons.",
    "Voss says his views are shared by the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) coalition that also includes German chancellor Angela Merkel.",
