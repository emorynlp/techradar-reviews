    "In a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, revealed during a recent Square Enix livestream, it has been confirmed that the game will be a PS5 exclusive for at least six months after its release.",
    "This detail is shown at the end of the trailer, where small print under a declaration of the game\u2019s console exclusivity reads \u201cavailable on PS5 at least six months earlier than any other format.\"",
    "Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, an enhanced version of last year\u2019s Final Fantasy 7 Remake for PS4, will launch on PS5 on June 10, so if it is going to come to any other platform the earliest we should expect it to see that happen is December 10 2021.",
    "When Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade launches on June 10 it\u2019ll bring next-gen visual optimizations and new story content to PS5. The brand new story expansion called \u2018Episode INTERmission\u2019 features Yuffie as a playable character. You can catch a few glimpses of this new chapter as well as the PS5 enhancements in the new trailer, embedded below:",
    "Timed exclusivity isn\u2019t exactly breaking new ground for Final Fantasy. Most recently, the original Final Fantasy 7 Remake was a timed exclusive on PS4 for a year.",
    "As yet, though, Square Enix hasn\u2019t confirmed any plans to bring either the Final Fantasy 7 Remake or this next-gen upgrade to Xbox or PC. It doesn\u2019t seem beyond the realms of possibility that Square Enix would bring the game to Xbox Series X/S and PC eventually, though, especially in this enhanced form.",
    "Given Square Enix's 2020 commitment to cross-gen availability, however, it feels possible that this timed exclusivity notice could have as much to do with making Intergrade's new story content available on PS4 as it does with porting the game in its entirety to other platforms as the game's FAQ page confirms INTERmission is a PS5 exclusive.",
    "In addition to showing the trailer for Remake Intergrade during the livestream, Tetsuya Nomura also very briefly touched on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 2. Confirming that Part 2 will pick up where Intergrade ends, Nomura added that development on the game continues \u201csmoothly\u201d and announcements will be made when \u201cthe time is right\u201d.",
    "When Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade launches in June, those who own the original Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PS4 will be able to upgrade for free, with the ability to carry over their save data.",
    "It should be noted, though, that PS4 owners who take this free upgrade to the PS5 version will have to purchase the new INTERmission story chapter as separate DLC. In addition to that, those who claimed Final Fantasy 7 Remake it as part of PS Plus\u2018 March offering will not be eligible for the free PS5 upgrade."
