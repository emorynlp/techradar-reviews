  "article": [
    "Well, the day is now here...the Nintendo Switch OLED is finally official, costing $349 and landing this October.",
    "Original article continues below:",
    "After appearing to be almost a certainty a few weeks ago, the Nintendo Switch Pro wasn\u2019t announced at E3. Instead, Nintendo focused on showcasing upcoming Nintendo Switch games for 2021 and 2022, and that\u2019s exactly what we got.",
    "While it wasn\u2019t the most thrilling Nintendo Direct we\u2019ve ever seen, it at least gave fans another glimpse of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, which is due to release sometime in 2022, and a couple of surprises in Metroid: Dread and Advance Wars 1+2 Bootcamp.",
    "Funnily enough, despite making it clear that its E3 presentation would strictly focus on Switch games, Nintendo did actually reveal some new hardware: the Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda console. However, the upgraded Switch that so many industry insiders and analysts had predicted was nowhere to be seen.",
    "With so many sources pointing to the existence of Nintendo\u2019s new Switch, such as this report from Bloomberg, we\u2019re still confident that the console is in development. Nintendo clearly isn\u2019t quite ready to reveal it just yet, however, and E3 wouldn\u2019t have been the best place to do so.",
    "If Nintendo did draw back the curtain to reveal a shiny new Switch Pro, which is tipped to have a 720p OLED screen and output at 4K resolution when hooked up to a TV, it\u2019s likely that the company\u2019s upcoming lineup of games would have been completely overshadowed by the new hardware.",
    "A large chunk of Nintendo\u2019s conference would have required the company to delve into what the system can do, why it was made, and more importantly, why consumers should buy it. It\u2019s more likely, then, that Nintendo will opt to dedicate an entire Nintendo Direct to the new hardware.",
    "With many suggesting that the Nintendo Switch Pro is set to release this year, we can only speculate that an announcement is still imminent. To give us an idea of which month Nintendo might choose to reveal the Switch Pro, the Nintendo Switch was announced in October and the Wii was announced in September. In contrast, both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS were revealed at E3, and failed to get tills ringing when they launched.",
    "That\u2019s not to say the same thing would have happened to the Nintendo Switch Pro, but there\u2019s enough evidence to show that new hardware is best served when consumers can focus solely on its reveal, and not be distracted by new game announcements or what the competition is showing.",
    "With the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite continuing to fly off the shelves, you may be wondering why a Switch Pro is even necessary at this point. Well, with the Switch approaching its fifth year on sale, it\u2019s starting to look slightly dated, particularly for those who play Switch games on the TV. Having a better display and the ability to output at 4K would certainly appeal to those who wish the Nintendo Switch was more powerful, and it would also extend the lifespan of Nintendo\u2019s console, which traditionally last five years.",
    "Nintendo could also ditch the idea of a Nintendo Switch Pro and decide to make a Nintendo Switch 2, which could go a lot further in terms of innovating upon the console\u2019s current design. It could also support backwards compatibility so that the Switch\u2019s vast library of games isn\u2019t forgotten about.",
    "Either way, we\u2019re approaching the period where Nintendo usually reveals what\u2019s next, and we\u2019ve got no doubts that they won\u2019t try to surprise us in some shape or another. Until then, we\u2019ll have to wait until Nintendo\u2019s ready to share more."
