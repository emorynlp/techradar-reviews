  "article": [
    "One of the most exciting rumors we\u2019ve heard about the upcoming iPhone 13 is a feature Android phones have had for years: an in-screen fingerprint sensor. So how likely is Apple\u2019s next flagship phone to get it?",
    "We\u2019ve heard so many rumors that Touch ID is coming back to iPhones that it feels like a question of when, not if. But it could be coming in 2022 or later, as a couple other predictions suggest.",
    "Apple switched away from fingerprint sensors in its flagship phones when it introduced the iPhone X in November 2017, and its priciest phones have relied solely on facial recognition since. While Face ID has been very accurate and dependable for unlocking and secure authentication for apps, users have wanted an alternate method for years \u2013 a murmur which rose to a clamor in 2020 as widespread mask usage obscured its use.",
    "While Apple did release a \u2018fix\u2019 for the issue in iOS 14.5 \u2013 using a paired Apple Watch to unlock your iPhone \u2013 it was barely a half-measure, since it doesn\u2019t authenticate for app functionality and requires a pricey wearable, too. In-screen Touch ID wouldn\u2019t just be helpful in the current still-masked climate, but is just genuinely useful when facial recognition is too awkward. Don\u2019t take our word for it \u2013 ask any Android user, or the many iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 owners who aren\u2019t upgrading because they don\u2019t want to lose Touch ID.",
    "Given the persistent demand for an in-screen fingerprint sensor in a new flagship iPhone, how likely is it to arrive in the iPhone 13?",
    "Granted, we\u2019ve been hearing rumors that iPhones will get in-screen Touch ID for years, including one in September 2019 saying the iPhone 12 would get the feature \u2013 but even that leak suggested it could come in the 2021 phones (aka the iPhone 13) instead.",
    "Since then, other rumors have claimed that the iPhone 13 will get in-screen Touch ID \u2013 in October 2020, leakers suggested \u2018MESA uts\u2019 was coming to iPhones, with \u2018MESA\u2019 being a keyword for Touch ID and \u2018uts\u2019 for under the screen.",
    "The rumors continued into 2021, with a Bloomberg report in January suggesting the feature was coming in the iPhone 13. Another leak suggested the upcoming iOS 15, which is expected to launch alongside the iPhone 13, supports dual biometric authentication through both Touch ID and Face ID. This will exclusive to Apple\u2019s next flagship phone, implying that it will get in-screen fingerprint scanning.",
    "Various Apple patents suggest the feature is coming, like a couple filed in July 2020 for an \u2018Optical-Fingerprint Detection System\u2019 which at least suggests the company is seriously investigating the tech and, conceivably, integrating it into its phones. Another patent also suggests that the cameras could get \u2018subepidermal imaging\u2019 to scan the veins under the skin as an even more robust authentication, though it seems linked to Face ID rather than fingerprint sensing.",
    "Other rumors cite analysts with knowledge of Apple\u2019s supply chain, who claim the feature is coming in the iPhone 13, and will not only keep Face ID but improve it \u2013 with other leaks suggesting the front-facing cameras will be hidden under the display, too, to finally get rid of the notch.",
    "Other rumors, like one from early 2021 citing Apple employees who spoke with the Wall Street Journal, still suggest in-screen fingerprint sensors are coming to flagship iPhones, but don\u2019t specify a timeframe. The feature will arrive, but maybe not for a while.",
    "Other rumors are more specific that the feature won\u2019t come in the iPhone 13. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in-screen Touch ID will come in the 2022 line of iPhones, which presumably means the iPhone 14, though it could also include a mid-range successor to the iPhone SE 2020.",
    "Clearly, the rumors favor the feature coming to the iPhone 13, but that also reflects the nature of rumors themselves, which often correctly predict the existence of an upcoming feature but get the timeframe wrong. There are plenty of reasons in-screen Touch ID could skip the iPhone 13 but arrive in the iPhone 14, like if Apple isn\u2019t done implementing the tech, or runs into supply and manufacturing issues.",
    "Or Apple could just hold off on the feature because the company is never in a particular rush to jump on novel technology, with a tendency to let others debut and iterate new things only for Apple to then develop its own very refined version that becomes the new standard when it\u2019s released years later. Apple did this with true wireless earbuds (AirPods), tablets (iPads), and even the smartphone itself, making touchscreen-dominant design the market norm when it released the first iPhone in 2007.",
    "If Apple waits until 2022 to implement in-screen Touch ID, it won\u2019t turn people off of the iPhone 13. The phone range will likely sell well, given the success and sales of the iPhone 12 and all the flagship iPhones before it. But if this year\u2019s Apple flagships have the feature, it could convince Touch ID holdouts to make the jump \u2013 and join the modern generation of smartphones."
