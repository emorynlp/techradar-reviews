    "Move over Resident Evil Village, there\u2019s a new survival horror game in town and \u2013 after catching Dying Light 2\u2019s second gameplay trailer \u2013 we can safely say it\u2019s downright frightening.",
    "The trailer, which made its debut in the middle of TechLand\u2019s Dying 2 Know YouTube livestream, showed off a new hospital environment that was packed to the brim with turned civilians.",
    "According to the game\u2019s director, these nests are nearly impossible to fight through, but they can be navigated carefully if you\u2019re stealthy enough.",
    "Of course, as things always do in these sorts of situations, things go awry and before long the casual stroll through a creepy decrepit hospital turns into a heart-pumping nightmare roller-coaster as we have to watch the game\u2019s protagonist, Aiden Caldwell, escape from the hospital before he\u2019s either eviscerated by zombies or turned into one by the virus.",
    "Besides the awfully uninviting environment, the trailer is also a showcase for a few of the new zombie sub-types you\u2019ll encounter along the way \u2013 including the Revenant, a brand-new infected species that\u2019s smarter than the regular infected.",
    "While livestreams are rarely a good indicator of what a final game will look like, the latest trailer does show us what the PS5 and Xbox Series X can really do.",
    "Namely, that\u2019s the ability to include a number of high-resolution enemies on screen at once in an ultra detailed environment. That\u2019s easier to do when the setting is somewhere inside as then the game\u2019s engine only renders a small area at a time, but Dying Light 2\u2019s environments seem both complex and incredibly detailed.",
    "Watching the trailer you can see some interesting options presented to the player \u2013 when exactly to use the flashlight that could attract the infected and when to take chances by stumbling around in the dark by crawling underneath tables.",
    "We'll be excited to see if we can complete some of the game's missions in multiple ways like, say, Far Cry or a Bethesda title might allow, but so far the game's white-knuckle parkour gameplay and frenetic combat look pretty darn enticing.",
    "Dying Light 2 will be available on December 7, 2021 for PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PS5."
