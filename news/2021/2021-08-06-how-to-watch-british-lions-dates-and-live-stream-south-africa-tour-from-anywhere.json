    "It all comes down to this for the British and Irish Lions and their South African counterparts, as the two sides get set for a decisive third Test in Cape Town this Saturday. Follow our guide as we explain how to watch the Lions Tour 2021 online and get a rugby live stream from anywhere in the world.",
    "Led by coach Warren Gatland and skipper Alun Wyn Jones, the Lions jumped out to a 1-0 series lead with a thrilling 21-17 win in the opening Test, but were overwhelmed by the Springboks in the second, losing 27-9 in a fiery encounter to set up this weekend's decider.",
    "Gatland is ringing the changes for the third and final clash, after his side were dominated in the second-half of last Saturday's game - particularly in the air. That sees Liam Williams set to replace Stuart Hogg at 15, while Bundee Aki will add some heft to the midfield. In comes reliable veteran Welsh hooker Ken Owens, too, with set pieces of paramount performance on Saturday.",
    "South Africa will certainly go in to Cape Town brimming with confidence after such dominance. But their pulsating scrum-half Faf de Klerk will miss the decider with injury, while the awesome Pieter-Steph du Toit must also sit this one out.",
    "It's all at stake in the third and final Lions vs South Africa Test taking place Saturday, August 7, so read on as we explain how to get a 2021 Lions Tour live stream wherever you are in the world.",
    "If you're outside your country of residence - whether that be the UK or anywhere else - and try to start streaming the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to watch the British and Irish Lions tour from anywhere",
    "South Africa won the first two Tests to clinch the series but the Lions roared back to win the third match in style.",
    "Things have been better for the Lions since, with a win Down Under in Australia, followed by the most remarkable drawn series in New Zealand four years ago.",
