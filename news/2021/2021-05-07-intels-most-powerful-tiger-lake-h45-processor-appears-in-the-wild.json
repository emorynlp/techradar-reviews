  "article": [
    "Although Intel hasn\u2019t yet launched its 11th-gen Tiger Lake processors, its flagship model, the Core i9-11950H, has made its debut on Geekbench inside an HP ZBook Studio G8 laptop.",
    "The Tiger Lake line of processors is designed specifically for laptops and the Core i9-11950H will help Intel take on AMD's top-end mobile gaming processors, specifically the Ryzen 9 5980HX and the Ryzen 9 5900HX.",
    "However, as Notebookcheck warns, not all that much can be inferred from the processor\u2019s Geekbench score, since it usually takes a handful of different benchmarks with different configurations to present the true picture of a processor\u2019s performance.",
    "As it stands, there is only one listing for the processor on Geekbench, which can\u2019t be used to accurately gauge the actual performance.",
    "Furthermore, Geekbench notes that the processor was benchmarked while the laptop was running the optimized power plan, which doesn\u2019t put the processor under as much stress as Windows 10's Best Performance mode.",
    "While the scores aren\u2019t of much use, the listing does give us a glimpse into the specifications of the upcoming processor.",
    "From the Geekbench listing, it appears the Core i9-11950H will feature eight hyper threaded cores, a base clock of 2.6GHz and a boost clock of 4.9GHz.",
    "Furthermore, the processor features 640 KB of L1 cache, 10 MB of L2 cache and 24 MB of L3 cache.",
    "Of course, the listing also confirms that HP has a G8 edition of the ZBook Studio in the works.",
