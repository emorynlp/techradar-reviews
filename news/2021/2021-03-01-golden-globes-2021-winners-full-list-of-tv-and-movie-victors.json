    "Nomadland and Borat Subsequent Moviefilm have won the biggest prizes at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards.",
    "The duo picked up two gongs apiece on the night, with Nomadland winning Best Film for drama and Best Film Director for Chloe Zhao. Sacha Baron Cohen snapped up the Best Actor in a musical or comedy film as fictional Kazakhstani journalist Borat, while the sequel to the 2006 mockumentary landed Best Film in the musical or comedy category.",
    "Other notable winners on the night included Minari, which won Best Film in the foreign language category, and a posthumous victory for Chadwick Boseman in the Best Actor in a drama film for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Unsurprisingly, Netflix was the biggest winner at the 78th Golden Globes ceremony, with the streamer securing eight awards across its range of nominees.",
    "There were some shock winners at the first Golden Globes to be held remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic, though. Andra Day saw off fierce competition to land Best Actress in a drama film for her performance in The United States vs Billie Holiday. Best Original Song, meanwhile, went to Io Si (Seen) by Laura Pausini for Italian drama The Life Ahead, which beat out the likes of One Night in Miami and The Trial of the Chicago 7 for the gong.",
