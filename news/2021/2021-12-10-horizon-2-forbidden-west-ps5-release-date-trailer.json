  "article": [
    "Horizon Forbidden West has managed to cement itself as one of the most highly-anticipated exclusives for PS5 for good reason, and its February 2022 release date seems so close, yet so far away.",
    "Releasing on both PS5 and PS4, Horizon Forbidden West was originally slated for a 2021 launch, but was confirmed during Gamesom 2021 to be pushed back to February 18, 2022.",
    "The sequel to 2017's critically acclaimed Horizon Zero Dawn, we know that Horizon Forbidden West will continue the story of protagonist Aloy. This time around, she finds herself in the western United States on a mission to stop a mysterious threat known only as the Red Blight.",
    "The game, following on from Zero Dawn, will feature a large open world that players can explore filled with machines, gadgets, and weapons to discover. New activities include underwater exploration and a variety of new tools and weapons Aloy will acquire on her adventure. It's safe to say what we've seen so far is pretty visually impressive.",
    "If you want all the details about Horizon Forbidden West so far, and we're learning a great deal as the game's release approaches, read on. We\u2019ve collected together the news and rumors below, including its release date, trailers, price and more.",
    "Though it was originally expected to release in 2021, particularly after PlayStation boss Jim Ryan told GQ he felt \"pretty good\" that Horizon Forbidden West would hit that year, during Gamescom 2021 Sony confirmed that the game has been delayed until February 18 2022. While it's later than originally expected it is at least now a solid date.",
    "This followed PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst expressing a cautious approach to the release date in June and a Bloomberg report in July which claimed that Sony has pushed back the Horizon Forbidden West release date to the first quarter of 2022.",
    "In a post on the official PlayStation Blog, game director Mathijs de Jonge cited the global pandemic as a reason for the game's delay, saying \"It\u2019s no surprise that our teams were hugely impacted by the global pandemic; we have been adjusting to new workflows, protocols, and other challenges, while keeping our teams safe and prioritizing a healthy work/life balance.\"",
    "He went on to say that \"while the decision to move the game\u2019s launch to 2022 certainly wasn\u2019t easy, we\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of our fans for their unwavering support; we know how much you\u2019ve been looking forward to reuniting with Aloy and her friends, continuing her story, and exploring a new and more dangerous world. Your passion, fan art, cosplay, virtual photography, and videos have meant the world to all of us.\"",
    "Following a pre-order announcement from Sony, we finally know how much Horizon Forbidden West will cost at launch for its different versions.",
    "The Standard Edition, which comes with just the base game will be $59.99 / \u00a359.99 / AU$109.95 on PS4 and $69.99 / \u00a369.99 / AU$124.95 on PS5. Alternatively, you could splash out on a series of more expensive options like the Special Edition (which includes an art book with the base game), a Digital Deluxe Edition (which includes the base game and in-game digital bonuses like outfits), or the Collector's and Regalla editions which add physical statues and other goodies into the mix.",
    "Originally, Sony made the controversial decision to not include a free PS5 upgrade for Horizon Forbidden West's PS4 version. This has since been walked back due to fan backlash, with Jim Ryan announcing the PS5 upgrade will be free, and players will no longer need to purchase the Deluxe edition to be eligible for it.",
    "Additionally, all future cross-gen titles will feature a flat $10 / \u00a310 fee to upgrade from the PS4 to the PS5 version, which will likely include God of War: Ragnarok and Gran Turismo 7.",
    "If you want to know more details about the various editions of Horizon Forbidden West, you can check out the full announcement on Sony's website.",
    "A brand new trailer for Horizon Forbidden West was debuted at The Game Awards 2021, showing a mixture of environments and enemies we can expect in the long-awaited sequel. Check it out, below:",
    "During Gamescom 2021's Opening Night Live showcase, Horizon Forbidden West game director Mathijs de Jonge revealed the official release date for the game.",
    "We got another look at Horizon Forbidden West during a May 2021 State of Play. 14 minutes of gameplay were shown off, giving us a better idea of what we can expect from Aloy's adventures out west. Watch it for yourself below:",
    "Sony and Guerrilla Games revealed the first Horizon Forbidden West trailer at the PS5 games reveal event on June 11, 2020. The trailer below provides a three-minute glimpse at the kinds of varied landscapes you'll explore in the second game, and which machines you can expect to fight (mammoths and alligators, by the looks of it).",
    "We also get the sense that Horizon Forbidden West will be heavy on underwater gameplay, based on how much of a big deal the trailer makes of Aloy using her scuba gear at the 1:40 mark above, and the shots of underwater ruined cities.",
    "A direct sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West takes place 6 months after the end of the first game and will see Aloy travel west from her homeland to a new frontier setting. The reason for Aloy's journey is to seek out her allies and a solution to the Red Blight, a mysterious organism that's destroying the natural world and she'll meet new tribes and new machines along the way. Horizon Forbidden West will take players to locations like San Francisco, Yosemite and beyond, with narrative director Ben McCaw telling GamesRadar that \u201cthe vast, vast majority of the game takes place in the Forbidden West\u201d.",
    "Game Director Mathijs de Jonge has told IGN that Horizon Forbidden West has a larger, more dense game world than Zero Dawn. According to de Jonge: \u201cThe map is a little bit bigger, but in general, we\u2019ve really looked at increasing the density, and adding more content, making sure there\u2019s a lot more to do for the player across the map, and then making that content also engaging by telling little micro-stories.\u201d",
    "Some of the additional breadth and depth in the world is coming from new underwater exploration. Narrative director Benjamin McCaw explained that \u201cExploration is really the theme. And it\u2019s not enough for us to just show underwater. We wanted to make sure that it\u2019s every bit as beautiful as what you see in the natural world above it. But it wasn\u2019t just enough that you could swim around underwater. We wanted to do some things that are really surprising and interesting. And I think that\u2019s where some of the story stuff comes in, and we just absolutely can\u2019t wait for players to see what they\u2019re going to experience.\u201d",
    "As revealed in an official PlayStation blog post, there\u2019s an entire team, headed up by Espen Sogn, Lead Living World Designer, that's dedicated to making Horizon Forbidden West's \u201cworld feel authentic and alive: the tribes, the settlements, and the people within them.\"",
    "Sogn\u2019s team has worked alongside the narrative team and Annie Kitain, Senior Writer at Guerrilla, says that \u201ca lot of thought\u201d has gone into every tribe that players will encounter in the game. \u201cTake the Tenakth, for instance,\u201d Kitain explains, \u201cMany of their beliefs are influenced by the ancient ruins of the Forbidden West, and unlike other tribes, they\u2019re comprised of three distinct clans. Their shared history, convictions, disputes \u2013 all of that is important to developing the characters that Aloy will meet on her journey.\u201d",
    "The \u201ccompetitive and combat-focused\u201d Tenakth are both similar and different from other tribes in the game world and this, in turn, is communicated through the game world itself, through \u201cthe details, the animations, and the behaviors. Within their settlements, you\u2019ll see the Tenakth working out, readying themselves for battle. They\u2019re often younger because they need to be capable warriors. Their base is an ancient ruin, from which they\u2019ve picked up certain Old World gestures that they may not fully understand \u2013 like using a military salute to say hello.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe Living World team does a fantastic job, and it\u2019s so great to see it all come together,\u201d says Kitain. \u201cEach tribe starts as a bunch of ideas, then is translated into these amazing settlements. Like the Utaru, who were imagined as an agrarian society that\u2019s deeply connected to the land around them. Once the tribe is in-game and the Living World team has done their magic, you\u2019re walking around the Utaru\u2019s fields, interacting with them, and you think, \u2018whoa, they nailed it.\u2019 Now this tribe feels real.\u201d",
    "To add to the sense of authenticity, the post reveals that every non-combat NPC is part of a \u201ccrowd system\u201d, within which rules can be created. This allows Guerilla to \u201ccreate unique people who behave like individuals within the world.\u201d",
    "Aloy will explore tribe settlements through the game and she\u2019ll need them and the NPCs that populate them \u201cto sustain and equip her.\u201d",
    "According to Steven Lumpkin, Senior Designer at Guerrilla, the team \u201cwanted the towns and villages across the Forbidden West to feel lived in, vibrant, and useful.\u201d To that end, \u201cin each settlement across the world, you\u2019ll find opportunities for adventure. They are filled with merchants and vendors: Stitchers, who can sell Aloy powerful (and beautiful!) new outfits in exchange for shards and machine parts; Hunters, who offer an array of tactical new weaponry; Herbalists, who sell potent potions that Aloy is definitely strong enough to handle; and Cooks, who prepare invigorating meals that Aloy can carry with her for a boost.\u201d",
    "Guerilla is using Horizon Forbidden West's deeper and larger setting as an opportunity to give players more freedom of movement, with David McMullen, Lead Systems Designer at Guerrilla saying in a PlayStation Blog post that \u201cAloy can climb freely on and across huge sections of rocky terrain; even more machine types can be used as mounts; grapple points can be found throughout the environment which allows agile vertical traversal; swimming underwater has opened up a whole new aspect of exploration; and gliding with the Shieldwing provides the ultimate view of the beautiful world of Horizon Forbidden West \u2013 not to mention a quick way down from great heights!\u201d",
    "This focus on player choice extends to improvements in combat, too. According to Guerrilla\u2019s Lead Combat Designer, Dennis Zopfi, \u201cOne of the focus points that influenced all our combat decisions was increased player choice, and we applied this to everything: melee, weapons, outfits, skills and other new mechanics. We wanted to give players more tools, depth and dials to play with.\u2019",
    "This means Aloy will also be getting new weapons and abilities\u2014Narrative Director Ben McCaw explained how Aloy will have a \u201chuge variety of weapons\u201d at her disposal, with combat having an emphasis on tactics and choice\u2014but she'll also be able to upgrade and strengthen them. This will be done at the new workbench which \u201cunlocks new perks, mod slots, skills, and offers a bigger degree of customization, resistances, and new abilities for players!\u201d",
    "This upgrading is part of increasing the game\u2019s RPG and action mechanics, with de Jonge telling GamesRadar that it also \u201ccomes from just the desire to make the weapons more engaging, that you have a little bit more of a bond with these weapons. By investing time and resources, and by upgrading them, you get that feeling of like, you actually spent time to make this weapon better, rather than getting an upgrade from a machine and just slotting that in. You have to fight sort of machines or get other resources throughout the world in order to upgrade. So the whole loop is more integrated, in that sense with the rest of the world.\u201c",
    "As far as new tools are concerned, we know of quite a few: the Pullcaster; the Shieldwing; and her Diving Mask. All of these, Guerilla say, make Aloy \"more agile during both exploration and the inevitable battles she\u2019ll be fighting in the West.\" The Pullcaster, for instance, acts as a grapple to speed up Aloy's movements as well as a winch for manipulating, moving and destroying objects in the environment. The Shieldwing, meanwhile, \"allows her to safely descend from great heights (or surprise enemies from above)\".",
    "There\u2019s also a brand new skill tree, with the skill tree from Zero Dawn having been \u201ccompletely redesigned and repopulated with new skills\u201d to offer more depth. In an interview with Game Informer, game director Mathijs De Jonge revealed that players will be able to upgrade Aloy\u2019s skills to suit their playstyle.",
    "As part of the new skill tree, there\u2019s also a new Valor Surge system. There are 12 Valor Surges in total, \"each of them representing and strengthening a specific approach to the game\", and they\u2019re unlocked and upgraded by spending skill points in the skill tree, with players then being able to choose which Valor Surge is active at any moment.",
    "To unleash a Valor Surge move, the Valor Surge bar in the bottom right of the screen needs to be filled. This is done by \u201cplaying technically\u201d, headshotting humans or removing components from enemies, which will reward players with specific technical combat XP, which is its own point system, that can be spent in the skill tree.",
    "One Valor Surge shown as part of a State of Play gameplay trailer is known as 360 Blast. Another, shown on the PlayStation Blog is Radial Blast, used to knock down stockier foes.",
    "It sounds like you'll be needing most \u2014if not all\u2014of the advantages you can get with Aloy\u2019s new abilities, as her enemies can now hunt in new ways. Human enemies can now fight alongside machines as well as against them, and we've even seen them make use of mounted combat just as Aloy can.",
    "Horizon Forbidden West is expected to release on both PS4 and PS5 but PS5 players will enjoy some advantages that come from the power of the hardware.",
    "In an interview with HardwareZone, Guerrilla Games confirmed that the PS5 version of Horizon Forbidden West will feature the option to choose between a 60 FPS Performance Mode or a 4K Quality Mode, which will run at 30 FPS. It was Quality Mode which the May 2021 State of Play gameplay footage was using. The exact resolution for the 60 FPS Performance Mode hasn't been confirmed just yet but it's possible Horizon Forbidden West will go down the route of other games by applying dynamic resolution.",
    "In an interview with Game Informer, Game Director Mathijs de Jonge said that because of its power, \u201cthe PlayStation 5 can go much further [than the PlayStation 4]\u201d. De Jonge explained that, \u201cVisually we can add a lot more detail. Graphically, the rendering technique for the underwater scenes is special for the PlayStation 5, it has extra details and extra systems, like the wave technique is better on that system.\u201d",
    "On top of this, \u201cThe lighting on Aloy on PlayStation 5 has much more definition,\u201d as they \u201cuse a special cinematic lighting rig, that on the PlayStation 4 is only used in cutscenes because the game is not running and we have more processing power in those scenes. But with the PlayStation 5 we have plenty of processing power, so we can have that lighting rig always available, so she always looks great with that lighting setup traveling with her anywhere.\u201d",
    "PS5 owners will also be able to take advantage of the DualSense's adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, with Mathijs de Jonge confirming that \"The DualSense wireless controller adaptive triggers will help us to make the weapons feel even more unique and satisfying to use.\"",
    "David McMullen, lead systems designer at Guerrilla, revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that the DualSense\u2019s features are \u201cheavily featured throughout our mechanics. From the scrape of rubble as you push a crate, to the sensation of an unravelling winch as you use the Pullcaster \u2014 with the increased adaptive trigger tension as you pull!\"",
    "There are even some more subtle uses, with \u201cextra tactile dimensions\u201d such as \u201cthe sensation of grass brushing around you to indicate you are entering stealth grass, or the pop of the adaptive trigger as you reach maximum draw with a bow. We even use the absence of adaptive tension to help communicate when you\u2019re out of ammo.\u201d",
    "But PS4 owners shouldn\u2019t be worried about gameplay performance. According to de Jonge, \u201cA lot of the development has taken place on the PlayStation 4, and a lot of playtesting has been done on PlayStation 4. So we are ensuring that owners of that console have a great experience and the game will look fantastic on that console.\u201d",
    "We've compiled all the latest Horizon Forbidden West news and rumors below for your perusal:",
    "Resonator blast",
    "One ability we're particularly looking forward to using is Aloy's new resonator blast. As detailed in the blog post linked below, the resonator blast acts as a marriage of melee and ranged combat.",
    "Put simply, Aloy will build up a focused energy as she attacks with her spear. Not only does this mean melee combat is encouraged in Horizon Forbidden West, it's also very much viable in many circumstances.",
    "When the energy is filled, Aloy can send a projectile out that sticks to her enemies. She can then shoot this energy, acting as a target, with an arrow, causing it to explode and dealing massive damage in the process.",
    "Stronger Aloy, stronger machines",
    "A December 6, 2021 official PlayStation Blog post from Guerrilla took a bit of a deep dive into combat and AI improvements that will feature in Horizon Forbidden West.",
    "\u201cWe wanted enemies to feel more authentic by improving the fluidity and continuity of motion, like making enemies (and companions) more capable of traversing rugged terrain,\" explains lead AI programmer Arjen Beij.",
    "\"The AI in Horizon Zero Dawn already supported some dynamic terrain changes, but we wanted to take this further by adding jumping and climbing as a systemic part of their behavior. As you are playing the game, the AI will be searching for opportunities to take shortcuts, where it previously was a cumbersome detour.\"",
    "And it's not just the machines who are getting buffed in the sequel, as Guerrilla has paid special attention to the human enemies that will attempt to block Aloy's progress.",
    "\"We rely on readable silhouettes and behaviors that the player can recognize,\" explains gameplay animation director Richard Oud, \"so you can anticipate or react to an enemy move. We play around with the timing of those movements to not only create windows of opportunities for the player to strike, block, or run, but also to show some personality traits in the animations themselves.\"",
    "GAIA podcast",
    "Ahead of the release of Horizon Forbidden West, the team at Guerilla Games has launched a new, spoiler-filled podcast in which it \u201cdives deep into the Horizon universe.\u201d The first episode focuses on Aloy, the series protagonist, with more of a focus on the first game in the series, Horizon Zero Dawn.",
    "Peach fuzz confirmed In a September 27, 2021 post on the official PlayStation blog, titled Horizon Forbidden West: Evolving Aloy, Guerrilla community lead Bo De Vries wrote about just how much detail is going into Aloy's upcoming PS5 adventure, including something of a deep dive on the major graphical enhancements over the first game in the series.",
    "To really sell just how far the developer has come since 2017's Horizon Zero Dawn, lead character artist Bastien Ramisse stated: \"Each generation of consoles brings extra power that lets us add even denser polygons to our character models, so we can create finer details such as peach fuzz, smooth contouring, or finer texture details and accurate materials expression, to name a few.\"",
    "This was followed by a rather stunning looking screenshot of protagonist Aloy, showcasing graphical enhancements such as visible stitching on her clothing and relaxed braids in her hair.",
    "Developing for PS4 hasn't held anything back Horizon Forbidden West is coming to PS4 and PS5 but according to the game\u2019s director, getting the game ready for last-gen\u2019s consoles hasn\u2019t held it back or forced the team to scale back.",
    "Speaking with Hardware Zone (via VGC), Mathijs de Jonge said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the cross-generation development was limiting in any way. When we started with the concept of this game, we had so many great ideas that ended up being included \u2013 to the point that we didn\u2019t really think about hardware limitations or anything, we just wanted to design a really nice, unique experience for the player. An awesome adventure.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s how we also brainstormed all the quests and events the player is going to go through.\u201d",
    "That said, there are differences between what the consoles can do and de Jonge added, \u201cI think that the big delta between these two consoles, apart from the 3D audio, quick loading and DualSense of course, is on the graphical side of things. On the PlayStation 5, we can add so much more detail graphically. We can see the tiny hairs on Aloy\u2019s face, for example. You can also see a ton of detail from far away.\u201d",
    "This lines up with a previous interview with Game Informer, in which de Jonge revealed that \u201cA lot of the development has taken place on the PlayStation 4, and a lot of playtesting has been done on PlayStation 4. So we are ensuring that owners of that console have a great experience and the game will look fantastic on that console.\u201d",
    "In the \"last stages of development\" Horizon Forbidden West doesn\u2019t have a solid release date just yet but in an interview with Hardware Zone, game director Mathijs de Jonge has said that it\u2019s in the \u201clast stages of development\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe have just successfully completed our beta milestone, which is pretty far along,\u201d said De Jonge. \u201cWe\u2019re now in the final stages of development. So we are polishing the game and fixing bugs. We are also wrapping up certain aspects of the game, like some of the machines being behind schedule - because it takes an enormous amount of time to build them. We\u2019re working on the final cinematic. So, we\u2019re really wrapping up. There\u2019s still a lot to do with a game of this size and magnitude, but we\u2019re in the final stages.\u201d",
    "This comes not long after PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst expressed a cautious approach to the release date, saying in a PlayStation Blog Post: \u201cWe think we are on track to release this holiday season. But that isn\u2019t quite certain yet, and we\u2019re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.\u201d",
    "So, while anything could happen with the game\u2019s final release date at the moment, it is in its final stages.",
    "Virtually no loading screens During a dev diary video from Guerrilla Games, Horizon Forbidden West game director Mathijs de Jonge explained how the sequel will utilize the PS5's super-fast SSD.",
    "\"With the PS5's SSD, there will be virtually no loading screens,\" Jonge said in the video. \"In an open-world game like Horizon Forbidden West, if you open up the map and fast travel from one end to the other, or restart from a checkpoint, it will be super fast. When you boot up the game, you're right there in the action.\"",
