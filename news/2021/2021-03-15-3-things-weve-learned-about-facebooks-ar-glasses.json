    "AR wearables have long been thought of as the next great innovation in the world of mainstream consumer tech \u2013 but after all these years, no one has yet managed to come up with a commercially-viable proposition.",
    "Now, after the trials and tribulations of Apple, Google and Samsung before it, Facebook is throwing its hat in the ring to try and develop the glasses of the future.",
    "A recent post from Facebook Reality Labs \u2013 the brains behind the Oculus Quest headsets \u2013 suggests the company is intent on bringing about a world \u201cwhere a lightweight, stylish pair of glasses could replace your need for a computer or smartphone.\u201d But how realistic is this vision? What makes Facebook so confident it can succeed where so many others have failed?",
    "Here, we\u2019ll break down three things we\u2019ve learned about Facebook\u2019s AR glasses, and leave you to decide what is fact and what is fantasy.",
    "During a recent company-wide meeting, the Vice President of augmented and virtual reality at Facebook, Andrew \u2018Boz\u2019 Bosworth, suggested the developer is considering incorporating plans for facial recognition technology in its AR wearables project.",
    "Naturally, details were scarce as to how this technology might be implemented \u2013 it was more of a throwaway comment from Bosworth than a statement of intent \u2013 but we\u2019ll speculate that the glasses would be capable of detecting the user\u2019s face to determine whether or not they function (in the same way facial recognition software works as a mode of security for phones).",
    "Of course, this could also mean the wearables might be able to detect other faces, too, though why this would benefit their functionality is anyone\u2019s guess at this stage.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Bosworth made sure, during a later Instagram Q&A, to caveat that Facebook would only roll out facial recognition if people wanted it. The company has been the subject of a major privacy lawsuit in recent years \u2013 having recently agreed to pay damages to users who alleged Facebook created and stored scans of their faces through its photo-tagging feature without their consent in 2015 \u2013 so it follows that the company are exercising caution in this regard.",
    "Bosworth also tweeted that AR glasses \u201cwould be fine without\u201d the feature, but that Facebook is investigating the potential legal and privacy issues around using the technology. That\u2019s a fairly so-so verdict on whether or not we\u2019ll see facial recognition functionality on Facebook\u2019s upcoming AR wearables, but it\u2019s clear the company is at least entertaining the idea.",
    "The latest Facebook Reality Labs blog post suggests the upcoming AR glasses might also come with what the company describes as a \u201csoft wristband\u201d.",
    "Whatever this might mean, Facebook is clearly working on an alternative to more traditional interface methods found on existing smart glasses. The Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2, for example, had discreet finger loops that let you navigate menus, while Epson\u2019s Moverio glasses had you rely on your smartphone to engage with the wearables. Naturally, smart glasses require a method of interacting with what the user sees in front of their eyes, but neither solutions from Google nor Epson were particularly intuitive.",
    "Facebook, then, might be taking a different approach by having the user wear a separate wristband alongside the glasses. The blog describes the following scenario, which sheds some light on how this might work: \u201cSay you decide to walk to your local caf\u00e9 to get some work done. You\u2019re wearing a pair of AR glasses and a soft wristband. As you head out the door, your Assistant asks if you\u2019d like to listen to the latest episode of your favorite podcast. A small movement of your finger lets you click \u2018play\u2019.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem too far-fetched.",
    "A wristband like this would presumably harness electromyography (EMG) \u2013 technology which monitors the electrical signals traveling from your spine to your hand \u2013 to determine user decisions. It\u2019s not an entirely new technology, since we\u2019ve seen similar band prototypes for the Apple Watch which let you control functions with the tiniest of finger movements, but it certainly marks uncharted territory for the mainstream tech market.",
    "Following the hypothetical scenario in which you choose your playlist using this electromyography-enabled wristband, the blog post goes on to mention a pair of \u201csoft, lightweight haptic gloves\u201d that tell the glasses to project a virtual screen and keyboard in front of the user.",
    "Haptic feedback \u2013 which refers to any technology that can create an experience of touch by applying forces, vibrations or motions \u2013 offers an easy way of detecting and transmitting data between the user and device, so it makes sense that a pair of AR glasses could employ this technology effectively.",
    "These \u201csoft gloves\u201d (there\u2019s a \u201csoft\u201d theme here) would liaise with what Facebook describes as the Assistant, a Siri-like virtual voice which uses special in-ear monitors (IEMs) and active noise cancellation to soften the background noise and allow you to focus on the task at hand.",
    "Essentially, Facebook seems intent on introducing a range of \u201csoft, all-day wearable systems\u201d to address the interface challenges posed by AR glasses technology. As we\u2019ve mentioned, the blog post simply provides a hypothetical glimpse at what Facebook\u2019s wearables might be capable of when they\u2019re finally released to the mass market. When that time will come \u2013 and indeed which of these features will end up in the final offering \u2013 remains a mystery at this early stage in development.",
    "In any case, the glasses are \u201ccoming along nicely,\u201d according to Andrew Bosworth. Maybe Facebook\u2019s plans to crack this notoriously problematic technology are more fact than fantasy, after all."
