  "article": [
    "Black Friday is now well underway, but one thing you won't find during the annual sales extravaganza is stock of either the PS5 or Xbox Series X. Both consoles remain extremely hard to find, a problem that's likely to persist for many more months to come. The Xbox Series S, on the other hand, is in plentiful supply \u2013 and there are even some enticing bundles and discounts to be had.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s strategy of releasing a less powerful console was dismissed by some as a waste of time, but the longer the Xbox Series X remains sold out, the more attractive the Xbox Series S becomes. And more people are noticing the incredible value it offers.",
    "At a price of just $299 / \u00a3249, the Xbox Series S is significantly cheaper than the Xbox Series X and PS5 at $449, which are often bundled with games and accessories to inflate your bill even more.",
    "The Xbox Series S can be purchased on its own or with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass (new subscribers can get 1 month for $1 / for \u00a31), which grants you access to hundreds of games including Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 to name but a few. Xbox All Access is also a possibility if you want to pay for the console in monthly installments.",
    "While the Series S is admittedly a step down from the Series X, it isn\u2019t as drastic as some might think \u2013 you\u2019re only really sacrificing resolution and sometimes framerate. Fundamentally, you're still playing the same games as Xbox Series X owners, like the aforementioned Halo Infinite, and countless other next-gen titles that have been released. You just don\u2019t have to pay through the nose to do it.",
    "While it may seem an insignificant detail, the size of the Xbox Series S deserves the utmost praise. It\u2019s impossibly small \u2013 the smallest Xbox Microsoft has ever made in fact \u2013 and it looks absolutely gorgeous in person. If console aesthetics mean anything to you, the Xbox Series S is comfortably the best-looking piece of hardware in a generation; it makes the PS5 look like it was designed during a fever dream. It can also be placed vertically or horizontally and is completely silent in operation.",
    "It's also a great streaming box, capable of outputting Netflix at 4K with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support. You can also enjoy both Dolby technologies while gaming, which is something the PS5 doesn't offer.",
    "If you\u2019re tired of waiting for an Xbox Series X to come in stock, or a PlayStation fan who simply wants a place to play future Xbox exclusive games like Starfield without breaking the bank, Black Friday and the Cyber Monday deals event are great opportunities to pick up the already cheap Xbox Series S and get even more bang for your buck. It\u2019s worth it alone for Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer, honestly, which is completely free to play.",
