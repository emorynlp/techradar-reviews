    "Receiving its theatrical release back in September, it wasn't long before Shang-Chi became North America's highest-grossing movie of the year. Combining plenty of heart, humor, and some fantastic special effects, it was more than enough to coax people out of their homes post-pandemic to return to movie theaters. Now hitting Disney's very own streaming platform, here's how to watch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings online with a Disney Plus susbscription.",
    "Simu Liu plays the eponymous hero, a Chinese American known as \u201cShaun\u201d who works as a valet with his best friend Katy in San Francisco. Unbeknownst to her, he\u2019s actually a martial arts expert whose father is the leader of criminal organization the Ten Rings.",
    "After Shang-Chi is ambushed by Razor Fist, he reunites with his sister Xialing on a quest to the mystical village of Ta Lo, where they must prevent their father from unleashing demonic forces.",
    "Shang-Chi is a blast of fresh air, functioning as a unique stand-alone movie yet littered with dozens of wry references to the MCU. Plus, it\u2019s the first Marvel film to feature a majority Asian cast, including Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan, Tony Leung as Wenwu, Awkwafina, and Doctor Strange\u2019s Benedict Wong as the Master of the Mystic Arts.",
    "With a charismatic cast and a heartfelt story, Shang-Chi is Marvel at its best. You'll be able to watch Shang-Chi and the Legends of Ten Rings online now with a Disney Plus subscription.",
    "Disney Plus offers great value and is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix. Yet you can get more bang for your buck when you sign up for an annual subscription and get 15% off the monthly price. Yes, you have to splash a wad of cash initially, but with so much content to get stuck into, we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before your year is up. You're looking at $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for a 12-month membership.",
    "If your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously recommend the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN Plus to your subscription price, with the Hulu element opening up a world of more adult content, including Hulu Originals like The Great, Upload, Helstrom, and Normal People. Meanwhile, ESPN Plus brings tonnes of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "In addition to Marvel blockbusters, National Geographic documentaries, Pixar, the entire Star Wars saga and every season of The Simpsons \u2013 oh, and a growing roster of Disney Originals too \u2013 international viewers get the Star on Disney Plus. This provides titles aimed at grown-ups and more than doubles the amount of content available to watch.",
    "Some of the best Star on Disney Plus shows include Big Sky, Solar Opposites, Only Murders in the Building and Love, Victor. And parents won\u2019t have to worry about their kids accidentally seeing inappropriate content, because the rollout of Star includes a slew of new parental control features to ensure the service stays as family-friendly as ever.",
    "What devices can you watch Disney Plus on? The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
