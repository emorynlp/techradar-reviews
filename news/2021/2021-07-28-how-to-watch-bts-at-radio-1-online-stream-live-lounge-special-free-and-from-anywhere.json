    "Jungkook, Jimin, V, Jin, Suga, RM, and J-Hope, the seven-member K-Pop boyband BTS from South Korea, made their Radio 1 Live Lounge debut on Tuesday. But there's more in store for dedicated members of the A.R.M.Y. who can watch them perform three live tracks and an extra treat (an exclusive documentary) airing on BBC One on UK TV and via its BBC iPlayer service. Here's everything you need to know on how to watch BTS at Radio 1 online...and for free!",
    "BTS, otherwise known as the Bangtan Boys, formed back in 2013, but have seen success in recent years as they've experienced their mainstream breakthrough into global markets and climbed the charts in both the UK and US.",
    "Offering a blend of K-Pop, Pop, Hip Hop, and R&B sounds, recent hits include Permission to Dance - with writing credits including Ed Sheeran - and Butter.",
    "And there can be no accolade on British soil more notable than earning a slot in the Radio 1 Live Lounge. Hosting some of the music industry's biggest and best artists for acoustic renditions and covers - think Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Florence and the Machine - BTS were finally able to tick this off their career bucket list as they sat down to speak to Radio 1 DJ, Adele Roberts, and gave three exclusive performances.",
    "BTS at Radio 1 will include all three performances of Dynamite and Permission to Dance, and their special Puff Daddy, Faith Evans and Sting cover of I'll Be Missing You, as well as footage from Adele's catch-up with the boys. And here's how to watch BTS at Radio 1 online where you are for free...",
    "A part of the BTS A.R.M.Y and don't want to miss out on the BBC special as the boys debut in the Radio 1 Live Lounge? We've got all the details on how to watch BTS at Radio 1 below. However, if you're out of the country, you may run into issue watching live on BBC iPlayer, as it can only be accessed if you're based in the UK.",
    "This is because of geo-blocking, which restricts certain services and content to specific parts of the world. However, you can get around geo-blocks by using a VPN, or Virtual Private Network. It's completely legal, very affordable and easy to use - and it also encrypts your browsing, offering protection against cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to watch BTS at Radio 1 from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just choose between and head to BBC iPlayer"
