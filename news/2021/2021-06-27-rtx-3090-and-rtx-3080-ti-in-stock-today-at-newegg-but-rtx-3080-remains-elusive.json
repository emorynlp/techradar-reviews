  "article": [
    "RTX 3080 update: If you can't find an Nvidia RTX 3080, RTX 3090, or RTX 3070 GPU in stock at Best Buy, Newegg or Amazon in the US, then you're probably not following our up-to-the-minute tracker. There are no GPU restocks today, June 27, but that's a normal process, as weekend restocks are always slow. The new week is when to get a graphics card, and we'll tell you where to buy an RTX GPU.",
    "How to know about GPU restock: Our GPU restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider will send you an alert when RTX graphics cards are back in stock \u2013 if you follow his account and turn on notifications (the little bell icon). He sent out a tweet about the Best Buy RTX graphics cards restock, and several people were able to buy one.",
    "Trust factor: In addition to helping 52,500 people get next-gen consoles through his Xbox and PS5 restock alerts, Matt is now tracking GPU stock in the US. Here's what we expect to see today and tomorrow from multiple American retailers.",
    "The Newegg Shuffle on Friday had five different RTX GPU options available to purchase \u2013 if you were lucky enough to win the product lottery. There were also two AMD Ryzen 9 processors on hand. On average, five to seven followers of Matt Swider's Twitter account are able to get one GPU or another option, according to his tweet replies.",
    "The way the Newegg Shuffle works is... controversial. It's free, but it becomes a game of chance simply because these are the most popular items that Newegg Sells. Other retailers in the US, including Best Buy yesterday, have GPU stock for mere seconds. So the Newegg Shuffle feels fair.",
    "However, you could enter 100 times and still not get 'picked' to buy an RTX GPU. There are just that many people trying to buy a new graphics card. What's even more contentious among GPU buyers is the fact that Newegg tends to mark up prices with bundles, so expect to pay over MSRP.",
    "That being said, there were two MSI RTX 3090 GPU options today that don't force you into buying a bundle, but the price was $2,279.99 and $2379.99 for the top-end RTX card.",
    "The Newegg Shuffle is only one option for RTX GPUs. While we find Amazon to make it nearly impossible to buy sought-after graphics cards, Antonline RTX stock lasts one or two minutes for the RTX 3080, the most coveted GPU. That's aged in the restock world. Best Buy has RTX GPUs for MSRP, but the inventory lasts just one minute \u2013 if that.",
    "Antonline: Antonline often has RTX graphics cards in stock weekly and pairs them with other components (just like Newegg does). So you'll also be buying a motherboard, case, monitor or something else with it. The difference with Antonline is that it's first-come-first-serve (vs Newegg's lottery), so if you're fast enough, this is the one to watch. You just have to be okay with GPU bundles with tons of extras.",
    "Best Buy: Best Buy had Nvidia RTX GPUs in stock yesterday and they were at their normal MSRP online. This may seem better than waiting 20 hours in line when it's a rare in-store restock (see our RTX 3080 Ti launch line coverage). Because the RTX cards from Best Buy aren't part of a bundle and because they're at retail price, they last less than a minute in some cases and we advise people to keep trying until they're totally sold out.",
    "We'll let you know if RTX GPUs are in stock at Best Buy next week, although it's been every two weeks or so recently.",
    "Amazon: This one is at the bottom simply because it's harder to find a GPU restock at Amazon. Whether it's bot scooping up the console before everyone else or a lack of inventory, securing a GPU at Amazon feels next to impossible. That's why our GPU restock tweets tend to focus on Newegg, where it's done by chance, and Best Buy, where it often has two weeks of RTX stock built up and unleashes them all at once. Amazon GPU sales come in drops and drabs."
