  "summary": "What we know and what we want from the next basic iPad",
  "article": [
    "The new iPad 10.2 (2021) has only recently landed, but it\u2019s never too early to start thinking about the next model, which \u2013 since we\u2019re not sure of the screen size yet \u2013 we\u2019re just calling the new iPad 2022 for now.",
    "There\u2019s little in the way of news about Apple\u2019s next entry-level slate yet, but we can predict some things, and you\u2019ll find those below, covering the possible release date, price, and some of the specs and features.",
    "Then further down we\u2019ve included a wish list of what we want to see from the new iPad 2022 to make it the best budget iPad possible. And make sure to check back regularly, as we\u2019ll be updating this article whenever we hear any news or rumors about this tablet.",
    "We don\u2019t know when the new iPad 2022 will be announced but we can take a good guess, as the iPad 10.2 (2021) was unveiled on September 14, the iPad 10.2 (2020) was announced on September 15 of its launch year, and the iPad 10.2 (2019) on September 12. You\u2019re probably noticing a pattern here.",
    "They were all announced around the middle of September, and in the last two years they were also announced on a Tuesday, so if we had to get more specific we\u2019d guess the new iPad 2022 will be announced on Tuesday September 13, 2022.",
    "The time between announcement and availability is more variable, but it\u2019s unlikely to be more than a couple of weeks, so we\u2019d think the new iPad 2022 would hit stores before the end of September 2022, and possibly even within a few days of its announcement.",
    "As for the price, the iPad 10.2 (2021) starts at $329 / \u00a3319 / AU$499, and the iPad 10.2 (2020) had a similar starting price, so we\u2019d think roughly the same again is likely, but there\u2019s no news on that yet.",
    "There\u2019s no news yet on the new iPad 2022, but one thing we can be fairly confident of is that it will stick with an LCD screen.",
    "There was some suggestion that Apple might switch to OLED for the iPad Air 5, but recent reports suggest that isn\u2019t happening, and either way there was no mention of the basic iPad getting this display tech.",
    "There also probably won\u2019t be any significant changes to the front-facing camera, as that\u2019s only just had a big upgrade for the latest model.",
    "The chipset is sure to be better though, with Apple likely to equip the new iPad 2022 with the A14 Bionic from the iPhone 12 range based on past form.",
    "Two things that could go either way are the design, which might be modernized in line with all Apple\u2019s other iPad ranges, and 5G, which may or may not be included. We\u2019d think by 2022 it will be due, but the iPad Air 4 (2020) doesn\u2019t have 5G either, so Apple might add that to the iPad Air 5 but leave it off the basic iPad for another year.",
    "To make the new iPad 2022 as good as possible we want it to have the following things.",
    "The lack of Face ID on the new iPad 10.2 (2021) isn\u2019t overly surprising given that Apple currently reserves this tech for the iPad Pro range. But over in iPhone land it\u2019s basically now a standard feature and has been for years, so we\u2019d like to see the company make it standard on iPads too.",
    "We don\u2019t particularly expect the new iPad 2022 to get Face ID, since it will presumably be last in line for it, with the iPad Air and iPad mini ranges likely to get it first, but it would be nice to see.",
    "This tech has been around so long that it doesn\u2019t feel like it should need to be a premium feature anymore, so Apple, stop holding it back.",
    "The basic iPad range is now alone in being the only tablet range from Apple that doesn\u2019t include a modern design with smaller bezels and no home button, with even the iPad mini (2021) sporting this look.",
    "Instead, you\u2019re stuck with a very dated and relatively cheap appearance on the iPad 10.2 (2021), and it\u2019s one that we want to see gone with the new iPad 2022.",
    "The iPad 10.2 (2021) supports the original Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard, but it lacks support for the Apple Pencil 2 and the Magic Keyboard, making it less good both for typing and sketching than it could be \u2013 or than other Apple tablets are.",
    "Supporting these accessories shouldn\u2019t be hard, and we wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019d add much if anything to Apple\u2019s costs, so there\u2019s really no reason to block the iPad 2022 off from them.",
    "The iPad 10.2 (2021) doesn\u2019t have bad speakers, but unlike the iPad mini (2021) and the iPad Air 4, they don\u2019t recalibrate based on the orientation of the tablet.",
    "With one of those tablets then you\u2019ll be getting the best from the speakers whether you use the slate in portrait or landscape orientation, but not here. Hopefully, Apple fixes that for the next model.",
    "With the iPad 10.2 (2021) Apple upgraded the base storage size from the pathetically tiny 32GB of the iPad 10.2 (2020), to a still rather small 64GB.",
    "We know this is a cheap slate, so the company wants to keep the cost down as much as possible, but 64GB is a just barely acceptable amount of storage in 2021, let alone 2022 when the next model is expected. So we want to see the new iPad 2022 start with 128GB of storage, especially as there\u2019s no microSD card slot."
