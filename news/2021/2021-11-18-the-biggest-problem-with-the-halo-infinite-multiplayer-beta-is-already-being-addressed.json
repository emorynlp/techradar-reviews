  "article": [
    "Developer 343 Industries has revealed that Halo Infinite\u2019s Battle Pass is in the process of being adjusted based on player feedback, and that changes will be rolling out soon.",
    "Halo Community Manager at 343 Industries John Junyszek took to Twitter to inform players of the upcoming tweaks to the Battle Pass progression system, which includes new challenges, bug fixes, and a longer XP boost duration. According to Junyszek, these changes should ultimately help players progress through the Battle Pass faster.",
    "Even though the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta has been extremely well received since its surprise launch on November 15, 2021 \u2013 which marked the 20th anniversary of Xbox and Halo: Combat Evolved \u2013 the Battle Pass progression system has been criticized.",
    "Currently, Halo Infinite rewards players with XP for completing in-game challenges. As you gain XP, you slowly progress through the Battle Pass levels and unlock various rewards like cosmetics, new AI companions, and boosters. However, Halo Infinite only gives players XP for completing challenges, which poses a number of problems.",
    "Firstly, several challenges are tied to specific game modes. If, for example, you have a challenge that requires you to play Big Team Battle, you might find it remains locked if that\u2019s not a mode you usually play. Other challenges require players to complete rather specific in-game actions, like knocking an enemy off the edge of the map or wracking up a number of kills while on a warthog turret.",
    "Some challenges can be swapped, but only at the cost of using the \u2018challenge swap\u2019 item. There\u2019s also a risk that some challenges won\u2019t unlock \u2013 we've had one challenge that we've completed numerous times, only to see it stubbornly remain.",
    "As a result of these changes, Junyszek noted that Weekly Challenge progress will need to be reset. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 to make up for the reset, every player who logs in from November 23 to November 30 will receive the week\u2019s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor.",
    "The current excitement around Halo Infinite is reminiscent of Halo 3\u2019s historic launch, which many fans would regard as the pinnacle of the series\u2019 popularity. The game\u2019s surprise launch on November 15 has been almost inconceivably smooth, with server issues and the litany of problems that online games usually face nowhere to be found. Some players did encounter a Halo Infinite blue screen error when the game first dropped, but it appears that problem has all but been resolved.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s strategy of making the game free-to-play and accessible on Steam has also seemingly paid dividends. The game smashed the current Steam record for an Xbox Game Studios title, amassing over 270k concurrent players in a couple of days. While we\u2019re still waiting for official player count figures, it\u2019s likely that Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer beta will amass similar numbers to Forza Horizon 5, which reached over one million players before it even launched.",
    "It\u2019s worth remembering that Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer is still in beta, with the game officially launching on December 8, 2021. All player progress in the beta carries over to the official build, so there\u2019s no need to worry about any of your unlocks, ranks, or stats being lost. If you haven't jumped in yet, here's how to download the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta.",
    "Of course, Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer is only one part of what Microsoft hopes will be a two-punch combo. The game\u2019s highly anticipated campaign launches on December 8 and promises to be a spiritual successor to Halo: Combat Evolved. Unlike Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer, which is free-to-play, the campaign will only be available to those who purchase the game or subscribe to Xbox Game Pass.",
    "The release of Halo Infinite bookends an incredibly strong six months for Xbox. Since July, players have been treated to first-party titles like Microsoft Flight Simulator, Psychonauts 2, Forza Horizon 5, and Skyrim: Anniversary Edition. Microsoft also added over 70 Xbox 360 and original Xbox games to its backward compatibility program and launched Xbox Cloud Gaming for consoles, which allows Xbox One owners to play Gen 9 titles like The Medium and Microsoft Flight Simulator via the cloud.",
    "With Black Friday 2021 right around the corner, there\u2019s no doubt that Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S will be popular with consumers, then \u2013 and we\u2019ll be rounding up all the best Black Friday Xbox Series X deals and Xbox Series X Cyber Monday deals so you don\u2019t miss out on any of the best offers during the annual sales extravaganza."
