    "We have a cracker of an Australian Open semi-final to look forward to on Rod Laver Arena, as two of the most promising starlets on the circuit in world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev and world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas cross rackets for a shot at a maiden grand slam title. Read on as we explain how to watch Australian Open tennis online and get a Tsitsipas vs Medvedev live stream wherever you are right now.",
    "Medvedev dominates their head-to-head, winning five of the six matches they've played against each other, but Tsitsipas came out on top in their most recent encounter, which wasn't very recent at all, as by some quirk of the draw they didn't actually meet in 2020.",
    "The 22-year-old Tsitsipas played arguably the game of his life to complete a scarcely believable comeback against Rafael Nadal in the last round, while Medvedev has looked brilliant in Melbourne, having come into the Aussie Open off the back of triumphs at the ATP Finals and the ATP Cup.",
    "They're both taking huge steps towards usurping the old triumvirate, but right now they have just one appearance in a grand slam final between them, an unforgettable 2019 US Open final that marked Medvedev's arrival. That will change this weekend.",
    "Who will earn their shot at glory? You don't have to miss a single point from Melbourne Park as it couldn't be easier to get an Australian Open live stream from all corners of the world. Watch all the drama unfold as it happens by following our Tsitsipas vs Medvedev live stream guide below to watch Australian Open 2021 tennis online today.",
    "For broadcast and streaming details in tennis-mad countries like the UK, Australia, US, Canada and New Zealand, just scroll down the page - everything you need to know is there, including details of who is showing the tennis.",
    "But if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for sports fans all over the world. Fortunately, there's an easy solution."
