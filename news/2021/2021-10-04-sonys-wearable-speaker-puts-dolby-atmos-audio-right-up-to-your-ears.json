    "Sony is putting Dolby Atmos spatial audio in a new place \u2013 around your neck. It\u2019s all thanks to the new Sony SRS-NS7 wireless neckband speaker that can stream Dolby Atmos tracks from a connected Bravia XR TV when you pair it with a wireless transmitter.",
    "That sounds like a lot of work to get Dolby Atmos sound \u2013 but it\u2019s a nice alternative to filling your living room with floor-standing speakers for folks who are short on space.",
    "In addition to Dolby Atmos sound from the TV, the SRS-NS7 can stream Sony 360 Reality Audio tracks from Deezer and Tidal from a smartphone. To tune the sound for your ears, Sony is releasing a 360 Spatial Sound Personalizer app that you can use to take a photo of your ears to make the sound more immersive.",
    "According to Sony, the wearable Dolby Atmos speaker has a 12-hour battery life at a regular volume level and around five hours when you crank it up to the max level. It\u2019s IPX4 water-resistant \u2013 which is nice but probably not insulated enough to wear out in public. (Please, please don\u2019t wear this in public.)",
    "The Sony SRS-NS7 wireless neckband speaker will be available to purchase soon for $299 (around \u00a3220, AU$400) while an additional WLA-NS7 wireless transmitter that connects the speaker to a Bravia TV can be picked up soon for $59 (around \u00a344, AU$80).",
    "Neckband speakers have long existed as an alternative to traditional over-ear headphones. The latter are unmatched when it comes to critical listening, but the former are certainly more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.",
    "The tradeoff that neckband speakers have always made is that they\u2019re usually lacking in the technology department \u2013 because, after all, they\u2019re limited by Bluetooth\u2019s small bandwidth \u2013 and that meant that they never really sounded as good as other types of speakers.",
    "Sony is trying to change that with the SRS-NS7 \u2013 but it will require the help of that wireless transmitter if you want to stream Dolby Atmos tracks. Sony has reached out to inform us that one comes in the box, and says that a second reciever is sold separately. That said, Atmos content can only be streamed from compatible Bravia TVs.",
    "There are a few drawbacks to it, however even with those caveats the NS7 seems like it\u2019s an elegant solution for an age-old problem."
