    "You can now experience Dolby Vision gaming and Dolby Atmos on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but which games support both of these technologies?",
    "Dolby Atmos support has been around for a while and first debuted on Xbox One back in 2017. The spatial audio tech requires a license to use on headphones, but it\u2019s free to use on soundbars and speakers. Some headphones do come with a free license, though, like the Xbox Wireless Headset.",
    "Dolby Vision requires a compatible display but is also free to those who can enable it. Currently, however, not every TV that supports Dolby Vision gaming can output at 120Hz, but Microsoft and Dolby are working closely with TV manufacturers to update more displays via a firmware update in the future. Noticeable sets that are awaiting an update include the LG CX, which the manufacturer has confirmed is coming soon.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for every Xbox Series X/S game with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, check out the full list below.",
    "More than 100 next-gen HDR-capable titles will support Dolby Vision soon, including games available today and in the future such as Halo Infinite, which was tipped to include Dolby Vision support a few months ago. Not all of them will support Dolby Vision gaming and Atmos, though, but these are the titles that do.",
    "We\u2019ll keep this page updated should more games with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support appear in the future.",
