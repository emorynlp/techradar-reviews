  "article": [
    "Finally, after three years of waiting, we\u2019re getting a sequel to the critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie.",
    "Or should that be two sequels? Yes, you heard us right \u2013 Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 is the first of a two-part follow-up to Sony Pictures\u2019 beloved animated flick. And, with the next instalment in the superhero film franchise due to arrive next year, it\u2019s time to start getting excited for its return.",
    "Before it lands in theaters, though, we suspect that you want to learn more about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1. What is the story about? Which characters are returning? And will it look as gorgeous as its predecessor?",
    "Below, you\u2019ll find everything you need to know about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1. We reveal when its release date is, which actors are part of the voice cast, what trailers have dropped so far, and much more. So grab your web-shooters and let\u2019s swing into action, shall we?",
    "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 will arrive in theaters on October 7, 2022. It was originally supposed to arrive in April 2022 but, like every other movie that was set to launch over the past 18 months, the ongoing pandemic delayed its release.",
    "Providing there aren\u2019t any further setbacks, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 shouldn't be delayed again. Here\u2019s hoping so, anyway.",
    "Yes. Sony Pictures released a first-look at Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 at Brazil Comic-Con (CCXP Worlds) on Saturday, December 4. You can watch the video above.",
    "As you\u2019d expect, the teaser doesn\u2019t give too much away about the film\u2019s plot (more on this later). But we do see Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy reunite in his universe, Miles travelling to some new dimensions, and his first encounter with Spider-Man 2099. There\u2019s plenty of humor and action to be had within the trailer, too, which shows that Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 will retain a lot of elements that made the first movie a success.",
    "Right now, there are five confirmed cast members, but you can expect this list to grow a lot as more announcements are made:",
    "Moore, Steinfeld and Johnson will all reprise their roles from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Isaac, meanwhile, has been bumped up the roster after he made a cameo appearance in the first movie\u2019s post-credits scene.",
    "The only current new cast member is Issa Rae (Insecure), who will portray Jessica Drew, aka Spider-Woman. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Rae had been added to the film\u2019s cast in June 2021, even though Sony is yet to officially confirm this.",
    "Other Spider-Men and Spider-People are also expected to make an appearance in the sequel, however. John Mulaney\u2019s Spider-Ham, Kimiko Glenn\u2019s Peni Parker and Nicholas Cage\u2019s Spider-Man Noir may all return, while Across the Spider-Verse\u2019s first trailer teased the potential arrival of Spider-Man India.",
    "Japanese Spider-Man\u2019s appearance has also been hinted at by the film\u2019s co-screenwriter and executive producer Phil Lord (via ScreenRant). But it\u2019s unclear if this particular iteration of the character will feature just yet.",
    "Official plot details are thin on the ground right now, but we do know some elements about its story.",
    "First, the movie\u2019s official synopsis (via Collider) reads as follows: \u201cMiles Morales returns for the next chapter of the Oscar-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn\u2019s full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.\u201d",
    "Speaking exclusively to Entertainment Weekly after the first trailer\u2019s reveal, Lord and long time writing partner Chris Miller explained why they made the decision to split the next chapter in Miles\u2019 story into Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 and Part 2.",
    "\"Miles' story is an epic,\" Miller and Lord said. \"We wrote what we thought the story needed to be, and to our surprise we realized it was two movies instead of one. We're working on them both as we speak.\u201d",
    "Lord and Miller also cryptically hinted at the numerous universes that Miles and company will travel to, saying: \"Every dimension looks and feels radically different from all the others. They all look like they were drawn by a different artist.\"",
    "And what of the potential for characters to return from the first movie? As you\u2019ve probably guessed, the duo simply teased: \"Miles will reunite with some old friends and meet... a lot of new ones.\"",
    "With those official comments out of the way, what can we determine from what we\u2019ve seen of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1, and where its predecessor left off?",
    "For starters, it seems that Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 takes place sometime after Into the Spider-Verse. Miles and Gwen look older than they did in the first film, so we\u2019re guessing that it\u2019s been one year or two years since they said their goodbyes in Into the Spider-Verse.",
    "Next, we know that Miles and company will be jumping between dimensions in Across the Spider-Verse, which reverses the events of the first film where multiple Spider-People crossed over into Miles\u2019 reality. We\u2019ve already seen a pencil-sketched world, as well as being transported to Earth-928 (Spider-Man 2099\u2019s universe), in the first trailer. So we know we\u2019ll be seeing two new realities, at the very least, in Across the Spider-Verse Part 1.",
    "As for who the mysterious villain is, it\u2019s highly unlikely to be Spider-Man 2099. Yes, he\u2019s seen grappling with Miles in the movie\u2019s first teaser, but we\u2019re confident that he\u2019s simply trying to recruit Miles in order to stop the film\u2019s supervillain from presumably wreaking havoc across the multiverse. We\u2019ve taken a look at the most likely candidate for the villain in our Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 Easter eggs article, so check that out to get our thoughts on who it may be.",
    "Finally, it sounds like Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 and Part 2 will be full of emotional story beats, much like Into the Spider-Verse. Lord and Miller revealed that there\u2019s one particular scene concerning Spider-Gwen that will really tug at our heartstrings. Based on another of their answers in a tweet above, too, we\u2019ll see Miles grappling with what it truly means to be a Spider-Man in this film.",
    "There\u2019s no official release date for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 1\u2019s follow-up yet. But, in their chat with Entertainment Weekly, Lord and Miller revealed that Part 2 should be released in 2023, but neither was forthcoming with an exact launch date.",
    "Again, the ongoing pandemic may affect when it\u2019s released. Nobody knows what the situation will look like in 2023, so it\u2019s likely Sony and Marvel are keeping their options open. We imagine they all have some idea of when Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 2 will arrive, but that may change if the pandemic hasn\u2019t subsided by then.",
    "If we had to guess, we\u2019d say that Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Part 2 will launch in theaters in late 2023. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse arrived in December 2018, while Across the Spider-Verse Part 1 comes out in October 2022. If Sony and Marvel stick to a similar release schedule for Part 2, it\u2019ll likely be released between October and December 2023."
