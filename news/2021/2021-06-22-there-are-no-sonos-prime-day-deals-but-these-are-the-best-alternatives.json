    "If you're after the best Sonos Prime Day deals, well, we don't know what to tell you. The quality audio brand hasn't been part of Amazon's Prime Day festivities, though that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of other great audio hardware options for improving your home cinema setup.",
    "Anyone after a Prime Day deal on something similar to a Sonos speaker has a good few options. Those shopping in the US could opt for some Klipsch bookshelf speakers at half price, or a center-channel speaker with almost $300 cut from its price tag.",
    "Those in the UK, meanwhile, can save a neat \u00a3100 on a plug-in Samsung soundbar, or get \u00a3100 off a more premium Denon model. There are some wireless speakers in the mix if you're after a Sonos Move alternative too.",
    "Getting some quality speakers is a key part of any real home cinema setup, amplifying the scale, volume and detail of the audio that's possible when watching a TV show or film. While some TVs come with decent built-in speakers, they're also often an afterthought for manufacturers, capping out at 10W with a tinny output that's less cinema and more smartphone ringtone.",
    "It's worth checking what audio formats are supported by your television, though. Dolby Atmos or DTS:X are great additions, but you'll need every connected piece of hardware to support it, from your TV to your sound system \u2013 and even the source device if you're using a streaming stick or 4K Blu-ray player."
