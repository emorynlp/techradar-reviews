  "summary": "Is there a new Apple HomePod on the horizon?",
  "article": [
    "The original Apple HomePod was among the best wireless speakers on the market, before it was unceremoniously discontinued in March 2021 and the company elected to focus on the smaller and cheaper Apple HomePod mini.",
    "While the Apple HomePod mini is a fantastic speaker in its own right, its small stature and low price makes us doubt that Apple wouldn\u2019t release a follow-up to its original flagship smart speaker, in a bid to compete with more powerful models like the Amazon Echo Studio and the Sonos One.",
    "Since Apple discontinued the HomePod, we\u2019ve seen a number of patents that could suggest that the company is looking to create a new HomePod model \u2013 the so-called Apple HomePod 2 \u2013 and it may even come with a display, if rumors are to be believed.",
    "So far, Apple hasn\u2019t confirmed whether the HomePod 2 really exists, which means that we can\u2019t say for sure whether it will materialize any time soon \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t stopped us from dreaming about all the features we\u2019d like to see from the tech giant\u2019s next smart speaker.",
    "[Update: The iPhone 13 launch event came and went without any mention of a new HomePod, but we did get out first glimpse of the Apple Watch 7, new iPad, new iPad mini, and iPadOS 15.]",
    "There\u2019s no word yet on when the Apple HomePod 2 will be released \u2013 or indeed if it really exists \u2013 and there was no mention of the smart speaker at Apple's first event of 2021.",
    "Indeed, we could be waiting a while to see the HomePod 2. In a Bloomberg report by Mark Gurman on the recently discovered temperature sensors inside the Apple HomePod mini, Gurman says that, \"before the discontinuation of the larger HomePod, the company had been working on an updated version for release in 2022. It has also been developing new speakers with screens and cameras, but such a launch isn\u2019t imminent\".",
    "Again, there\u2019s no word on a potential price for the Apple HomePod 2, but if it\u2019s another full-sized HomePod as opposed to the HomePod mini, we\u2019d expect it to cost about the same as the original smart speaker.",
    "When it launched in 2018, the Apple HomePod cost $349 / \u00a3319 / AU$499, making it one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market \u2013 and certainly the most expensive mainstream option.",
    "That\u2019s why we were surprised when the Apple HomePod mini was released in 2020 for just $99 / \u00a399 / AU$149. We\u2019re hoping that, even if the next HomePod is full-size, Apple will find a happy medium between the two price points.",
    "So far we\u2019ve heard a few Apple HomePod 2 rumors that might tell us what the next smart speaker will be like.",
    "HomePod with a screen?",
    "One of the most interesting rumors is that the HomePod 2 could come with a screen, like the Amazon Echo Show 10 and the Google Nest Hub 2. The news that Apple is potentially working on a HomePod smart display, could be a good indication that the company is renewing its focus on smart home compatibility.",
    "Plus, as MacRumors' Steve Moser discovered in the tvOS 14.5 beta code, Apple has added FaceTime and iMessage frameworks, as well as a new AVFCapture framework related to capturing images.",
    "Apple uses tvOS as the basis for the software that runs on the HomePod, rather than iOS \u2013 and that means messaging and video calls could come to a future HomePod smart display, too.",
    "Smarter than your average smart speaker",
    "Whether the next HomePod is a smart display or a regular smart speaker, it has the potential to be very clever. A newly-uncovered patent shows that Apple has ambitions for its smart speakers to work alongside its rumored Apple VR headsets.",
    "The patent describes an audio speaker system that is equipped with additional microphones and depth-sensing cameras. In tandem, they\u2019d be able to pinpoint a user\u2019s position in a room, and tailor a 3D audio experience to suit what\u2019s being seen in a virtual reality environment.",
    "From what we can gather from the patent, a user with one or more HomePods set up could enjoy adaptive and surrounding audio without the need for headphones or on-device speakers like what you see with the Oculus Quest headsets. Say there\u2019s a virtual cat in your VR experience \u2013 walking towards it could increase the volume of its meow from a HomePod Mini, for instance.",
    "This would also work in two way communication applications \u2013 a user with a similar set up elsewhere could transmit their spatial audio information to another user in VR with the same set up, and both would be able to identify sound coming from the other in 3D space.",
    "The patent also goes to describe how this could be used for commercial purposes, and lays out how a recording and transmission system could be set up at a live music event, and beamed to a VR headset with the resulting spatial audio information.",
    "As with any patented technology, there\u2019s no guarantee that these features will actually materialize \u2013 but they do give us an interesting insight into the future of Apple speakers.",
    "The Apple HomePod mini may offer a few clues as to the features we\u2019ll see from the next HomePod, too.",
    "A built-in temperature sensor?",
    "The HomePod mini contains a hidden sensor that can measure temperature and humidity \u2013 potentially unlocking new and exciting features for the device in the future.",
    "A recent report from Bloomberg highlighted the previously undiscovered feature, describing a sensor which could allow \u201cinternet-connected thermostats [to] adjust different parts of a home based on current conditions.\u201d",
    "The hardware could also let the HomePod mini automatically engage other actions depending on temperature \u2013 such as activating a fan \u2013 which suggests the device might see a host of functionality upgrades in future software updates.",
    "It\u2019s possible that these functionality upgrades could come to the HomePod 2 as well, if Apple decides to include these sensors in a future model.",
    "While information on the Apple HomePod 2 is still thin on the ground, there are a few things we\u2019d like to see from the rumored smart speaker.",
    "Bluetooth connectivity",
    "Sure, smart speakers are all about voice controls, and the fact that they\u2019re standalone devices that don\u2019t need to be hooked up to another audio source in order to play back tunes and podcasts. But, sometimes, a few added options are just convenient \u2013 especially if you\u2019re trying to play back a track that, for whatever reason, can\u2019t be found on the smart speaker\u2019s streaming service of choice.",
    "It may not be cutting edge in the smart speaker world, but there\u2019s still the odd occasion when a Bluetooth speaker would be useful, and it\u2019s a feature that was introduced with the HomePod mini.",
    "If the HomePod 2 is similarly tied to Apple Music, that\u2019d be particularly useful for anyone looking to access, say, Spotify streaming. Which brings us onto our next point\u2026",
    "Open access to other music services",
    "If you buy one of the current Apple HomePod speakers, you\u2019re essentially locking yourself into Apple\u2019s audio ecosystem. So, iTunes purchases aside, that\u2019s $9.99 / \u00a39.99 / AU$11.99 a month for a single Apple Music streaming account, or $14.99 / \u00a314.99 / AU$17.99 for a family account.",
    "That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re an iPhone-owning Cupertino disciple, and Apple Music is a fine service definitely worth investing in. But, if you\u2019ve already committed to Spotify or Google Play Music or any of the other myriad smaller streaming options, that could be a frustrating restriction.",
    "By knocking a few bricks out of its walled garden and letting other services have a look in could give a new Apple HomePod a user base boost \u2013 and it could be paired with incentives to jump to Apple Music, if Apple played a savvy long-game.",
    "Better Siri performance",
    "Apple\u2019s HomePod does well on sound but when it comes to smarts it\u2019s somewhat lacking. Compared to Google Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Siri is rather limited in what it can do for you as a smart home hub. This isn\u2019t great considering it\u2019s one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market, and Siri is your main means of controlling it.",
    "With that in mind, we\u2019d love to see better Siri performance in a new HomePod iteration when it comes to performing commands quickly and accurately."
