    "The Pok\u00e9mon Company isn\u2019t ready to reveal more about Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus right now but it will be \u201csoon\u201d.",
    "Speaking in an interview with GamesBeat (via GamesRadar) JC Smith, the senior director of consumer marketing at The Pok\u00e9mon Company, said that when it comes to Arceus, the company has \u201ca robust rollout\" planned, adding that there's \"not a lot that I can share at this time. But the team has a lot of great things to share, and you\u2019ll be hearing from us soon.\u201d",
    "Unfortunately, Smith wasn\u2019t able to give any indication on how soon \u201csoon\u201d is. Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus was first revealed to the world back in February of this year in a Nintendo Direct celebrating Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s 25th anniversary. Since then, the biggest news has been a confirmation of its 2022 release date and box art reveal via Twitter.",
    "Nintendo didn\u2019t offer any more information in its E3 2021 presentation and doesn\u2019t appear to have any plans for Gamescom 2021 as it\u2019s not listed as a partner, so it\u2019s hard to predict when exactly we might learn more.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is a Nintendo Switch exclusive and it currently has a release date of January 28 2022, which actually isn\u2019t all that long away. That said, it\u2019s not the only upcoming Pok\u00e9mon game, with Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Shining Pearl (remakes of the beloved Nintendo DS titles) set to release first, in November of this year.",
    "We know: why \u201csoon\u201d? If there are lots of great things to share why not right now, this minute, this second? Well, actually, it\u2019s maybe kind of understandable that The Pok\u00e9mon Company is reticent about Pokemon: Arceus at the moment.",
    "For one thing, the Pok\u00e9mon calendar is actually pretty busy. Pok\u00e9mon Unite, the strategic team battle game, has only just launched on Nintendo Switch and is likely the company\u2019s most immediate focus. Then, before we get to Pok\u00e9mon: Arceus\u2019 January 2022 launch date, there\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Shining Pearl in November. There's probably still more we have to learn about these remakes, so it's easy to see that being The Pok\u00e9mon Company\u2019s next hurdle.",
    "Arceus\u2019 2022 release date, early in the year though it is, likely means it\u2019s not at the top of the priority list at the moment as far as revealing details is concerned.",
    "Plus, given Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus looks set to change things quite a bit, with official website saying it \u201chonours past Pok\u00e9mon games\u2019 core gameplay while infusing new action and RPG elements\u201c, it's possible The Pok\u00e9mon Company will want take its time over laying out exactly what that means.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon: Arceus is a prequel of sorts, taking players into a historical Sinnoh region. The scope of the open world appears to be larger than previous entries in the series (think Sword and Shield\u2019s Wild Areas but more) and notions of what it means to be a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer or even what a Pok\u00e9mon League is are totally different.",
    "Arceus certainly gives the impression it'll be an entry that experiments with some of the Pok\u00e9mon formula but, for a series that\u2019s so long-running and beloved, announcements regarding changes can\u2019t just be flung out into the world\u2014it\u2019s likely The Pok\u00e9mon Company will want to lay out a cohesive picture of what players can expect and why they should look forward to it, rather than tidbits here and there.",
    "Still, this doesn\u2019t get us any closer to answering when exactly we might learn more. Nintendo still has a good amount of time left in the year for announcements and, given the strength of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, big events like Gamescom or E3 aren\u2019t strictly necessary to prop up a dedicated Arceus Nintendo Direct. With that in mind, we could learn more at any time over the next few months so keep your eyes and ears open."
