  "article": [
    "The Cyber Monday Garmin sales are here, and many are the same as the Black Friday deals which launched a few days ago. They're still find all the top deals below, which are still in stock.",
    "We're seeing big savings on the Garmin Fenix 6 range in particular, but there are discounts across a wide variety of Garmin wearables, with more possibly still to come.",
    "That said, some years we don't see much in the way of new offers on Cyber Monday itself, with retailers instead continuing their Black Friday deals, so if you see something tempting you might as well buy it now, as the deals likely won't get any better.",
    "Below we've highlighted all the best deals so far, and we'll be updating this article if and when new deals arrive, so keep it bookmarked if you don't spot anything you want yet.",
    "Based on what we saw last year we can take a good guess at some of the Garmin deals that we might see on Cyber Monday 2021. They include the following:",
    "Garmin makes a wide range of wearables at different prices and for different types of users, so it can be tricky finding the right one.",
    "It can also be tricky finding the best deals, even on sales days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but we've got some tips to help.",
    "1. Check out our best Garmin guide",
    "It's worth working out what you want to buy before you even head into the sales, and your first stop for that should be our best Garmin watch guide, where we've highlighted all the top options.",
    "Don't just go for our number one pick though, as something else might suit you better - some Garmin wearables are aimed at serious athletes, while others are more for those just dipping their toes in, and some focus on specific sports too. So it's worth taking a look at all the best options.",
    "2. Keep an eye out for dodgy deals",
    "Not every deal is a good deal, even if it looks good. A discount of 50% off RRP for example might look great, until you realize that nowhere is selling the device at full price.",
    "So it's worth checking the prices elsewhere before pressing the buy button, or even using a tool like The Camelizer to see price history for the site you're on. Or just stick with TechRadar, as we'll only be highlighting genuine deals here.",
    "3. Watch for big deals on older models",
    "The latest Garmin watches may well get discounted on Cyber Monday, but older models are far more likely to - and are likely to get biggest discounts.",
    "Retailers will be looking to clear their stock to make way for the shiny new hardware, so big savings can often be had. And just because a model is older, it doesn't mean it's not still great.",
    "The Garmin Fenix 6 is for our money the best Garmin watch. It's not cheap, but it could become a lot more palatable on Cyber Monday, with prices likely to plummet for the sale.",
    "Really it's the whole Fenix 6 range that we rate at the top - they're all unsurpassed multi-sport smartwatches with comprehensive activity tracking, great battery life and strong performance.",
    "Even with a Cyber Monday discount this might not be for you if you're not a serious athlete or outdoorsperson, but if you want a watch that won't let you down whether you're running a marathon or hiking a trail, this is the one for you.",
    "The Garmin Venu 2 is a mid-range wearable that does a great job of functioning both as a conventional smartwatch and as a sports watch.",
    "Unlike many Garmin devices this has a fairly stylish, sleek design, yet it still has all the features you need when training outdoors or in, including GPS, heart rate monitoring, cadence tracking and a whole lot more.",
    "The Venu 2 only launched in 2021 so we don't have any Cyber Monday history for it, but the original Garmin Venu did get a solid $100 discount last year, and Garmin wearables in general tend to get reduced, so we wouldn't be surprised if there are some decent deals on this too.",
    "If you're after a budget Garmin watch then the Garmin Forerunner 55 is a top choice, especially if you're a runner.",
    "There's no touchscreen, but the five hardware buttons that you get instead are arguably easier to use mid-run, and with suggested workouts and post-training advice this wearable goes beyond just tracking - it also gives you the insights you need to train better.",
    "We found that it had extremely accurate GPS too, and it's a bit of a bargain even when it's not discounted, so this could be a low-end star of Cyber Monday if there are any decent deals on it.",
    "While we wait for Cyber Monday 2021, it's worth taking a look at some of the best Garmin deals we saw on Cyber Monday 2020. You can see these below, and while they're all expired, they provide an indication of the sorts of discounts you might see this year."
