    "Mini LED is a TV term that describes the screen tech you\u2019ll find inside many of the best TVs of 2021. Interestingly, it\u2019s cropping up in other devices now, too, like Apple\u2019s new MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021). But what is Mini LED? And is it something you need to make sure you have next time you buy a TV or a new laptop?",
    "Mini LED is mostly found in TV displays. Nowadays most of the major TV makers, like Philips, TCL, LG and Samsung, all have Mini LED TVs available to buy or they\u2019re building new ones with Mini LED\u2019s backlight tech inside them.",
    "Some brands are even combining Mini LED with other kinds of new tech. For example, LG's Mini LED TV range of 'QNED' screens are now available worldwide. These TVs have both LG\u2019s NanoCell LCD and Mini LED backlighting for the first time.",
    "But although you\u2019ll find Mini LED in many of today\u2019s newest TVs, you'll find it in other devices with a screen as well. For example, rumors suggest it might also be used in the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2. Apple also uses Mini LED tech in its all-new MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) and its new iPad Pro with reports suggesting it could be added to Apple's MacBook Air 2022 and new MacBook Pros as well.",
    "Now Apple is actively adding Mini LED to its latest products, we can expect to see it in even more devices beyond TVs from other brands in the future. What we\u2019re saying is, it\u2019s a very exciting time for Mini LED tech and if you\u2019re buying a new TV, you need to scrub up on your knowledge.",
    "That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find Mini LED. But how does it work and how does it impact your viewing experience? In the guide below, we\u2019ll cover the technical details of Mini LED, as well as the big question: do you really need a Mini LED TV? Read on to find out whether this new TV tech is right for you and whether you should keep an eye out for it in your next laptop purchase, too.",
    "Now onto what the tech does. As you might guess from the name, Mini LED shrinks the LED modules that provide backlighting to LCD screens.",
    "LCD pixels can\u2019t illuminate themselves \u2013 although OLED can \u2013 so they need a light source behind them that can shine light through. This is what creates the necessary brightness and color. Because of this extra layer of backlighting, the pixels in an LCD display can never be turned completely off.",
    "How does this impact your viewing experience? It\u2019s best to compare it to an LCD screen. Blacks on an LCD screen don\u2019t just lack the inky quality of their OLED equivalents, but if an LCD TV\u2019s backlight is poorly implemented and controlled, there can be noticeable unevenness to the way the screen describes what should be uniform areas of black.",
    "A good example is if you imagine the end credits of most movies. There\u2019s a black screen with white text scrolling up it. When you\u2019re watching on an LCD TV, it\u2019s normal to see a halo of light around the words, or to let its backlight show \u2018bleed\u2019 from the corners of the screen. The result is whatever should be black is now more of a cloudy grey.",
    "We know that no one ever bought a TV solely for how it handles the end credits of a film. But this kind of messy picture quality is what has increasingly made LCD technology look second class compared to its shiny OLED competitor.",
    "However, there might still be a way for LCD technology to reassert itself among the best TVs \u2013 and that\u2019s through Mini LED.",
    "LG\u2019s Mini LED range \u2013 called \u2018QNED\u2019 \u2013 has immediately become its premium LCD offering, combining Mini LED with quantum dot technology. It\u2019s positioned above the NanoCell LCDs that were previously the company\u2019s most aspirational LCD TVs.",
    "The QNED99 is the hero of the range. It\u2019s an 8K, 120Hz television with full array local dimming (all the better to show off exactly what Mini LED is capable of). It\u2019s available in 65-inch, 75-inch and 86-inch variants. The QNED95 swaps the 120Hz panel of the QNED99 for just 60Hz, but retains the 8K resolution and all the other technological highlights \u2013 the 86-inch size aside.",
    "There are a couple of 4K QNED ranges that are similarly arranged. The QNED90 has a 120Hz panel in front of its Mini LED Full Array Local Dimming arrangement, while the QNED85 makes do with a 60Hz panel instead.",
    "Over at Samsung, \u2018Neo QLED\u2019 is the way the company is describing its Mini LED televisions for this year. Along with a \u2018micro layer\u2019 to guide the light of the Mini LEDs (perhaps as many as 5,000 individual diodes for a single screen) through the quantum dots, Samsung has developed its most precise dimming and power distribution algorithms to date.",
    "All of which bodes well for the chances of the range-topping QN900A. This is an 8K 120Hz screen, available in 65-inch, 75-inch or 85-inch sizes. The QN800A retains the 8K resolution and the selection screen size options \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t have quite the whistles-and-bells audio system of the QN900A.",
    "The 4K flag for Samsung is flown by the QN95A and QN90A: these are both 120Hz panels, and both available in 50 in-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch, 75-inch and 85-inch screen sizes. The QN95A also features Samsung\u2019s One Connect box, which takes all connectivity requirements away from the screen itself. There\u2019s also the QN85A, which retains the 120Hz panel of its siblings but doesn\u2019t have quite as many dimming zones or speaker drivers.",
    "Philips, of course, has its unique selling point to bring to the Mini LED party: Ambilight. Both the 9639 and 9506 are available in 65-inch or 75-inch sizes, and both have four-sided Ambilight as well as Mini LED backlights. As with LG, Philips\u2019 Mini LED TVs slot into the television series just below the pricier OLED ranges."
