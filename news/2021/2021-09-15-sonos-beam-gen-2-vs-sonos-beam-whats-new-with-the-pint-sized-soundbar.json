  "article": [
    "We\u2019ve been recommending the Sonos Beam to anyone on the market for a compact soundbar offering excellent connectivity for some time \u2013 but now that the audio company has announced the Sonos Beam (Gen 2), you may be wondering which soundbar is best for you.",
    "From the outside, the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) looks similar to its predecessor, which makes it difficult to determine exactly what\u2019s changed. In fact, the acoustic architecture of both soundbars is exactly the same.",
    "However, there\u2019s one big difference between the two generations of Beam. The Sonos Beam (Gen 2) brings Dolby Atmos immersive audio to the mini soundbar for the first time, and that could be a game-changer if you want to recreate the feel of a cinema at home.",
    "Not surprisingly, the second-gen Sonos Beam has also seen a small price hike \u2013 and now that the original Beam has been usurped, we\u2019re starting to see that model discounted. The level of discount is only likely to increase as we get closer to Black Friday 2021.",
    "So, should you save some money and opt for the original model of Beam, or choose the Dolby Atmos-touting second-generation of Sonos\u2019 smallest soundbar? We haven\u2019t had the opportunity to test the Beam (Gen 2) just yet, but we\u2019ve taken an in-depth look at all the new specs and features to help you make the right decision.",
    "The new Sonos Beam (Gen 2) will be available to buy from October 5 for $449 / \u00a3449 / $699 (although it is available to preorder now). This makes it more expensive than the original at launch, which cost $399 / \u00a3339 / AU$599.",
    "We\u2019ve already started to see prices for the original Sonos Beam come down, and you can almost guarantee that it will be discounted heavily over Black Friday 2021 \u2013 if stocks last, that is. The first-gen Beam has been officially discontinued, so you should act fast if you have your heart set on it.",
    "Weirdly, we\u2019re not confident that the price of the second-gen Sonos Beam won\u2019t change in the future. Sonos recently announced a price hike for a number of its products, stating that it evaluates pricing on a \"market-by-market\" basis. One of the biggest price increases was to the company\u2019s other soundbar, the Sonos Arc, which is now $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$100 more expensive than before. That doesn\u2019t exactly bode well for the new Beam.",
    "Saying that, Sonos hasn\u2019t made any suggestion that the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) will see a price increase any time soon \u2013 just be aware that the company\u2019s prices aren\u2019t set in stone.",
    "The design of the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) and its predecessor is largely the same, although the company has made a couple of subtle tweaks.",
    "Both soundbars are designed for smaller spaces, and at 2.72 x 25.63 x 3.94 inches (H x W x D), they should fit comfortably under most TVs. Both devices are also available in black and white color options, they can be wall-mounted, and are controllable via a touch-sensitive panel found along the top of the unit. You also have the option of the Sonos S2 app, your TV remote, AirPlay 2, or using the built-in Google Assistant and Alexa voice assistants to control your music playback and other settings.",
    "The only immediately discernible difference between the two is that Sonos has done away with the fabric grille on the original Beam, swapping it for a polycarbonate (or plastic, if you prefer) front.",
    "The plastic grille matches that of the Sonos Arc \u2013 and, as the company points out, it\u2019s far easier to clean than dust-attracting fabric. We asked Sonos whether the new grille brings any acoustic benefits, but the company told us it\u2019s purely an aesthetic choice.",
    "It certainly brings the soundbar into line with the rest of the Sonos ecosystem, since none of the other current-gen Sonos speakers feature fabric grilles.",
    "Around the back of the soundbar you\u2019ll now find an HDMI eARC port, rather than the HDMI ARC on the original Beam (more on that later).",
    "The biggest difference between the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) and the original on the audio front is that the new soundbar supports Dolby Atmos.",
    "This cinematic sound technology arranges elements of a film soundtrack (or compatible music files) in a 3D sphere, which makes it feel as though the sound is coming at you from every angle.",
    "\u2018True\u2019 Dolby Atmos speakers and soundbars \u2013 such as the Sonos Arc \u2013 use upfiring tweeters to bounce sound off the ceiling and back down to your ears to give soundtracks a sense of height, but the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) does this virtually.",
    "According to Sonos, the sense that the sound is surrounding you from every angle is achieved using \u201cpsychoacoustic techniques\u201d, made possible by the new and improved speaker arrays. The second-gen Beam contains five arrays as opposed to the three found in the original Beam.",
    "While we\u2019re yet to test this for ourselves, virtual Atmos can be quite convincing \u2013 although you\u2019ll probably get a better sense of height from the pricier and larger Sonos Arc.",
    "Otherwise, the rest of the audio tech inside the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) is the same as before. You have five class-D amplifiers, one center tweeter, four elliptical midwoofers, and three passive radiators working together to deliver a powerful and balanced sound.",
    "And that\u2019s no bad thing. In our review of the original Sonos Beam, we were blown away by the richness and depth of the audio, despite the unit\u2019s small size. With this in mind, you can certainly expect a clear and impactful sound from the new Beam, especially if you pair it with some Sonos One SL rear speakers and the Sonos Sub for a more complete home cinema setup.",
    "Like all Sonos speakers, the new Beam uses Trueplay, a feature that calibrates the soundbar to your room\u2019s dimensions. The Beam (Gen 2) also still comes with sound modes such as Speech Enhancement for clear dialogue and Night mode for when you don\u2019t want to disturb your neighbors \u2013 and, you can tweak the EQ settings via the S2 app.",
    "Like the original Sonos Beam, the Beam (Gen 2) comes with support for Alexa and Google Assistant, AirPlay 2, and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as an Ethernet port for hardwiring the soundbar to your router.",
    "As mentioned, you can hook both soundbars up to your existing Sonos system for a richer home theater setup, or for multi-room audio to fill your entire space with sound.",
    "One new connectivity feature included with the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) is HDMI eARC compatibility, which the company says will bring a \u201cricher, more immersive, and higher definition sound experience\u201d. Compared to the HDMI ARC connectivity found on the original Beam, eARC can handle more advanced audio formats and deliver superior audio quality.",
    "It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no HDMI passthrough support, which would allow for 4K at 120Hz and even 8K at 60Hz passthrough \u2013 which in turn, would make the Beam ideal for 8K-supporting consoles such as the PS5 and the Xbox Series X.",
    "Still, the new Beam will be able to cope with 32 channels of audio, and even eight-channel 24-bit/192kHz uncompressed 38Mbps data streams. In other words, as well as supporting Atmos, it can play hi-res audio files of your favorite songs.",
    "While we can\u2019t say for certain whether you should buy the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) before we\u2019re able to test it for ourselves, if you want Dolby Atmos without paying for the Sonos Arc, the newer soundbar is your best bet.",
    "You should also opt for the newer Beam if you want to play hi-res audio files through your soundbar.",
    "However, if you\u2019re on a budget and Atmos or hi-res music isn\u2019t on your radar, the original Sonos Beam is still a fantastic choice \u2013 and Sonos tells us that it will continue to be supported by updates and bug fixes in the future.",
    "You\u2019ll need to act fast if you do want to buy the original Beam, though. There\u2019s no telling when stock will run out, and it will probably be quite popular over Black Friday in November.",
    "Not sold on Sonos? There are plenty of other brilliant soundbars out there. If you want Dolby Atmos compatibility, check out models such as the Samsung HW-Q950A and the Sony HT-X8500. On a strict budget? The Vizio SB362An-F6 is well worth a look, as is the Sony HT-MT300."
