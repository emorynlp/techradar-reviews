    "On the hunt for a new projector this Black Friday? You're in luck, there are several fantastic deals in both the US and the UK available right now for one of the best 4K projectors in 2021.",
    "That's the Samsung Premiere, which launched late last year and scooped up a number of awards \u2013 including TechRadar\u2019s best projector of the year.",
    "In the US, you can buy the Premiere LSP9T from Best Buy and save $1,500 \u2013 while UK shoppers can head directly to Samsung and save a huge \u00a32000.",
    "Of course, the Premiere is still a bit pricey at $4999 / \u00a34999, but with a max screen size of 130 inches and support for HDR10+ and Samsung\u2019s Tizen smart platform, you\u2019re definitely getting your money\u2019s worth.",
    "If that's still too much, choose the Premiere LSP7T instead. This model is the same projector but cheaper because it projects to a max 120-inch screen size rather than a 130-inch screen size. Check out the latest deals on the Samsung Premiere LSP7T below.",
    "Don't forget to check out all of the top Black Friday deals for more great savings.",
    "In our review for this projector, we called The Premiere \"the most comprehensive and all-round successful living room-friendly projector solution we\u2019ve seen to date\".",
    "We thought the picture quality was excellent and, for its size, produced great sound. You might still want to hook it up to a Dolby Atmos soundbar for that full-scale immersion, but even right out of the box you'll get decent sound.",
    "Just want a large-screen TV at a discount instead? Here are a selection of televisions at very tempting prices \u2013 though you should head to our full Black Friday TV deals guide for the full suite of offers currently available.",
    "You can see more TV deals with our Best Buy Black Friday deals guide. You can also shop more bargains with our roundup of the best Walmart Black Friday deals and the best Amazon Black Friday deals."
