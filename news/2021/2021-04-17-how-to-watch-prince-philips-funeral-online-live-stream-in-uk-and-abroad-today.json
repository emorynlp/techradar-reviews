    "With reverential silences being observed and black arm bands being donned across the country and the globe since Prince Philip's death a week ago, Saturday gives the world the opportunity to pay its final respects to the Queen's husband over over 70 years. It's possible to watch watch Prince Philip's funeral online and on TV today, and we explain how below.",
    "After passing away at the age of 99 last Friday, the UK has been in an official period of national mourning. His 73-year marriage to HRH Queen Elizabeth II was the longest of any British monarch of history, during which time they had four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.",
    "Unlike most other royal events of mourning, it will be a relatively small and intimate ceremony with crowd numbers reduced due to coronavirus restrictions",
    "So instead of a huge state funeral as is usually befitting of such an event, a smaller ceremonial funeral will take place at St George's Chapel in Windsor - around 20 miles west of London. Attendees are limited to just 30 - as per the current national rules in place for the pandemic - and will mostly comprise family members, including Prince Harry who has flown back to the UK specially for the event.",
    "It is intended for the ceremony and lead-up to be shown in full on Saturday, so all of the well wishers who had hoped to line the streets in person will still be able to watch from the comfort of their own TVs and mobiles. Keep reading to learn how to watch Prince Philip's funeral today.",
    "Most major royal events do tend to get shown on YouTube around the world, and we'd be suprised if this one wasn't, too. We don't have confirmation, but it will be worth checking out the The Royal Family Channel on the day to see.",
    "For such a major event, we'd fully expect that localized coverage will be available in most countries, especially those in the Commonwealth. So do check your local listings in the first instance.",
    "Unfortunately, if you try to watch the funeral on any of the free UK services listed above when overseas, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcasters prevent you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for streamers all over the world, but there's an easy solution.",
    "You can use a piece of software called a VPN, which makes your computer or streaming device think it's somewhere else in the world entirely - in this case, the UK. From that point, you can go ahead and watch UK television coverage as though you were physically there."
