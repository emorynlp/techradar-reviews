    "Doctor Who is back on our screens to bring in the New Year, and returning with it are some familiar faces and, erm, chassis. With the Time Lord imprisoned halfway across the universe, now would be about as terrible moment as any for our dear leaders to decide to deploy Daleks on the streets, but then again that level of wisdom is about par for the course for the current inhabitants of 10 Downing Street. We\u2019ll explain here how to watch Revolution of the Daleks, the Doctor Who New Year Special online from anywhere in the world - including for FREE in the UK and the US!",
    "That places responsibility for the survival of the human race firmly in the hands of Yaz, Ryan and Graham, who really don't stand a chance without the Doctor. How much can three normal people really do when phrases like \"Prepare for maximum extermination\" are being screeched out by floating, laser-fitted malevolent trash cans?",
    "Fortunately, while the Doctor's away, her companions can rely on some much-needed help from none other than Captain Jack Harkness, who intersperses his usual blend of light comedy and nostalgia with one or two stark warnings for his new companions.",
    "Chris Noth also reprises his role as the eminently hateable Jack Robertson, the only guy who could make you question how bad those pesky Daleks really are. Ready for a fresh helping of cheese and sci-fi horseplay? Read on as we explain how to watch the Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 online, and stream this beloved BBC show for FREE in the UK, US, and also from anywhere.",
    "If you're outside of your country of residence over the holidays, then geo-blocking restrictions will prevent you from streaming the Doctor Who special online today.",
    "Fortunately, there\u2019s a simple solution. By downloading a VPN \u2013 short for Virtual Private Network \u2013 you can alter your IP address to that of your country back home, and so stream TV content that would otherwise be inaccessible."
