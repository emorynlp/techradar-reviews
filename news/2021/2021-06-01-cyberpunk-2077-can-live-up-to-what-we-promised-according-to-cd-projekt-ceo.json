    "The president of CD Projekt, Adam Kicinski, recently made comments to reaffirm his commitment to delivering a finished version of Cyberpunk 2077. As part of the company\u2019s first-quarter financial reports (per PC Gamer), Kicinski said that \u201cnearly half\u201d of the Cyberpunk development team are still dedicated to fixing and updating the game that will eventually \u201clive up to what we promised\u201d.",
    "The other half of the team has been spun off into other projects, though we aren\u2019t likely to learn what those are exactly for some time. Kicinski said as much, in line with the company\u2019s new stance to not announce a game until it's closer to launch.",
    "CD Projekt will likely be hoping that its ongoing efforts will win back fans who\u2019ve been left with a sour taste in their mouths after Cyberpunk 2077's initial buggy release. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how it fairs on that front, though games like No Man\u2019s Sky have shown that developers can turn perception around eventually.",
    "Another reason for CD Projekt\u2019s efforts will likely be from wanting to get Cyberpunk 2077 back on PlayStation digital stores. Back in December 2020, we reported that Sony decided to pull the game from its virtual shelves. Nearly six months on, there\u2019s no clear sign for when the decision will be reversed. CD Projekt staff have explained in a previous investor call that \u201cthe final decision, you have to understand, belongs to Sony.\u201d",
    "Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be near the top of the team\u2019s priority list for now, but with teams already splitting off into new projects, we can\u2019t help but speculate what we might see next.",
    "One game we\u2019re fairly confident about is The Witcher 4, given that CD Projekt have previously confirmed that it's not done with the series yet. We don\u2019t know much about the game right now, though, beyond that Geralt likely won\u2019t be the lead. At this point, there\u2019s no telling if it would even be a sequel or a prequel to the game series so far, and it might not even be called The Witcher 4.",
    "For those hoping for more Cyberpunk 2077 content, you might be out of luck. The developer\u2019s DLC plans have been quietly pushed to one side and we\u2019re now unlikely to see the promised standalone Cyberpunk multiplayer game. We aren\u2019t 100% sure if all of the plans have been scrapped, but when it\u2019s finally done fixing the game CD Projekt Red may be keen to put the Cyberpunk world far behind it."
