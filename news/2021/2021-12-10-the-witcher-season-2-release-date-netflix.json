  "summary": "The Witcher season 2 arrives on Netflix next week",
  "article": [
    "The Witcher season 2 is almost here. That's right, the next instalment in Netflix's live-action adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski\u2019s bestselling novels will be with us shortly. And, honestly, we can't wait for it to officially launch on the streaming giant.",
    "We've already seen the first six episodes, so check out our Witcher season 2 spoiler-free review to learn more about what its plot entails, potential surprises in store and more.",
    "It's almost two years to the day since our last trip to the Continent, so we imagine that you're eager to return to it and catch up with Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer and company. Given that The Witcher season 2 is one of the most anticipated TV shows of 2021, too, we wouldn't be surprised if you are.",
    "Ahead of Netflix's big-budget fantasy show returning to our screens, then, you'll want to know everything about The Witcher season 2 before its return. Below, we've compiled every piece of information that you should read ahead of its release, including its launch date, cast, plot details, trailers, episode titles and more.",
    "Don't forget to toss a coin to your Witcher. Once you have, let's dive in.",
    "The Witcher season 2 will be released on December 17, 2021.",
    "For those who aren't aware, too, it'll comprise eight episodes, much like its predecessor did. If you want the lowdown on season 2's episode titles, as well as who has written and directed each entry, you can jump ahead to the relevant section below.",
    "The final trailer for The Witcher season 2 landed online in late October, and gave us an even better look at what the show's next instalment will be about.",
    "The latest trailer contains some major teases about the course of show's second year. \u201cNone of us will have any peace until there are no monsters left in the world,\u201d says Geralt, ushering in scenes of magic, violence and monsters \u2013 not to mention some epic vistas of the Continent and ominous portents about Ciri's power.",
    "You can check it out above if you haven't seen it yet, and then read on to watch the first season 2 teaser that was released on July 9 as part of the Witcher Con celebration:",
    "Seeing as much of the first season focused on Geralt's efforts to fulfil the Law of Surprise binding him to Ciri, the young, orphaned heir/Lion Cub of Cintra, it's no shock that the first season 2 trailer picks things up with them.",
    "Now that Geralt has made contact with Ciri, he takes her under his wing and leads her to Kaer Morhen \u2013 his childhood home and a safehouse for his Witcher brethen, which is run by his mentor and fellow Witcher Vesemir.",
    "There's also a brief sighting of the final member of The Witcher's central triumvirate, Yennefer of Vengerberg, in the aftermath of season 1's climactic Battle of Sodden Hill. She's been found by Fringilla, the Nilfgaardian mage who was pivotal in the downfall of Cintra, who simply tells her: \"Welcome back...\"",
    "\u201cWe're digging deeper into [Fringilla\u2019s] past and how she ended up at Nilfgaard,\u201d showrunner Lauren S Hissrich told Vulture. \u201cWho she is as a person, and how she and Yennefer ended up on such different paths.\"",
    "There are also two new first-look clips for the show, too, which focus on Geralt's relationship with new character Nivellen, and another where Geralt is warding off a new monster to protect Ciri.",
    "Seven of the eight episode titles for season 2 were revealed as part of WitcherCon. And, since then, we've received word of who has written and directed each one. Check out these new details below:",
    "The eighth and final episode's title is apparently so secret we'll have to wait to learn what it is. But the ones that have been revealed offer up a few clues about The Witcher season 2.",
    "'A Grain of Truth' takes its name from a short story in Andrzej Sapkowki\u2019s book The Last Wish, which features Nivellen, the character played by Game of Thrones\u2019 Kristofer Hivju. And 'Kaer Morhen' is the name of a fortress where Witchers are trained, which is also where Geralt grew up.",
    "Meanwhile, 'Redanian Intelligence' refers to Redania, a country on the Continent that possesses an exceptional spy network \u2013 Redanian Intelligence is also the name of a news site devoted to The Witcher. 'Dear Friend' may refer to a letter Geralt wrote to Yennefer in the Witcher books (though we're not giving anything away).",
    "And 'Voleth Meir' refers to a new character played by Ania Marson. Voleth Meir is reportedly elven for 'Deathless Mother', and it seems the character has an important role to play in Ciri's arc. Again, no spoilers here, so you'll have to watch season to find out more.",
    "Here's the full cast list, for the actors who appeared in season 1, for The Witcher season 2:",
    "The list of new characters is as follows:",
    "While Geralt was something of a lone (White) wolf in season 1, we\u2019ll be meeting a few more Witchers in season 2.",
    "We know that Kim Bodnia (Killing Eve) is playing Vesemir \u2013 who appears as the focus in animated Witcher prequel movie Nightmare of the Wolf. Paul Bullion, Yasen Atour and Basil Eidenbenz are also joining the cast as fellow Witchers Lambert, Co\u00ebn and Eskel, respectively, while Redanian Intelligence has reported that Joel Adrian will play another Witcher named Hemrik.",
    "Fans of the book games will already be familiar with Lambert and Eskel. It's interesting that the producers are seemingly throwing in extra Witchers for season 2, seeing as these monster-slaying professionals are typically considered to be a dying breed. While there are references to other Witcher schools like the Cat and Bear in the books, Geralt\u2019s faction seems to be one of the few Witcher groups actively doing anything to fight the monster threat facing the Continent.",
    "In terms of other newcomers, Kristofer Hivju will play Nivellen, a man cursed with the body of a monster. We\u2019ll see him in the first episode, aka \u2018A Grain of Truth\u2019.",
    "In March 2021, Netflix revealed seven more characters who had been added to the cast. They were Adjoa Andoh (Bridgerton) as Nenneke, a priestess of Melitele in the books; Liz Carr (Silent Witness) as Fenn; Simon Callow (Four Weddings and a Funeral) as Fenn's partner, Codringher; Graham McTavish (Outlander) as Redanian armed forces head Dijkstra; Chris Fulton (Clique) as the mage Rience; Cassie Clare (Grace) as Redanian royal advisor Philippa Eilhart; and Kevin Doyle (Downton Abbey) as Ba'Lian, a new character.",
    "Other castings include Mecia Simson (Brave New World) as Francesca, Aisha Fabienne Ross (The Danish Girl) as Lydia and Agnes Born (Just a Thought) as Vereena.",
    "At least one character from The Witcher games is destined for The Witcher season 2, too.",
    "According to Redanian Intelligence, the witty, powerful Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia, introduced in the game Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, is to be played by Rebecca Hanssen (Enola Holmes). The videogame connections are also set to continue with actor Alastair Parker, who played Cleaver in The Witcher 3 game (also via Redanian Intelligence), who\u2019ll appear in an as-yet unrevealed role.",
    "Again, we've seen the first six episodes of The Witcher season 2, so we know what happens for much of the plot. However, we won't be spoiling a thing here: everything you read below, then, is what we'd previously speculated about the show's second season. So read that instead to get a better idea of what may happen.",
    "For starters, here's Netflix's official logline on the show's return:",
    "\"Convinced Yennefer\u2019s life was lost at the Battle of Sodden, Geralt of Rivia brings Princess Cirilla to the safest place he knows, his childhood home of Kaer Morhen. While the Continent\u2019s kings, elves, humans and demons strive for supremacy outside its walls, he must protect the girl from something far more dangerous: the mysterious power she possesses inside.\"",
    "It's a season about Geralt becoming a father figure to Ciri, according to showrunner Lauren S Hissrich, so expect that relationship to drive season 2. Geralt \u2013 a man who rarely uses words when a grunt will do \u2013 might become more talkative in his new paternal role.",
    "\"For me, it was very important to bring Geralt as close to the books as the vision and plot would allow,\u201d said Henry Cavill at WitcherCon (via Redanian Intelligence). \u201cI wanted him to be more verbose and more intellectual and more representative of a man who has lived 70 years and has a philosophical lean. He can be mopey at times but he is also wise. He has been around. He is a nice guy despite having moments of unpleasantness, and capable of extraordinary violence, but his intentions are pure. I wanted to reflect that as much as possible.\u201d",
    "A big talking point of The Witcher season 1 was how it told stories in multiple places and across a non-linear timeline \u2013 the now-released official Witcher map and Witcher timeline really help make sense of the show \u2013 resulting in a multi-tale anthology of sorts.",
    "In an interview with Vulture discussing the odd structure of season 1, Hissrich said that while she believes \"the audience is incredibly smart\", she had \"misunderstood what everyone was looking for in their entertainment\". She said \"I love to be challenged when I'm watching TV,\" but conceded that that wasn't the case for everyone.",
    "However, season 1's climax brought all the separate threads together nicely, priming The Witcher season 2 for a simpler plot and structure. Hissrich has confirmed that Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer exist in the same timeline now, so their stories will be told simultaneously. Indeed, this season will mark the first time Freya Allan (Ciri) and Anya Chalotra (Yennefer) have actually acted together, which should make things easier to follow.",
    "\"That\u2019s where we ended season 1. That\u2019s absolutely where we will pick up in season two. The stories will be told in a much more linear fashion. They won\u2019t all be one story. It\u2019s not like all three are together and happy all the time. But, I do want to employ some different ways to look at time series-wide.\"",
    "That doesn't mean we won't see any of the episodic Geralt monster-hunting adventures that we loved in season 1. Hissrich will be mining \"different short stories\" for The Witcher season 2 \u2013 such as the aforementioned 'A Grain of Truth' \u2013 and suggests there's an opportunity for flashback scenes.",
    "Some other changes are coming next year, too. The wrinkly Nilfgaardian armor, which some fans on the internet didn't like, will be upgraded in The Witcher season 2. Hissrich told Flickering Myth's Writer Experience podcast that, \"the Nilfgaard armor will be totally different. You have that opportunity [in season 2] to go back and course correct if you want to.\"",
    "And when asked by Pure Fandom for a teaser about The Witcher season 2, Hissrich simply had this to say: \"Without spoilers, I will say that there\u2019s a crop of new monsters, a new cost to magic, and new and unexpected pairings of our favorite characters.\"",
    "The first season of The Witcher shrugged off the idea that it was just here to fill a Game of Thrones-shaped hole in our lives. It confidently told stories in its own way and presented a fantasy world that has already captured people's imaginations on their Xboxes and PlayStations.",
    "And, while we are unlikely to see much spill over from the games in the Netflix show \u2013 they are not really canon according to author Sapkowski but rather a \"free adaptation containing elements of [his] work\" \u2013 we know fans will enjoy various subtle references to the games, as they did in season 1.",
    "The Witcher could run on Netflix for a long time, too \u2013 a third season is already confirmed, and Lauren S Hissrich claims to have thought out ideas for a massive seven seasons.",
    "We're pretty certain there's enough source material left for that to be viable, too: as it stands, Cavill is game for sticking with Geralt's story for the whole of a seven-season run. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAs long as we can keep telling great stories which honor [Andrzej] Sapkowski\u2019s work.\u201d",
    "And it's easy to see why they think it could be a goer, because they've got the entirety of Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer's stories to play out. It takes them across the Continent to a rich variety of locations and introduces us to some of the best fantasy characters around. Ciri's development is a great basis for future tales in The Witcher universe that combine themes of family and love, and mystery and magic.",
    "There's also prequel series The Witcher: Blood Origin in the offing, as well as another animated movie on the way and a more kid-friendly Witcher series in the works. Bring it all on, we say. We're in for the long haul, and so you should be."
