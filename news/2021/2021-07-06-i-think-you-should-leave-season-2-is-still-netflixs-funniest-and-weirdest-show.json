  "article": [
    "If you\u2019re of a certain age and you've watched a lot of British sketch comedy, you may remember The Fast Show\u2019s recurring skit in which a man completely misreads or embarrasses himself in a social situation before uttering the catchphrase \u201cI\u2019ll get me coat.\u201d",
    "Netflix sketch show I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson \u2013 whose second season has just hit the streaming service \u2013 thrives on placing its characters in similarly awkward scenarios. But instead of recognizing and apologizing for their faux pas, they stubbornly double down on their nonsense in increasingly manic ways.",
    "Should that all sound a little one-note, fear not. Combining Adult Swim-style absurdism with the enraged manchild persona of early Adam Sandler and the offbeat pacing of Portlandia, season 1 pushed its central concept into all kinds of entertaining situations.",
    "Its strength was skilfully wrongfooting viewers at every turn \u2013 mining glorious cringe comedy out of everything from inappropriate funeral music and Instagram self-deprecation, to Walk the Line parodies and Wienermobile crashes. And with each episode clocking in around the 15-minute mark, it never outstayed its welcome.",
    "But can Robinson, a former Saturday Night Live cast member-turned-writer, and co-creator Zach Kanin, primarily a cartoonist for The New Yorker, strike gold for a second time?",
    "Well, just the trailer for season 2, which repurposed previous highlights to make the show resemble an intense thriller, proved the pair have lost none of their ability to subvert.",
    "Still, even those who repeatedly binged their way through its previous 29 sketches may still take a while to readjust to its left-field nature. I Think You Should Leave has an aversion to clear-cut punchlines, always ending a skit much earlier, or indeed much later, than you\u2019d conventionally expect.",
    "\u201cIf people are staying to what's taught to you it gets boring, and no one wants to watch that,\u201d Robinson told GQ about the show\u2019s lack of established comedy rules. You\u2019re often left wondering what exactly it is you\u2019ve just witnessed, every time the colorful 1970s-styled interlude pops up.",
    "Yet while the jokes \u2013 or anti-jokes, you could say \u2013 don\u2019t always land (mainly the scatological gags), the hit-to-miss ratio is of a much higher percentage than the format\u2019s average. That\u2019s even more impressive considering how wildly it swings, and for the fact that it doesn\u2019t rely on tried and tested comedy techniques.",
    "There are a few throwbacks which fans will appreciate. Robinson\u2019s partner-in-crime on underrated advertising sitcom Detroiters, Sam Richardson, shows up again as the host of another wildly inappropriate competition. Here he\u2019s gate-crashing a business function, forcing a mortified CEO to judge a contest dubbed 'Little Buff Boys'. The poor man\u2019s horror at having to choose between a group of flexing, foam-padded tweens is both hilarious and highly uncomfortable to witness \u2013 the show\u2019s mentality in a nutshell.",
    "There are also several parody commercials which recall the work of Detroiters\u2019 bumbling execs Cramblin and Duvet. They\u2019d surely be proud of the treatments given to Dan Flashes (the premier and surprisingly aggressive destination for highly complicated patterned shirts) or the vacuum cleaner designed specifically to hoover up hazardous hot dogs (a callback to the show's opening skit).",
    "However, this delayed six-part season is largely more interested when it comes to developing brand-new baffling situations to squirm over. And they don\u2019t get much more baffling than the Calicocutpants.com skit, which almost takes up the entire fourth episode of season 2.",
    "What initially starts out as a favor to prevent mild embarrassment escalates into a workplace nightmare, involving battery-eating wives, inescapable pop-ups and, erm, a crowdfunded smokescreen for pee-stained trousers (if that sounds confusing written down, rest assured that it makes no more sense on-screen). It\u2019s a prime example of how Robinson takes a seemingly mundane scenario, twists it beyond all recognition and then just when you think it\u2019s over, twists things some more.",
    "I Think You Should Leave still boasts several instant laugh-out-loud moments to go along with all the lengthier absurdities, though. See the straight-to-camera plea to \"save Corncob TV\", a channel showing nothing more than dead bodies falling comically out of coffins. Or the big reveal after a prank show host \u2013 soon to undergo a very public existential crisis \u2013 is fitted with the most unconvincing of aging prosthetics. You could never accuse Robinson of not committing to his arsenal of oddballs.",
    "Admittedly, that commitment can occasionally be a little jarring, particularly when the comedian starts mistaking volume for substance. You pretty much always know that it\u2019s one of the weaker sketches when Robinson resorts to simply yelling. See when he plays the angry lookalike agency owner, for example, or the angry novice driver, or the angry partygoer determined to convince everyone that he\u2019s no longer a \u201cpiece of s***.\u201d",
    "To be fair, Robinson appears to acknowledge that audiences do need a respite from all the shouting. In the brilliant third episode opener, he happily plays the straight man to a beloved college professor with a serious case of food envy. Likewise, when he appears opposite Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul) as a single father who instantly regrets lying about the lack of ice cream, you get a slightly different energy from the show's leading man.",
    "Along those lines, there are several sketches in which he goes completely AWOL. Take the Detective Crashmore trailer and accompanying press junket, where Santa Claus reinvents himself as a foul-mouthed gun-toting B-movie star. There\u2019s also an inspired, and for some, possibly relatable, restaurant set-up which sees Search Party\u2019s John Early throw a tantrum over a game of credit card roulette.",
    "Season 2 of I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson, just like the first, won\u2019t be for everyone. But then again, it shouldn\u2019t be. Netflix have plenty of mass appeal comedies in their originals stable. This is the kind of idiosyncratic, disorientating and truly unhinged fare that\u2019s only ever likely to develop a loyal cult following \u2013 and it's exactly why we love it.",
    "I Think You Should Leave season 2 is now streaming worldwide on Netflix."
