    "Spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follow.",
    "If, by some unlikely turn of events, \u2018Power Broker\u2019 turns out be someone\u2019s first exposure to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they might wonder if they\u2019re watching a superhero franchise at all. Comic book-inspired costumes and superpowers are kept to an absolute minimum in an episode that amplifies the real-world elements of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s story arc.",
    "In fact, this third instalment has more in common with Jason Bourne and the edgier, grittier James Bond movies than it does with the more outlandish extremes of the MCU \u2013 even some of the music has an appropriately John Barry edge.",
    "This is Sam and Bucky going off the grid to take their mismatched detective duo act to the seedier corners of the world, with the recreated Super-Soldier Serum as their McGuffin. The best thing about the gear shift is that it works.",
    "There\u2019s hints of The Silence of the Lambs as Bucky confronts the incarcerated Baron Zemo through a plexiglass wall. There\u2019s little time for psychological probing and quid pro quo, however, because within minutes they\u2019ve come to a mutually beneficial agreement. They don\u2019t even wait for Sam\u2019s sign-off on an audacious prison break sequence that comes packaged in an Ocean\u2019s 11-like voiceover wrapping. Sam\u2019s (justified) scepticism about the loyalties of their new ally is mollified by Bucky requesting he back him up the same way he followed Steve in opposing the Sokovia Accords.",
    "The fact that Zemo is the owner of a private jet doesn\u2019t hurt, either \u2013 the butler is just the icing on the cake. Besides, the presence of the wonderfully ambiguous Zemo creates an extra source of conflict in the already fractious Falcon/Winter Soldier dynamic.",
    "The first target on their mission is Selby, a mid-level fence operating from the South-east Asian island nation of Madripoor. Getting to her requires Sam to masquerade as a criminal known as Smiling Tiger, while Bucky reassumes his Winter Soldier persona \u2013 complete with an impressively destructive bar brawl for show.",
    "That display of strength is particularly important because he\u2019s the collateral in a deal to get information on the Super-Soldier Serum. Selby reveals that a Dr Wilfred Nagel has been working on the wonder-drug, but she won\u2019t give them any more intel without payment. She\u2019s not the sort of person you argue with either, as she proves when she forces Sam to answer an incoming phone call from his sister, Sarah, on speaker \u2013 or die. The chat goes surprisingly well \u2013 aside from the explaining Sam would have to do for Sarah later \u2013 until she says his name\u2026",
    "Luckily, they have a guardian angel who kills Selby before she can kill them. Unluckily, there\u2019s now a sizeable bounty on their heads, and the whole of Madripoor\u2019s criminal underworld is on their tail. In other words, it\u2019s at times like these you need a friend, and she materializes in the form of former SHIELD agent Sharon Carter. Sharon\u2019s been living off the grid since helping Steve Rogers in Captain America: Civil War, and was keeping an eye on what was going down in the bar before Sam, Bucky and Zemo met Selby.",
    "She\u2019s not the woman they remember, however. As well as being a successful hustler and black market art dealer, she has been left (understandably) embittered by her years on the run \u2013 she no longer believes in the idealism that led her to defy her orders and follow Cap. It\u2019s immediately clear that she\u2019s not going to join Sam and Bucky\u2019s mission out of any loyalty \u2013 misplaced or otherwise \u2013 and even Sam\u2019s offer of a government pardon is met with cynicism.",
    "It\u2019s still enough to persuade her to use her contacts to track Nagel down to a laboratory hidden in a shipping container \u2013 and single-handedly fight off legions of gunmen as Sam, Bucky and Nemo go after the rogue scientist.",
    "Held at gunpoint, Nagel admits he was hired by HYDRA to continue their Winter Soldier program. When they fell, he continued the work for the CIA, successfully isolating the Super-Soldier Serum from the blood of a test subject \u2013 Isaiah Bradley. Unlike the Serum that created Captain America, the Nagel variant wouldn\u2019t require \u201cclunky machines\u201d or create jacked-up bodies \u2013 but his work was left incomplete when Thanos\u2019s finger snap turned him to dust. When Nagel returned five years later, he wound up working for the Power Broker. He made 20 samples of the Serum, which were stolen by Karli Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers.",
    "He\u2019s unable to tell them much more, however, as Zemo unexpectedly puts a bullet through the scientist\u2019s brain \u2013 as a rocket launcher destroys the lab. Zemo\u2019s true motives remain unclear, but the way he\u2019s able to escape from the lab invisibly, before taking possession of a super-charged car that looks perfect for a getaway, suggests he may know more about what\u2019s happening than he\u2019s letting on. Either way, it\u2019s safe to assume he\u2019s not to be trusted.",
    "But that feels entirely appropriate in an episode that revels in playing with our perceptions. It\u2019s clear that neither Sharon nor Zemo are exactly who they claim to be, while Sharon\u2019s loaded comment about the hypocrisy of superheroes ties into Sam\u2019s doubts about becoming the new Captain America \u2013 he even says later that he\u2019s now wishing he\u2019d destroyed Cap\u2019s shield.",
    "Then there\u2019s new Captain America John Walker, whose methods \u2013 bullying, torture \u2013 are a shocking contradiction to Steve Rogers\u2019 rules of engagement. He may be willing to break the rules, doing whatever it takes to bring the Flag Smashers to \u201cjustice\u201d, but is that sort of behavior worthy of the uniform?",
    "It\u2019s certainly harder to sympathize with Walker than it is with the Flag Smashers. Having introduced them as a group of souped-up terrorists, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has subsequently explored the reasons they do what they do. Once you\u2019ve realized it\u2019s all about providing food and medicine to the millions made homeless by the Blip \u2013 and you see Karli\u2019s grief over the death of Donya Madani \u2013 you start to see them as heroes. And then Karli blows up a building with people inside \u2013 saying \u201cThis is the only language these people understand\u201d \u2013 and your perceptions shift again.",
    "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is developing into a show of impressive moral complexity \u2013 and although they share plenty of DNA, that\u2019s rarely something you could say of James Bond.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Bucky\u2019s show of strength in the bar and Zemo donning his famous comic-book mask may be the episode\u2019s only real superhero trappings, but you never feel there\u2019s anything missing from \u2018Power Broker\u2019. The Bond/Bourne espionage edge really meshes with the characters, while themes about the Flag Smashers\u2019 motives, the new Captain America\u2019s disrespect for human rights, and what it means to be a hero lift this way above average beat-\u2019em-up fare. There\u2019s also plenty for long-standing fans of the MCU, with returns for Zemo and Sharon Carter, more intel on the post-Captain America Super-Soldier program, and a brief cameo from the Dora Milaje\u2019s Ayo. Now it seems Black Panther is in the show\u2019s orbit too\u2026",
    "New episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available on Disney Plus every Friday."
