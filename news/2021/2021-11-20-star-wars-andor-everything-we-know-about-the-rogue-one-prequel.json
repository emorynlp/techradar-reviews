  "article": [
    "The Andor TV show brings one of the stars of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to the small screen.",
    "Set around five years before Rebel spies recovered plans to the Death Star \u2013 paving the way for Luke Skywalker to fire those fateful proton torpedos down an exhaust port \u2013 the show focusses on Cassian Andor, a secret service operative working for the Rebellion against the Empire.",
    "Diego Luna reprises his Rogue One role as Andor, and with that movie\u2019s co-writer (and Bourne scripter) Tony Gilroy on showrunning duties, it looks set to be an espionage thriller in outer space \u2013 think Jason Bourne with starships. Luna has also teased that we\u2019ll \u201cdefinitely see some familiar faces\u201d, so expect the Andor TV show how key figures in the Rebel Alliance turned a ragtag bunch of soldiers into a force capable of overthrowing the Empire.",
    "We can expect to see movie-scale production values, a cast of thousands and plenty of Star Wars action. So with the Andor TV show set to land on Disney Plus in the second half of 2022, TechRadar has unleashed its Bothan spies to uncover everything you need to know...",
    "Release date: Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has confirmed the 12-episode series will debut in 2022 \u2013 the most recent news from Disney suggests a July-September timeframe.",
    "Cast: Rogue One\u2019s Diego Luna will be joined by an all-star cast including Adria Arjona, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Fiona Shaw, Robert Emms, Denise Gough and Kyle Soller. Genevieve O\u2019Reilly also reprises her role as Mon Mothma.",
    "Story: Andor is a prequel to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars story, a spy story focusing on the exploits of intelligence operative Cassian Andor.",
    "Way back in November 2018, then-Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a Cassian Andor TV show was in development \u2013 a whole year before Disney Plus and The Mandalorian made their debuts. Star Diego Luna confirmed in a November 2020 interview with Jimmy Kimmel that, after some Covid-19-related delays, the show had started production. The shoot \u2013 which, according to ScreenRant, wrapped in August 2021 \u2013 took place at London\u2019s Pinewood Studios, and across the UK.",
    "At Disney\u2019s Investor Day in December 2020 \u2013 the one where Lucasfilm and Marvel announced a huge raft of Star Wars and MCU TV shows \u2013 Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that the show will be called Andor, and that the Andor release date will be some time in 2022.",
    "As for when in 2022 we\u2019ll see it\u2026",
    "CBR reported in November 2021 that The Walt Disney Company's most recent update for investors gave Andor a release date window of fourth quarter, 2022. Because Disney's financial year runs from October to the following September, that means the Andor release date will be some time between July and September 2022. Like the other Star Wars TV shows, Andor will stream exclusively on Disney Plus.",
    "It\u2019s still a bit early to expect a teaser for a series that won\u2019t debut until 2022 \u2013 we often have to wait until within a month or two of release for a Star Wars movie or TV show to show off its first footage. But in the absence of a genuine Star Wars: Andor trailer \u2013 or any new footage from Disney Plus Day \u2013 we do at least have the sizzle reel that debuted at the Disney Investor Day in December 2020.",
    "While it doesn\u2019t reveal any finished scenes from the show, the reel does showcase concept art, costumes and the scale of the production, and features plenty of contributions from Luna and behind-the-scenes department heads.",
    "Besides, the sizzle reel\u2019s Rogue One soundbite of Andor saying, \u201cEverything I did, I did for the Rebellion,\u201d may turn out to be a neat summary of the show\u2026",
    "The list of confirmed Star Wars: Andor cast members currently looks like this:",
    "The Andor cast is truly vast, with costume designer Michael Wilkinson revealing in the sizzle reel that there are \u201cover 200 named cast members\u201d and \u201cover 6,000 crowd people\u201d (aka extras). This being a typically secretive Star Wars production, however, we only know for sure who a couple of this literal cast of thousands are playing.",
    "Unsurprisingly, Diego Luna is reprising his Rogue One: A Star Wars Story role as the eponymous Rebel spy Cassian Andor. He\u2019ll be joined by another Rogue One veteran in Genevieve O\u2019Reilly, whose involvement was confirmed by the Hollywood Reporter in April 2020.",
    "She\u2019ll be playing Mon Mothma, a member of the Galactic Senate before the fall of the Old Republic, who becomes a prime mover in the formation of the Rebel Alliance. O\u2019Reilly originally played the role in scenes cut from Revenge of the Sith, her uncanny likeness to Caroline Blakiston (who played Mon Mothma in Return of the Jedi) ensuring she looks the part without the need for expensive digital magic.",
    "Luna and O\u2019Reilly will be joined by Good Omens/6 Underground star Adria Arjona, Thor/Dune\u2019s Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Harry Potter/Killing Eve\u2019s Fiona Shaw, Atlantis/Chernobyl\u2019s Robert Emms, Poldark/Anna Karenina\u2019s Kyle Soller, and Olivier Award-winning theater star Denise Gough \u2013 though Lucasfilm and Disney are yet to reveal who any of them are playing.",
    "Luna told Deadline in September 2021 that \u201cyou'll definitely see familiar faces,\u201d and beyond the officially announced Andor cast, there are unconfirmed rumors we\u2019ll be seeing appearances from more Rogue One characters.",
    "The Direct reports that Ben Mendelsohn will be reprising his role as the Death Star\u2019s architect-in-chief Orson Krennic. Meanwhile, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd suggested in an interview on Swedish radio (h/t CBR) that Forest Whitaker\u2019s Saw Gerrera \u2013 the loose cannon freedom fighter who first appeared in The Clone Wars \u2013 might also be up for a return.",
    "It looks like we\u2019ll have to wait a while to see an appearance from K-2SO, the former Imperial security droid who was Cassian\u2019s right-hand man in Rogue One. While performance capture/voice actor Alan Tudyk was attached to the Andor TV show when it was first announced, he\u2019s no longer set to appear \u00ad\u2013 at least, he isn\u2019t yet\u2026",
    "\u201cThey\u2019re shooting it right now, I\u2019m not in it,\u201d Tudyk told Collider in early 2021. \u201cBut, if it stays on the air, and stories keep getting told, I\u2019ll end up in there. I\u2019m going to be in the show. It\u2019s just that the story that Tony [Gilroy, showrunner] is telling doesn't involve K-2SO until later on... I can't be too specific, but I can definitely say that I\u2019m not going to be in the first season.\u201d Presumably that means that later seasons will feature that important \u2018When Cassian met K-2SO\u2019 moment\u2026",
    "While most of the core Rogue One figures \u2013 such as Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones), Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) and Chirrut \u00cemwe (Donnie Yen) \u2013 don\u2019t start to move in Rebel Alliance circles until that movie, there are several other established characters who could feature in the Andor TV show.",
    "Sex Education\u2019s Alistair Petrie, for example, could reprise his role as General Draven, while regular Clone Wars/Rebels/The Bad Batch voicer Stephen Stanton could feasibly return as Mon Calamari officer Admiral Raddus. Having played Princess Leia\u2019s adoptive father, Bail Organa, in the prequel trilogy and Rogue One, Jimmy Smits also seems a prime candidate for a cameo.",
    "Indeed, one of the fun things about Andor\u2019s spot in the Star Wars timeline is that most of the major players in the franchise are out there somewhere in the galaxy. So don\u2019t be surprised if characters from Star Wars Rebels (set in the same period as Andor) such as ace pilot Hera Syndulla make their live-action debuts, or if Rogue One\u2019s Guy Henry gets to wheel out his Peter Cushing impression once again, as Grand Moff Tarkin.",
    "On the more out-there end of the rumor mill, Making Star Wars reports that Andy Serkis is set to join the Star Wars: Andor cast. He famously played the late Supreme Leader Snoke in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, before being unceremoniously cut down by Kylo Ren \u2013 we subsequently learned in The Rise of Skywalker that he was just one of a batch of clones commissioned by Emperor Palpatine. If Snoke is around in the Andor era, it suggests that the Emperor created the Supreme Leader earlier than we previously believed. Unless, of course, Serkis is playing an entirely different role \u2013 he's a performance capture specialist, so Lucasfilm may have tapped him up to play another alien.",
    "Most intriguingly of all, we know from Rebels that Anakin Skywalker\u2019s former Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, was pivotal in the formation of the Alliance. Indeed, she was one of the top-secret operatives who worked under the codename \u2018Fulcrum\u2019 \u2013 Cassian Andor himself will also use the moniker at some point \u2013 so there\u2019s a good chance the Jedi will cross paths with one of Andor\u2019s missions. With Rosario Dawson having played the role in The Mandalorian and taking the lead in her own Ahsoka spin-off series, a cameo in Andor seems plausible.",
    "Just as the presence of Diego Luna and Genevieve Reilly ensures a connection with the Rogue One cast, there\u2019s also continuity behind the camera \u2013 Tony Gilroy, the Bourne screenwriter who supervised reshoots on Rogue One, is the Andor showrunner.",
    "Having initially been hired as a writer on the series, Gilroy took the top job after the departure of former The Americans showrunner Stephen Schiff in April 2020 (via CBR.com). StarWars.com subsequently confirmed that Schiff remains on board as a scripter, with the writers\u2019 room bolstered by the big-name likes of Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler) and Beau Willimon (House of Cards).",
    "Although Tony Gilroy, who picked up an Oscar nomination for directing Michael Clayton, was originally attached to helm episodes, Deadline reported in September 2020 that Covid-19 concerns had prompted him to stay in New York, rather than join the UK-based production.",
    "Instead, Doctor Who and Black Mirror director Toby Haynes was brought in to call the shots on the opening three episodes. ScreenRant reported in February 2021 that Susanna White (who includes Nanny McPhee Returns, and episodes of Boardwalk Empire and Masters of Sex on her resum\u00e9) and Ben Caron (The Crown) will also direct instalments.",
    "Beyond the fact that StarWars.com has confirmed that the show \u201ctakes place five years before the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d and is a \u201crousing spy thriller [that] will explore tales filled with espionage and daring missions to restore hope to a galaxy in the grip of a ruthless Empire\u201d, Lucasfilm and Disney are being as cagey as you\u2019d expect about the Andor plot. And that's despite Luna's acknowledgement (via Deadline) that \"I can't spoil the ending if you've seen [Rogue One] already.\u201d",
    "From the minimal intel that\u2019s made it past the production\u2019s energy shield, it sounds like the Andor TV show will play out like James Bond \u2013 or, given Tony Gilroy\u2019s involvement, Jason Bourne \u2013 in a galaxy far, far away.",
    "Luna told Jimmy Kimmel that, \u201cit\u2019s basically everything you have to know to understand Rogue One.\u201d We know from early scenes of that movie \u2013 where Andor kills an informant who may compromise his mission \u2013 that Luna\u2019s character is capable of performing brutal acts in the name of the Rebellion. It\u2019s also hinted that he has a murky past that could be explored in the new Andor TV show \u2013 perhaps we\u2019ll be seeing the beginnings of a path to redemption that culminated in Rogue One.",
    "That \u201cfive years before the events of Rogue One\u201d setting means Andor will overlap significantly with the Rebels animated series. That show revealed how the Rebel Alliance united numerous cells of freedom fighters into a collective capable of winning its first significant victory at the Battle of Scarif \u2013 and subsequently taking down the Death Star. In other words, expect the series to detail the origins of the Alliance. As Diego Luna teased in the sizzle reel: \u201cThere\u2019s tons of possibilities to explore. It is the building of a revolution.\u201d"
