    "The iPhone 13 is here, and you\u2019re going to want to protect your shiny new tech. Rokform\u2019s cases provide a degree of protection much higher than a lot of the competition. And, to celebrate the launch of the new iPhone 13 and its new cases, Rokform is hosting a giveaway for nearly $300 worth of Rokform accessories to kit out their iPhone 13.",
    "The latest cases from Rokform are part of its Crystal series and Rugged series. Whichever you choose, you can count on considerable protection for your device.",
    "The Rokform Crystal case provides a degree of transparency, so the colors of your brand-new iPhone 13 can show through. It has clear paneling on the back, but that\u2019s still made from hard plastic to protect the phone.",
    "The Rokform Rugged case is built with a carbon fiber-style backing that\u2019s scratch-resistant, so it can keep looking sharp even if you\u2019re less than careful with your phone now and then.",
    "Both the Rugged and Crystal series of cases provide notable protection for every corner of your device. They have reinforced edges and corners to absorb shock and keep the screen from hitting the ground should you drop your phone. That extra protection extends to the iPhone 13\u2019s cameras too with a 2.6mm raised TPU ring to keep them out of harm\u2019s way.",
    "These new cases continue to offer Rokform\u2019s signature feature with magnets, but they are also now MagSafe compatible. So, you\u2019ll be able to use MagSafe wireless charging systems and accessories while keeping your phone secure in the Rokform case.",
    "The magnets Rokform has built into the case provide some extra tricks. You can mount your phone to magnetic surfaces for convenient hands-free use. Throw it onto the fridge to keep a recipe handy while you\u2019re cooking or mount it onto a toolbox while you\u2019re at your workbench.",
    "If the phone is ever on a non-magnetic surface, the anti-slip grip on the back of the case can still help keep it in place. You can also use the case\u2019s rear attachment point to connect them with Rokform\u2019s Twist Lock accessories for cars, bikes, motorcycles, and more, which go on with a simple twist and hold firmly in place with magnets.",
    "If you\u2019re excited about the new iPhone 13 series and want to keep the phone safe, be sure to check out Rokform\u2019s Crystal and Rugged cases for the whole iPhone 13 lineup, from the iPhone 13 Mini all the way up to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. And, if you want a chance to win some Rokform swag for your iPhone 13, enter the Rokform giveaway below. You\u2019ll have a chance to win a Rokform iPhone 13 Rugged Case, tempered glass screen protector, windshield mount, G-Rok Bluetooth speaker, and Sport Ring accessory."
