  "article": [
    "The Beats Studio Buds were one of Apple\u2019s worst-kept secrets, having been leaked multiple times in the lead up to their release on June 14.",
    "For months in advance, we knew how the Studio Buds would look, which colors they would come in, and that they\u2019d sport active noise cancellation.",
    "What we didn\u2019t know is that they\u2019d be the first Beats headphones (and by extension, the first Apple headphones, as the tech giant owns the brand) to support one-touch pairing with Android phones, as well as iOS devices.",
    "They don\u2019t even come with the H1 headphone chip (nor its W1 predecessors) that\u2019s seen across the AirPods range of headphones and wireless earbuds. Is Apple putting distance between its own audio devices and the Beats brand? It certainly looks that way.",
    "Whether you\u2019ve used Beats headphones or not, you\u2019ve almost certainly heard of the brand. It was founded by rapper Dr Dre and record producer Jimmy Iovine in 2006, and quickly became a leading company in the world of personal audio.",
    "Its large market share and cool branding is likely what attracted Apple, which acquired Beats for an astonishing $3 billion in 2014.",
    "Since then, Apple has worked hard to rectify Beats\u2019 reputation for putting out overly-bassy headphones that no real audiophile would go anywhere near, with the sporty Powerbeats Pro making strides towards a well-balanced soundstage.",
    "The Powerbeats Pro even came with the same H1 headphone chip found inside the Apple AirPods and the AirPods Pro, allowing for fast pairing times and the ability to summon Apple\u2019s AI assistant Siri, with your voice alone.",
    "In all but name and design, the Powerbeats Pro are essentially a pair of AirPods, coming with all the functionality you\u2019d expect from a pair of Apple headphones \u2013 and that includes optimization with iOS devices.",
    "The Beats Studio Buds, however, are different. Instead of coming with the H1 headphone chip, they sport a proprietary Beats chip \u2013 and this allows for one-touch pairing with Android devices, as well as iOS devices.",
    "This is a first for any pair of Beats headphones, and it suggests that Apple is taking a different approach with the brand compared to its own headphones, which are traditionally \u2018locked in\u2019 to the Apple ecosystem.",
    "Sure, you can use a pair of AirPods with an Android phone, but you miss out on a lot of quality-of-life features, like automatic switching between devices and the ability to listen with a single earbud.",
    "The Beats Studio Buds bring some functionality back, like built-in controls, the ability to check your battery level, and firmware updates via the Beats app \u2013 and that all-important one-touch pairing feature.",
    "However, the use of a Beats headphone chip means you do lose out on some AirPods features; they don\u2019t support iCloud device syncing or multipoint pairing, for example.",
    "So, they can\u2019t be said to be the best Beats headphones for Apple devotees, especially if you like to be able to switch between your Macbook Pro and your iPhone with minimal fuss. But, they might just be the best Beats headphones for Android users \u2013 and by extension, the best Apple headphones for Android.",
    "Does this mean Apple is distancing its own products from Beats headphones? We can\u2019t know for sure, but the fact that the Studio Buds work just as well for Android as they do for iOS does suggest as much. After all, Apple isn\u2019t exactly known for being OS-agnostic.",
    "Furthermore, the Studio Buds have an uncharacteristically low price compared to other Beats and Apple headphones. They cost $149.99 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$199.95, which is far cheaper than the Apple AirPods Pro. Of course, that\u2019s not cheap for a pair of true wireless earbuds, but it\u2019s certainly not at the higher end of the price scale, either.",
    "Apple has surprised us in the past with low prices \u2013 just look at the $99 / \u00a399 / AU$149 HomePod mini \u2013 but undercutting the competition isn\u2019t in the tech giant\u2019s nature.",
    "So, it\u2019s possible that the Studio Buds represent a new focus for the Beats brand \u2013 to offer more affordable, less Apple-centric versions of its owner\u2019s audio products. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what Beats does next, but don\u2019t be surprised if we see a pair of AirPods Max-style over-ear headphones with Android compatibility and a cheaper price tag in the near future."
