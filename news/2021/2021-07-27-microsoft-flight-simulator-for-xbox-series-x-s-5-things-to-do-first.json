    "It\u2019s one of the most impressive games on PC at the moment \u2013 and it\u2019s worthy of the same accolades on Xbox. Microsoft Flight Simulator launches on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S today, bringing the entire world (yes, you read that correctly, the entire world) to your TV, ready to be explored from high in the sky.",
    "It\u2019s a ridiculously ambitious feat, harnessing the power of the new consoles and cloud data services in tandem (not to mention a huge amount of Xbox storage space), and Microsoft\u2019s Asobo Studio has pulled it off with aplomb.",
    "But it\u2019s also quite a daunting game, too. With the entire world at your fingertips, and the minutiae of dozens of aircraft to get your head around, where is best to start?",
    "Our Microsoft Flight Simulator guide for Xbox below will walk you through your first few hours in the game, getting you up in the sky and ready for the more challenging flights in the weeks ahead as you earn your wings over five steps. Plus, we've thrown in a bonus sixth tip for those ready to really invest in the experience.",
    "This sounds like an obvious one, but you\u2019d be surprised how many people skip the tutorial and just jump straight into a game as first timers. With Microsoft Flight Simulator, that\u2019s a bad idea. There are lots of complex controls to learn and flight instrumentation to understand. It\u2019ll quickly become second nature \u2013 but without an early guiding hand you\u2019re going to struggle.",
    "There are eight scenarios in flight training to complete, taking about 30 minutes to work though, and covering everything from camera control to take off and landing. If you\u2019ve only access to a control pad (remember, Xbox consoles can accept keyboard and mouse input, too), it\u2019s particularly important to run Flight Training, as some controls may not be instantly obvious.",
    "You can\u2019t do much in terms of tweaking the controls while you\u2019re in Flight Training, but once you\u2019re out of it, you\u2019ve free rein to reassign inputs, change assist levels, and mess with sensitivity levels.",
    "That last one is super important if you\u2019re playing on Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S and are limited to a pad, as the default sensitivity level is incredibly high, making fine-tuned landings a bit difficult to pull off.",
    "It\u2019s also worth heading into the menu and changing at least one of the in-game flight assists. While some are pivotal for keeping a newbie\u2019s plane in the air, we\u2019d encourage you to switch off \u2018Assisted Yoke\u2019. That\u2019s what\u2019s in charge of pitch (altitude) and roll and, seeing as that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be doing the most silly, fun in-flight moves, you want control over that once you\u2019ve settled in.",
    "There\u2019s in-game air traffic control in Microsoft Flight Simulator, as you\u2019d imagine, and as you fly around you\u2019ll get little radio calls letting you know about those in the skies around you. You can tweak your tail number to give your plane a little personalisation (pop your name on your tail, why don\u2019t you?), but it\u2019s the call sign that has a more profound effect on radio messaging.",
    "If you edit your call sign, air traffic control teams will use that to identify you on the radio, using the Phonetic Alphabet (alpha, bravo, charlie, etc) to speak to you. If you pop a short word into your call sign though, they may use that to call you instead. It\u2019s a nice little touch that makes you feel part of the bigger gaming world \u2013 though don\u2019t bother messing with profanities, as it\u2019ll just ignore them and replace them with something generic instead.",
    "You\u2019ve got your wings, you\u2019ve got the whole world to explore\u2026 and yet the first place you want to check out is a bird\u2019s eye view of your home right? Yep, us too.",
    "You can quite easily find your house by flying around from a nearby airport, providing you have the patience and a decent sense of local geography. But here are a few tips to make sure your fly-by goes off without a hitch.",
    "If you just want to appear in the sky directly above your home, you can click anywhere on the World Map / Free Flight mode that isn\u2019t an airport and select \u201cset as departure\u201d. You\u2019ll appear high above the location at a cruising speed though, so you\u2019ll speed right past if you\u2019re not careful.",
    "If you want the exact coordinates, pop your address into Google Maps and right click on the red pin that appears on the location \u2013 that top string of numbers that appears is the exact coordinates of your home! Copy them into the World Map search field and you\u2019ll be able to set it as a starting point or destination. It\u2019s more fun to fly to it from a local airport, though, so look up some nearby runways and set one as your takeoff location.",
    "Remember the Microsoft Flight Simulator trailers that looked more like an Attenborough documentary, complete with herds of grazing animals to fly over? That wasn\u2019t just marketing rubbish \u2013 they are actually in the game, but can be quite difficult to find just aimlessly flying.",
    "To make it a bit easier, type in \u201cfauna\u201d on the World Map search bar, which will bring up a list of locations for different species, from flamingoes to elephants. Once you\u2019re up in the air relatively nearby, hit pause and bring up the Assistance tab. From the navigational menu you\u2019ll then want to turn the toggle for \u201cFauna Markers\u201d on. You\u2019ll then get a heads up marker making it way easier to spot the little (or large) critters.",
    "Now you're up to speed with all that the game has to offer, it's time to step it up a gear. No pilot worth their wings plays with a keyboard and mouse, let alone a gamepad. If you're truly looking at ascend, you need to invest in a flight stick.",
    "While there are plenty of options for PC gamers, you're a bit more limited when it comes to console compatibility. Our pick is the above Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas One.",
    "The Hotas One bundles together the main joystick, a throttle and a detachable base, allowing you to position the peripheral to your liking, and giving you all the controls you'll need easily within reach. Being an official flight accessory to the game and console means there should be little to no compatibility issues to get in the way of your flying, either."
