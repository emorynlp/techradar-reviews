    "Fortnite has received some major content with Chapter 3 - after a pretty spectacular chapter 2 finale - that brings a whole new map to the popular battle royale game. This includes fan-favorite locations that have been brought back from chapter 1, alongside new locations, plus new gameplay mechanics and secrets.",
    "Jump into Fortnite right now and you\u2019ll find the Daily Bugle office building from Spider-Man and a bunch of spider webs spread out across the island. Plus there\u2019s another new area called the Sanctuary that acts as the base for the Seven - the weird and secret organization behind the bigger Fortnite narrative. Oh, and also there\u2019s a huge statue of Dwyane \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson right near the base.",
    "Along with the new locations are some welcome gameplay changes. You can now slide across Fortnite by holding the crouch button on your respective gaming platform, and doing this downhill will increase your speed. Spider-Man\u2019s presence has also ushered in new gameplay features, and from December 11, players will be able to swing from high places with Spider-Man\u2019s web-shooters.",
    "The ability to set up camps in Chapter 3 has been added to the game - this is where you and your squad can heal, store items and plan your next attack. A new heap of weapons have been added to the game, including shotguns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Thunderstorms, lightning, and tornadoes have also made their way onto Fortnite - but beware of getting too close to tornados as they\u2019ll suck you in and spit you back out.",
    "To get the full rundown on everything that\u2019s been added to Fortnite, check out Epic Games' full \u2018What\u2019s new\u2019 post.",
    "It's great to see a constant flow of new content get added to Battle Royales like Fortnite and Apex Legends. Whether it\u2019s new maps, new guns, stories or new gameplay mechanics, there\u2019s always something there to keep the game interesting.",
    "However, this isn\u2019t quite the same case for Call of Duty: Warzone, which is now only just getting a whole new map on December 9 after more than a year since its release.",
    "Verdansk has been Warzone\u2019s main map for over a year now - it\u2019s seen some changes but they weren\u2019t substantial. A much smaller map called Rebirth Island was added to bring some new life to the game, but that was released in December 2020 - so it\u2019s pretty safe to say that has gotten stale too. And the staleness of the game is shown in its player count. According to playercounter.com estimations, Warzone consistently has dramatically lower player counts compared to Fortnite and Apex Legends.",
    "But it\u2019s looking like the new Warzone map called \u2018Caldera\u2019 will bring some much-needed content and changes to the Call of Duty Battle Royale."
