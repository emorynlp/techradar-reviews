    "Intel has released a fresh graphics driver which brings in official support for its new discrete Xe GPU for laptops, and provides a useful fix for a Cyberpunk 2077 bug.",
    "The highlight of driver release 27.20.100.9168 is the introduction of support for Intel Iris Xe Max Graphics, otherwise known as DG1, the first Xe standalone GPU (as opposed to integrated graphics built into the CPU).",
    "A number of notebooks already run with Intel\u2019s new GPU, including the Acer Swift 3x and Asus VivoBook Flip TP470.",
    "Support for the game Hitman 3 also arrives with this new driver, although it is recommended that you should be running Iris Xe Graphics (or better) to enjoy this fresh release.",
    "As you might expect, driver 27.20.100.9168 also fixes a bunch of issues, including a frustrating crash which happens when launching Cyberpunk 2077 \u2013 although there are still other \u2018intermittent\u2019 crashing issues affecting the game, as listed in the known issues of the release notes [PDF].",
    "There are lots of cures for \u2018minor\u2019 graphics glitches in a whole load of games, including Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy, Nioh 2, Star Wars Battlefront 2 and various Tomb Raider games.",
    "A problem with 4K monitors connected to a laptop via DisplayPort, which caused flickering to occur on the screen after closing the notebook and then resuming from sleep, has also been fixed.",
