  "article": [
    "Intel\u2019s Xe HPG, or high-performance gaming graphics card, has again been teased online, with testing apparently well underway with the GPU.",
    "Raja Koduri, chief architect and head of the graphics division at Intel, tweeted about the HPG card being in action with 3DMark\u2019s incoming Mesh Shader Feature test (as spotted by VideoCardz).",
    "What exactly is being tested here isn\u2019t as exciting as the simple news that the Xe HPG is being fully put through its paces now, suggesting that development might be proceeding on track.",
    "You may recall that we\u2019re hopeful for a 2021 launch for this new graphics card, although chatter from the GPU grapevine has suggested that perhaps early 2022 could be more realistic. With testing now seemingly advancing nicely, perhaps the former potential launch timeframe looks a bit more likely. Fingers crossed.",
    "As for mesh shading, if that sounds familiar, then it\u2019s probably because you recall Nvidia introducing this for its Turing graphics cards (RTX 2000 models) back at the close of 2018. Essentially, it\u2019s a performance boosting technique to help with faster frame-rates without noticeable detriment to image quality (we explain more here, and Nvidia shares a neat demo too).",
    "Intel doesn\u2019t intend to make this heavyweight gaming GPU \u2013 which could rival Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 \u2013 itself, with production set to be outsourced to a third-party fab. If the rumor mill is right, it\u2019ll be TSMC\u2019s enhanced 7nm process which will be used for the card.",
    "Speculation also points to the use of GDDR6 video memory, and of course we already know that the GPU will support ray tracing, which is obviously a requirement in terms of standing a chance against Nvidia and AMD."
