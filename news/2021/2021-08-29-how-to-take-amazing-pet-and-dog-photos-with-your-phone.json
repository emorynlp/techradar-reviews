    "If you\u2019ve got a furry, feathered or scaled friend, then you\u2019ll probably already have taken enough snaps to fill your camera roll. But if you\u2019ve ever wondered how you can improve your pet shots or dog photos to give them a professional sheen, then we\u2019ve got some training treats for you.",
    "Using a smartphone to take pictures of dogs and pets makes a lot of sense. For starters, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll always have the former with you, so you can quickly react to whatever adorable thing your furry friend is getting up to. Phones are also small, light and unobtrusive, unlike bigger cameras which might make nervous pets a little anxious.",
    "Modern smartphones are also well-equipped to get great photos of your dog or pet. With various lenses available for different effects, you can have a lot of fun taking snaps, and it\u2019s a great way to bond with your pet, too. You\u2019ll probably find you use the \u2018main\u2019 lens most often, but an ultra wide-angle can create some fun and unusual effects, while a telephoto lens is ideal if you can\u2019t get super close to your pet to take the shot.",
    "That said, there\u2019s plenty of other ways you can improve your photography, so we asked several pros to provide some tips that can quickly boost your dog photos or pet snaps. Our pros are using a variety of phones, but you should find that all the tips work with whatever model you\u2019re using.",
    "Professional photographer Liz Gregg uses smartphones for lots of her imagery. She runs the hugely successful @blackwhite.gold Instagram account, formed after working on a shoot for Cosmopolitan magazine entitled \u2018How to Make Your Dog Instafamous\u2019. Currently, there\u2019s an exhibition of her work taking place at Herne Bay seafront in the UK.",
    "One of Liz\u2019s best and most creative tips for photographing is to use the advantages of your smartphone to create fantastic reflection photographs.",
    "\u201cReflections can really add to a photo. With the right light and background, they look kind of magical,\" she says. \"Stand your dog just at the other side of a puddle, or even in it. Then turn your phone upside down so the lens is at the lower edge of the phone. Place the phone as close to the reflective surface as possible - in the example here, it\u2019s a puddle,\" she adds.",
    "\"Because of the way smartphones are built, it means reflection photos taken with them are often better than those snapped with a standard camera, as you can get the lens totally next to the reflection, which is what gives that dreamy, pristine, mirror-like effect\u201d she says.",
    "What dog (or cat) doesn\u2019t like treats? You can turn your next photo session with your beloved pet into a game that you\u2019ll all enjoy by incorporating treat time into it.",
    "You might need some practice to get the best results, but with a bit of perseverance and patience, you should find that you get some truly eye-catching photos that will look fantastic on your Instagram page.",
    "It\u2019s something that Liz Gregg practices often with her own pet photography. \u201cA really fun way to take a photo of your dog is to do so while it\u2019s catching a treat. This requires a fast shutter speed, as the action is over in a split second,\" she says.",
    "\"If your camera phone has the option to select a shutter speed (something you\u2019ll find in Pro or Advanced modes of many Android phones, or via several advanced camera apps for iOS), start with 1/1000 second and, if there\u2019s still some blur, select an even faster speed,\" she says.",
    "\u201cIf your phone doesn\u2019t have that option, make sure you\u2019re taking the photo outside on a bright day so the phone will automatically select a fast speed. It takes practice to get the timing right \u2013 one hand to throw the treat, the other to take the photo \u2013 but it\u2019s worth the practice and I promise your dog will love it!\u201d she adds.",
    "Most recent smartphones have some sort of Portrait mode. While you\u2019re probably used to using this with people, it\u2019s also a great way to give your pet photography a boost.",
    "Depending on the model of your phone, you might find this is called Portrait, Aperture, Live Focus or similar. Essentially, what you\u2019re looking for is the opportunity to blur the background to recreate the look of using a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a portrait-style lens.",
    "It can take some experimenting to get the best results. Professional photographer Jet Lendon, who hung up her \u2018big\u2019 camera after 13 years to shoot exclusively with an iPhone, and who now runs workshops under the brand Jet Black Squares to help others do the same, has some good advice.",
    "\u201cDefinitely use \u2018Portrait\u2019 mode (or equivalent), but make sure you touch on the screen where your pet\u2019s eyes are as this is what you want to be in focus,\" she says. \"If you have a messy background, this works wonders in blurring it all away \u2013 but wherever possible, try and avoid messy distractions, moving to a cleaner or clearer position if you can\" she adds.",
    "A quick and easy way to instantly improve your pet photography is to get down to their level. Yes, sometimes this will mean that you\u2019re rolling around in dirt and mud \u2013 but your Instagram followers will surely reward you for it.",
    "By placing yourself, or at least your phone, at the same level as your dog, cat or other type of pet, you\u2019ll produce a much more natural and realistic result, and show off your pet in all their glory. Towering above them to take the shot can often result in strange and unflattering perspectives.",
    "If it\u2019s difficult to get down to their level, try to bring them up to yours. Steps and staircases are a great way to do this, but you could also try turning your phone upside down to give you a little bit of extra reach.",
    "You should also try not to worry too much about your pet posing perfectly for you. \u201cDon\u2019t panic if your pets refuse to look at you \u2013 natural shots are often the best, she says. \"Bribery works well as a last resort, try placing a treat or a favorite squeaky too just at the top of your phone and you should find you quickly grab their attention.\u201d",
    "Once you\u2019ve taken a snap, you can improve them even further by using some simple editing tricks directly on your phone.",
    "A popular app used by various photographers, including professionals, is Snapseed. Jo Bradford\u2019s latest book Smart Phone Smart Photo Editing (available to pre-order now) comes packed with all sorts of tips for using the app across a variety of subjects.",
    "For pets, she advises the following: \u201cColor can create a sort of blindness to the texture and tone of animals\u2019 fur and coats. Consider converting color images of your pets to black and white to achieve more detail and bring to the fore the full range of textures\", she says.",
    "\u201cHowever, if you choose to stick with color, use selective adjustments in apps such as Snapseed to brighten darker areas of their fur / coats, especially if your pet is darker colored\", she adds.",
    "\u201cAs with any portrait (human or animal), it is essential to get the eyes in focus, with catchlights an added bonus if you can capture them. You can also make eyes look brighter and sharper by using Snapseed\u2019s \u2018Selective\u2019 tool to brighten and structure them\u201d she says."
