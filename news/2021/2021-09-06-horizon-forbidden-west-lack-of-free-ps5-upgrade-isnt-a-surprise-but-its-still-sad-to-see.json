    "Update: Sony has announced that players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will now be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.",
    "In a statement on the PlayStation Blog, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan said: \"Thursday was to be a celebration of Horizon Forbidden West and the amazing team at Guerilla working to deliver it on February 18, 2022. However, it's abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in our pre-order kickoff missed the mark.\"",
    "Ryan goes on to add: \"Last year we made a commitment to deliver free upgrades for our cross-gen launch titles, which included Horizon Forbidden West. While the pandemic's profound impact pushed Forbidden West out of the launch window we initially envisioned, we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.\"",
    "In less positive news, Ryan also said: \"I also want to confirm today that moving forward, Playstation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles (newly releasing on PS4 & PS5) - both digital and physical - will offer a $10 USD digital upgrade option from PS4 to PS5. This will apply to the next God of War and Gran Turismo 7, and any other exclusive cross-gen PS4 & PS5 title published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.\"",
    "Original story: Horizon Forbidden West won\u2019t include a free PS5 upgrade if you buy the game on PS4, a move that shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to anyone at this point. And yet, that\u2019s exactly the type of reaction I\u2019ve seen taking the internet by storm since Sony made the announcement: a mix of frustration, surprise, and even disbelief.",
    "But why?",
    "I\u2019ve been banging this drum for a while now, but the PS5 isn\u2019t good value compared to Xbox Series X. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t a fantastic console, with a revolutionary controller and some truly fantastic games. But it seems like Sony can\u2019t help itself when it has an opportunity to wring the coffers of PlayStation consumers.",
    "We\u2019ve seen from the outset that Sony\u2019s generosity doesn\u2019t span very far when it comes to PS5. Whether it\u2019s the $70 / \u00a370 price tag for first-party exclusives, PS Now not including any PS5 games, not being able to use your existing DualShock 4 controllers (unless its to play PS4 games), or locking PS5 features behind Director\u2019s Cut re-releases, Sony\u2019s strategy of capitalizing on the allure of PS5 titles has been clear for quite some time.",
    "That\u2019s not to say Sony has been all bad, though. The PS Plus Collection lets subscribers download 20 games, and we\u2019ve seen some pleasing free 60fps updates to titles like Days Gone, God of War, The Last of Us 2, and most recently, Horizon: Zero Dawn. Sony\u2019s Play at Home initiative was also a nice touch.",
    "But now, whether Sony realizes it or not, it\u2019s actively punishing those who are unable to buy a PS5 by how it\u2019s handling Horizon Forbidden West\u2019s restrictive upgrade path.",
    "Picture this all too common scene: you\u2019re a PlayStation gamer, excited to jump into the next generation with PS5. Like thousands of others, though, you haven\u2019t been able to buy the elusive new console yet. So what do you do when Horizon Forbidden West comes out?",
    "If you buy the game on PS4 when it releases on February 18, 2022 for $60 / \u00a360, you\u2019ll get to enjoy Aloy\u2019s next adventure right away. Pick up a PS5 down the line, however, and you\u2019ll be stuck with the last-gen version of the game. No upgrade will be provided, so if you want to play the PS5 version of the game... well, be prepared to part with $70 / \u00a370 to do so. Ouch.",
    "But wait, there is a solution! On PlayStation\u2019s FAQ page for pre-ordering the game, Sony has provided a solution:",
    "\u201cTo access both the PS4 and PS5 versions of Horizon Forbidden West, you need to purchase the Digital Deluxe, Collector\u2019s or Regalla Editions. Dual entitlement does not apply to the Standard and Special Editions.\u201d",
    "The Horizon Forbidden West Digital Deluxe Edition costs $80 / \u00a380 but does come with a few extra bits and bobs \u2013 in-game resources pack, digital comic book etc. \u2013 which definitely isn\u2019t an attempt by Sony\u2019s to mask the fact it\u2019s asking for more money for something that could have been free.",
    "Horizon Forbidden West\u2019s lack of free upgrade isn\u2019t a good look for Sony, then, but it\u2019s even more ugly when you realize that Microsoft does the polar opposite when it comes to next-gen upgrades.",
    "Thanks to its Smart Delivery system, Microsoft grants players the Xbox Series X|S version of every title it releases for free. Xbox Smart Delivery detects if you\u2019re playing an Xbox One game on either Xbox Series X|S and automatically gives you the best version (for free).",
    "Already own Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Xbox One? There\u2019s a free upgrade waiting for you if you ever buy an Xbox Series X|S. Gears 5? Enjoy a free upgrade. Sea of Thieves? Arrgggh, ye guessed it, me hearties: a free upgrade.",
    "And what about games that haven\u2019t been released yet, like Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5? Well, if you were to purchase or play either of those titles on Xbox One, you\u2019ll be stunned to know that yes, those will be upgraded \u2013 for free \u2013 should you ever pick up an Xbox Series X|S down the line. They\u2019re also both on Xbox Game Pass from day one, so you won\u2019t have to spend $140 just to experience them either.",
    "Xbox Smart Delivery also grants you the last-gen versions of a game, too, so if you decide to hop on your aging Xbox One X and bought a game on Xbox Series X|S, you\u2019ll automatically be given the last-gen version too. Sounds completely fair and reasonable, right? Well, that\u2019s because it is.",
    "So should Sony be dragged over hot coals for its latest decision to charge for a PS5 upgrade? Well, not really, even if it is rather distasteful. Sony is only capitalizing on the ravenous demand for PlayStation 5, and its strategy must be paying dividends if the company is continuing to make the same decisions. But I can\u2019t subscribe to the idea of double-dipping or paying upgrade fees for games I already own.",
    "If there\u2019s one thing that has made this generation so enjoyable \u2013 for me, at least \u2013 it\u2019s been how developers have rewarded gamers with new and updated versions of titles that they may have already purchased. Yes, it\u2019s unprecedented compared to previous generations, but much like how PC gamers reap the rewards of upgrading their hardware with prettier games and better performance, it\u2019s been a long time coming in the console space.",
    "You could argue that Sony is clinging on to a model that is outdated and almost elitist when compared to Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Smart Delivery system. Is it fair that a fan of Horizon Zero Dawn be forced to pay $20 / \u00a320 more just to ensure that they won\u2019t be hit with a $70 / \u00a370 fee if they ever want to play the game on PS5? Absolutely not. Can Sony get away with it? Probably, though that doesn\u2019t mean it should.",
    "Unfortunately, it\u2019s likely that Sony will stick with this approach if Gran Turismo 7 and God of War: Ragnarok do indeed come to PS4 as well as PS5. And as long as PlayStation 5 consoles continue to be as hard to find as a needle in a haystack, you can bet that more consumers will be coerced into having to spend more than they actually should. Whether Sony is successful with this strategy depends on one thing, of course: if consumers take a stand against it, or not."
