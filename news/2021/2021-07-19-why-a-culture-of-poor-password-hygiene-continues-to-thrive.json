    "Passwords remain the number one form of authentication, even though they can leave an organization vulnerable to attacks if appropriate cybersecurity measures are not in place. They\u2019ve been around since the Internet was invented and are not likely to go away for years to come, despite the proliferation of \u2018passwordless\u2019 conversations generating some buzz.",
    "Currently, there are billions of passwords available on the Dark Web, aggregated through various attack methods from brute force to malware to phishing then used in password spraying and credential stuffing attacks. Such attacks are successful due to the fact that 65% of users reuse passwords, according to a 2019 Google study. So, it\u2019s really not a surprise that stolen or compromised credentials are one of the leading root causes of malicious attacks. In fact, according to IBM\u2019s 2020 Cost of a Data Breach report, one in five companies that suffered a malicious data breach was infiltrated due to stolen or compromised credentials.",
    "Passwords are oftentimes the sole key to unlock access to various applications, resources and sensitive data, yet we still see poor password hygiene leading to some pretty major data breaches.",
    "So, what does poor password hygiene mean? Essentially, these are the mistakes that leave the door wide open for attackers. And given that security is not top of mind for users, the onus falls on IT to ensure that they are enforcing password security with solutions that prevent users from:",
    "Even large organizations get this wrong. For context, several major breaches can be traced back to compromised passwords as the source of entry, including:",
    "Poor password hygiene persists primarily because it is not being recognized as a problem or realized as a potential threat. For instance, a common misconception is that attackers typically target large organizations. In contrast, attackers do in fact target SMBs and have increasingly since the pandemic due to the accelerated adoption rate of online applications and remote technologies that can be prone to misconfiguration while lacking secure access policies. According to Verizon\u2019s 2020 Data Breach Investigation report, SMBs experienced 417 incidents in 2020 with over half of those disclosing data.",
    "Another misconception is that organizations feel secure when using two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is a security measure and not a fail-safe. Additionally, passwords are still the first factor as such, the password \u2013 should be as secure as possible.",
    "With the majority of organizations globally utilizing Active Directory (AD), the perception that fine-grained password policy in AD is enough is common. However, it does not eliminate the use of compromised passwords or remove the use of weak password construction patterns. Another common feeling is that implementing and enforcing a robust password security policy will be complicated or create user friction.",
    "It\u2019s true that implementing a secure password policy can create user friction such as users forgetting their password because now they cannot use things like the word password or falling back to poor password construction patterns. Therefore, it\u2019s important to take the user experience into account to ensure the best security and user outcomes. The solution: remove the burden from the users and use technology instead.",
    "Many organizations turn to NIST for guidance on this front. NIST recommends:",
    "While recommendations provide a great starting point, it is essential to consider risk level. For instance, removing expiration guidelines can lead to a security gap as it takes organizations close to 300 days to identify a breach. So, if you\u2019re not comfortable with removing expiry or are regulated by PCI or CMMC or any other standard that requires expiry and complexity, then you should look for technical solutions that can reduce the poor password hygiene issues these can create.",
    "When looking to implement a secure password policy, it\u2019s important to consider the full password lifecycle from creation to reset/change. Therefore, solutions should:",
    "Passwords aren\u2019t going away any time soon - organizations simply do not have the infrastructure to support a passwordless ecosystem. Thus, it\u2019s important that all industry recommits to putting a progressive password security strategy in place."
