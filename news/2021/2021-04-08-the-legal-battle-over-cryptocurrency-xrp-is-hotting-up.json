    "Ripple has been handed a boost in its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the sale and classification of cryptocurrency XRP.",
    "A motion has been granted that will give Ripple access to internal SEC communications, which the firm hopes will reveal that XRP has previously been described in similar terms to Bitcoin and Ether, neither of which are the subject of an SEC lawsuit.",
    "According to the presiding judge, the ruling will allow Ripple to review SEC communications \u201cexpressing the agency\u2019s interpretation or views [on cryptocurrency]\u201d, but the company will not be given access to emails between SEC staff members.",
    "Mathew Solomon, a lawyer representing Ripple, claimed the ruling could represent \u201cgame over\u201d for the plaintiff. If able to confirm the SEC has at some point regarded XRP as a non-security, Ripple could argue that the cryptocurrency should fall outside the regulator\u2019s jurisdiction.",
    "The multiple years it took the SEC to file the lawsuit in the first place is also expected to be a focus of the Ripple legal team when reviewing the documentation.",
    "The SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple and its executives in December, blindsiding the company and sending the price of XRP tumbling. The regulator alleged that the sale of XRP to individual investors amounted to a violation of federal securities law.",
    "\u201cOver a years-long unregistered offering of securities, Ripple was able to raise at least $1.38 billion by selling XRP without providing the type of financial and managerial information typically provided in registration statements and subsequent periodic and current filings,\u201d wrote the SEC.",
    "The case hinges on the classification of XRP as a security (i.e. a financial asset from which the investor intends to profit), as opposed to a currency or medium of exchange. By failing to file a securities registration statement or seek special exemption, Ripple violated multiple sections of the Securities Act of 1933, the official complaint contends.",
    "Ripple, for its part, maintains that XRP should not be classified as a security. In an official riposte published after the lawsuit was first served, the company stated that \u201cthe SEC\u2019s theory, that XRP is an investment contract, is wrong on the facts, the law and the equities\u201d.",
    "With access to new evidence, Ripple will hope to put this ongoing debate to rest once and for all, and in doing so provide an important reference point for future cryptocurrency startups.",
