    "The best audio PCs boast more than sheer power to run Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software. As essential tools for music producers and musicians, these computers can be rather demanding when it comes to specs. So it\u2019s true that every audio PCs has to have enough power to run DAW software like Image-Line FL Studio, PreSonus Studio One and Cubase without a hitch - no matter how many tracks you're working on.",
    "Still, the best audio PCs and laptops need to have more than just cutting edge components. They should also be able to allow you to plug in multiple musical instruments, have a large enough hard drive to store your projects and uncompressed audio files, and have top-notch onboard audio quality \u2013 not to mention the ability to plug into external speakers and monitors.",

    "The new iMacs are not just an improvement over their 21.5-inch predecessor externally, touting a fresh new face that comes in several different colors. They also come with fresh new specs, rocking Apple\u2019s new M1 chip that makes it much more powerful than the previous Intel iMacs. In fact, we\u2019d go as far as to say that the new iMac (24-inch, 2021) is the best and most efficient all-in-one PC we\u2019ve ever tested, making it the best audio PC right now. It\u2019s not the most affordable, but you\u2019ll be happy to know that you are getting great value here, as you\u2019re getting the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse included \u2013 in matching colors, we might add.",

    "The MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) may not have gotten a massive design overhaul, but what it lacks in that department, it makes up for in performance and battery life. Thanks to Apple\u2019s groundbreaking M1 chip, the new MacBook Pro 13-inch delivers excellent performance and exceptional battery life. Its performance is so impressive, in fact, that it can easily handle 4K - and even 8K - videos \u2013 let alone music production. If you\u2019re looking for a powerful yet portable PC for making music, this is the best audio PC money can buy.",

    "One of Apple\u2019s biggest surprises of the year is the update to its smallest Mac. The brand-new Mac mini now touts Apple\u2019s M1 chip, while keeping things the same in its much-loved design. It\u2019s more powerful than ever \u2013 with performance powerful enough for music production and even 8K video editing, thanks to this new chip. That\u2019s while still keeping its title as the cheapest Mac ever \u2013 terrific news for budget-minded musicians and music producers.",

    "Not that you need one of the most powerful laptops in existence for making music, but if you do want it, the Razer Blade 15 Studio Edition will no doubt take your breath away thanks to its sheer power and stunning display. This is a mobile workstation that can compete with even the most powerful desktop PCs and is worthy of the most complex tasks like 3D animation and video editing, let alone music production. The steep price is just as breathtaking, however, so only invest if you really want that much firepower and can afford it.",

    "The Surface Studio 2 is a great alternative to Apple's iMacs, and if you'd rather use Windows 10 over macOS, then this all-in-one from Microsoft is an excellent choice. Sleek, stylish and capable of handling DAW software with ease, along with a bright and vibrant built-in display, this is an excellent audio PC that would look great in anyone's studio.",
    "It's not quite as powerful as the latest iMac, however, so if you want pure power, go for Apple's all-in-one. Still, this is an excellent performer, that's ideal for creatives.",

    "The formidable Acer ConceptD 7 is capable of handling complex and demanding tasks such as audio production. Clearly designed specifically with creative professionals in mind, it boasts that sheer power you\u2019ll only find in workstations and gaming laptops.",
    "Beyond that excellent performance it delivers, it also offers decent port selection, a minimalist solid white design and that stunning Pantone-validated 4K IPS display. Obviously, it\u2019s still pretty pricey, but no professional\u2019s tool comes cheap. If you\u2019re looking for a Windows-powered MacBook alternative for audio production, this is a fantastic choice.",

    "Lenovo\u2019s latest all-in-one offering isn\u2019t as powerful as Apple\u2019s premium AIO, the iMac Pro, or even the recently updated iMac, which now offers a 9th-generation Intel Core configuration. After all, the 8th-generation chips and Radeon RX 560 graphics are aging at this point.",
    "However, it is still plenty powerful to meet the needs of creative professionals out there who are not entirely impressed by Apple\u2019s pricey machines. On top of that, the Lenovo Yoga A940 has a few aces up its sleeves, including 100% Adobe RGB support and Dolby Vision, a set of Dolby Atmos speakers, a port offering that\u2019s more generous than Apple\u2019s all-in-one, and a stylus included in the box.",

    "Professionals and creatives need something that can handle any workload they can possibly throw at it. If you\u2019re one such user, the iMac Pro isn\u2019t just one of the best Macs for you; it\u2019s the only Mac to consider.",
    "Not only does it have a vibrant 27-inch 5K display with a P3 wide color gamut, but it also boasts some of the most powerful hardware Apple could get its hands on. It\u2019s extremely expensive though, so it\u2019s really only meant for folks who have deep pockets and need that unbridled power to get through their daily workloads.",
