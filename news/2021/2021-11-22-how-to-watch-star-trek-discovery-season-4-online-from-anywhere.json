    "Great news! Sonequa Martin-Green is back as Captain Michael Burnham, navigating the USS Discovery through deep space alongside Cleveland Booker, the Kelpien Saru, Lieutenant Sylvia Tilly, and Chief Medical Officer Culber. But this time they face a phenomenon called \u201cthe anomaly\u201d that might just wipe out the entire galaxy. No biggie, then. Read on as we explain how to watch Star Trek: Discovery season 4 online now with a subscription to Paramount Plus in the US.",
    "Although set in the 32nd century, season 4 of Discovery is definitely a product of its time. We\u2019ll find Captain Michael Burnham facing a threat of unknown origin that endangers the lives of billions of people (cough cough *Covid* cough cough). It\u2019ll require more derring-do from our impetuous captain than we\u2019ve seen derring-done before.",
    "But galactic annihilation can\u2019t be prevented by the Discovery alone. The Federation President (played here by actress Chelah Horsdal) will be requesting co-operation from the leaders of the United Federation of Planets. And, excitingly for Trekkies, that means seeing Orions, Tellurites, Ferengi, Vulcans and more working together to prevent total annihilation \u2013 well, that\u2019s the theory anyway.",
    "It\u2019s going to be epic and its going to be emotional. So, get ready to head into the eye of the galaxy with our guide for how to watch Star Trek: Discovery season 4 online from anywhere now.",
    "If you\u2019ve left the galaxy \u2013 or are even just travelling to another country \u2013 when Star Trek: Discovery season 4 lands, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the thrilling new series due to annoying regional restrictions.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream Star Trek: Discovery season 4 online no matter where you are. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Star Trek: Discovery from abroad",
    "It's not good news for those in the UK. While Brits could once watch Star Trek: Discovery on Netflix, Paramount Plus has exclusive rights in every region, resulting in Star: Trek being pulled from international Netflix libraries days before season 4 premiered across the Atlantic.",
    "While Paramount Plus is planning to be rolled out in Europe and other markets next year in 2022, there's no solid date on exactly when that might be, leaving Trekkies to twiddle their thumbs and wait.",
    "If you\u2019re planning on a winter break abroad in the UK but don\u2019t want to miss all-new Discovery, don\u2019t fear. Purchasing a VPN means you can connect to your streaming service from absolutely anywhere. Impressive, right?"
