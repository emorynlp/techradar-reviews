  "article": [
    "Tony Fadell, inventor of the Apple iPod and smart thermostat Nest, has said he believes too many companies approach product design with the wrong priorities.",
    "During a panel at Slush 2021, attended by TechRadar Pro, Fadell explained he thinks even some of the brightest entrepreneurs lack the sense of timing necessary to build truly iconic products.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s vital to understand what people need, or will need. You\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re solving a problem that people are just beginning to have,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s no good coming in two decades early, even if the technology is there. People need to understand the problems you\u2019re trying to solve.\u201d",
    "Fadell says his advice for budding founders is to \u201cstop trying to create something that impresses the engineers\u201d, and to focus instead on creating something that \u201cgives super powers to every person\u201d.",
    "Fadell also used the startup conference, which was live again in Helsinki after a one-year hiatus, to unveil his latest project: a manual for the next generation of product designers, called Build.",
    "Although precious little was revealed about the book itself, which won\u2019t hit the shelves until May 2022, it was presented as \u201can unorthodox guide to making things worth making\u201d that will help entrepreneurs take the big leaps necessary to bring about dramatic change.",
    "\u201cOver the years, working with all these entrepreneurs, I\u2019ve realized something: the only reason I'm on this stage is because someone helped me to get here. They mentored and believed in me,\u201d said Fadell.",
    "\"But a lot of my mentors have now passed away, so that baton of mentorship has been passed from them to me. The only way I can give back is to give back to the [startup] community.\u201d",
    "Another way in which Fadell will endeavor to support up-and-coming talent is by taking calculated risks on emerging deep tech companies, via his venture capital firm Future Shape.",
    "The investment house specializes in startups that are tackling difficult technical problems that most VCs won\u2019t go near, Fadell explained - and it\u2019s looking to add to its 200-strong portfolio. Presumably, though, Fadell is only interested in founders that can demonstrate that all-important sense of timing."
