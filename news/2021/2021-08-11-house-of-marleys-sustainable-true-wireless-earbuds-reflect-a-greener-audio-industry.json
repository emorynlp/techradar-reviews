    "When it comes to sustainability, technology must play its part in reducing humanity\u2019s impact on the environment \u2013 whether that\u2019s through the TVs we watch, the consoles we play or the earbuds we listen with.",
    "In our recent guide to the future of sustainable sound, we detailed the ways in which audio companies \u2013 from big names like Sony to smaller brands like Grado and Focal \u2013 are changing their manufacturing, distribution and marketing processes to align themselves with this changing tide.",
    "Among those companies is House of Marley, an audiomaker more committed than most to using sustainable materials across its range of speakers, headphones, turntables and accessories. Unsurprisingly, that philosophy endures with the launch of the brand\u2019s new true wireless offering, the Rebel earbuds.",
    "An expansion of its TWS (true wireless stereo) collection, the Rebel earbuds are designed using a combination of bamboo, natural wood fibre composite and recycled plastics. They\u2019re packaging, too, is 100% recyclable.",
    "Being a brand so closely associated with music legend Bob Marley (and his grandson, Skip Marley, who collaborated with the company on these new earbuds), House of Marley\u2019s Rebel earbuds pack a compelling range of audio specs, as well as green credentials.",
    "Those specs include swappable EQs (Signature and Bass Boost), echo noise cancellation for improved call performance, and eight hours of on-board battery life (jumping to more than 30 hours when paired with their wireless charging case).",
    "They won\u2019t break the bank, either. The black pair are available now for $129.99 / \u00a399.99 (which is around $AU185, when they land in Australia), with a cream color to follow in the coming months.",
    "House of Marley isn\u2019t the only audio brand looking towards a greener future.",
    "Many major tech companies now have long-term sustainability goals, like becoming carbon neutral within a decade (Apple) or creating products using more recycled materials (Sony).",
    "Most interestingly, some companies are working on ways to ditch power-guzzling batteries. Urbanista\u2019s Los Angeles headphones, for example, are solar-powered, and could mark a bold frontier for the future of audio products if they can deliver a stellar audio performance while promoting alternative power sources.",
    "Then there are the schemes in place to aid the conscience of the consumer. Apple\u2019s trade-in scheme, for one, allows customers to return old devices in exchange for credit towards their next purchase \u2013 which proves sustainability can play into profitable business models, too.",
    "All of these small steps represent larger strides towards a future free of excessive audio-based waste \u2013 companies like House of Marley were simply ahead of the curve."
