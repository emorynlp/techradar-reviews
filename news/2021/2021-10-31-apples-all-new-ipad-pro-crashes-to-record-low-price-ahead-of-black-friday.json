    "If you're looking to snag an early Black Friday Apple deal, then you're in luck. We've just spotted Apple's powerful iPad Pro on sale for $699.99 at Amazon when you apply the additional $50 savings at checkout. That's a massive $100 discount and the lowest price we've seen for the 2021 tablet. Apple's 11-inch tablet has only dropped to this price once before, and we typically don't see discounts like this until the official Black Friday 2021 sale. Early Black Friday Apple deals like this usually don't stick around for long, and the additional savings from Amazon is a limited-time offer, so we recommend snagging this bargain now before it's too late.",
    "Apple's 2021 iPad Pro features a stunning 11-inch Liquid Retina display, an ultra-wide front-facing camera, and an impressive speaker system. Perfect for students, the lightweight iPad Pro delivers more power than most laptops by offering Apple's M1 chipset and 128GB of storage. You're also getting Face ID for secure authentication, Apple Pay, and an all-day battery life.",
