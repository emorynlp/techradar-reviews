    "Modern Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems are taking the business world by storm. Nowadays, upgrading your phone system and adding more terminals is as simple as ensuring you have an internet connection and a compatible device. This represents huge cost savings compared to traditional business phone systems, making VoIP the logical choice for many.",
    "We\u2019ve spent countless hours scouring the web for the best VoIP service providers, and VoDaVi is a company that stood out. It offers a range of technical services, with powerful custom solutions for businesses of all shapes and sizes.",
    "In the rest of this VoDaVi VoIP evaluation, we take a close look at the services on offer and what you can expect if you decide to use this company.",
    "Unfortunately, VoDaVi doesn\u2019t provide pricing information on its website or anywhere else online, which is slightly frustrating. However, it\u2019s safe to assume that the company provides custom solutions for each business it works with, which is very important if you\u2019re looking to get the most out of your VoIP system.",
    "One thing that VoDaVi does market heavily is its free consultation service. With this, there\u2019s absolutely no harm in speaking with the sales team and discussing your options. To find out more about how much this company\u2019s services are likely to cost your business, we\u2019d recommend reaching out to the team for a custom quote.",
    "VoDaVi gives little information about exactly its services work, but given it is a managed VoIP service provider, we can assume that the company takes care of every aspect of the installation and ongoing maintenance processes. To get started, you will need to reach out to the sales team for a free consultation.",
    "If you decide to move ahead, the VoDaVi team will work with you to develop the best VoIP solutions for your business. Additional infrastructure will be installed if required, and the company\u2019s tech team will help you get your communications systems up and running as soon as possible.",
    "Although VoDaVi doesn\u2019t provide a huge amount of information about its VoIP solutions, some very attractive features still stand out.",
    "One of our favorite things about VoDaVi\u2019s service is its advanced VoIP security integrations. It uses a powerful firewall to prevent unauthorized traffic from accessing your computer, along with advanced data encryption to protect sensitive transmissions. In reality, this is crucial, especially if you\u2019re regularly sending or discussing sensitive information over the web.",
    "Another thing that stood out about VoDaVi\u2019s managed VoIP services was its 24/7 emergency support. In short, the team is available to identify and deal with problems immediately when they occur, helping you minimize downtime and allowing you to keep your business running normally as much as possible.",
    "If you do decide to use one of VoDaVi\u2019s VoIP solutions, you will benefit from industry-leading, fully managed services. In short, this means that the company will take care of everything from setting up your VoIP system to ensuring things continue to run smoothly over time.",
    "Since VoDaVi provides physical VoIP solutions across its service region, its online support services are a little limited. You can reach out to the customer service team through the online contact form or via phone.",
    "Meanwhile, VoDaVi is quite active across Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, which means you should be able to get in contact with a company representative through any of these streams. Unfortunately, though, there are very limited self-help resources available. We can only assume that this is because VoDaVi provides fully managed telecoms solutions, which are designed to minimize the effort required on your part.",
    "In terms of post-sales customer care, there is little information available. That said, the Facebook and Google reviews we found all gave VoDaVi a rating of five out of five stars, which is excellent. After all, it\u2019s important to use a managed VoIP service provider who actually cares about its clients.",
    "VoDaVi appears to offer high-quality managed VoIP solutions, but we\u2019d like to see some more specifics on its website. You might choose to consider one of the following alternatives instead.",
    "RingCentral is a powerful VoIP service provider offering a range of solutions for businesses of all sizes. Its cloud-based platform provides standard VoIP services, as well as video calling, messaging, online fax, and much, much more. Prices start from $19.99 per user, per month, which is quite affordable compared to many similar providers.",
    "Another great option is Dialpad, which provides a range of solutions designed for small businesses. Its VoIP services start from $15 per month, which provides unlimited calls across the US and Canada, HD video calling, and a huge range of other advanced features.",
    "VoDaVi does receive excellent five-star ratings in the customer reviews we could find. Its managed VoIP solutions are likely a great option for businesses without the time or technical knowledge to take care of their own voice networks, and it\u2019s backed by an excellent track record and years of experience."
