    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 is finally available in the US as a rugged tablet that\u2019s tough enough with new features and specs suited for workplaces that might be a little more rugged than .",
    "The Galaxy Tab Active 3, which was released in other regions late in 2020, is a take on the 8-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet, though it has some differences. Most notably, the Active 3 has three physical buttons on the front \u2013 easier to press when wearing gloves or in harsher weather conditions \u2013 and a removable 5,050mAh battery that\u2019s accessible via the backplate.",
    "That backplate is attached to a hardened case-like exterior (which Samsung calls an \u2018Inbox Cover\u2019), which has hardened edges and a slot at the top of the phone, which houses a dust- and water-resistant version of Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus. The right side has the rest of the tablet\u2019s buttons: a power button, volume rocker button, and an \u2018Active Key\u2019 for instant access to the most-used apps or programs.",
    "The Active 3 has an 8-inch PLS TFT LCD with Full HD (1920 x 1200) resolution with a 16:10 ratio. There\u2019s a 13MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing camera, with a microSD slot for a single SIM. The battery can be removed for use mounted in a vehicle.",
    "You\u2019ll be paying a bit of a steep price for the Active 3: $489 (around \u00a3358 / AU$633) for the WiFi-only version and $589 / \u00a3539 (around AU$763) for the LTE version. That\u2019s a noticeably higher cost than the Tab A, which costs $329 / \u00a3249 (about AU$470) for WiFi-only and the LTE version costs $419 / \u00a3299 (about AU$600)."
