    "Last year, we did something we\u2019d never done before \u2013 put an Apple Macbook (the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) to be precise) at the top of our best laptops list.",
    "To be honest, I was as surprised as anyone by how much I loved Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air. I\u2019ve always preferred Windows devices for my personal use. Not necessarily because Windows 10 is better than macOS \u2013 though I prefer how more open Microsoft\u2019s operating system is (despite Microsoft\u2019s best efforts sometimes) \u2013 but because I\u2019ve been using Windows machines since Windows 3.1. I know how it works, and when something breaks, which it can often do, I usually know how to fix it.",
    "But, all of a sudden, a MacBook had become my favorite laptop \u2013 and not just while I was reviewing it, I was choosing to use it as my day-to-day device as well. It answered so many of my issues with Windows 10 laptops. For a start, macOS worked like a charm, and pretty much any app I used on Windows I could run in Big Sur \u2013 even if the app hadn\u2019t yet got a native M1 version.",
    "I\u2019ve gone on about how impressed I am by Apple\u2019s Rosetta 2 tech before, which allows older Mac apps designed for Intel hardware to run pretty much flawlessly on the new M1 hardware made by Apple. Unlike with the Windows 10 on Snapdragon devices, which greatly limited the amount of apps you could run on ARM-based hardware, Apple\u2019s own ARM-based MacBooks could run pretty much any app you wanted.",
    "I also loved the fanless design of the new MacBook Air. Going back to Windows 10 laptops that fire up fans whenever they do something even remotely difficult, was a real bummer. I want all my laptops to be silent from now on.",
    "The biggest issue, though, that the MacBook Air addressed was battery life. Not only did it last for ages on a single charge \u2013 to be fair, Windows 10 laptops are getting better at that \u2013 but it keeps its charge when not in use.",
    "I\u2019m sick of picking up a Windows 10 laptop after a few days and finding the battery dead. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I stopped using a Dell XPS 13 and used the Pixelbook Go Chromebook instead.",
    "Spec (and price wise) there\u2019s no comparison \u2013 the XPS 13 should destroy the Pixelbook Go. But I fell in love with the Chromebook. It did most of the things I needed it to, though I did have to look for a few Chrome OS/Android alternatives, its keyboard is a joy to type on, and once again, the battery life is brilliant.",
    "When you want something to quickly pick up and type on, the fact that I could do that with the MacBook Air and Pixelbook Go was great. When I\u2019d tried to do it with the XPS 13 \u2013 and other Windows 10 laptops \u2013 more often than not, I\u2019d find the battery was dead, so I\u2019d have to root around for the power cable and plug it in.",
    "Now, in the grand scheme of things, that\u2019s not the biggest hardship in the world, but Chromebooks and MacBooks have shown me there\u2019s another way \u2013 and it\u2019s meant I haven\u2019t want to go back to using a Windows 10 laptop.",
    "Now, you might be thinking \u2018what about gaming?\u2019 MacBooks and Chromebooks are all well and good for day-to-day use, but cannot compete with Windows 10 machines. That\u2019s certainly true, but here\u2019s the thing \u2013 I don\u2019t game on laptops.",
    "I\u2019m firmly a desktop PC gamer, and on that front I\u2019ll likely never leave Windows. While Mac and Linux game libraries are growing (the latter especially due to Valve\u2019s commitment to Linux gaming), they simply do not offer the sheer breadth that Windows does when it comes to games. So, yeah, on my desktop you\u2019re not going to get me off Windows 10 any time soon.",
    "So, is my falling out of love with Windows 10 laptops terminal? Will I never want to go back? Actually, no \u2013 and a lot of it is due to Intel.",
    "After a year where the company saw its competitor AMD go from strength to strength and continue to eat into its market share, along with Apple\u2019s high profile decision to stop using Intel chips and instead make its own (very good) ARM-based M1 chip, you may be surprised by my view that Intel could be the savior of Windows 10 laptops \u2013 but hear me out.",
    "For a start, in the recent CES 2021 tech show, Intel\u2019s presentation was the one that really impressed me with its vision of the future of laptops. Its 11th generation Tiger Lake-H35 processors in particular look like they could really deliver on the promise of thin and light laptops that are also incredibly powerful.",
    "I\u2019ve also really been liking what I\u2019ve been hearing about the Intel Evo platform. Like the Ultrabooks that came before, Intel Evo is a list of specifications that Intel thinks represents the next evolutionary leap in laptops.",
    "To be classified as an Intel Evo laptop, the device needs to offer incredibly fast Windows 10 boot up times, thin and light designs and over nine hours of battery life \u2013 while also being powered by Intel 11th gen chips. The specifications for Intel Evo laptops address a number of my biggest complaints with Windows 10 laptops, and I\u2019ve already tried a few out \u2013 the HP Spectre x360 (2021), for example, which is a brilliant laptop.",
    "I\u2019ve also had several conversations with Intel, and each time I\u2019ve noticed the clear excitement and enthusiasm it has for Intel Evo and what it means for upcoming laptops. It\u2019s hard to come away from those conversations without feeling a similar level of enthusiasm.",
    "Pretty much all of the biggest names in laptops are making Intel Evo devices, including HP, Dell and Lenovo, and that\u2019s one of the strengths of Windows 10 laptops.",
    "With MacBooks, there\u2019s only one company making them, and so far, Apple seems reluctant to make any bold innovations when it comes to the designs of its laptops. While I love the new MacBook Air, it looks and feels like a MacBook Air released several years ago. There\u2019s no touchscreen or 2-in-1 options, and the design is beginning to feel decidedly outdated, especially when compared to the slick and stylish Windows 10 laptops coming out.",
    "So, while I\u2019m sticking to my trusted Pixelbook Go for the time being \u2013 and have yet to find a laptop to replace the M1 MacBook Air in my affections, I\u2019m most excited about the Windows 10 laptops that are coming out this year. I have a strong feeling I\u2019ll be returning to Windows 10 sooner rather than later."
