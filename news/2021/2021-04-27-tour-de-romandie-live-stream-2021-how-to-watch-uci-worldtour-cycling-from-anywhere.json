    "We're up in the hills and mountains of western Switzerland for the Tour de Romandie, two years after Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d rode to victory in the last edition of the race. As the final stage race of the UCI World Tour before the Giro d'Italia in May, it's the perfect opportunity for the riders to tune up and measure themselves against their rivals. So join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Tour de Romandie live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online wherever you are in the world.",
    "Last year's Tour de Romandie was one of the many races that fell victim to the pandemic, which means 2019 winner Rogli\u010d is still the reigning champion. The Slovenian also won the 2018 edition, but he won't be in Romandie to defend his crown.",
    "Instead, the big names on the start list include Steven Kruijwsijk (Team Jumbo-Visma), Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers), Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe), and Miguel \u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez (Movistar).",
    "The opening and closing stages are both individual time trials, with the first measuring little over 4km, which can only mean one thing - a gruelling 8% climb to finish.",
    "Stages 2 (2,262-metre elevation gain), 4 (4,157-metre elevation gain) and 5 (an individual time trial featuring several steep legs and an uphill finish), meanwhile, look especially cruel. Read on for everything you need to know to watch a 2021 Tour de Romandie live stream from anywhere in the world today.",
    "Best of all, there are a couple of ways to watch a FREE Tour de Romandie live stream, but prepare to dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book.",
    "Anyone in Belgium can tune in for free on Sporza, and cycling fans in France can get the race on L'Equipe TV.",
    "If you're a resident of Belgium or France and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage as explained in more detail below..",
    "As discussed above, if you're desperate to watch the Tour de Romandie but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
