    "If you don't want to be restricted to public WiFi when using your tablet out on the road, you'll want to take a look at this week's cellular iPad Pro deals. With some of the lowest prices ever on these flexible and powerful devices, you're often only paying a little more than you would for WiFi only versions - and getting plenty of extra functionality in there as well.",
    "These iPad Pro deals are mostly hitting the 12.9-inch model, with the 128GB version coming in at a record low $1,079.99 (was $1,149) - that's around $140 more than the WiFi version (currently on sale for $929 down from $999). If you know you're going to be on the move with work a lot more in the coming months, then, it's well worth taking a look at the extra features available on the cellular model.",
    "However, if you think you'll need more storage, you'll find $100 discounts on both the 256GB and 512GB models right now as well.",
    "That's excellent news whether you plan on taking out a separate data contract or not - you certainly don't need a SIM to run these tablets as usual, but the option is always there. If you're happy to stick with WiFi, though, we're seeing some excellent discounts on standard tablets as well - with prices starting at just $749 this week.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more cheap iPad Pro prices in your region.",
    "The iPad Pro runs on Apple's own operating system, so if you're in need of a Windows machine you might want to check out the latest Surface Pro deals instead. If you're after something a little smaller, it's worth checking out the latest iPad Mini deals for a far cheaper tablet. Or, if you're looking to spend as little as possible, we're also rounding up all the best cheap Android tablets as well."
