  "article": [
    "LG has announced the latest update to its LG Tone Free earbud lineup: the FP9 and FP8 true wireless earbuds. Both models offer noise cancellation thanks to three microphones in each earbud, good sound quality and a few handy new features.",
    "Headphone Spatial Processing comes courtesy of Meridian Audio, which brings a surround sound-like experience to your ears. You\u2019ll find this tech in other LG earbuds, but with larger drivers and 3D Sound Stage in the FP9 and FP8, both audio quality and immersion should be notably improved. (This is a welcome upgrade considering we didn't rate the LG Tone Free HBS-FN6 for sound quality.)",
    "Both the FP9 and FP8 have a \u2018whisper mode\u2019, which turns the right earbud into a mic so you can whisper into it when you\u2019re in a public space to give you a bit more privacy without compromising on call quality.",
    "The Tone Free FP9 boasts a new Plug & Wireless feature, which allows you to pair almost any device with the earbuds, even if there\u2019s no Bluetooth on-board.",
    "The feature works thanks to a USB-C to AUX cable that connects whatever device you want to listen from \u2013 whether that\u2019s a phone, games console, PC, etc \u2013 to the FP9\u2019s accompanying charging case. The case then becomes a wireless dongle making up for any device that lacks Bluetooth connectivity \u2013 a helpful feature on flights.",
    "There are naturally a lot of true wireless earbuds on the market these days, from the Apple AirPods to the Cambridge Melomania 1, so the question for you is whether LG offers something different \u2013 or at least a promising selection of features at a reasonable price.",
    "The earbuds are both IPX4 rated, so they\u2019re fine for sweaty workouts and light rain showers, and LG promises a more comfortable fit for active lifestyles. This suggests they\u2019re designed for all-day wear, but could be a good choice if you're looking for a new pair of fitness headphones, too.",
    "The FP9 and FP8 come with one of LG\u2019s new UVnano cases, which cleans the buds as they charge up with UV light. A cleaning case might not seem like a top priority, but a lot of bacteria we\u2019d rather not think about can collect on your earbuds \u2013 especially if you use them 24/7 and take them to the gym.",
    "You\u2019ll get 24 hours of battery life from both models with the charging case, and a quick charging feature means five minutes in the case equates to around an extra hour of listening.",
    "We\u2019ll update this article with prices as soon as they\u2019re confirmed, but if LG can undercut more premium models, while improving on the performance of past Tone Free earbuds, these new iterations may well be worth checking out.",
    "The LG Tone Free FP9 and FP8 earbuds will be available from July 2021 in black, white and gold."
