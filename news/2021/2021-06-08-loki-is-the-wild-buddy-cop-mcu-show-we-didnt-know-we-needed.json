  "summary": "We\u2019ve seen Loki\u2019s first two episodes \u2013 here\u2019s our spoiler-free review",
  "article": [
    "Remember when the MCU had a villain problem? As good as Marvel\u2019s Phase 1 and 2 movies are, the lack of investable antagonists (or ones who weren\u2019t carbon copies of each film\u2019s heroes) was a regular criticism that many fans and critics had.",
    "Marvel Studios fixed this issue with its Phase 3 offerings \u2013 Eric Killmonger and Thanos are two such examples \u2013 but there was one villain that Marvel did get right in its earlier MCU projects: Loki.",
    "Now, a decade after Tom Hiddleston\u2019s debut as the God of Mischief in 2011\u2019s Thor (and after his Avengers: Infinity War death), Loki is back and, this time, he\u2019s taking center stage.",
    "Loki will star in his own MCU TV show when it launches on Disney Plus on June 9 \u2013 and, frankly, after seeing the first two episodes, we think it\u2019s the best (and most important) Marvel TV series yet.",
    "Loki picks up straight after Avengers: Endgame. As a result of the Avengers\u2019 slightly botched time travel heist in Endgame, the 2012 version of Loki (Hiddleston) has escaped with the Tesseract and prepares to concoct a new plan to conquer Earth.",
    "Or so he thinks. Loki is immediately detained by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), a bureaucratic organization that oversees every timeline in the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse (MCM), for removing the Tesseract from its proper point in time.",
    "Charged with disrupting the Sacred Timeline (the MCM\u2019s main timeline as decreed by the Time Keepers), Loki is labeled a \u201ctime variant\u201d and looks set to be deleted from existence. That is, until Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) offers him a way out: help the TVA track down a greater threat to the timeline and his sentence may not be so extreme.",
    "From the outset, it\u2019s clear that Hiddleston relished the opportunity to revisit 2012-era Loki and dig into the many facets that make up his complex character. Loki\u2019s pre-Thor: The Dark World persona is back at its brazen best and it\u2019s fun to see Hiddleston dive back into that side of Loki once more, even if the character\u2019s ego takes a humorous beating from the TVA\u2019s unperturbed workforce.",
    "It\u2019s this clashing of Loki\u2019s cocky attitude with the TVA\u2019s unflappable employees that makes for many humorous moments early on, too. There are slapstick incidents aplenty, but the verbal sparring between Loki and Mobius, in particular, is a highlight. It plays out like a chess match as the pair strategically try to outmaneuver each other and, just as equally, sets the stage for the duo\u2019s burgeoning bromance-style relationship to come.",
    "In truth, it\u2019s pleasing to see Marvel\u2019s signature humor make a return. Enjoyable as WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier were, both were somewhat lacking in the comedy stakes. In contrast (largely thanks to Hiddleston\u2019s performance), Marvel\u2019s latest series unleashes its humor from the get-go, and it\u2019s all the better for it.",
    "That isn\u2019t to say that the series trades heartfelt drama for comedy. Loki is a tragic character, and seeing his arrogant facade stripped away by Mobius during the first episode is surprisingly heart wrenching. This is a villain-turned-antihero who believes he\u2019s destined for greatness but, through Mobius\u2019 psychoanalysis, has his sense of identity challenged and deep-seated trauma brought to the surface.",
    "It\u2019s tough to watch, particularly when Mobius uses MCU flashbacks and flash-forwards to stick the knife in, but it feels necessary. Audiences want a lead character they can invest in and, though charismatic as Loki is, leaning into his vulnerable side is a solid way for the show\u2019s writing team to get viewers on side and root for him to succeed.",
    "Speaking of Mobius, Wilson is on top form here. Loki is the actor\u2019s first major TV role, but it feels like it was tailor made for him, with his soft-but-stern approach to Mobius key to keeping Loki in line (or at least trying to anyway). Wilson and Hiddleston\u2019s chemistry is natural and buddy cop-esque without coming across as trite, too, and seems like it\u2019ll be central to the show\u2019s overarching plot.",
    "Add in strong performances from other cast members \u2013 Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Wunmi Mosaku are scene stealers as Ravonna Renslayer and Hunter B-15 respectively \u2013 and there isn\u2019t a weak link to be seen.",
    "Production wise, Loki is as visually impressive as any preceding Marvel TV project. Its retro modern sci-fi aesthetic, especially where the TVA is concerned, is not only an homage to sci-fi movies like Brazil and Metropolis, but also helps Loki\u2019s TV series to feel unique in the realm of the MCU.",
    "That distinctive approach to Loki is evident through its genre-spanning plot, too.",
    "Marvel has developed a knack for incorporating various genres into its many productions, and the same is true here. Loki may be comedy-centric to begin with, but it soon veers into other genre territories including mystery thriller, crime drama and trippy space opera.",
    "The seamless transition between these isn\u2019t novel for Marvel but, here, it works extremely well. Each genre switch feels organic, and there are shades of Doctor Who, Se7en, Blade Runner, Men in Black and even horror films like Alien within Loki\u2019s plot and multiple settings.",
    "Like WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier before it, Loki is pretty devoid of action sequences in its opening act \u2013 but that\u2019s a good thing. Combat-heavy moments are certain to come but, given the amount of world building and exposition that\u2019s detailed in the first two episodes, the inclusion of major action sequences would have been unnecessary.",
    "What is unavoidable early in Loki\u2019s six-episode run, though, is ties to the MCM \u2013 and it has plenty of them. Numerous callbacks are made to previous Marvel movies within its first episode alone (WandaVision is indirectly referenced, too) but what\u2019s far more intriguing is how Loki appears to set up future Marvel productions.",
    "Without spoiling anything, it\u2019s clear that Loki will impact upcoming films, even if it doesn\u2019t appear that it\u2019ll do so directly. We already know of two Marvel movies that will explore the MCM in more detail, and Loki certainly alludes to events that are yet to transpire. It\u2019ll be enthralling, then, to see how Mobius\u2019 explanation of Marvel timelines \u2013 or Loki\u2019s series as a whole \u2013 will inform those films when they arrive.",
    "Loki feels like a Marvel TV series that will break new ground. It\u2019s grander in scope, bigger in scale by way of its multiverse exploration, and so far feels like a six-hour movie rather than a near 60-minute, six-episode TV show.",
    "It may not be as inventive as WandaVision with its novel use of sitcoms, nor does it deal with major real-world issues like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and its examination of racism when it comes to who gets to be Captain America.",
    "Loki, though, is far bigger and more important, from a multiverse perspective, than its predecessors. It raises the bar about what we should expect from Marvel TV shows moving forward while delivering an enjoyable, thrilling and surprisingly emotional adventure that will create plenty of online debate and fan theories.",
    "It\u2019ll be fascinating to see how the rest of Loki pans out but, if its first two episodes are anything to go by, we\u2019re in for a wild, amusing and surreal ride with plenty of twists and turns along the way.",
    "Loki launches exclusively on Disney Plus on Wednesday, June 9."
