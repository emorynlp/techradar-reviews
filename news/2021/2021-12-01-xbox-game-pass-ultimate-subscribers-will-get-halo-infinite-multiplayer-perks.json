    "Microsoft has revealed that subscribers to the Ultimate tier of its Xbox Game Pass service will get access to monthly bonuses in Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer.",
    "In a blog post covering some of the new titles that will be coming to Game Pass over the next month, the company says, \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome time for Perks because we\u2019re excited to reveal that Ultimate members will be locked in to get monthly Halo Infinite Multiplayer bonuses.\u201d The first bonuses will be made available on December 8, when Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer officially launches alongside its campaign.",
    "The post confirms that the December 8 bonuses will include the \u201cexclusive \u2018Pass Tense\u2019 MA40 Assault Rifle coating\u201d as well as \u201cfour 2XP Boosts, and four Challenge Swaps\u201d. This is, of course, in addition to getting access to the game\u2019s full release as part of the subscription.",
    "Halo Infinite won\u2019t be the only game Ultimate subscribers will get perks in this month; Dauntless, Apex Legends and World of Warships: Legends were also on the list. And as for new games coming to Game Pass before we go into 2022, you can expect to see Stardew Valley, Among Us, Final Fantasy XIII-2 and more.",
    "Halo Infinite\u2019s official launch date is December 8 so the game\u2019s multiplayer is still technically in beta. While players have found much to like in its gameplay, problems with cheating are causing concern and its Battle Pass has been subject to a fair amount of criticism.",
    "Amidst frustration around slow progression in the game\u2019s Battle Pass, those XP boosts and challenge swaps that are included in the Game Pass Ultimate perks are likely to be welcome to subscribers. But they may well raise the eyebrows of some non-subscribers.",
    "343 Industries has been taking steps to improve the game based on player feedback and at the end of November community manager John Junyszek announced an XP increase for the first six matches of each day. Junyszek said he hoped the change would help players jumping on \u201ceach and every day\u201d but acknowledged \u201cwe know many of you want even larger changes and we're committed to doing so, but those will take time.\u201d",
    "When Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer launches on December 8, Microsoft has confirmed that any progress made in the beta will carry over. As for that highly-anticipated campaign, we went hands on with it recently and found a lot to like in the first four missions."
