    "The next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event has been heavily rumored to be on August 11 - and that date has just been confirmed by the company itself through...Bixby assistant.",
    "As SamMobile first noticed, anyone with access to Bixby can ask when the date for the next Unpacked event is, and they\u2019ll be told to \u2018Listen carefully\u2019 and given this message: \u2018._ .._ __. .._ ... _ .____ .____\u2019 - which, when run through a Morse Code Translator, gives \u2018AUGUST11\u2019.",
    "Pretty cute, Samsung. Since it\u2019s not as complex as the multi-step puzzles Google typically poses to fans for each year\u2019s Google IO starting date, we\u2019re guessing Samsung just wants to get the date out and confirmed already, especially after it\u2019s been rumored and leaked for months now.",
    "What will be revealed at Samsung\u2019s next Unpacked event? The better question may be what won\u2019t be revealed, as many of the company\u2019s biggest mobile devices are rumored to have a new version set to launch at the show.",
    "The biggest reveal we\u2019re expecting is for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, which a teaser suggested will be the star of the show. There are also rumors that the clamshell foldable Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 will launch later in 2021, suggesting it could be shown off at the event, too.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is also heavily rumored to launch at the event, though reports disagree on whether the more affordable flagship Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will launch during Unpacked or if it will be delayed. But if the latter doesn\u2019t arrive in 2021, then Samsung could have a big gap in its phone launches, as we aren\u2019t expecting to see the Samsung Galaxy Note 21 come out this year - if at all, after rumors of its cancellation.",
