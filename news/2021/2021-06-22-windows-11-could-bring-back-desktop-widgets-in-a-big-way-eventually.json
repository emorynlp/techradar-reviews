  "summary": "Third-party widgets might make a comeback, but not with the initial launch of Windows 11",
  "article": [
    "Windows 11 is apparently set to come with integrated widgets \u2013 like the \u2018News and interests\u2019 one that\u2019s already in Windows 10 (see the pic above) \u2013 but only from Microsoft initially, although the rumor mill reckons that a whole range of third-party widgets could become available down the line.",
    "As Neowin spotted, this rumor surfaced on Twitter courtesy of WalkingCat, a well-known and generally reliable Microsoft leaker.",
    "So, the theory is that third-party widget support will arrive at a later date, with Microsoft effectively bringing back what we had in Windows Vista \u2013 desktop gadgets \u2013 after doing away with Live Tiles in Windows 11 (which were the effective replacement for gadgets/widgets).",
    "There are doubters out there, as you might expect, with Rafael Rivera, a Microsoft MVP who we\u2019ve heard from before, asserting that it looks like there won\u2019t be any third-party widgets in the initial incarnation of Windows 11 \u2013 and noting that he isn\u2019t so sure third-party support will ever arrive. To which WalkingCat replied: \u201cNo one can be sure, even Microsoft.\u201d",
    "In other words, even if there is currently a plan to look at implementing third-party widgets for the Windows 11 desktop, say, next year, that may well change based on testing, feedback and so forth.",
    "If third-party support is indeed brought in, that will obviously open up the playing field to a lot of fresh widgets, and potentially useful functionality \u2013 or pointless clutter depending on how you look at it (although obviously you don\u2019t have to use these things, and even the recently introduced \u2018News and interests\u2019 widget now live in Windows 10 can easily be turned off).",
    "We\u2019ll soon know a lot more about next-gen Windows courtesy of Microsoft\u2019s press event and big reveal which happens in just a couple of days on June 24."
