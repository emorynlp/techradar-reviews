  "summary": "The very best of TechRadar from the week that was",
  "article": [
    "Did you celebrate Mardi Gras last week? Depending on your geography, that\u2019s Pancake Day, or maybe even Fat Tuesday. Here at TechRadar, we enjoyed the odd Nutella-covered cr\u00eape in between Zoom calls, but it was a little difficult to relax given the host of tech-related news and events filling our inboxes.",
    "Nintendo Direct, BlizzCon and several high-profile earnings reports were the talk of the town in the week that was, bringing to light new games, services and progress updates on some of the tech world\u2019s most exciting projects.",
    "Here, we\u2019ve picked out the best TechRadar content of the week, from our round-up of the best video doorbells to why your bedroom ceiling is the perfect place for a projector screen. We\u2019ve even gone ahead and resurrected a 15-year-old iPod Classic and pitted it against a shiny new iPhone 12 Pro \u2013 you know, just for nostalgia.",
    "There\u2019s also a host of review and opinion content for you to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re after something a little easier on the eyes (but maybe not the ears), we\u2019ve parked the latest episode of the TechRadar Noise Cancelling Podcast at the end of this article for your convenient listening pleasure.",
    "One TechRadar writer has had enough of FIFA 21\u2019s career mode. For a game so historically-focused on its ability to simulate real soccer, the latest iteration of EA\u2019s flagship franchise seemingly ditches the fun of being on the pitch and instead places more emphasis on what happens off it.",
    "Busy menus, lazy mechanics and a general lack of progression make FIFA 21\u2019s career mode anything but an enjoyable management experience. It\u2019s more of the same, in the worst way.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "CP+ 2021 is around the corner, and for the uninitiated, it\u2019s essentially the world's biggest trade show for cameras and photography (think E3, but with lenses).",
    "Naturally, this year\u2019s event is set to take place online-only, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t expect to see a host of new tech from the likes of Canon, Sony and Nikon. Here, we round up what we hope to see from the industry heavyweights.",

    "It definitely doesn't feel like it, but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 launched five months ago on September 17, 2020, so it's about the right time to start speculating on what Nvidia is going to do to refresh the lineup halfway through its lifespan.",
    "Our computing editor reckons an RTX 3080 Super and an RTX 3070 Super would be a good bet to hit the streets later this year, with the recent action to prevent cryptocurrency miners from bulk buying GPUs a good opportunity to get the graphics cards in the hands of regular gamers.",

    "In an effort to avoid spoilers, we\u2019ll simply say that TV commercials play a key role in the mystery of Disney Plus\u2019 flagship Marvel series, WandaVision.",
    "In the latest episode, one particular commercial gives some clues as to how the studio plans to take its MCU interdimensional. Here, we explain how \u2013 though proceed with caution if you haven\u2019t caught up yet.",

    "For all its simplicity, the humble doorbell is an important part of everyday life.",
    "Nowadays, of course, doorbells aren\u2019t just doorbells, but real-time video feeds that can monitor intruders, deliveries or even the milkman. Here, we round up the best video doorbells of the bunch, from Ring, Google, Arlo and more.",

    "There\u2019s a bittersweet notion that makes the rounds on the internet every so often, which muses that at some point your parents picked you up and put you down for the last time.",
    "Well, that applies to tech, too: at some point, one TechRadar writer turned off his iPod Classic for the last time and shoved it in a drawer. But what would happen if one were to rediscover the magic of Apple\u2019s 15-year-old MP3 player, or even pit it against the shiny new iPhone 12 Pro? Well, that\u2019s exactly what we did.",

    "While it\u2019s true that the art of traditional photography draws closer to its last breath every waking day, the arrival of AI photo editing still hasn\u2019t yet marked the nail in the coffin.",
    "For some photographers, the arrival of Photoshop 2021 and Luminar AI might feel a bit like the moment Skynet became self-aware in The Terminator, but one TechRadar writer is on hand to dispel the notion that the end has arrived for conventional snapping and editing.",

    "Forget the big white wall in your kitchen \u2013 your bedroom ceiling is the new go-to place to beam your projector.",
    "When it comes to comfortably enjoying content on a big screen, one TechRadar writer argues the merits of lying in bed and looking up, instead of down. From the comfortable repose to the massive image, we break down the logic of switching your lounge for your bedroom when it comes to your next Netflix session.",
