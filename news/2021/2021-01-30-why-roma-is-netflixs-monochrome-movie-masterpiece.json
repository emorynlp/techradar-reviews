    "Sometimes, you\u2019ve got to mix things up. You wouldn\u2019t spend the rest of your days eating at the same restaurant every week or listening to one track on repeat (unless it\u2019s the TechRadar podcast, then we\u2019d understand), so why settle for uniformity when it comes to filmmaking?",
    "Sure, gun-toting, sky-diving, supervillain-crushing action hero flicks are great, but it\u2019s refreshing to find a movie that challenges everything you thought you enjoyed about cinema. Especially when it's on service you've already got in your home.",
    "Thankfully, Netflix is all for variety, and the world\u2019s most popular streaming platform has invested in storytelling from all walks of life \u2013 and all corners of the globe \u2013 to offer subscribers an Aladdin's cave of choice. Roma, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s semi-autobiographical portrayal of a year in the life of a housekeeper in Mexico City, is one of those masterful movies hidden among the blockbusters.",
    "You might remember the buzz around this black-and-white slow burner back at the 2019 Academy Awards. It took home the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Cinematography and Best Director, and was lauded as one of those rare pictures that achieves a harmonious marrying of impressive performances, beautiful camerawork and a sense of social importance. It\u2019s easy to roll your eyes at the pomp and circumstance of awards season and the critical jargon bandied around, but Roma really does deserve the praise heaped upon it \u2013 and warrants a revisit in 2021.",
    "Roma is a heartfelt, honest, and occasionally distressing experience that merits a big-screen rewatch \u2013 the curled-up, night-time laptop routine Netflix is famous for doesn\u2019t entirely do Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s filmmaking justice. Back in 2019, we wrote an article on why you need to see Roma in a Dolby cinema, and though Covid-19 means there\u2019s no chance of that happening any time soon, the sentiment remains the same.",
    "The story follows Cleo, in a compelling debut performance from Yalitza Aparicio, as she navigates the struggles of her own life as well as those of her employers, a middle-class family enduring the aftermath of a divorce. Cuar\u00f3n never sensationalizes events, nor does he draw melodrama from dialling in on the individual emotions of his characters. Rather, his cinematography captures the necessary moments of emotion, humor and contextual unrest in equal measure, crafting a fascinating yet convincingly real picture of life in 1980s Mexico.",
    "Roma represents an emotional moment of reflection in the career of a director known for his affinity with science fiction \u2013 Cuar\u00f3n counts Gravity and Children of Men among his credits \u2013 and proves a powerful watch for any admirer of cinema for its ability to beautify the seemingly-mundane. It occasionally risks self-indulgence, but Roma is a credit to its creator.",
    "It isn\u2019t a quick watch, nor an easy one, but there are so many parts of Roma to admire on an audiovisual level. This is largely down to the director\u2019s mastery of the camera. Cuar\u00f3n is famed for his ability to transform the most monotonous of subjects into engaging pieces of filmmaking \u2013 remember the creepy playground in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, or the famous 6-minute single take from Children of Men? \u2013 and it's a skill no more evident than here.",
    "The opening sequence, for example, sees the camera focus on wet floor tiles which become \u2013 by virtue of the lens\u2019 positioning \u2013 reflective of the sky above. Birds and planes cross the screen while the camera remains pointed to the floor, and the scene evolves into a dichotomy between the tedium of housework and the hustle of the outside world.",
    "Cuar\u00f3n likes to use this trick a few times \u2013 at least, he likes to linger by the ordinary at every opportunity. For the most part, this achieves the desired effect and undeniably confirms his gift for camerawork. Occasionally, his commitment to dazzling the viewer with technique wears slightly thin, but the personal nature of the project gives Cuar\u00f3n license to experiment.",
    "Watching Roma is like having a guided tour through an art gallery. Everything you\u2019re looking at is unquestionably beautiful, and though sometimes you wish things would move a little faster, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to step back and appreciate the craft on show.",
    "The monochrome filter helps the movie in two ways. It gives the setting a timeless quality \u2013 the story could feasibly take place at any time in the last 50 years \u2013 which serves as a mechanism for emphasizing the ubiquitous issues of family turmoil as well as the monotony of domestic duties.",
    "It also underlines the fundamental power of the moving image. 10 minutes in, and the black and white film may as well become glorious technicolor. It\u2019s an evidently-artsy move and won\u2019t appeal to everyone, but it nevertheless differentiates Roma among the wimpish safety of mainstream cinema.",
    "Yalitza Aparicio is fantastic in the lead role \u2013 it\u2019s the emotion of her mannerisms and ability to dictate subtle facial changes that establish her as an exciting new talent. So too is Marina de Tavira excellent in her portrayal as the firm-but-fragile Sof\u00eda, the mother of four who is unexpectedly thrown into her role as head of the family. It all feels very real, which is, you would think, the point of any film \u2013 and it\u2019s the performances that anchor this sense of authenticity.",
    "Ultimately, then, Roma is bold and brilliant, a masterful picture that succeeds almost without a hitch. Watch it for the first time. Watch it again. Then go back to the multiverse madness of Hollywood blockbusters."
