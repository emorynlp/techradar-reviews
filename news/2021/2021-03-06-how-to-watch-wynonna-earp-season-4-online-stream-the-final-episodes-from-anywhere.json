Read on as we explain how to watch Wynonna Earp season 4 online wherever you are in the world today.",

    "Based on the comic by Beau Smith and starring Melanie Scrofano as titular heroine and great-great-granddaughter of legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, the show has built up a sizeable online following since the show began airing on Syfy back in 2016.",
    "Production of the fan-favorite show was halted in Canada last year thanks to the coronavirus, causing the airing of season 4 to be split in two, with the first chunk of shows broadcast in July last year, and the concluding run of episode now set to finally air from this week.",
    "While producers are looking for a new home for the hugely popular show, in the meantime these final six episodes will offer Earpers more battles between Wynonna and the revenants, the zombified outlaws that have blighted her family through time.",
