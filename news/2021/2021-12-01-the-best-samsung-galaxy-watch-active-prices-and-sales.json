We're rounding up all the best Samsung Galaxy Watch Active deals so you can be sure to find the lowest price online. As the name implies, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active is focused on fitness, and its new design and features reflect that. The ultra-lightweight Galaxy Active comes in one size and features a 1.1-inch display. The fitness watch continually monitors your heart and will send alerts when an abnormal heart rate is detected. The Samsung watch can also help with your sleep and stress, analyzing your sleep patterns and sending you breathing exercises when high-stress levels are detected. The Galaxy Active will also help you keep on track with your health and fitness goals by tracking up to 39 exercises and displaying your health summary on the smartwatch display. The waterproof watch comes in four different colors and has a battery that lasts for days on a single charge.",
    "Released in 2019, the Samsung Galaxy Active Watch had a starting price of $199.99/\u00a3229, but thanks to the release of the Active 2, the price has dropped since then, and easier than ever to find Samsung Galaxy Active Watch deals. The Active watch has a cheaper starting price when compared to the original Samsung Galaxy Watch because the Active is missing the rotatable bezel, a core feature from the Samsung Galaxy Watch. This means navigation of the menus and features is handled by the touchscreen and two side buttons. If you plan on using the Samsung watch just for fitness purposes, then the Galaxy Active is a great alternative at a lower price. You'll find all of the best Samsung Galaxy Active Watch prices from online retailers below.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 was released in 2019 with a starting price of $279.99 / \u00a3269 for the 40mm version and $299 / \u00a3289 / AU$549 for the 44mm version. Unlike the original Active watch, the Active 2 is available in two different sizes and comes in aluminum or stainless steel. The Active 2 also offers an LTE version which allows you to get internet and phone connectivity on your watch even when your smartphone is far away.
