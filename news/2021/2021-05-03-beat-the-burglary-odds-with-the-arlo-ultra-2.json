    "The tech you love so much is a tempting target for housebreakers, and unfortunately the odds of catching the culprit can be very low: just 14 out of every 100 burglaries result in an arrest* and only 5% result in a conviction**. That means it's really important to keep your stuff secure, and to get the best possible evidence if someone does break in.",
    "One of the best ways to do that is to invest in a Wi-Fi security camera such as the Arlo Ultra 2 Spotlight Security Camera.",
    "The Ultra 2 captures 4x more detail with 4K HDR, enabling you to zoom in 12x on important features without distortion. That means you can identify individuals even at night.",
    "Wi-Fi security cameras are not all created equal. Many of them are just 1080p, which means they have a quarter of the resolution and half the frame rate of the Arlo Ultra 2 Spotlight Security Camera.",
    "That can mean indistinct, jerky video instead of smooth, detailed 4K. And most don't have HDR, which means they can miss important details because of poor image contrast.",
    "4K HDR resolution isn't the only important feature of the Arlo Ultra 2. Its motion alerts will detect movement and send notifications straight to your phone, so you can quickly react to what's happening no matter where you are.",
    "And its crystal clear two-way audio features wind and noise reduction so that you can hear what\u2019s happening and interact with visitors such as delivery drivers.",
    "Where many Wi-Fi security cameras have a very narrow field of view, restricting their viewing area and introducing lots of distortion at the edges, the Arlo Ultra 2 Spotlight Security Camera has a very wide 180-degree diagonal field of view with automatic image correction to reduce the fish-eye effect.",
    "Its digital auto-focus can track intruders so you don\u2019t miss important activity, and the enhanced colour night vision with integrated spotlight enables you to see crucial details that monochrome video can't display.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 is built to withstand heat, cold, rain and sun, and because it's completely wireless you can install it anywhere for the best view of your property.",
    "With up to six months battery life from a single charge*** you can fit it and leave it to watch the most vulnerable parts of your property for months on end. And with Arlo Smart Plans all your footage is stored securely in the cloud for 30 days, so every detail is available online for you to download and use as evidence.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 connects to Arlo's clever SmartHub, which plugs into your internet router and enables you to connect multiple cameras with ease. It adds extra protection via battery management and the ability to store video footage locally as well as online.",
    "It's all controlled via Arlo's excellent smartphone app, which gives you complete control of your connected home security cameras as well as the ability to create custom activity zones and benefit from advanced object detection for people, vehicles and animals.",
    "You can also use the app to trigger the camera's smart siren or to get the siren to trigger automatically when it detects motion.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 Spotlight Security Camera comes from one of the most trusted names in the home security sector.",
    "Arlo is Europe's number one surveillance camera brand thanks to its combination of intelligence, innovation and thoughtful design, and the Ultra 2 is part of an entire family of industry-leading security solutions that includes a wide range of cameras, floodlight cameras and video doorbells to protect your home inside and out.",
