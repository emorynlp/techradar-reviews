    "The best budget wireless earbuds are better than their low prices suggest, and that's especially true of these ones you'll find discounted as part of this year's Prime Day deals.",
    "Here's a collection of the best Amazon Prime Day 2021 wireless earbuds deals we've found under $100 / \u00a3100 in the US and the UK. There are some amazing products in this list, including earbuds from respected brands like Sennheiser, Sony, and Anker.",
    "You'll notice that many deals in the UK are now sold out as Prime Day is officially over \u2013 but lots are still available, and the sales event is still going strong in the US.",
    "Not in the US or UK? Scroll down to the bottom of this page for the best deals in your region on some of the featured products.",
    "It pays to be wary about budget wireless earbuds. There are countless brands available on Amazon and other online retailers that offer headphones for incredibly low prices \u2013 which drop down even lower during Prime Day.",
    "But, there are some hidden gems that offer decent sound quality and style for a price that can seem too good to be true. However, if you have a good idea of the specs you're looking for before you buy, you can save yourself a lot of time during the sales period.",
    "Whatever kind of wireless earbuds you buy this Prime Day, they need to be comfortable \u2013 look out for models that come with interchangeable ear tips in a range of sizes to ensure a snug fit. Memory foam or silicone tips are usually best, though some people prefer AirPods-style ear tips that don't need to be pushed as deeply into your ear.",
    "If you want to use your wireless earbuds during exercise, they should have an IPX4 water-resistance rating or above; this means that they'll be able to withstand a little sweat as well as a spot of rain.",
    "It's worth checking out the battery life, too. Take lots of long haul flights? A short battery life isn't going to cut it, and you might be better off paying a little extra for the convenience of not having to charge your buds every single day.",
    "Most importantly, think about the audio quality you're looking for. Cheap wireless earbuds may not always come with audiophile specs like support for hi-res audio codecs, but it's worth taking a look at the reviews to see how other users have found them \u2013 and we've reviewed many of the earbuds on this list, so you can check out our findings, too.",

    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the best earbuds in this guide from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
