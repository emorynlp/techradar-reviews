    "The stars are out in force for one of the most prestigious one-day events on the cycling calendar, Strade Bianche, with the peloton set to face up to 63km of Tuscan gravel on a gorgeous route that twists and turns its way through those country lanes and farm tracks that criss-cross the hills and vineyards of the Chianti region. Last year's race winners, Annemiek van Vleuten and Wout van Aert, are amongst the contenders. Read on as we explain how to get a 2021 Strade Bianche live stream today and watch cycling online right now.",
    "Both the men's and women's races start and finish in Siena, though the men's route covers 184km, compared to 136km for the women's race. Tuscany's unmistakable dusty white roads are the centre-piece of both races, with the women set to ride over more than 30km of gravel across eight sectors, and the men roughly 63km of gravel across 11 sectors.",
    "As well as the tricky terrain, the route is armed to the teeth with short and sharp climbs, though at least the riders won't have the searing heat of last summer to contend with, the Strade Bianche having thankfully been restored to its usual March slot after Covid-disruption forced it to take place in August last year.",
    "In the men's race, the battle between reigning champion van Aert (Jumbo-Visma), arch-rival Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Fenix) and, to a lesser extent, world champion Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-QuickStep) looks mouthwatering, while in the women's competition Anna Van Der Breggen (SD Worx) looks best-placed to challenge van Vleuten (Movistar Team) after her resounding Omloop Het Nieuwsblad triumph last weekend.",
    "Don't miss a moment of the action this weekend - follow our guide as we explain how to watch a Strade Bianche live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling wherever you are.",
    "Prepare to dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book if you want to 'voir en direct', because anyone in Italy can watch a FREE Strade Bianche live stream on Rai, while cycling fans in Belgium can tune in for free on Sporza, and those in France can get the race on L'Equipe without paying a penny.",
    "The catch? Well, all the commentary will either be in Italian, Dutch or French, so dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book and prepare to expand your foreign language skills. Or, if that doesn't sound like something you'd enjoy, there's plenty of other coverage around the world, including in English.",
    "If you're a resident of Italy, Belgium or France and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "Our latest 2021 testing showed our recommended VPN working well on these platforms from abroad, and we'll be sure to confirm for this race as soon as it's underway.",
    "If you're desperate to watch the Strade Bianche but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
