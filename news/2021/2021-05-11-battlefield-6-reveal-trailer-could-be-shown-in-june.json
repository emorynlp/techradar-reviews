    "The first Battlefield 6 (now confirmed to be Battlefield 2042) reveal trailer could be shown in June, according to the game\u2019s official Twitter account, which should finally give us a definitive look at DICE's upcoming first-person shooter.",
    "In a teasing tweet, the Battlefield 6 official account wrote: \u201cWords that rhyme with Soon. June. Boom.\u201d",
    "It doesn\u2019t take a detective to determine when we\u2019re going to get some more information on the next Battlefield, then, but exactly what remains to be seen. We'd be shocked, though if it wasn't the Battlefield 6 reveal trailer.",
    "The word \u201cboom\u201d indicates that we\u2019ll finally see Battlefield 6 in action, with the game\u2019s first trailer tipped to show an island location with aerial combat and extreme weather conditions that will impact gameplay. Apparently the game will see tornados causing havoc during matches, which could spice things up considerably. The game is also tipped to have wacky cosmetics and armed robot dogs.",
    "EA had promised that Battlefield 6 would be revealed in Spring (between March and June), so we\u2019re fairly confident that we\u2019ll finally see some gameplay of Battlefield 6, and possibly get a release date too.",
    "The reveal may coincide with E3 2021, which takes place on June 12 to June 15 this year and is a digital only event. It's also when the marketing for Battlefield tends to ramp up, with a release set for Holiday 2021 (between October and December).",
    "Battlefield 6 developer DICE recently shared more information in a blog post that said the team is working on \u201ccreating a jaw-dropping experience\u201d and that the sixth entry has \u201ceverything we love about Battlefield \u2013 and takes all of it to the next level.\u201d",
    "The game promises to deliver all-out military warfare with crazy, unexpected moments, game-changing destruction and massive battles. The game will be packed with more players and mayhem than ever before, though we still don\u2019t have an exact figure as to how many players there will actually be.",
    "Battlefield 6 will hopefully be a return to form for the long-running series, which arguably fell flat after the release of Battlefield 5. It allowed Call of Duty to regain its foothold as the premiere first-person shooter, with Call of Duty: Warzone, the game\u2019s free-to-play battle royale mode, a large factor in turning the fortunes of Activision\u2019s blockbuster franchise."
