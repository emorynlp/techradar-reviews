    "Fed up of standard white light bulbs in your home? Maybe you crave the ability to create dramatic mood lighting with a range of different hues? Or perhaps you want lights that switch on automatically when you\u2019re not at home to deter intruders?",
    "Here\u2019s where the best smart lights come in - as well as allowing you to pick from millions of different colors or tones of white light, they can also be controlled by your smartphone, even when you\u2019re miles away.",
    "However, if you\u2019re not entirely sure how these smart home devices work, what you can actually do with them and how you can use them to automate your home, we\u2019re here to demystify things.",
    "Want to get your hands on the best smart light bulbs now? Check out these great deals for some of the best on the market.",
    "Smart light bulbs are one of the most popular smart home devices on the market today. According to Statista, the smart lighting market is projected to be worth $105.2bn by 2023 - up from \u2018just\u2019 $8.68 billion in 2018. It\u2019s not hard to see why as these handy gadgets can really make life a little easier.",
    "Smart light bulbs work in the same way as many of the best smart home devices, by using wireless technologies to connect to your smartphone and allow you to control the bulb from an app.",
    "Some smart bulbs use Bluetooth to pair directly to your phone, but as this is a point-to-point connection you won\u2019t be able to control them when you\u2019re not at home. Other smart bulbs use the wireless protocols Z-Wave or Zigbee, which are slightly faster than Bluetooth and allow several devices to be controlled at the same time.",
    "However, they can\u2019t be controlled when you\u2019re not at home unless they are used with an optional hub (also called a bridge). This relays commands from your smartphone to the cloud and back to the smart light, if you\u2019re not connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This means if you\u2019ve left for the day but forgot to turn the bathroom light off, you can simply open the app and switch the light off remotely - no more wasting energy until you get home.",
    "These hubs don\u2019t have to be made by the same manufacturer as the smart lights, however; for example, the Amazon Echo (4th generation) doubles as a Zigbee compatible smart hub.",
    "When Philips first launched Hue smart lights they couldn\u2019t be set-up without a bridge, which was supplied in starter kits with two or three bulbs. However, newer iterations of the smart lights feature Bluetooth so they can be controlled when you\u2019re in the house, and can be paired with an optional bridge if you want to control the lights remotely.",
    "Notably, LIFX is one of the few exceptions of Zigbee devices that doesn\u2019t require a bridge to be controlled remotely as it offers its own cloud service to relay commands to its bulbs when you\u2019re away from the house.",
    "If you have an iPhone and the smart lights you choose are HomeKit compatible; for example Philips Hue and LIFX, you\u2019ll be able to set them up through the Home app using the QR code that comes with the lights. However, if you want to control them remotely you will need a HomeKit hub such as a HomePod Mini or an Apple TV 4K.",
    "As well as allowing you to switch the lights on and off from your smartphone, smart bulbs can also be brightened or dimmed from an app too, so you no longer need to leave your armchair to adjust the lighting or switch on a lamp.",
    "Depending on the smart light bulb you opt for, the color of the bulb can be adjusted; pick from 16 million different hues to set the perfect ambiance or select a shade from cool white, which creates a fresh, bright, clinical type glow, to warm white - a similar shade to when the sun is setting that creates a warm cosy atmosphere.",
    "Several smart light bulbs can also be grouped together; either all the bulbs in one room or all the bulbs on one floor for example, so you control them at the same time - whether that\u2019s just switching them on or off, or ensuring each individual smart light gloves a particular color without having to manually adjust each bulb.",
    "Some even offer a geofence feature that will ensure the light automatically switches off when you leave your house, providing you take your smartphone with you.",
    "Many smart light bulbs such as those from LIFX and TP-Link, are designed to replace your existing light bulbs and come in a range of fittings, while others, including Philips Hue, also offer side lamps and ceiling pendants that replace your existing home furnishings. There are even some from the likes of Nanoleaf that are designed to be attached to the walls in your home to create illuminated art-like features.",
    "Smart lights integrate with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri too, and can be set to work with other smart home devices; for example dimming the light when your smart thermostat switches the heating on in the evening to ensure a cosy environment to relax in, or switching on if your home security camera detects motion to simulate occupancy and deter would-be intruders.",
    "Not all smart lights work with all voice assistants, however, so make sure you check it will work with your current kit before you buy.",
    "The smart light bulb market is crowded, with stalwarts Philips Hue and LIFX up against newer brands including Nanoleaf - most of which offer a choice of different smart lights to pick from. We\u2019ve rounded up the best from each of the big hitters to help you choose."
