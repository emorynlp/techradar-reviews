    "Far Cry 6 features a third-person perspective during certain scenes and will also let players choose which gender they want to play as, just like in Far Cry 5.",
    "The addition of a third-person viewpoint is an interesting one, as the series is known for playing out entirely from a first-person perspective. In Far Cry 6, we\u2019ll get to see the game\u2019s protagonist, Dani Royas, in cutscenes, during certain parts of combat and when your character enters guerrilla camps. But why the change?",
    "Well, in an emailed response to GameSpot, narrative director Navid Khavari said there are \u201ca few reasons\u201d why the game shifts perspective. The most fundamental reason behind the design decision is to create more of a connection between Dani and the player, and also to showcase the game\u2019s various customization options.",
    "\"In cinematics, [third-person] is something the team tried early on, and it felt surprisingly seamless,\" Khavari wrote. \"It instantly felt like there was more of a connection to Dani's journey in the world, more of a connection to this epic story in Yara.",
    "\"Players will also be able to see their character customizations in these highly-realized story beats. In Guerrilla Camps, this is also an opportunity for players to be able to see their fully customized character, everything from their backpack to their clothes.\"",
    "As we saw in Far Cry 6\u2019s gameplay reveal trailer, when players use the Supremo backpack, which can fire off a barrage of missiles, the game shifts perspective. Khavi explained that this \u201cthird-person transition is intended so players can see all of the backpack\u2019s effects, and better feel its impact in action.\u201d",
    "The move to have a more compelling protagonist is a dramatic shift from Far Cry 5, which took place entirely in first-person and features a silent protagonist. There\u2019s a far greater chance, then, that players will be able to build a meaningful connection with Dani.",
    "Speaking of Dani, players will also be able to choose which gender they want to play as. Khavari posted a video on Far Cry\u2019s Twitter account and said that having a choice was \u201cimportant to us\u201d. Khavari also specified that the team didn\u2019t want to create two separate storylines and that \u201cif you pick male or female, that choice is for you to make, and that journey of Dani will be one and the same.\u201d",
    "We\u2019ve only seen the female Dani in Far Cry 6 so far, but it\u2019s good to see that Ubisoft is continuing to offer the choice to players, just like it did in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla and Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey.",
    "Far Cry 6 is set to release on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC on October 7, 2021."
