    "Target PS5 restock update: The confirmed Target PS5 restock today in the US happened and the followers of our 24/7 PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider were able to buy the PS5 Disc for $499, at least before it sold out completely after just 13 minutes.",
    "When is the next PS5 restock? Matt will send you an alert when the PS5 is in stock \u2013 if you follow Matt's Twitter account and turn on notifications. He's tracking over a dozen American retailers, including Best Buy, GameStop and Walmart. There was a Best Buy PS5 restock date last Friday (one week ago) and usually has weekly PlayStation 5 console inventory of both PS5 Disc and PS5 Digital, but it's not confirmed. Here's how to know when to get the next PS5 restock.",
    "\u25ba When? Follow our PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider and turn on notifications for Target PS5 restock alerts. It's the fastest way to get restock updates.",
    "\u25ba Warning: don't buy from other Twitter users. They're all scams. Only buy from the US stores Matt alerts you about. No one will sell a PS5 for just $550.",
    "\u25ba Why trust TechRadar? We don't point you to a bunch of US retailer links, which are always dead ends. Others do that \u2013 not us. Matt Swider will send you a push notification when there's actual PS5 stock through his 24/7 tracking efforts.",
    "Directions: Click on this image of an example of a Target PS5 restock alert from Matt Swider and turn on notifications (that little bell icon) for instant alerts.",
    "Friday update: Target did restock the PS5 Digital at a few stores this week, including today, July 30, at a local level (online purchases for in-store Target pick-up), but it was at a handful of Target stores with even fewer consoles at each store (we're talking two in Iowa and another two in Nebraska). In other words, this isn't the massive PS5 restock you've been waiting for.",
    "The Target PS5 restock time is 7am to 8am EDT, and we know that even if we don't know the exact restock date with certainty (there's just a chance it'll be today, as the last PS5 stock launched on Friday three weeks ago).",
    "Target has stuck to opening up PS5 stock during that hour-long range in 2021, with the official PS5 restock time, spanning 7:06am EDT at the earliest time (that was the latest PS5 restock time, actually) and to 7:50 EDT at the latest time. If the Target PS5 restock doesn't happen by 8am EDT, it's probably not going to happen on that date.",
    "Across the four main time zones in the US, that means you should be looking for our PS5 restock Target Twitter alert by 7am EDT / 6am CDT / 5am MDT / 4am MDT. Note that the most consistent restock time at Target is 7:40am EDT.",
    "Why does Target restock PS5 so early? It's in an effort to launch PS5 orders before any of the Target stores open up in the US. The last thing anyone in management wants is to have people flock to its individual stores trying to buy something that's can't be bought, and then getting angry or milling about in crowds in 2021.",
    "This is a tough ask for people on the West Coast of the United States, however, it's actually an advantage if you're really determined to buy the PlayStation 5. While you can't (repeat: cannot) buy the PS5 console in Target stores today, you do have to (read: are required, as they do not ship) pick up the Sony system at your local store. This cuts down on resellers claiming multiple $499 PS5 Disc and $399 PS5 Digital Edition consoles, as they're sold at MSRP and easy to resell. With the restock happening during the 4am PDT hour, most of your competition is fast asleep.",
    "If the Target PS5 restock date is Friday, that means the American retailer is switching to an end-of-the-week pattern. Its last massive restock was a Friday, though every other time, it has picked a Wednesday or Thursday since mid-February 2021.",
    "We know that there are more than 20 PS5 consoles sitting at individual Target stores in the US, so we're going to be tracking the Target PS5 restock chances every morning like we did today. If it doesn't happen on Friday from 7am to 8am EDT, then we'll check again next Wednesday and Thursday. By then, Target may have closer to 40 consoles on hand at some stores, which is good news.",
    "So don't be disappointed if there isn't a PS5 restock this week. The only reason the date will slip to next week is if Target wants to hold off for more inventory. We have seen Target wait until it has 40 PS5 consoles in stock in 2021, and since we're at slightly over 20 PS5 Disc version consoles at major stores in the US, that's a possibility (but we like the chances for today only because Target doesn't like to hold on to the PS5 Disc consoles for that long).",
    "This is why our PS5 Twitter tracker alerts have become essential and why so many people have notifications turned on for Matt Swider's account. With the time known but still within an hour time frame and with the date unknown but usually within a two-day span, you want to be among the first time try to buy the PS5.",
    "Do note that being first to the page and seeing that the PS5 sold out our unavailable at your local Target store is normal. In fact, being first is sometimes a bad thing, as a lot of people stop trying after not getting the console within the first minute. What so many people don't know is that the PS5 restock happens in waves and tapping that add-to-cart button over and over again is the only way to checkout.",
    "In other words, speed is good, but persistence is even more important. That's why, when we're offering PS5 restock expert advice, say the only reason to be fast to the Target PS5 retail page is to get more chances at trying to checkout, not to be there first. It's a marathon, not a sprint.",
    "Looking back through our PS5 restock Twitter alerts by Matt Swider, it's easy to pinpoint when the PS5 has been in stock at Target in 2021. The 24/7 tracking of US stores, including Target, provides a detailed view of when and where the PS5 has been available to purchase.",
    "We're constantly checking in with our helpful sources at individual Target stores to ensure our followers \u2013 made up of real gamers hoping to get the PS5 restock before any bots and resellers buy all of them \u2013 checkout with the console of their choice.",
    "So far we've seen Target stores in the US have anywhere from 11 to 26 consoles on hand earlier this week and the numbers just got bumped up today, July 29, meaning they're in the stores but not being sold because Target waits until it has enough PS5 inventory before doing a nationwide restock. The question remains: is up to 26 consoles at larger Target locations enough? We've seen the American retailer do a restock based on this amount, but we've also seen Target launch orders when it has as many as 40 PS5 consoles at these same locations we check in with.",
    "Target has anywhere from 15,000 to 38,000 PS5 consoles for sale nationwide during each restock, though these numbers are publicly disclosed by Target and we're working on fragments of information from its online inventory count.",
    "We'll continue to update this PS5 restock page as more information comes in and do a Target PS5 restock live stream when and if the console becomes available to buy.",
    "The one mistake people keeping making is holding off on buying the $499 PS5 Disc version of the Sony console in favor of waiting for the PS5 Digital Edition \u2013 which is usually but not always second. Target PS5 restocks happen one after the other, not all at the same time.",
    "While PS5 Digital will save you $100, we can confirm that its inventory is not nearly as strong at Target stores. We've seen cases in which there are 40 PS5 Disc consoles at an individual location and just one PS5 Digital. And sure enough, whenever the second round of orders for the PS5 Digital go in stock, it's out of stock in seconds.",
    "We also convey to everyone that PS5 Disc is cheaper in the long run because $60 and $70 PS5 games come down in price much more quickly on disc. When it's digital, Sony controls the pricing through the PlayStation Store and while there are sales on games sometimes, it's much rarer."
