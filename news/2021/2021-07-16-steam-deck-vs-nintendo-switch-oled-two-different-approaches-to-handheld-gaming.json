  "article": [
    "We bet Nintendo didn\u2019t think it would have competition for the Switch OLED so soon, but that\u2019s exactly what Valve\u2019s new portable PC, the Steam Deck, is set to provide.",
    "The Steam Deck could be considered to be the Nintendo Switch Pro that many had expected the Kyoto-based company to make, as it\u2019s equipped with powerful specs, and is capable of running the latest AAA games like Death Stranding and Doom Eternal. It\u2019s also a portable PC, and that means it\u2019s capable of so much more than a handheld-only device. Hook it up to a docking station and you can output to a monitor, attach Bluetooth and USB accessories, and even use it for productivity tasks.",
    "It\u2019s a different proposition to the Nintendo Switch OLED in many ways, then. But one thing that they both have in common is the ability to play games on the move. If Valve\u2019s new handheld console has caught your eye, we\u2019re putting head-to-head against the Switch OLED to see which one comes out on top.",
    "Valve\u2019s Steam Deck is set to cost $399 / \u00a3349 for its entry-level 64GB model, which is the closest match to the Nintendo Switch OLED. It\u2019s due to launch in December 2021, with pre-orders now available. There\u2019s a small deposit to pay of $4 / \u00a35 if you\u2019d like to reserve your Steam Deck, and you can do so by heading to the Steam Store.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED will retail for $349 / \u00a3309 / AU$539 and will be released on October 8, 2021. The Switch OLED is $50 cheaper, then, and both consoles can have their storage expanded via the included microSD card slot found on both systems. The Switch OLED is also available to pre-order now.",
    "While both the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch OLED are portable consoles, they do differ significantly when it comes to technical specifications and design. Both consoles come equipped with a 7-inch touchscreen (the Steam Deck has a resolution of 1280x800 and the Switch OLED is 1280x720), though the Nintendo Switch OLED boasts an OLED display. This means it should offer more vibrant colors, inky black and better contrast ratio than Valve\u2019s LCD screen on the Steam Deck. Both screens' max refresh rate is 60Hz.",
    "In terms of controls, the Steam Deck features two analog sticks and two touchpads that can replicate mouse movement. They have capacitive touch sensors built-in, which will detect when your thumbs are active. You\u2019ll also find the usual face buttons, bumper and trigger buttons, as well as gyroscope control included. It\u2019s worth noting that the triggers on the Steam Deck are analog, not digital like on the Switch OLED, which means they can provide more fine-grain control. The Steam Deck adds further inputs via the four grip buttons on the back of the device, which provide extra inputs when playing games.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED comes with the Joy-Con controllers that we\u2019ve been used to since 2017. The Joy-Con controllers feature HD Rumble, motion controls and can be detached from the console, enabling local multiplayer at a moment\u2019s notice if you\u2019re playing in tabletop mode. Thanks to the Switch OLED\u2019s redesigned, wider stand, this should be far more appealing and easier to do. The Steam Deck\u2019s controllers cannot be detached, and it doesn\u2019t come with a kickstand, either.",
    "However, both the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch OLED can be docked to output to a TV \u2013 although Valve hasn\u2019t revealed it\u2019s official dock, which will be sold separately. Unlike the Switch OLED, though, the Steam Deck can be output to a TV or monitor via its USB Type-C port and a USB Type-C dock. This gives the handheld much more flexibility, and it can also output at higher resolutions than 1080p.",
    "When it comes to technical specifications, the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch OLED share some similarities when it comes to storage and screen size, but the Steam Deck is a far more capable machine. Here\u2019s a full breakdown of the Steam Deck\u2019s vital statistics:",
    "Valve\u2019s machine is certainly impressive, then, and should allow the system to run most AAA games at medium to high settings at 720p/60fps. That\u2019s a far cry from the Nintendo Switch, which has historically struggled to get third-party titles running above 30fps, and resolution usually has to be sacrificed as a result. That doesn\u2019t mean the Switch OLED isn\u2019t still a great piece of hardware, though, particularly as you won\u2019t find games like Breath of the Wild 2 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe anywhere else. Here\u2019s what\u2019s inside the Nintendo Switch OLED:",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED sports the same technical specifications as the original Nintendo Switch, which was disappointing news for some. The console is starting to show its age in the graphics department after almost five years on sale, but that doesn\u2019t mean Nintendo isn\u2019t capable of producing some surprisingly great results. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t care about high framerates and resolutions, the Nintendo Switch OLED should at least make the Switch\u2019s library of titles look better than before in handheld mode thanks to the crisp new display.",
    "One advantage that the Steam Deck has over the Nintendo Switch OLED from the outset is that the majority of your Steam library will be playable on Valve\u2019s new device. We say majority, because the truth is that not every PC title will be accessible. This is because the Steam Deck runs SteamOS, which is a Linux-based operating system. While Valve has promised to continue to improve compatibility with more titles running up to launch, there is a chance that some fan favorite like PUBG and Destiny won\u2019t run on the Steam Deck.",
    "At least not in its SteamOS form \u2013 it\u2019s important to remember that the Steam Deck is an open platform, which means you can technically run whatever OS you like on it. It also has the ability to play games from other stores and launchers, which is pleasing to hear.",
    "The Nintendo Switch is a more familiar proposition for console users. As a closed-garden, Nintendo dictates what titles are available on its hardware, and the fixed specs means that developers can benefit from knowing that every game they develop will run the same for every user. Games are arguably the Switch\u2019s biggest strength, too, as Nintendo\u2019s first-party lineup continues to have serious pulling power with gamers. Titles such as Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Animal Crossing: New Horizons have helped make the Switch top the sales charts each month, and there\u2019s plenty to look forward to in the years ahead.",
    "So which portable is right for you? Well, that depends. The Steam Deck may have the Switch OLED beat on paper, but Nintendo has the evergreen appeal of its fantastic library of titles which you can\u2019t play anywhere else. The Switch is also a console that has the benefit of allowing local multiplayer by detaching the Joy-Con, it has a proven track record since its launch of delivering a great experience.",
    "However, the Steam Deck will instantly appeal to those who were craving a Switch-like device that\u2019s capable of better performance. The fact it\u2019s being created by Valve and adopts all the bells and whistles of Steam shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, either. Time will tell whether it\u2019s as ergonomic or as reliable as the Switch (Joy-Con drift aside), but it\u2019s the first real competitor to Nintendo\u2019s dominance over the handheld market since Sony\u2019s ill-fated PlayStation Vita."
