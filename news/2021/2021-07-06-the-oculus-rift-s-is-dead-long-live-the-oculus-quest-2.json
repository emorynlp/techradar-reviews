    "The time has come to bid farewell to the Oculus Rift S \u2013 it\u2019s now officially off the shelves, having been discontinued earlier in the year.",
    "A statement posted to the Oculus website reads \u201cOculus Rift is no longer available,\u201d marking the end of a two-year lifespan for the VR headset, which launched in May 2019 as the successor to the original Oculus Rift model.",
    "The Rift S is survived by the Oculus Quest 2, which is now the brand\u2019s flagship entry-level VR headset and, for our money, the best VR headset for most gamers.",
    "This isn\u2019t surprising news, of course. Facebook, parent company to Oculus, revealed earlier this year that it wouldn\u2019t be shipping any more Rift S units to retailers once they had sold out, following the launch of the Quest 2 in October 2019. Facebook will also now focus on standalone VR headsets in the future, scrapping development of PC-only systems like the Rift S.",
    "What\u2019s more, the company is retiring support for Oculus accounts in 2023, meaning users will be forced to connect a Facebook account to their chosen Oculus device in order to access the system.",
    "That news won\u2019t go down well with players unwilling to become subject to Facebook\u2019s data monitoring practices, though, or indeed those unsettled by the company\u2019s recent ad testing on its Quest systems.",
    "Facebook says ads will allow for \"new ways for developers to generate revenue\" with the aim of \"creating a self-sustaining platform,\u201d though the decision to impose ads in the virtual world of a video game is one sure to frustrate VR enthusiasts \u2013 and gamers in general, for that matter.",
    "It\u2019s rare that a major tech company axes a product without announcing a direct successor, but that\u2019s now the case with the Oculus Rift S. It\u2019s clear Facebook intends to push full steam ahead with the Quest 2, though, so it\u2019s not as if VR fans have been left wanting for a capable mixed reality headset.",
    "But what of the Oculus Quest 3? Well, in a recent Twitter Q&A, vice president of Facebook Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, said that right now, a Quest 3 headset is still \u201ca little way off.\u201d",
    "A new Oculus-related project is currently in development, though, having been confirmed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a January earnings call for the company. Details of the device haven\u2019t yet been officially confirmed as plans for a third generation Quest device, but Zuckerberg told investors, \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to work on new hardware [which] will fit the same platform, so the content that works on Quest 2 should be forward-compatible.\u201d",
    "This could refer to an Oculus Quest Pro, also rumored to arrive in the coming years, but stay tuned to our hub for all the latest news and rumors surrounding the company\u2019s next VR project.",
