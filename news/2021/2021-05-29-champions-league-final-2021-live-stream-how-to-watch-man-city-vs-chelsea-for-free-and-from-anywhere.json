    "City and Chelsea have played each other twice in the past few weeks, with Chelsea dominating and winning both games. They beat the Sky Blues 1-0 in the semi-final of the FA Cup last month, thanks to a goal from Hakim Ziyech, before an astonishingly one-sided 2-1 victory in the Premier League, Ziyech and Marcos Alonso proving the match-winners after three Chelsea goals had been disallowed for offside.",

    "Instead, the whole thing has been shifted to Portugal and the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o in Porto. That's the same stadium that hosted the first ever Nations League Final on 2019, where Portugal beat the Netherlands 1-0.",
