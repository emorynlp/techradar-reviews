    "The big day is here and this year's Labor Day laptop sales are in full swing. Dell, HP, Best Buy, and Amazon are just some of the top retailers offering a ton of great deals across a range of machines today - all of which we've neatly rounded up just below.",
    "While not 'traditionally' a large component of the larger Labor Day sales, laptops have become an increasing staple at many retailers. Coinciding with the back-to-school period, Labor Day laptop sales tend to be the best chance to bag a bargain before Black Friday rolls around in November. Luckily, this year's event has plenty of options for all sorts of budgets.",
    "So far, HP and Dell are the forerunners in mid-range value, with the latter having quite a few deals being staggered throughout the day. Strictly on a budget? There are a ton of great cheap Chromebooks at Best Buy right now that are perfect for the basics or school work. Finally, Amazon has just posted the lowest price yet on the stunning Apple MacBook Air M1 at just $849.99. Currently ranked #1 on our best laptops buyer's guide, this one's an easy recommendation from us if you're looking for a premium ultrabook.",
    "At the bottom of the article, we've also included some information to really help you find the best machine for your requirements, as well as links to the top Labor Day laptop sales retailers - should you want to check out their full listings by yourself.",
    "One last thing - this article is a living list of recommendations and we'll be updating it regularly with more picks as we spot them. We'd recommend bookmarking this page if you don't spot something right away and checking in throughout the day for more. Note - most of these deals will be expiring tonight, so don't hang around if you're interested!",
    "First thing's first, we'd recommend setting yourself an upper limit for your budget right off the bat before considering any Labor Day laptop sales. If you're looking for a machine for simply the basics like schoolwork or browser tasks, then a Chromebook or basics Windows laptop of around $300 should suffice. For more intensive applications like everyday work use, we'd recommend bumping that budget up to around $550 for a machine with the latest 11th gen Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5-5000 series processors. For niche power-uses like design work, music production, or gaming, then you'll absolutely benefit from bumping that budget all the way up to around $1,000. Gaming laptops especially benefit from spending a bit more to secure those speedy RTX 3000 series graphics cards.",
    "One other tip we have is to watch out for clearance on older machines. Amazon and Walmart in particular are full of third-party sellers trying to clear out old laptops featuring components that are several generations old. While many of these laptops can get the job done, as a rule of thumb we'd recommend going for the latest components if possible as you'll get better mileage in the long run.",
