    "If you're looking for a list of all the new games coming out in 2021 and beyond, we\u2019ve got you covered.",
    "It's been an exciting year for gaming as developers have pushed the power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X, with Battlefield 2042, Returnal, Halo Infinite and more showcasing just what the new consoles are capable of. However, it's not only the next-gen console owners who have had all the fun this year. The Nintendo Switch has had another strong year, with the release of Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and Mario Party Superstars showing that - four years after its release - the Switch remains a must-have console. For those who wanted an extra boost, the House of Mario released the Switch OLED which took the newly released Metroid Dread to another level.",
    "As we hurtle towards the end of the year, there's not much left in the way of new games for 2021 to offer - but 2022 is another matter. Early 2022 (particularly February) looks to be jam-packed with some huge upcoming releases, with Elden Ring, Dying Light 2 and Horizon Forbidden West all landing in that period.",
    "We know it can be challenging to keep track of which upcoming games are being released and when you can expect them. That\u2019s why we've created this guide \u2013 which we regularly update \u2013 filled with the new games coming out in 2021 and beyond, so you always know what's on the horizon. As we're reaching the end of 2021, this list mostly consists of confirmed release dates over the next few months (into 2022), but expect this list to become entirely 2022 focused soon.",
    "Make sure you check out our dedicated platform release date lists too, which cover new PS5 games and new Xbox Series X games."
