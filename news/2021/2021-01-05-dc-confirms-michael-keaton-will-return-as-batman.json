    "DC has confirmed Michael Keaton will once again don the cowl as Batman, alongside Ben Affleck, in the 2022 film The Flash, as the studio attempts to establish a caped crusader multiverse. It\u2019s all a little complicated, and details aren\u2019t exactly crystal clear at this stage, but bear with us.",
    "In an interview with The New York Times, DC Films president Walter Hamada alluded to plans to introduce parallel worlds wherein different versions of the superhero exist simultaneously, in a similar model to Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man.",
    "Confirming Ben Affleck will reprise his role one last time as the caped crusader in the upcoming, Ezra Miller-led The Flash movie, Hamada suggests Keaton \u2013 who starred as the Bat in Tim Burton\u2019s now-revered 1989 Batman \u2013 will also feature as an older Bruce Wayne, in a role similar to Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
    "This isn\u2019t exactly new news. We previously reported that it was likely Keaton would return as the Bat in the upcoming Flash movie. But Hamada\u2019s recent comments have all-but confirmed what was merely a hotly-touted rumour, and added in the surprising news that Affleck \u2013 who famously jettisoned his own plans for a standalone Batman movie \u2013 will star alongside the 69-year-old actor.",
    "It\u2019s a move from the studio that hopes to rectify a major problem posed by the recent string of critically-condemned \u2013 but commercially successful \u2013 DCU movies. Zack Snyder\u2019s Batman v Superman and Justice League left critics unimpressed and polarised fans of the comics, but nonetheless introduced a swathe of highly-bankable DC characters who have since received their own standalone titles (Wonder Woman and Aquaman among them). At the same time, other filmmakers were developing DC projects based in universes\u2019 wholly detached from Snyder\u2019s \u2013 meaning Hamada, who took over the studio in 2018, was faced with the challenge of fostering the coexistence of all these movies and characters without any one contradicting the other.",
    "In a concept already in full swing over at Marvel Studios \u2013 the third Marvel Cinematic Universe Spider-Man film will reportedly re-introduce Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield alongside Tom Holland\u2019s web-slinger \u2013 DC has opted to pursue the multiverse idea. In short, some characters (Henry Caville\u2019s Superman, Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman etc.) will occupy Earth 1, while newer incarnations (Pattinson\u2019s Batman, for instance) will exist in Earth 2.",
    "They are separate universes, meaning the actions of one character won\u2019t impact the actions of their equivalent character in a different universe.",
    "The Flash movie, Hamada says, will link the two \u2013 meaning we could see three different Batmen (Keaton, Affleck and Pattinson) existing in the same world. We just don\u2019t know how yet.",
    "\"I don't think anyone else has ever attempted [the multiverse concept] on screen,\" Hamada said in the interview. \"But audiences are sophisticated enough to understand it. If we make good movies, they will go with it.\"",
    "Making good movies has been the studio's problem ever since Christopher Nolan\u2019s searing The Dark Knight trilogy concluded in 2012. Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker was, as befits DC, the most polarising film of 2019, and rumours are still floating as to whether Pattinson\u2019s Batman will, in some capacity, confront Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Clown Prince of Crime.",
    "The point is, the studio\u2019s plans for a multiverse mean there are lots, lots more DCU movies to come \u2013 and when you\u2019ve got some of the world\u2019s most iconic characters to work with, that can only be a good thing."
