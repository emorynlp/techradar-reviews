  "article": [
    "Outriders is the most forgettable looter shooter I\u2019ve played in a long time. Playing the co-op shooter looter\u2019s prologue, as part of the free demo, I felt nothing but sheer boredom. Every bit of lore fed to me poured out of my brain immediately, every character\u2019s name a fleeting memory and every bit of gear as beige as the last - there\u2019s something to be said about a game that loses you within the first few minutes.",
    "The Outriders demo has done nothing for me except guarantee that I absolutely won\u2019t be buying it upon release \u2013 I won\u2019t even be picking up the demo again if I can help it.",
    "But what stings most about Outriders\u2019 lackluster offering is that Square Enix had such a big opportunity in its lap. As one of the few brand new co-op shooters landing on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and one of the very first of 2021, Outriders could have cemented its place as the PS5\u2019s must-have co-op shooter. Instead, it was a wasted opportunity.",
    "The co-op shooter is seeing a resurgence. In a time when people are most wanting to feel connected, there\u2019s nothing that achieves that goal quite like teaming up with a friend a couple of nights a week to take on some \u2018Big Bad\u2019. And, given how oversaturated the PvP market is, it\u2019s a smart move for developers to make.",
    "2021 looks to be the year of co-op shooters, with the likes of Halo Infinite, Back 4 Blood and Alien: Fireteam all slated for release. So Outriders is in a very fortunate position, being the first horse out of the gate on both PS5 and Xbox Series X to offer fans the brand new next-gen shooter experience they\u2019ve been after. But while Halo Infinite is likely to claim the must-have co-op shooter crown on the Series X, the coveted title remains up for grabs on the PS5.",
    "Sure, there are a handful of co-op shooters on PS5 already, many of which are either PS4 games being played via backwards compatibility or PS4 games with next-gen enhancements, but there\u2019s nothing new. With the Outriders demo, Square Enix was presented with a chance to get those co-op shooter fans under its wing, to rip them away from the likes of Destiny and The Division and offer them a brand new cooperative shooter to sink their teeth into.",
    "And a demo is a fantastic idea. It gives players the chance to try out the game before they drop their hard-earned money on it and to provide feedback \u2013 but it\u2019s also meant to grip us.",
    "Outriders may be new but its ideas aren\u2019t. Between its low-grade Mass Effect style, Gears of War roadie run and Destiny-like mission structure, it feels like a game I\u2019ve played a million times before - some sort of Frankenstein mix-match of co-op shooters.",
    "That\u2019s not to say that this can\u2019t sometimes be a good thing, innovation in games is lauded but the key to it is adding your own stamp. While Outriders tries to do this with its inclusion of Class Skills, essentially super abilities that let you set enemies aflame or teleport, it\u2019s not enough to prop up an overall quite underwhelming game. The combat is often one-note, despite these abilities, the story and its characters uninspiring and the weapon choice leaves much to be desired. Don\u2019t even get me started on the cutscenes.",
    "The only time I found Outriders to be somewhat bearable was when playing with others and, frankly, I think it was more the company than the game itself that made it a somewhat enjoyable experience. I happily had a chat with TechRadar\u2019s finest, while mindlessly spraying down hordes of enemies. The only benefit was Outriders\u2019 mindless gameplay made it easier to focus on the conversation: simply gunning down hordes of enemies one after another, maybe set something on fire, more gunning. While sometimes you want a low-pressure task while playing games online with friends, there\u2019s a difference between fun low-pressure (like navigating a jellybean over a series of seesaws) and low-pressure boredom.",
    "And while you could try to chalk this up to what I\u2019ve played just being a demo, Square Enix emphasized that this was a polished demo rather than a beta and the game itself will remain largely unchanged upon release on April 1 \u2013 save for some bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.",
    "Playing the demo on PS5, I was expecting a shooter that would utilize the console\u2019s raw power, delivering stunning visuals, smooth frame rates and speedy load times, but it doesn\u2019t. Instead, Outriders managed to go back a step and look more like a PS3 game than a PS5 game.",
    "Outriders isn\u2019t what I hoped it would be, but it does leave the door open for another co-op shooter to become a PS5 must-have.",
    "While the likes of Destiny and The Division still thrive on PS5, they aren\u2019t the most hospitable games for new players, and there\u2019s room for a brand new cooperative shooter to land on the new console, creating a new community - with a clean slate - that both shooter veterans and newbies can enjoy.",
    "Right now, that is lacking. But who knows, maybe Outriders could claw it back? At this point, with an official release encroaching in a matter of weeks, it doesn\u2019t look likely and Outriders looks to befall the same fate as Marvel\u2019s Avengers: becoming another forgettable looter shooter. Let\u2019s just hope another developer takes up the gauntlet and runs with it."
