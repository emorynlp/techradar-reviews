    "We\u2019ve been hearing for a while that Apple might upgrade the screen on a future iPad model, offering a Mini LED display rather than an LCD one, and it now looks like that day could come sooner rather than later.",
    "DigiTimes claims that it expects Apple will \u201cpossibly\u201d launch a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini LED screen in the first quarter of 2021 (so by the end of March).",
    "We would however take this with a pinch of salt, as the site doesn\u2019t sound very certain, and it appears to have come to this conclusion based on claims from Epistar\u2019s company president, Fan Chin-yung, that \u201cshipments for mini LED chips will begin to contribute to consolidated revenues in first-quarter 2021.\u201d",
    "Epistar produces LEDs, so it presumably wouldn\u2019t make this comment if it didn\u2019t have customers lined up, though there\u2019s no confirmation that Apple is one of them, and \u2013 according to DigiTimes \u2013 Fan Chin-yung additionally stated that large-volume shipments of Mini LED chips wouldn\u2019t begin until the second or third quarter, and that revenues from them wouldn\u2019t peak until then either.",
    "So based on that it sounds to us like a Mini LED iPad Pro might not arrive until later in 2021, assuming it launches this year at all.",
    "Still, it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve heard there could be a Mini LED iPad Pro at some point in 2021, and it\u2019s a change we\u2019d like to see, as Mini LED can improve contrast and color reproduction, as well as being more energy-efficient than an LCD screen.",
    "The iPad Pro 2020 launched back in March, so we may well see an iPad Pro 2021 this coming March, whether or not it uses this new screen tech. If such a slate is landing that soon we\u2019d expect plenty more leaks and rumors in the coming weeks and months, so stay tuned to TechRadar for all the updates.",
