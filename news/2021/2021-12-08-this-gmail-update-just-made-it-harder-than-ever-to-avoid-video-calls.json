    "Avoiding video conferencing meetings could soon be trickier than ever now that Google has made it much simpler to join a video or audio call via Gmail.",
    "The company has announced that users can now start or join meetings and audio calls from 1:1 chats in Google Chat in Gmail on Android and iOS.",
    "\"As some teams begin to return to office, while others remain distributed, we hope this makes it easier to connect with your colleagues in the hybrid work world,\" Google wrote in a blog post announcing the new addition. \"This feature will allow you to seamlessly switch between chat to a video or audio call when needed, helping you collaborate and move your work forward.\"",
    "Going forward, Gmail users will now see a phone and video icon in the top right corner of a 1:1 Google chat window that, when clicked, will start a direct call with the contact.",
    "In order to join a call, you just need to select the phone or video chip within the 1:1 chat window, and while on a call, you\u2019ll see a banner of the person you\u2019re on a call with, the call duration and a Meet icon in the chat roster.",
    "Missed calls will be indicated with a red phone or video icon within the conversation and the chat roster.",
    "The feature is hosted as part of Gmail, so if you select to join a call from the Google chat app, you'll be redirected to the Gmail app. If you don't have the Gmail app installed on your device, you\u2019ll be prompted to download it via Google Play store or the App Store",
    "The feature, which will be rolled out to all Google Workspace customers, as well as G Suite Basic and Business customers by default, is currently only available for 1:1 meetings so far. This means there's no group calls for the moment, but given the ongoing popularity of video calls, this can't be too far away."
