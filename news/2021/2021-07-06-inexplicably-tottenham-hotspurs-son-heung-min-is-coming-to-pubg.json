    "Unexpected pop culture collaborations are nothing new in the gaming world. Travis Scott hosted a virtual concert in Fortnite, Fall Guys\u2019 jellybean creatures got a wearable Godzilla skin and Jango Fett, for some reason, popped up in Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 4.",
    "But it\u2019s footballers who continue to establish themselves as gaming\u2019s weirdest commercial partners in 2021, and PUBG\u2019s latest off-the-pitch alliance is no different. Yes, Tottenham Hotspur's Son Heung-Min is coming to the popular battle royale game.",
    "PUBG first teased the collaboration via Twitter back in June, and did so again more recently, but eagle-eyed data miners have uncovered what to expect from the partnership when the game\u2019s 12.2 update arrives on July 7.",
    "Images shared by PlayerIGN reveal an eight-piece cosmetic bundle as part of the collaboration with the South Korean winger, which is set to include two sportswear outfits, a signed helmet, the player\u2019s game face, two new weapon skins and two of the player\u2019s iconic celebrations as emotes.",
    "The bundle will likely be available to purchase via PUBG\u2019s in-game store, though there\u2019s no word on how much it will set you back. We\u2019re guessing around 1000 G-Coin \u2013 approximately $10 / \u00a310 / AU$13 \u2013 if recent cosmetic bundles are anything to go by, though previous items have exceeded that amount.",
    "It\u2019s also still unclear whether Son will continue to work with Krafton, the game\u2019s developer, as a brand ambassador for PUBG, or whether this cosmetic set represents the extent of their partnership. We\u2019re assuming the latter, similar to Neymar Jr\u2019s one-time collaboration with Fortnite.",
    "For a better look at Son in PUBG, PlayerIGN also shared some promo shots of the player modelling (virtually, of course) the new skins in the game world, which were officially posted to the PUBG Weibo account.",
    "What is clear, at least, is that we can expect countless Son-related memes to emerge when the game\u2019s update drops on July 7.",
    "\"Are ya winning, Son?\", \"Cheers, Son's crying\" \u2013 you get the idea..."
