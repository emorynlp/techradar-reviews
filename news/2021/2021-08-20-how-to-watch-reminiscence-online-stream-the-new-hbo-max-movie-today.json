    "From the co-creator of HBO\u2019s Westworld comes an edge-of-your-seat science fiction movie set in the very near future. Starring Hugh Jackman and Thandiwe Newton, it\u2019s a visually stunning film driven by a gripping central mystery. Here we explain how to watch Reminiscence online with a HBO Max subscription, available to stream for 31 days from its theatrical debut.",
    "Written and directed by Lisa Joy, Reminiscence takes place in a Miami permanently submerged by flood-waters and where civil disorder is a regular occurrence.",
    "Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) is a rugged ex-veteran who, along with his business partner Watts (Newton), provides individuals with the opportunity to re-live any memory they desire. In a chaotic present, there\u2019s solace to be found in the certainty of the past.",
    "The film introduces a noir-inspired mystery when Mae (played by Rebecca Ferguson) arrives to procure Nick\u2019s services. They embark on a brief yet passionate love affair. But, when she suddenly vanishes, an infatuated Nick is determined to discover her whereabouts: especially after another client\u2019s memories implicate her in a series of violent crimes.",
    "While recalling iconic sci-fi dystopias like Blade Runner (1982), Reminiscence is grounded in a more plausible reality: offering a spectacular vision of a world in which climate change is an omnipresent feature of daily life. It\u2019s also action packed, full of incredible set pieces, and tethered to a provocative story.",
    "Read our guide below for how to watch Reminiscence online from anywhere. We\u2019re betting it\u2019ll be a movie worth remembering.",
    "Across much of the globe cinemas are open again, and so movies like Reminiscence are getting an international theatrical release. If you feel like venturing out, the film lands on Thursday, August 19 in Australia, while it's available the same day as the US in both the UK and Canada on August 20.",
    "Currently, there\u2019s no confirmation whether Reminiscence will be procured by any of the major VOD platforms in these territories. However, many of the 2021 Warner Brothers films released on HBO Max \u2013 like The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It \u2013 have been made available internationally to rent as PVOD (premium video on demand) titles, on services like Amazon Prime Video, Apple iTunes, and Google Play Store. While we don\u2019t know for certain yet, it\u2019ll be worth checking these websites to see if that holds true for Reminiscence.",
    "As well as instant access to new Warner Bros. blockbusters \u2013 James Wan\u2019s horror thriller Malignant is next up on September 10 \u2013 you get over 10,000 hours of prime content: choice picks from the Warner Bros. archive and subsidiary companies like New Line Cinema, Studio Ghibli\u2019s animated masterpieces, DC Entertainment blockbusters like Wonder Woman: 1984.",
    "Plus \u2013 the clue's in the name \u2013 you can watch every iconic HBO series ever made. Enjoy The Sopranos, Euphoria, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Westworld, plus all 10 seasons of iconic sitcom Friends, addictive HBO Max Originals like Gossip Girl, and so much more."
