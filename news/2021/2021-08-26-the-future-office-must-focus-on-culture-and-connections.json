    "The future of the office, and the experience it will offer, has been a hot topic for the past year. Just this month studies have revealed that a massive 3 in 4 professionals prefer the flexibility of working from home with over half saying they are anxious about the restrictions easing. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen speculation that there may not be such thing as an office, and that we will all work remotely. Others are looking to put a hybrid model in place, but no matter your opinion, the easing of lockdown means that we will likely know what the office of the future will look like in the coming months.",
    "Many companies have put new policies in place to begin in the next few months. Nokia has adopted a hybrid working model with three days remote, and the Bank of England is asking staff to come into the office for a minimum of one day a week from September, for example.",
    "Mike and I met each other on a Zoom call recently to talk about our perspectives on the re-invention of the office. I (Simon), got into the video collaboration industry after finding video calls as a way of keeping in touch when away from home, and became passionate about making the technology easier to use and \u2018adoptable\u2019. Mike has experienced 15 years in real estate, and is driving strategy with some of the biggest enterprises out there as to what their premises could become post-Covid.",
    "I\u2019m an introvert and will remain mostly home-based as I have done for years, while Mike is more extroverted, and will follow a hybrid balance. That being said, we\u2019re aligned in believing that the office won\u2019t become a relic of the past, but it will evolve into a destination to collaborate, not just a place to work. Below, we share our thoughts on the office of the future.",
    "Mike: The biggest companies in the world manifest their brand in their physical environments, and their culture is defined by more than just a strap line. A team\u2019s willingness to help others collaborate on projects, or being able to have a spontaneous drink at the pub are both drives of culture \u2013 and these activities are more physical than virtual.",
    "Some of this can be done with a remote catch-up, but corporate purpose and a sense of community comes from physical interaction. There will be hybrid working in most companies, but it must become more of a balance than the model we\u2019re working in now, where many employees work mostly or entirely at home.",
    "When the pandemic hit, we tried to move office life as we knew it online. We lost the energy and creativity of real-life meets, and we still haven\u2019t quite pinpointed how we can bring it back effectively. A truly hybrid working world will need this, as the home and office involve different ways of working and communicating.",
    "Simon: Logitech is a video-first organization and our CEO gives regular video updates to employees which helps set the tone of our company culture. It\u2019s an example that make virtual communication an everyday and productive experience for all employees.",
    "However, we also know the value of places for colleagues to meet, and have 80 offices around the world. These spaces were transforming even pre-pandemic, as a video-first mindset ensured 20, 30, even 50% of the people joining meetings didn\u2019t have to be in the same building. It\u2019s important for distributed teams \u2013 whether across the country, the world or different job functions \u2013 to have this capability.",
    "Logitech creates products that are useful to people\u2019s everyday lives, both digitally and physically, so teams can meet and work in both environments in order to innovate. Other companies will have different requirements \u2013 sales teams may need office space to meet customers in person, and financial groups will want the excitement brought back to the trading floor.",
    "Mike: The office used to be built prioritizing the physical space first, followed by the needs of the humans inside it. Digital technologies were considered last. Advances in technology and design is now changing that. We are seeing a model where considering the people in the office, and how they will be using it, comes first. This includes having a better awareness of employees\u2019 personas, functions and the preferences.",
    "A good example is juniors and new starters, who are trying to find their feet in the world of work. My son spent the first year as a graduate in 2020, and it was all on Zoom. While this was good for short, focused meetings, he\u2019s missed out on ad-hoc on-the-fly chats with peers or seniors, and socializing with colleagues.",
    "For many at this career stage, work lunches and socials, and workplace friendships are very valuable \u2013 and can\u2019t be replicated online. Therefore, I believe working from home has more benefits for senior members of the team. People like Simon and I are established in our roles, can draw on global networks with ease and make connections day-to-day.",
    "Simon: Working from home has shown me how fortunate I am too with my network. However, I think that we will need to make extra effort to stay connected with colleagues we don\u2019t directly work with. Unless we meet in person and catch up, even just from time to time, how long can these vast networks stay truly connected?",
    "Networking has its benefits offline and online, and many of us will need to go back into the office at some point to freshen relationships that could be better grown in person. When this isn\u2019t possible, we need to think about the digital technologies that can equip us to do business remotely.",
    "Mike: Prior to the pandemic, people often regarded those in the office as the most important members of the team. In the worst case, remote workers would join a call but participants in the meeting room would forget their attendance.",
    "We will not be going back to this. Firstly, spaces have been equipped with video and personal workplace technologies that mean remote workers have quality tools the same as in-office workers. Beyond that, no matter an employee\u2019s job role, function or age, most people will choose to work from home for at least part of the week. So, while there\u2019ll be a change of physical office design so meeting rooms can manage half of participants joining virtually, there will be a bigger focus on company culture and how it can be nourished going forwards.",
    "This will require an industrial transformation of office space. This time last year, most of the corporate world got up at 6am, and commuted to an office to access the internet at their desks by 8.30am. But now people have a home office, the city version has to offer something better \u2013 far more than just a fast broadband connection. I think it\u2019ll be the human physical interaction that gets us there \u2013 a cultural injection that cannot be experienced from home."
