    "The producers behind the James Bond movies have confirmed there won\u2019t be any small-screen adventures for 007 in the near future.",
    "In an interview with Total Film, long-time Bond custodian Barbara Broccoli responded to questions surrounding the iconic character\u2019s future following Amazon\u2019s $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM back in May.",
    "\"We make films,\u201d Broccoli asserted. \u201cWe make films for the cinema. That\u2019s what we do,\" adding that MGM has \u201cresisted [calls for a Bond television series] for 60 years.\"",
    "Though no such ambitions were made official by Amazon following the high-profile deal between the two studios, it\u2019s safe to assume that its acquisition of the Bond IP brought with it a wealth of potential spin-off concepts for the streamer.",
    "Hell, following the announcement, even we at TechRadar put together a list of 5 James Bond TV shows we\u2019d like to see on Amazon Prime Video. Awkward.",
    "But Broccoli\u2019s resistance to seeing Bond on the small screen may come as a relief to Bond fans who felt Amazon\u2019s acquisition of MGM threatened the integrity of the franchise.",
    "A similarly-beloved IP like Star Wars, for instance, has seen its characters and lore stretched far and wide following Disney\u2019s purchase of Lucasfilm back in 2012. At present, there are 11 different Star Wars TV shows in the works, and while some of them will inevitably hit the mark \u2013 The Mandalorian, for example, has been a roaring success \u2013 Disney runs the risk of wearing thin the appeal of a universe that has held strong for decades.",
    "Of course, Broccoli\u2019s comments also don\u2019t represent a legally-binding stance. Depending on the nature of the deal between Amazon and MGM, there may come a time when the wishes of Bond\u2019s creators are cast aside in favor of the franchise\u2019s unquestionable commercial appeal.",
    "Until then, though, the immediate future of Bond lies with the release of No Time to Die, which is currently scheduled for release on September 30 in the UK and October 8 in the US.",
    "\"It\u2019s tough to think about the future until this film has its moment,\" Broccoli told Total Film. \"I think we just really want to celebrate this and celebrate Daniel, and then when the dust settles, then look at the landscape and figure out what the future is.\u201d",
    "That sounds to us like the small screen door is ajar, rather than locked shut..."
