    "It\u2019s not often that Conor McGregor inspires the writing of a tech article. Often brash and expletive-laden, the exploits of Ireland\u2019s maverick martial artist are usually best left to the disposable pages of the tabloids. But seriously, did you *see* his latest watch?",
    "Supposedly a bejewelled representation of the night sky, McGregor\u2019s $1million (\u00a3740,000) timepiece is cut from a 288-facet spherical diamond and reflects every ray of incoming light, illuminating the night sky of its glass dome. Honestly, it looks like the Golden Compass on steroids \u2014 ostentatiousness personified.",
    "McGregor can do what he pleases with his inordinate wealth, but his latest display of extravagance got me thinking about watches. Namely the smart and not-so-smart variety. As I sit writing this, I\u2019m minded to think about the whole point of a watch. What makes the perfect horological companion? \u201cA fine balance between design and function\u201d is probably the textbook answer, but everyone\u2019s got their preferences.",
    "I also take a look down at my own wrist and think about how to spend the next few hundred words justifying the purchase of a piece of kit I saved many, many years for; the labour of various birthday contributions, try-scoring weekends, hours spent lifeguarding at the local pool and even my first professional paycheck. Not for anything sensible like a high-end PC or a new car, mind, but for what is essentially a 35mm stainless steel box with two bits of leather attached to either side \u2014 and all it does is tell the time.",
    "It\u2019s almost embarrassing to admit, as a technology writer, that this is all it does. It doesn\u2019t even have a date window. In the age of neatly-packaged heart monitors, day-planners, mobile phones and sat-navs designed to sit smartly on even the smallest wrists, an overpriced time-teller doesn\u2019t seem the most shrewd acquisition for a journalist with a responsibility to keep up with the latest and greatest gadgets. What\u2019s more, it doesn\u2019t even do that basic function particularly well \u2014 have you ever tried reading black roman numerals in the dark? The point being, it\u2019s as far from an Apple Watch 6 as you could get; less Elon Musk and more Jay Gatsby.",
    "Of course, that\u2019s not all a simple wristwatch does. Not really. Sure, they tell the time. But they also do what pretentious chrono-heads say every good watch should do \u2014 they tell a story. They\u2019ve got a history, a lineage, a Batman-worthy origin tale. They\u2019ve got film credits, famous owners, and a refreshing simplicity that reminds you of what once was deemed groundbreaking technology. They don\u2019t have the bells and whistles needed to alert you to hydrate during a marathon or see a doctor when your blood pressure increases, but good, old-fashioned timepieces are the reason why smartwatches won\u2019t ever take over the world. They\u2019re invulnerable to progress.",
    "It might seem odd to find a smartwatch-bashing article on a smartwatch-loving website, but in fact you haven\u2019t found that at all. Smartwatches are increasingly stylish and frequently awesome bits of tech. Look no further than our Apple Watch, Fitbit and Garmin roundups for a sense of the acclaim we often bestow upon the latest wearable devices \u2014 they\u2019re durable, genuinely smart in more ways than one and represent a rapidly-developing industry which sees millions (and millions) of consumers pick up smartwatches every year. Hell, some of them are practically laptops for the wrist.",
    "Smartwatches are versatile, stylish and a relatively inexpensive way to instantly augment your life towards quicker and easier communication, better health and seamless synergy between you and your various other day-to-day devices. But unlike how cell phones replaced the telephone and music streaming condemned CDs to the grave, smartwatches still haven\u2019t kicked wristwatches to the curb. And they won\u2019t any time soon.",
    "Most developments in technology will eventually forcibly replace their predecessors \u2014 that is, of course, the point of technology. We\u2019ve seen it happen in industries the world over for hundreds of years, from filmmaking and photography (the jump from film to digital) to telephones and computers (these days, both play second fiddle to smartphones). If a new product delivers a result quicker and more easily than a previous version, the latter becomes outmoded. Take trains as an example. Nobody operates coal-powered steam trains anymore because there\u2019s no benefits to be gained from doing so. Newer trains are just, well, better. The sentimentality of quaint, fudge-selling railway stations isn\u2019t enough to justify the maintenance of a slow, environmentally-damaging mode of transport.",
    "Inevitable technological developments also occur when the domain \u2014 the playing field \u2014 of a particular product changes. It\u2019ll happen, eventually, with conventional automobiles. Sure, there\u2019ll be a whole load of people who would rather hold on to their manual-gearboxes and desperately hope to preserve the authentic driving experience \u2014 it\u2019s something that happens even now, with some folk only driving classic cars \u2014 but what happens when highways move into the sky and fuel disappears completely in place of electricity, hydrogen or another lean, clean energy source? The point being, consumers will be forced to move with technology as the machines of the past no longer maintain a place in the world. In 2083, how could you still hope to drive a car from this generation if the future goes all Blade Runner on us?",
    "And yet, I\u2019d wager the Rick Deckard\u2019s of the future will still be sporting conventional wristwatches. While VCRs, record players and even roads get lost to history, the (hopefully) undeviating nature of the human wrist means it\u2019s unlikely traditional watchmaking will get left behind.",
    "Consider the advent of the first wristwatch. In 1904, Alberto Santos-Dumont, an early Brazilian aviator, asked his friend, a French watchmaker called Louis Cartier, to design a watch that could be useful during his flights. 117 years later, the design of the Cartier Santos remains almost identical to that worn by the pilot prior to the First World War. I\u2019m straining to think of another technology that can boast such permanence.",
    "Only letter-writing comes to mind as a useful comparison. People still hand-write cards and letters (albeit less frequently) despite the ease of email and instant messaging because the process requires care and attention, therefore the words enclosed carry greater meaning when they reach their intended recipients. The words aren\u2019t just words, per se, but something more human.",
    "The same is true of watches. Many are still built by hand using manufacturing processes that haven\u2019t changed in over a century, and so represent the product of someone\u2019s skill and labour. They\u2019re often passed down from generation to generation because they signify a piece of history \u2014 if you\u2019ll allow the wordplay, they immortalise a moment in time. Mine, I hope, will last long after I\u2019m gone. It will remind me of my first jobs, the time it took to pick out, the family members who helped along the way and those who are no longer around to tell their stories. It will remind me of the troublesome year in which it was bought and the craftsmen of a by-gone generation who first conceived its design. It\u2019s an homage to the past and, one day, to me.",
    "As easy as an Apple Watch makes calling a friend or taking an ECG, it\u2019s not something worth putting in a box for your grandchildren. Perhaps, in a hundred years, when cars are flying above our heads and robots roam the streets, we\u2019ll look back on today\u2019s smartwatches with the same misty-eyed nostalgia as we do yesterday\u2019s wristwatches \u2014 but I\u2019m not convinced. Planned obsolescence means most smartwatches are abandoned as quickly as their flashier counterparts are introduced, left lifeless, out of juice and in need of software updates that won\u2019t ever come. Will we remember the day Apple put a temperature sensor on our wrists? Only time will tell, I guess."
