    "It\u2019s not exactly official compatibility, but those looking to use their Nvidia GeForce Now PC game streaming accounts on their Xbox Series X or S consoles are in luck. If you fire up the service through the consoles\u2019 Microsoft Edge browser, you\u2019ll be able to sit back on the couch and play hundreds of PC games to your heart's content.",
    "As ever with the Nvidia GeForce Now service (set at $9.99 / \u00a38.99 a month for new members), mileage will vary as to the speed of your internet connection, as the games are streamed in from cloud servers. Also, you\u2019ll have to own the title you want to play from Nvidia\u2019s library of a few hundred, on Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG or elsewhere before you can start playing \u2013 but at least you don\u2019t have to purchase them twice. The subscription here is purely to access Nvidia\u2019s servers, which do a great job of delivering the games with high-end visuals intact.",
    "With the Xbox\u2019s mouse and keyboard support, it\u2019s a great way to play PC games that otherwise wouldn\u2019t make it to the console, be that Warhammer RTS games or MOBAs like DOTA 2, or even older classics like the first The Witcher game.",
    "Access to streaming services like GeForce Now \u2013 through a console \u2013 act to further blur the line between what is the expected divide between PC and console gaming. Through cloud servers and a decent web connection, you can be enjoying Gordon Freeman\u2019s Half-Life exploits with an Xbox pad in hand with little fuss.",
    "It\u2019s a stance that Xbox has already embraced with this generation of consoles through its own \u2018Play Anywhere\u2019 mantra \u2013 with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you\u2019re able to play any first-party Microsoft game day one on both its consoles and a gaming PC, and carry progress over between the two. The exceptions to this rule are few, with Age of Empires 4 being the only recent point of contention.",
    "That\u2019s not to say that rivalries between the platform holders won\u2019t still rear their heads. Though Sony PlayStation is slowly adding its back catalogue of games to PC, according to The Verge\u2019s Tom Warren it appears the PlayStation console-exclusive Death Stranding can\u2019t be accessed through GeForce Now on Xbox, despite it having a native PC version available from another publisher. Contractual obligations may still tie certain titles down, but this is the most open the platform gates have ever been. It\u2019s a great time to be a gamer."
