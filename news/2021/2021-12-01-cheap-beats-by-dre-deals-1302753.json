    "If you're looking to score a pair of cheap Beats headphones, then you've come to the right place. We're rounding up all the best Beats headphones sales and deals that are available online. Beats headphones are something of an institution when it comes to consumer audio tech and are absolutely up there with the very best brands when it comes to popularity. Acquired by Apple back in the heady days of 2014, the Beats brand has gone from strength to strength and now encompasses a wide range of over-ear headphones and in-ear earphones. For you Beats deals hunters, that means some fantastic cheap Beats Headphones sales on the older models, although the new ones are often for sale as well. There are Beats Headphone prices for everyone as well, thankfully, as prices range from just $45/\u00a359 all the way to $249/\u00a3249.",
    "On the over-ear and on-ear side of the Beats headphones range you'll find the Beats Solo Pro and Beats Studio 3 Wireless leading the charge with the best sound and highest price. The Beats Solo 3 Wireless is the most popular option, and also one of the more recent, with an on-ear slightly more compact design. Meanwhile, the Beats EP is a cheap Beats headphone option that goes for under $100. You can also still pick up a pair of Beats Pro headphones, made for DJs - though they're no longer listed on the Beats website.",
    "Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro are the latest true wireless earbuds in the Beats in-ear headphone range, offering totally wireless listening with a sporty finish \u2013 think Apple Airpods but with better noise isolation and better sound.",
    "They're backed up by the Powerbeats3 Wireless, the previous wireless option that connects the earphones behind your neck. The Powerbeats3 and the slightly newer Beats X, a more traditional style of wireless earbuds, are your best bet for cheap Beats headphone sales right now. However, at the bottom end, you also have the wired urBeats3 earphones, available with either 3.5mm or Lightning connector for an iPhone. This is where you'll find the best Beats headphones prices, but not necessarily the quality to back them up.",
    "If you're shopping the latest Beats headphones sales but aren't sure which ones to get or where to find the best Beats prices, you've come to the right place. We've compared every model still readily available - both the newest models and also the now slightly older and cheaper ones - to show you what each pair of Beats headphones does best to help you decide on a pair. You can also find deals on Beats headphones and more with our Memorial Day sales roundup.",
    "The Powerbeats Pro were certainly worth the wait, especially if you've been waiting for the most exercise-friendly Beats headphones yet. Sure, we had the Powerbeats 3 back in 2016, but these are true-wireless, meaning there's no cable connecting the two earpieces here. The hook that reaches behind the ear feels better than ever and ensures your Beats stay in place during any activity.",
    "In addition to that signature bass-heavy sound, you're getting surprisingly adept quality in mid-range clarity as well as superior noise-isolation to the AirPods. Make no mistake though, Beats are at their best with high-energy, big tunes. So, if you're hitting the gym, these are the Beats you want. They're not waterproof mind, so be careful if you go running in the rain.",
    "We're loving the 9-hour battery and that can be boosted to around 24 hours thanks to the charging case that comes with the new Powerbeats Pro headphones. Running late? A five-minute quick charge gives you 90 minutes of playback. Nice.",
    "Even better, the Powerbeats Pro see regular inclusion in cheap Beats headphones sales, making them a fantastic option for deal hunters in particular.",
    "The newest Beats on the block are a fantastic addition to the series and a tempting purchase for anyone looking for a set of cans with decent noise-canceling tech.",
    "Studier than the Solo 3 line and sporting a cool matte finish in each color, the Beats Solo Pro feel like the biggest step up in quality the series has seen in some time for its larger line of headphones. Beats work best with iPhones and pair fast thanks to modern chipsets and we're loving the hands-free Siri integration too which is a first on the Beats Solo Pro.",
    "The active noise-cancelation brings Apple's Beats somewhat closer to the best offerings from Sony and Bose, although those two are still ahead by some distance. We do like the simple-one button access to the transparency mode here though. This optional feature allows some outside noise to come through, which can be handy in an office if you want to be aware of someone calling your name or making sure you're aware of traffic around you when walking or cycling.",
    "You'll see one of the higher Beats headphones prices attached to this particular set of cans, but for a 2019 model with such power as these it's easily worth it.",
    "If you have a modern iPhone and want a pair of the best Beats headphones made specifically for Apple's latest range, you really should take a look at the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones. In addition to a fantastic wireless connection and punchy sound, you're getting a huge battery run-time. A single charge can last for up to 40 hours which could last you for an entire week's worth of commuting between charges.",
    "The Solo 3 Wireless are the most popular over/on-ear headphones in the Beats range and are regularly featured in cheap Beats headphones sales. They're also available in a whole range of different color designs so there's plenty of scope to choose a color scheme that best represents your personality - whether that's jet black or blingy gold!",
    "They fold neatly away in a bag and don't look massive on your head - although there are no noise cancelling options with this model - for that you'd need either the Beats Studio 3 Wireless or the newer Beats Solo Pro. If you're looking for cheap Beats headphones prices on a set of over-ear cans that don't feel outdated in their spec, the 2018 Solo 3 model is for you.",
    "The newest Studio entry in the Beats headphones range is the Beats Studio 3 Wireless. Using an over-ear, closed back design, the Studio 3 is one of the best noise cancelling sets of headphones Beats has ever made. The battery has massively improved too, so you can enjoy music for up to 22 hours, or 40 with the active noise cancellation turned off. The Beats Studio3 Wireless headphones are a great match for users of modern iPhones missing 3.5mm jacks - you can pair them with any smartphone though thanks to the Bluetooth technology. The Studio 3 is available in multiple colors including: red, matte black, white, porcelain rose, blue and shadow grey. They are more expensive compared with the Solo 3 Wireless and they're bulkier and heavier too - so do make sure you're aware of this before you buy.",
    "Long after their reveal alongside the iPhone 7, these eagerly awaited in-ear Beats headphones were finally released in February 2017. These wireless headphones are a perfect match for iPhone owners missing the 3.5mm port. We're particularly impressed by the quick charge feature that gives you two hours of playback from a single five-minute charge. Eight hours from a full charge isn't too shabby either.",
    "There are two versions of the urBeats 3 in-ear headphones to look out for. One with a Lightning connection for modern iPhones and these ones with the traditional 3.5mm jack. It gets better too, as Beats have released a few newer in-ear options since the urBeats 3, meaning the prices has come tumbling down in recent months, making these the cheapest Beats on the market. They're not the best Beats on the market, although the bass performance is impressive from such small buds.",
    "The earphones themselves are the same as the ones above, but they come with a Lightning connector on the end instead of a 3.5mm jack. This is ideal if you want something to use on a modern iPhone or MacBook as we're seeing those items ditch the old headphone port nowadays. The urBeats 3 with Lightning connector is one of the cheapest in the Beats range too, often with massive discounts compared to the original launch price. They do generally cost a touch more than the 3.5mm versions though.",
    "The Beats Pro over-ear headphones aren't as appealing for day-to-day use as they used to be thanks to the latest Solo 3 and Studio 3 lines offering a better overall experience, usually for less money too. This model is consequently no longer in production. But if you're looking for some big, beefy, bassy Beats headphones to use as a DJ or for listening at home they excel in loud environments. The metal frames are incredibly durable too as the rest of the Beats line favour plastic designs.",
    "Do you lead an active lifestyle that requires the lightweight feel of in-ear headphones without the massive cans on your head? Then the Beats headphones range has you covered for that, too, because not all models about that authentic studio design. With an improved 12-hour battery life, you're all set for multiple workouts packed with hours of adrenaline-pumping tunes.",
    "If you'd prefer a true-wireless upgrade though, then you may want to consider the new PowerBeats Pro that we mentioned earlier in this article.",
    "The Beats EP headphones are the cheapest on-ear headphones in the Beats by Dre lineup and are a fine place to start if you've had your eye on the colorful stylings for a while. They're wired via a 3.5mm jack, but at least you'll never have to worry about them running out of battery juice."
