    "With most of the specs for the iPhone 13 range now leaked, we\u2019re getting a clearer idea of the colors that might be offered, with the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max apparently coming in black, silver, rose gold and sunset gold.",
    "That\u2019s according to a leaker known as Lanzuk, posting on Naver (a South Korean social media site), who adds that the sunset gold shade has a bronze appearance, while the rose gold model looks very pale.",
    "For reference, the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max come in a choice of graphite, silver, gold or pacific blue. So if this leak is right then silver might be the only model that remains for the iPhone 13 Pro range, with the rest of the colors being different, given that the golds mentioned here don\u2019t sound the same as the current gold option.",
    "Some of these colors we\u2019ve heard rumored before. A matte black shade has been mentioned multiple times and linked specifically to the Pro models, so it looks very likely at this point that it will be among the offered shades. We\u2019ve previously heard that this shade might be more of a very dark grey though, and have a metallic look.",
    "We\u2019ve also previously heard that a bronze or orange color could be in the works, which could be the sunset gold shade mentioned here. However, previous sources didn\u2019t sound very sure that this would make it past the prototype stage, so we were less confident that we\u2019d see it.",
    "Rose gold hasn\u2019t been mentioned before, but rose pink has, and Apple has made phones in a rose gold shade in the past, so it\u2019s certainly possible that we\u2019ll see a return of this.",
    "By the sounds of things, all of these colors would also be in keeping with Apple\u2019s habit of using understated colors for its priciest phones \u2013 a habit we wish it would break.",
    "Still, nothing is certain yet, and nor will it be until Apple unveils the iPhone 13 range, which we\u2019re expecting it to do sometime in September. But we\u2019ll be sure to bring you all the credible iPhone 13 news and leaks in the meantime.",
