    "Major spoilers follow for Foundation episodes 1 to 4. Watch them first before reading on.",
    "It\u2019s about time, Foundation. After four episodes of politicking, sluggish plot pacing and character introductions, Apple TV Plus\u2019 sci-fi series is preparing to up the ante in an action capacity.",
    "Barbarians at the Gate, episode 4\u2019s official title, doesn\u2019t deliver any meaningful action, but what it does do is act as a precursor for the battles to come. Yes, Foundation has taken another episode to get to this point, but it\u2019s a relief that we may finally see something in the way of action in episode 5.",
    "While it makes us wait another week for a long overdue fight sequence (hopefully, anyway), though, Foundation episode 4 isn\u2019t solely composed of filler material.",
    "Barbarians at the Gate is an entry defined by power struggles between the old guard and the new blood, with some intriguing dimensions added to dynamics between various characters. And the show is all the better for it.",
    "Once episode 4\u2019s confusing opening segment is out of the way, it\u2019s clear that divisions are beginning to grow between the Galactic Empire\u2019s three rulers.",
    "Brother Dawn (Cassian Bilton) questions the protocols that Brother Day (Lee Pace) and Dusk (Terrence Mann), as well as those Cleon clones before them, have followed for centuries. The trio also debate religion, science and whether free will has a place in either construct. And, while the conversation reaches a satisfying conclusion, an underlying tension remains.",
    "It\u2019s this straining of their normally tight relationships that, after three and a bit episodes, finally gives us some story payoff later in episode 4.",
    "We see Day lose his temper when the Empire\u2019s most experienced statisticians inform him that, after 35 years of research, Hari Seldon\u2019s predictions aren\u2019t entirely false. Later, we witness Day and Dusk have a suspense-filled standoff as they argue about who should make an important trip to a female-led conclave \u2013 a verbal battle that Days wins. Pace is wonderfully menacing in both scenarios, bringing a level of terror and tyranny that's been somewhat absent from the Empire\u2019s chief ruler so far.",
    "Like the statistician scene, Day\u2019s emotionally charged criticism of Dusk is a throwback to events of an earlier episode. In this case, it\u2019s the Empire\u2019s chilling decision to retaliate to Thespis and Anacreon\u2019s alleged Starbridge attack in episode 2. It\u2019s a perfect example of how traumatic events can affect someone later in life, too, with Day (now the grown-up version of Dawn we saw in episodes 1 and 2) still clearly affected by what he observed as a child.",
    "Plot payoffs aren\u2019t solely reserved for Foundation\u2019s Trantor storyline. On Terminus, we bear witness to the impact that the Empire\u2019s genocidal attack had on Anacreon.",
    "After being ambushed at the end of episode 3, Salvor Hardin (Leah Harvey) turns the tables on Anacreon\u2019s invading forces. Tricking their leader Phara (Kubbra Sait) into believing that she\u2019ll co-operate, Salvor uses the Vault\u2019s disorienting force field to take Phara as her prisoner. Back at Terminus City, Salvor and Hugo interrogate Phara to find out why Anacreon warships are orbiting Terminus.",
    "It\u2019s here where Salvor determines that Phara was a child during the Empire\u2019s retaliatory bombardment of her home world and Thespis. With Anacreon now an uninhabitable planet, Phara\u2019s scouting party was sent to Terminus to steal a spaceship navigation module that would allow them to search for a new world to call home.",
    "Foundation hadn\u2019t followed through on any of its early episode plot threads until this point. Seeing it do so now on Trantor and Terminus, then, is a welcome and necessary change in its narrative direction. Foundation couldn\u2019t have continued to set up future storylines without acknowledging, and returning to, plot points that it had laid before. Thankfully, it\u2019s starting to deliver on that front: here\u2019s hoping that similar pay offs are implemented in later episodes.",
    "Gratifying as those story-focused returns are, Foundation still suffers from a push and pull between too much or too little exposition.",
    "Barbarians at the Gate\u2019s opening five minutes are a perfect example of how Foundation struggles to provide the necessary context to its story. The introduction of a primarily female-centric council, which is due to meet following the death of former leader Proxima Opal, is too swift and confusing to follow. Brother Day is traveling to the conclave by episode 4\u2019s end, so this group is clearly an important part of Foundation\u2019s immediate future. Unless viewers rewatch episode 4\u2019s beginning to understand the conclave\u2019s significance, though, Foundation doesn\u2019t do a good job of establishing them as part of its world.",
    "By contrast, its Terminus storyline is a bit too heavy-handed with the exposition. Salvor practically walks us through Phara\u2019s whole history, including the revelation that she\u2019s Anacreon\u2019s grand-huntress. It\u2019s all a bit easy for Salvor and Terminus\u2019 other key players to work out and, by extension, doesn\u2019t allow viewers to unravel the mystery themselves. There\u2019s a disparity between what Foundation needs to tell us and what it should let us work out for ourselves. The sooner that it finds a balance between the two, the better.",
    "Hopefully, episode 5 will provide Foundation with the opportunity to take stock and iron out those issues. That is, as long as its next entry primarily focuses on the Terminus battle that\u2019s teased in episode 4\u2019s final moments. It would be a shame if Foundation makes us wait another week, especially as it feels that its Terminus storyline has been building to this moment for the past two episodes. And, honestly, we could do without so much talking and politicking for one entry.",
    "If Foundation episode 5 needs to take the occasional break from its first major fight \u2013 just so its audience doesn\u2019t suffer from battle burnout \u2013 it would do well to update us on who is rescuing Lou Llobell\u2019s Gaal Dornick. Episode 4\u2019s final scene shows Gaal\u2019s stasis pod, which has presumably been floating in space all this time, being recovered by an unknown ship. Is it Raych Seldon (Alfred Enoch) or somebody else? With any luck, we\u2019ll find out in episode 5.",
    "Barbarians at the Gate feels like something of a crossroads for Foundation. It carries more tension than some of its predecessors, makes good on some of the plot threads it laid down early on and it's gearing up for some much-needed action.",
    "But it\u2019s still lacking in important areas. A couple of episode 2 moments aside, it\u2019s an emotionally cold show. Combine that with ponderous plot moments and its variance in exposition, and Foundation still feels like it needs a big moment or shocking twist to make its audience sit up and take notice. Think the big death in Game of Thrones season 1 episode 9, or Westworld\u2019s seventh episode \u2013 Trompe L\u2019Oeil \u2013 and you\u2019ll get the idea.",
    "If that comes in its next episode (we\u2019d even take episode 6 at this point), Foundation will turn its fortunes around. There\u2019s enough here to make it a very good show: it\u2019s full of thought-provoking themes, ethical dilemmas, and morally questionable characters. But it needs a major surprise or memorable event to push it into the realms of unmissable TV. Foundation hasn\u2019t found its own yet, and that\u2019ll continue to hold it back until it does.",
    "New episodes of Foundation debut exclusively on Apple TV Plus every Friday."
