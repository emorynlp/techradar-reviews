    "There is nothing quite like the dedicated viewership of the beloved Brooklyn Nine-Nine. With the eighth and final season drawing to a close, now is the ideal time to go back and binge from the start of this hit sitcom. Wherever you are, here's how to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine online and stream every last moment of its 151-episode run.",
    "The show first hit screens back in 2013, with Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8 airing from August 12-September 16. It's been a huge hit since its inception; in fact, there was such an outcry after FOX cancelled the show after its fifth season that NBC snapped up the rights to Brooklyn Nine-Nine...the very next day.",
    "The Emmy and Golden Globe-winning series follows a team of mismatched detectives in the fictional 99th Precinct of the NYPD in Brooklyn. Broadly speaking, it centers around the quirky relationship between Jake Peralta, an immature but talented detective played by Andy Samberg, and his commanding officer, the overly serious but eccentric Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher).",
    "If that doesn't sound that hilarious to you, it's worth knowing Brooklyn Nine-Nine is another collaboration between Dan Goor and Michael Schur, the duo behind Parks and Recreation. Further bolstering Brooklyn Nine-Nine's credentials, Goor has also worked on The Daily Show, while Schur is behind the hugely popular The Good Place.",
    "Convinced? Great. Here's how to watch Brooklyn Nine online from start to finish where you are around the world.",
    "It's good news for Netflix subscribers, as Brooklyn Nine-Nine is available to stream on many of the service's international platforms. It's one of the best Netflix UK shows around and can also be found on Netflix Australia and Netflix Canada. However, what Brooklyn Nine-Nine seasons you can watch on Netflix will vary by region, with details below on where you can stream older episodes where you are.",
    "The final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine - season 8 - probably won't come to Netflix for a while, so read on to find out where you can catch the absolute latest episodes right now.",
    "If you find yourself abroad in a country where your preferred streaming service isn't available or you can't log-in to watch the show as usual, that's probably down to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Thankfully, help is at hand. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite show no matter where you are, simply by changing your IP address to one that's back in your country of residence. Here's how to get started with this essential bit of streaming software."
