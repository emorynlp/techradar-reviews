    "The opening weekend of the Spring Classics concludes with the Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne, aka the KBK, which as ever follows hot on the heels of yesterday's Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Follow our guide below as we explain how to get a Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online from anywhere today.",
    "Both are one-day events on the cobbles, but the Kuurne has a reputation for being more of a game for sprinters and gamblers and, famously, nobody has won both on the same weekend. It's always an unpredictable ride and a great way to start the new UCI season.",
    "The 2021 Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne is the 72nd edition of the race, which was first held in 1946, though strangely enough Brussels hasn't actually featured on the route for more than half a century.",
    "Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step's Kasper Asgreen was victorious here a year ago, becoming the first Danish rider to win the race in 24 years.",
    "He broke away early, with 30km of the race remaining and was more than half a minute ahead of the chasing pack with 15 km to go. But as the chase picked up speed and the strength in Asgreen's legs started dropping, there were just metres in it - but the exhausted Dane held on for the win.",
    "It was Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step's second successive KBK triumph, and Asgreen is back to defend his title, riding alongside Yves Lampaert, Zdenek \u0160tybar and \u00c1lvaro Hodeg.",
    "The final 50km of the route are more or less flat, which always makes for a chaotic finish - two riders ruined their race last yer by flying across a roundabout and taking the wrong exit - so read on for everything you need to know to watch a Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne live stream from anywhere in the world right now.",
    "Prepare to dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book if you want to 'voir en direct', because anyone in Belgium can watch a FREE Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne live stream on Sporza, while those in France can get the race on L'Equipe without paying a penny.",
    "If you're a resident of either country abroad right now, and you're worried about missing the action, all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "Our latest 2021 testing showed our recommended VPN working well on both these platforms from abroad, and we'll be sure to confirm for this race as soon as it's under way.",
    "If you're desperate to watch the Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
