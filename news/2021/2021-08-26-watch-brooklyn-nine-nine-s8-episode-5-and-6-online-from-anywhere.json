    "Season 8 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine is racing by and this week marks the halfway point in the final season ever (we're not crying, you are). Our favorite comedy police show has already taken on some hard-hitting real-world conversations, so what does the rest of the season have in store? Here's how to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8, episode 5 and 6 online where you are and find out.",
    "So far season 8 has organically tackled the very real issue of our broken justice system and our favorite fictional characters from the NYPD have experienced break-ups, career changes, and more in light of the racial injustice in the US. But don't worry, the sitcom still brings plenty of humor to the table while tackling these hard-hitting issues.",
    "In the latest instalment of Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8, new parents Jake and Amy struggle to balance parenthood and work when a new murder case comes across Jake's desk. An old nemesis of Jake's (we'll let you work that one out), is at the top of his list of suspects.",
    "We're already on episodes 5 and 6 of the weekly double bills of Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 8. Episode 5 suggests an old friend might be returning to our screens, with reference to a previous season being used as the title, 'PB&J'.",
    "In episode 6, Jake can't leave alone the high-profile case that the FBI has taken over, and Amy and Rosa negotiate with the police union. It looks like the stage is being set for something big, with the episode appropriately titled 'The Set Up'.",
    "Strap yourself in for the next two instalments of the eighth and final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and keep reading for everything you need to know about how to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8, episode 5 and 6 online where you are.",
    "Happen to be out of the country when this final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine airs? No problem. While you'll find the content is geo-blocked when you try and tune in, you can still catch all of the action via a VPN.",
    "A VPN allows you to watch your favorite show from anywhere in the world. It does this by changing your IP address to one in the country you live in normally. Here's everything you need to know to get started:",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location, i.e., US for Hulu, or Australia for SBS' free stream",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Australia, just head to SBS On Demand"
