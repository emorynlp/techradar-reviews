  "article": [
    "Walmart PS5 restock and Xbox Series X restock update: This week marked the biggest PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X restock at Walmart online, and over one thousand Twitter followers of our 24/7 PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider got an alert ahead of time and thousands were able to find the two consoles in stock. Matt has now helped over 7,000 buy PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks as of today and he's waiting on the next Best Buy PS5 restock to help again.",
    "Matt also did a Walmart PS5 and Xbox restock live stream video on YouTube, teaching people the tips and tricks on the complicated Walmart checkout process (if you missed it, go back and review how to checkout while the PS5 stock was live). The first few waves of consoles seemed impossible to buy at the time of 3pm EDT, but customers were able to breakthrough in subsequent waves (it lasted one hour) spaced ten minutes apart, and the price was right at the MSRP: $499 for PS5 Disc and Xbox Series X, and $399 for PS5 Digital.",
    "What to do right now for next restock: Click on this screenshot of this example of a Walmart PS5 restock alert from Matt Swider and turn on notifications (that little bell icon) for instant alerts. This is what you'll see when there's the PS5 is in stock.",
    "The Walmart PS5 and Xbox Series X restock time was at 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT, and it lasted more than an hour. You could buy both consoles today at MSRP.",
    "This fits into Walmart's pattern: the Walmart PS5 and Xbox Series X restock date is almost always on a Thursday, and we've listed the past restock dates below.",
    "This doesn't mean anyone who bought it today will get their console right away. Today's online order is meant to be shipped to you, so no in-store Walmart pick-ups will be available, and, no, you cannot go to the store to order the console. Please don't do that.",
    "Walmart is notorious for taking some time to ship next-gen to people (up to a month in some cases, but within a few days for a select few). There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the timing.",
    "Walmart is the most popular retailer in the US, so consoles sell out quickly when the PS5 is in stock. This is one case in which the mobile app is the hero and the website is the sidekick. We'll explain how and why you should use both during a PS5 drop at Walmart.",
    "You're looking at it. Walmart will restock the PS5 and Xbox Series X today at 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT, and while it sometimes goes early, if you miss it, there are always 10-minute waves where the consoles go out of stock and then comes back to life.",
    "We'll have more updates for other retailers in the US, but for now, all eyes are on Walmart in the coming hours. Stay tuned for more updates on this breaking news."
