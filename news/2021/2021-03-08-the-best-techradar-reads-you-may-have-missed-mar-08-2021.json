  "summary": "The very best of TechRadar from the week that was",
  "article": [
    "Everybody\u2019s talking about it. Everybody wants to know the truth. So, yes, in this week\u2019s round-up, we have all the details on the biggest interview of the year \u2013 our Computing Writer\u2019s chat with Ed Boyd, Head of Experience Design at Dell, about the future of ethical consumption.",
    "In all seriousness, though, here at TechRadar we pride ourselves on our coverage of the latest and greatest developments in tech and beyond, and Dell has some pretty ambitious plans for a totally sustainable future \u2013 including a \u2018looping lifecycle\u2019 across its entire design process.",
    "Below you\u2019ll find the best of TechRadar from the past week, from a detailed rundown of the global Fitbit outage to our Senior Gaming Writer's worries about the PS5\u2019s internal storage. We\u2019ve even gone ahead and hosted the royal rumble of subtitles in our assessment of which streaming service does accessibility best (spoiler: it\u2019s not Apple TV).",
    "There\u2019s also a host of review and opinion content for you to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re after something a little easier on the eyes (but maybe not the ears), we\u2019ve parked the latest episode of the TechRadar Noise Cancelling Podcast at the end of this article for your convenient listening pleasure.",
    "We love the PS5. Everyone loves the PS5. So many people love it, in fact, that it\u2019s still mightily difficult to source one (follow our in-house PS5 tracker Matt Swider on Twitter for help with that, by the way).",
    "But this doesn\u2019t mean Sony\u2019s latest console is without its issues. One of the biggest is its restrictive level of usable space \u2013 which our Senior Gaming Writer reckons could make for a louder PS5 when Sony attempts to solve the problem.",

    "Stuff happened in the season finale of the hit Disney Plus TV show, WandaVision. That stuff is likely to tie in to some CGI butt-kicking action in another corner of the MCU, and here we break down which corner that might be, and how that stuff might happen. Stuff, stuff, stuff \u2013 without revealing what that stuff is, for those yet to see the complete show.",
    "Spoilers ahead, obviously.",

    "2018 saw the release of the Google Home Hub, which marked the company\u2019s first foray into smart displays by combining a 7-inch screen with a smart speaker. Then, in 2019, Google launched the Next Hub Max, which packed a bigger, 10-inch screen.",
    "Now, we\u2019ve had the biggest indicator yet that Google is set to launch the Nest Hub 2, and here we break down everything we know about the upcoming device.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "Which streaming service does accessibility best? It\u2019s obvious to us that subtitles \u2013 or the \u201cone-inch tall barriers\u201d \u2013 offer an amazing way to experience a whole new world of movies and TV series, diving deeper into a script, and that's before noting how important they are to those hard of hearing, of course.",
    "The same question applies to audio dubbing in relation to those with visual impairment, so here we take a look at how each of the major streamers ranks in terms of accessibility.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "We spoke with Ed Boyd, Head of Experience Design at Dell, about the future of ethical consumption, and the computing powerhouse has some pretty ambitious plans for a totally renewable production process.",

    "Sonos is reportedly on the verge of releasing a new portable Bluetooth speaker, ostensibly called the Sonos Roam. We\u2019ve heard rumors and seen images of a potentially-final design, so how does the company\u2019s latest speaker compare to the Sonos Move?",
    "Our Audio and Music Editor walks us through the comparisons, from price and availability to design and performance.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "In news that rocked the routine of runners and home workout-ers across the world, Fitbit\u2019s data syncing services went down last week. A server fault meant users were unable to sync their sleep and fitness data with the app, a problem Fitbit says is now fixed, despite a few minor 'hiccups'.",
    "Our Fitness and Wellbeing Editor put together a handy timeline of the outage.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "If you follow smartphone news, you probably know that rollable smartphones are the next big thing, stealing the thunder from foldable phones, so to speak.",
    "These devices let you extend their screen size, as part of their displays are rolled up in the body of the phone and can unravel when you want. It's a futuristic concept, and one no commercially available smartphone has right now \u2013 but here\u2019s our thoughts on Oppo\u2019s initial effort to crack the technology.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "The DJI FPV drone darted into our lives this week like a slightly friendlier Sentinel from The Matrix. But one of the most intriguing things about its reveal, other than those otherworldly looks, is how much its launch felt like a GoPro event.",
    "With vertiginous videos of wingsuit fliers, drifting cars and motocross riders, it was all a little more extreme than your average DJI drone announcement \u2013 but how significant is this latest tech?",
    "Read more\u2026",
