    "When the JLab GO Air earphones were launched at the 2020 CES trade show, they set a new benchmark for just how cheap true wireless earbuds could be.",
    "Now, the American audio brand is back to raise the bar for affordability once again with the JLab GO Air POP, an even cheaper successor to the Air which cost \u2013 wait for it \u2013 just $20.",
    "Yes, you can now buy a pair of true wireless earbuds for less than the price of a single Apple AirTag ($29 / \u00a329 / AU$45).",
    "Now, don\u2019t expect the GO Air POP to rival the AirPods Pro or Beats Studio Buds for sound quality \u2013 its predecessors were, after all, cheap and cheerful at best \u2013 but JLab\u2019s latest earbuds still pack enough features to warrant some attention.",
    "For instance, you\u2019ll get iOS and Android-compatible touch controls, dual connect (allowing each earbud to be used independently), a 32 hour battery life when used with their charging case \u2013 which is more than most high-end competitors, by the way \u2013 and an IPX4 rating to ensure they'll last through most workouts.",
    "JLab also says the GO Air POP are 15% smaller and 40% lighter than their predecessor, boasting the brand\u2019s most unobtrusive fit to date. That tiny size is reflected in their charging case, too, which is smaller than a car key fob (and also looks similar to a certain AirPods Pro case).",
    "The GO Air POP don\u2019t look half bad, either. Available in five bold colors \u2013 lilac, rose, slate, teal and a subtle black \u2013 it\u2019s clear where the earbuds get their name, and JLab\u2019s philosophy of accessible innovation (read: affordable products) certainly isn\u2019t a boring one.",
    "Helpfully, as with all JLab true wireless products, the GO Air POP are backed by a 2-year warranty, which is twice the typical figure you\u2019ll find for similar products elsewhere. What\u2019s more, should you lose an earbud, JLab says replacements will be available to purchase at a fraction of the cost \u2013 which we\u2019d imagine to be around the price of a good takeaway, given their RRP.",
    "There\u2019s no official word yet on how much the buds will cost worldwide, but at $20 in the US, we\u2019d anticipate a figure in the region of \u00a320 / $AU27. In anyone\u2019s book, that makes them worth considering \u2013 even if they aren\u2019t likely to set the world (or your ears) alight.",
    "The JLab GO Air POP earbuds are set to launch on August 3, and will be available to purchase via the brand\u2019s official website."
