    "The company revealed the new capability will eradicate the risks of account takeovers, phishing, SIM swaps and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Speaking on the new plugin, Simon Law, CEO of LoginID explained that unlike other popular single-sign on solutions, user information cannot be used for tracking purposes, ensuring a private experience on websites that integrate the LoginID WordPress Plugin.",
