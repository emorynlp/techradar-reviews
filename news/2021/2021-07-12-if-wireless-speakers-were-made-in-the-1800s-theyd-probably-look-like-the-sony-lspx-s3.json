    "Sony has announced the LSPX-S3 wireless speaker, which looks like an old school lantern, which Sony says will offer \u201cwidespread crystal clear sound through [an] organic glass tweeter\u201d while softly illuminating your surroundings.",
    "The Sony LSPX-S3 wireless speaker will be available to purchase in August 2021 for \u00a3315 (around $439 / AU$589), though there\u2019s no word yet on when \u2013 and whether \u2013 the speaker will be released worldwide.",
    "Even though it doesn\u2019t look like a speaker, it seems that Sony wants to put sound first with the LSPX-S3, as it features three actuators surrounding the speaker to help push sound in all directions. Those, working alongside the glass tweeter, could provide a clear sound with a solid mid-range balance. There\u2019s also a bass boost mode and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to connect your device to the speaker without a cable.",
    "The most striking aspect of the Sony LSPX-S3 is its design, which looks wonderfully retro without being gaudy. The subtle glass design brings to mind a candle or an old lantern, emphasized by the soft illumination the speaker\u2019s lighting provides.",
    "The only obvious drawback we can see so far is the relatively short battery life, lasting just 8 hours on a full charge. It\u2019s handy that the speaker is portable, but existing alternatives like the Sonos Roam lasts around 10 hours on a full charge and cost half as much.",
    "It will also be interesting to see how the speaker compares to other hybrid speakers like the Sonos IKEA Symfonisk Lamp speaker. We loved its well-balanced sound, clever home cinema integration, and Sonos system compatibility, though we didn\u2019t feel it was the best speaker we\u2019ve ever tested.",
    "Still, we can see the Sony LSPX-S3 appealing to a crowd that likes novel, stylish designs for wireless speakers, and if the sound is as clear and high-quality as the company claims, it could still present a worthwhile purchase for audio enthusiasts looking for something a little bit different."
