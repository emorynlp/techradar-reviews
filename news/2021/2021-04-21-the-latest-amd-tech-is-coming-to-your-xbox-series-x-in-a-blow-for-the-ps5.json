    "AMD\u2019s FidelityFX technology has been added to the Xbox Series X/S Game Development Kit, officially announced through the AMD Gaming Twitter account. This will allow developers to implement graphical features on Xbox Series X/S consoles that were previously limited to PC, where FidelityFX was initially made available.",
    "AMD\u2019s FidelityFX tech is adaptive software that offers a variety of image sharpening enhancements for developers to more easily implement into their games. Standout features of FidelityFX include variable shading, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion, all of which add significant visual depth to an image without compromising game performance.",
    "Xbox Series X/S consoles are powered by AMD's RDNA 2 CPUs and Zen 2 GPUs, meaning that FidelityFX is a logical fit for Microsoft\u2019s flagship consoles. However, there\u2019s currently no word on whether AMD plans to add FidelityFX support to PS5 game development kits in future, meaning that upcoming Xbox Series X/S titles could have a graphical edge over the competition, at least for now.",
    "As FidelityFX has only just been added to Xbox Series X/S game development kits, it will likely be a while before we start seeing how AMD\u2019s tech benefits console gaming. However, FidelityFX could represent a breakthrough moment for future Xbox exclusives like Fable, Perfect Dark and Everwild.",
    "FidelityFX could prove to be a huge boon for the Xbox Series S in particular, with supported features like super resolution set to smartly upscale images below 4K. The prospect might make the Xbox Series S console seem less like a halfway house between last generation\u2019s Xbox One X and Microsoft\u2019s flagship Xbox Series X.",
    "As much as we\u2019d love to see FidelityFX available to developers on PS5, that might not be as straightforward as you might think. While exclusives like Demon\u2019s Souls and the upcoming Horizon: Forbidden West show us how graphically impressive PS5 games can be, Xbox Series X/S consoles are the only ones on the market that feature full AMD RDNA 2 architecture. This could make FidelityFX integration a bit more difficult on PS5."
