  "summary": "Think Mark! Why hasn't Invincible season 2 been released yet?",
  "article": [
    "Invincible season 2 may have been commissioned by Amazon, but its arrival still feels a long way off. Fans of Amazon Prime Video's R-rated animated adaptation have kept themselves amused with the many memes that have emerged from the TV show. But there's only so many we can take while we wait for Invincible's second season to launch.",
    "So when can we expect to see Invincible season 2 arrive on Prime Video? Right now, we're unsure. It sounds like everyone is hard at work on the series' next instalment but, as long as the finished product is as good as it can be, we're happy to wait.",
    "Invincible season 1 received rave reviews from fans and critics, so it's unsurprising that the superhero show will be back on our screens. Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker's comic series is beloved by many, and Amazon's adaptation has certainly done it justice, so it's unsurprising that more entries are on the way.",
    "While we wait for more news on season 2's arrival, then, what do we know about it? Below, we've collated everything you need to know about the TV series' next instalment. This includes new and returning cast members, possible story threads, when it may return to our screens and more",
    "There are spoilers for the first season and the comics below, so proceed at your own risk. Don't blame us if you fly into an Omni-Man kind of rage if something is ruined for you.",
    "Amazon Studios hasn't confirmed a release date for Invincible season 2 yet.",
    "Invincible's second season was announced \u2013 alongside season 3 \u2013 on April 29, though, so development should have begun by now, or be on its way to reaching the midway point (we hope, anyway). Kirkman and the series\u2019 executive team are sure to have had discussions on what plot points to build the next season around (more on this later), and we lots of pre-production work will have been completed by this point.",
    "Animated shows can get an early renewal behind-the-scenes because of the long turnaround it takes to make further episodes, so it's possible that it's further along than we think. We'd like to hope it is, solely for the fact that season 2 would be here earlier than expected.",
    "Even so, we don\u2019t expect to see Invincible season 2 take flight before the second half of 2022. Unless the creative team crunches on it to release the show early next year, we would be surprised to see arrive any sooner. A show like this needs as much care and attention to detail as possible, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re hedging our bets on.",
    "Speaking during a Skybound Xpo virtual panel for Invincible season 1 in July 2021, which you can view on YouTube, Kirkman also kept schtum on when we might see season 2, so it sounds like it'll be a while yet.",
    "In November 2021, Kirkman also revealed that he was \"happily very busy working on other stuff\" when he was asked about his potential involvement in Marvel Studios' upcoming Zombies animated project. Here's hoping Invincible season 2 forms a lark part of that \"other stuff\" that he alludes to:",
    "It seems that Amazon, or Invincible's creators at least, are well aware that fans are eager for Invincible's next instalment as well. A tweet on the official Invincible Twitter account perfectly sums up how we're all feeling during the gap between seasons 1 and 2, even if it seems like a bit of trolling on the part of Invincible's social media team:",
    "No casting confirmations have been made, but we\u2019d expect season 1\u2019s main players to return:",
    "It\u2019s possible that we may see other voice actors reprise their roles outside of the main cast, too.",
    "Zachary Quinto was the voice of Robot in season 1, but it\u2019s unclear if he'll be needed again. As we saw in the first season, Robot is the artificial host body of Rudy Conners, an individual whose genetic defects mean he\u2019s unable to live outside of his saline tank. With Rudy\u2019s consciousness being transferred into his new clone body in season 1 episode 7, Ross Marquand has taken over vocal duties for Rudy.",
    "So we don't know if Quinto will return. Robot has a big role to play in the comics, but we're unsure if those events will be part of season 2, season 3 or beyond.",
    "Other actors who may return include Chris Diamantopoulos (Doc Seismic), Fred Tatasciore (Kill Cannon), Clancy Brown (Damien Darkblood), Jeffrey Donovan (Machine Head), Ezra Miller (D.A. Sinclair) and Michael Dorn (Battle Beast and Thokk). Kirkman has hinted at some of their returns (more on this below) but we're unsure who will do so yet.",
    "As for new cast members, Kirkman has expressed interest in seeing some more of The Walking Dead TV series\u2019 cast in future seasons. Yeun, Marquand, Laurie Cohan, Michael Cudlitz, Sonequa Martin-Green and Lennie James have appeared in various roles already, but Kirkman wants more Walking Dead stars to lend their talents to the animated show.",
    "Speaking to ComicBook.com, Kirkman said: \"I can't think of an actor on The Walking Dead I wouldn't want to work with again. It's an amazing group of actors. Andrew Lincoln, Danai Gurira, Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride, Jeffrey Dean Morgan...there's not really anyone I wouldn't want to bring in.\"",
    "The comic series is a fun but at-times confusing one. There are many directions that Invincible season 2 could go in, but we already have an idea of what the next instalment could entail. This is based on the season 1 finale and some hints from the series' official Twitter account.",
    "First, let's discuss the Invincible season 1 finale. Omni-Man was supposed to conquer Earth for the Viltrumite Empire but, after realizing that he couldn\u2019t kill Mark and, by proxy, enslave humanity for his people, he tearfully heads out into space for an unknown destination.",
    "Season 2 is should pick up this plot thread. Mark will be tasked with keeping Earth safe from the invading Viltrumites, as well as help the Coalition of Planets stop the former from carrying out their universe-wide expansion. Mark already knows that a fleet is on its way thanks to Allen the Alien\u2019s warning and, with Allen having a more prominent role in the comics from this point on, we can expect the duo's friendship to grow throughout season 2.",
    "We should also find out where Omni-Man/Nolan has gone. In the comics, Nolan flies off to invade another planet, which he hopes will act as recompense \u2013 with the Viltrum Empire \u2013 for deserting his posting on Earth. There\u2019s a lot more for the TV series to cover regarding Mark and Nolan\u2019s relationship, which continues to be explored extensively in the comics, too. We\u2019ll be here forever if we dive too deep into this father-son bond so, for now, we\u2019ll say we hope to see some of J.K. Simmons\u2019 Nolan next season.",
    "As an offshoot of the above, the show should be entering cosmic territory in season 2 as well. Expect stranger worlds, weirder characters and a universe-spanning plot to be translated from page to screen.",
    "Season 1's final episode also teased other potential subplots for its successor. We should see more of the Sequids storyline, which wasn't officially concluded. We know that a Martian has infiltrated Earth after he traded places with one of the human astronauts. Additionally, the astronaut who was left behind on Mars is now being controlled by the Sequids, which could spell bad news for Earth if this parasitic race charts a course for the blue planet.",
    "We may see Titan and Battle Beast\u2019s stories fleshed out in more detail, too. The last time we saw the pair, they had taken over Machine Head\u2019s criminal organization and teleported away from Earth respectively. Their tales continue in the comics, and Kirkman has already alluded to fan favorite Battle Beast getting more screen time in Amazon\u2019s adaptation. The Flaxans also look like they'll return, despite Omni-Man's rampage across their home planet in episode 2.",
    "One interesting piece of news concerns story elements that didn\u2019t even make it into Invincible\u2019s comic run. In a chat with Beyond the Trailer, Kirkman revealed that he hoped to include storylines in the TV show that he couldn\u2019t fit into the graphic novels. One example that Kirkman gives relates to Damien Darkblood, who was banished back to Hell by Cecil Stedman in episode 4. It\u2019s unclear if this will form part of season 2, though.",
    "Finally, Kirkman himself has revealed more of where season 2\u2019s plot could go and it could include arguably Mark\u2019s biggest nemesis from the comics \u2013 Angstrom Levy. Check out confirmation of this below:",
    "Following on from that announcement, Kirkman reiterated that Levy will be part of season 2's story.",
    "Speaking during the virtual Skybound Xpo Invincible panel (where he declined to say when season 2 would arrive), Kirkman said: \"He [Levy] really shakes things up. If you're familiar with the comics and you've watched the TV show, you'll get a sense of where we're going with the second season, especially if you think really hard about how we adapted the story in the first season.\"",
    "For fans of the TV show only, Kirkman also teased that there would be some \"crazy stuff coming\", while Jason Mantzoukas revealed that he can't wait for season 2 to \"introduce more villains... like Thragg\" and more of the comic series' intergalactic elements.",
    "In total, there are 144 Invincible comics, which spanned 15 years of Kirkman and Walker\u2019s careers. The TV adaptation altered the order of certain plot points for season 1, but the first eight episodes only covered the first 23 issues. If a similar trajectory is maintained for future seasons, Invincible would end around the season 7 or 8 mark.",
    "According to Kirkman, however, there could be more or less than that. Speaking to ScreenRant, he said that the series\u2019 creative team has a \u201crough roadmap for where things from the comics will fall\u201d. Additionally, Kirkman told Inverse that he \u201ccould see it going for five\u2026 seven\u2026 even 10 years. Maybe we run out of comic books and\u2026 we do 100 seasons.\u201d",
    "Of course, that last number is Kirkman being excited about his own property, but we could certainly see Invincible running for at least five seasons. If audiences want more, Amazon would be silly to end it after three seasons.",
    "After all, Amazon has had major success with its live-action series based around another R-rated comic book in Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's The Boys. Invincible could chart a similar course and, in the process, make Amazon Prime Video the go-to streamer for mature, comic book adaptations."
