  "summary": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is certain to be very different to its predecessor.",
  "article": [
    "The Black Panther 2 we see in theaters will not be the sequel anybody would have wanted to see when the movie was first announced. The tragic death of star Chadwick Boseman (King T'Challa/Black Panther) in August 2020 means this eagerly anticipated follow-up will arrive tinged with sadness \u2013 and that returning director Ryan Coogler has had to completely rethink his film to accommodate the absence of its popular leading man.",
    "Even without Boseman, the sequel \u2013 now titled Wakanda Forever \u2013 is almost certain to be a hit. Of the 26 MCU movie releases to date, only the four Avengers outings have performed better at the worldwide box office than the first Black Panther. It was also the first superhero movie to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.",
    "But what will Black Panther 2 look like without its iconic King T\u2019Challa? When will we see it in cinemas? Who will lead the cast? How has Letitia Wright\u2019s on-set accident affected production? And how will the movie fit into the wider MCU continuity?",
    "We\u2019ve pulled together all the essential information surrounding the Black Panther 2 release date, story and more \u2013 including rumors about a potential villain, and reports of a future MCU hero who\u2019ll be making her debut in the movie.",
    "As they say in Birnin Zana, Wakanda Forever!",
    "Release date: After several delays, the Wakanda Forever release date is currently slated for November 11, 2022. It\u2019s expected to debut in theaters, before arriving on Disney Plus at least 45 days later.",
    "Cast: The late Chadwick Boseman will not be replaced as King T\u2019Challa, but most of the first movie\u2019s excellent supporting cast will return, including Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett and Martin Freeman. I May Destroy You\u2019s Michaela Coel also joins the ensemble.",
    "Story: In the Marvel tradition, plot details are currently heavily under wraps, but it\u2019s rumored Prince Namor \u2013 aka the Sub-Mariner \u2013 will appear in Wakanda Forever. We can also expect to see Wakanda coming to terms with the consequences of sharing its advanced technology with the world.",
    "Within a month of the first Black Panther\u2019s February 2018 theatrical debut, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was confirming in Entertainment Weekly that \u201cwe absolutely will do [a sequel]\u201d.",
    "But despite the colossal success of the original movie, Marvel and Disney never seemed in a rush to bring out a follow-up \u2013 even before star Chadwick Boseman\u2019s sad passing prompted a complete rethink of director Ryan Coogler\u2019s plans for the story.",
    "For a long time, the Black Panther 2 release date was scheduled for May 2022. Then, following a major Covid-19 induced reshuffle that saw Black Widow and subsequent MCU movies pushed back, the big Marvel Studios Celebrates the Movies trailer \u2013 part of Hollywood\u2019s drive to get people back to theaters in spring 2021 \u2013 confirmed a new Black Panther 2 release date of July 2022.",
    "That\u2019s since changed again, following Marvel's decision to push back all of its planned movie releases in 2022 and beyond. Black Panther 2: Wakanda Forever subsequently shifted to the November 11, 2022 slot previously occupied by Captain Marvel/Ms Marvel team-up The Marvels.",
    "Will the Black Panther 2 release date be held up again? Everyone\u2019s hoping not, though there is an extra complication that could add to the delays: as of November 2021, production is on hiatus due to an injury star Letitia Wright sustained on set a few months earlier:",
    "\u201cLetitia had a frightening accident on our set during a stunt back in August,\u201d producers Feige, Nate Moore and Louis D\u2019Esposito said in a note to the Wakanda Forever crew (reported by Deadline). \u201cWhat we had initially thought were minor injuries turned out to be much more serious, with Letitia suffering a critical shoulder fracture, and a concussion with severe side effects. It has been a painful process and Letitia has been home recovering with her doctors and the support of family.\u201d",
    "While the production schedule was adjusted to take account of Shuri\u2019s absence, the note points out that \u201cthere\u2019s only so much we can do without Shuri\u201d. This statement tallies with widespread rumors that Shuri will inherit the Black Panther mantle in Wakanda Forever. Principal photography is expected to resume in January.",
    "It seems likely that Black Panther 2 will first debut in theaters, before making the move to Disney Plus at least 45 days later.",
    "Although Black Widow arrived on the streaming platform the day it landed in theaters (as part of the premium Premier Access package), Marvel and Disney subsequently reintroduced the traditional theatrical release window for both Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and Eternals. We\u2019d expect Black Panther 2\u2019s release to follow a similar pattern.",
    "This is the Black Panther 2 cast list, based on the intel we have so far:",
    "Chadwick Boseman\u2019s death has left an unimaginably large hole in the Black Panther 2 cast. Wakanda Forever won\u2019t be recreating the star digitally, however, as Rogue One did with Peter Cushing.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s only one Chadwick, and he\u2019s not with us,\u201d Marvel Studios executive vice president Victoria Alonso told Argentinian website Clarin (via Digital Spy). \u201cOur king, unfortunately, has died in real life, not just in fiction, and we are taking a little time to see how we return to history and what we do to honor this chapter of what has happened to us that was so unexpected, so painful, so terrible, really.\u201d",
    "Nor will Black Panther 2 cast a new actor to play King T\u2019Challa (aka Black Panther). \u201cI want to acknowledge the devastating loss of a dear friend and a member of our Marvel Studios family,\u201d Kevin Feige told Disney\u2019s Investor Day conference in December 2020. \u201cChadwick Boseman was an immensely talented actor and inspirational individual who affected all of our lives both personally and professionally. His portrayal of T'Challa, the Black Panther, is iconic, and transcends any iteration of the character from any other medium in Marvel's past. It is for that reason that we will not recast the character.\u201d",
    "Even without its hero, however, the Black Panther 2 cast will feature plenty of familiar MCU faces. A Hollywood Reporter story in November 2020 reported that Lupita Nyong\u2019o (spy Nakia), Letitia Wright (T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, Shuri), Winston Duke (Jabari Tribe leader M\u2019Baku) and Angela Bassett (T\u2019Challa\u2019s mother, Ramonda) are all reprising their roles in Wakanda Forever, while CinemaBlend said that Danai Gurira will be back as Okoye, leader of Wakanda's elite royal guards, the Dora Milaje. An August 2021 tweet from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever News appeared to show Gurira and Wright together on set.",
    "Elsewhere, Martin Freeman confirmed on The Late Show with James Corden in May that the US operative he plays, Everett Ross, will be back: \u201cI had a Zoom call with Ryan Coogler, the director and co-writer, about seven or eight weeks ago, I suppose, and he sort of meticulously took me through all of my character\u2019s beats in the film.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s yet to be confirmed, however, whether Daniel Kaluuya \u2013 who\u2019s just won an Oscar for his performance in Judas and the Black Messiah \u2013 will return as W\u2019Kabi, T\u2019Challa\u2019s best friend. Even Kaluuya himself said in February 2020 he has \u201cno idea\u201d if he\u2019s heading back to Wakanda. \u201c[It\u2019s about] whatever the story needs,\u201d he told Jemele Hill (via ScreenRant). \u201cI\u2019m a fan. I\u2019m that kind of person, if the story and the piece is better without me, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m gonna watch this because I really wanna watch this.\u2019 And if I\u2019m in it and I\u2019m able to serve it, then I\u2019m in it.\u201d",
    "One star of the first movie who probably won\u2019t be back for Black Panther 2 is Michael B Jordan, who played antagonist Erik Killmonger. Aside from the fact that Killmonger died in the first movie \u2013 not that that\u2019s ever been a barrier to a character\u2019s return in the MCU \u2013 Feige has said (as reported by CinemaBlend) that any reports of Jordan\u2019s return are \u201cpure rumor and speculation\u201d, and that \u201cnothing is set yet in any way\u201d.",
    "When asked by Jess Cagle on Sirius XM about the likelihood of a Killmonger comeback on a scale of one (never) to 10 (definite), Jordan said: \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to go with a solid two. I didn\u2019t want to go zero! Never say never \u2013 I can\u2019t predict the future!\u201d",
    "There\u2019s no official confirmation yet on Wakanda Forever\u2019s villain, but a Hollywood Reporter story said in November 2020 that Narcos: Mexico star Tenoch Huerta was in talks to join the Black Panther 2 cast as an antagonist. The Illuminerdi threw a bit more light on the mystery in June 2021, claiming they had \u201clearned from our sources\u201d that Huerta is playing Prince Namor (also known as the Sub-Mariner), the Atlantean antihero who's essentially Marvel's answer to DC's Aquaman.",
    "As reported in Variety, British actress, writer, producer and director Michaela Coel has also signed on in an undisclosed role.",
    "Her critically acclaimed 2020 TV show I May Destroy You picked up numerous awards, including an Emmy for Coel's writing, so her star is only set to shine brighter as Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's release date approaches.",
    "And finally, the movie will provide an introduction to the headline star of one of the MCU's ever-expanding list of upcoming Disney Plus TV shows. Feige confirmed in August 2021 that Iron Man replacement Ironheart, aka Riri Williams, will make her live-action debut in Black Panther 2. Dominique Thorne has already been cast in the role.",
    "When it comes to storylines, Marvel tends to operate on a strict need-to-know basis, so little is known for sure about the Black Panther 2 plot. Indeed, with Boseman having kept his four-year battle with cancer secret, Coogler had originally worked on a script that would feature the star reprising his role as T\u2019Challa. \u201cI spent the last year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say, that we weren\u2019t destined to see,\u201d Coogler said (via the Hollywood Reporter). \u201cIt leaves me broken knowing that I won\u2019t be able to watch another close-up of him in the monitor again or walk up to him and ask for another take.\u201d",
    "What does all that mean for Wakanda Forever? Marvel\u2019s December 2020 Disney Investor Day presentation said that the sequel \u201cwill continue to explore the incomparable world of Wakanda, and all of the rich and varied characters introduced in the first film\u201d \u2013 a strategy reiterated by Feige in an interview with Deadline in January 2021.",
    "\u201cSo much of the comics and that first movie is the world of Wakanda,\u201d he said. \u201cWakanda is a place to further explore with characters and different subcultures. This was always and initially the primary focus of the next story. Ryan Coogler is working very hard right now on the script with all the respect and love and genius that he has, which gives us great solace, so it was always about furthering the mythology and the inspiration of Wakanda. There\u2019s also the task of honoring and respecting the ongoing learnings and teachings from Chad as well.\u201d",
    "As far back as March 2018, Feige was aware of the potential of Black Panther\u2019s supporting cast. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance between leaving people wanting more and then giving them too much,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI think Shuri\u2019s astounding, and you\u2019ll see much more of her in our universe. Okoye, I think I\u2019d watch three action films of just Okoye. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re doing that, but I\u2019m saying that we\u2019re intrigued by them.\u201d",
    "Lupita Nyong\u2019o simply said (in an interview with Good Morning America) that Black Panther 2 will be \u201cdifferent\u201d and that \u201call of us are dedicated to reimagining or carrying on his legacy in this new Black Panther\u201d. Martin Freeman, meanwhile, teased in his James Corden interview that, \u201cSome of [the script is] very odd, and I think [Ryan Coogler] could see by the reaction on my face some of the things he was saying\u2026 He kept on saying, \u2018Stay with me, but this is going to work.\u2019\u201d",
    "And while Wakanda Forever won\u2019t feature T\u2019Challa \u2013 though it will presumably address the character\u2019s absence in some way \u2013 there\u2019s a strong possibility the Black Panther 2 plot will introduce his successor in that iconic vibranium cat suit. In fact, there have been numerous rumors that Shuri \u2013 Wakanda\u2019s answer to James Bond\u2019s Q and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister \u2013 will inherit the Black Panther mantle. After all, it\u2019s already happened in the comics...",
    "With production currently on hiatus as Letitia Wright recovers from her injuries, we wouldn't expect a Black Panther 2 trailer to emerge for some time yet. For now, you can fill that Wakanda Forever-shaped hole with the Stan Lee-narrated Marvel Studios Celebrates the Movies trailer that revealed the Black Panther 2 title: Wakanda Forever.",
    "This is based on a great big if, but assuming that the Marvel Cinematic Universe release schedule doesn't make another radical shift, Black Panther 2 will be the 30th movie in the most successful cinematic franchise of all time. It\u2019ll follow Black Widow (July 2021), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (September 2021), Eternals (November 2021), Spider-Man: No Way Home (December 2021), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (May 2022) and Thor: Love and Thunder (July 2021) into theaters.",
    "As for where Black Panther 2 fits into the MCU timeline, that\u2019s something of a mystery, though we\u2019re guessing it\u2019ll take place some time after The Falcon and the Winter Soldier finale. After all, there was a strong Wakandan presence in the Disney Plus TV show, with Sam Wilson\u2019s new Captain America suit constructed using the African nation\u2019s sophisticated technology. There are even rumors that Anthony Mackie might turn up in Black Panther 2 as the new Cap.",
    "Indeed, Mackie hinted in an interview with The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah that he\u2019s working out to play Wilson again \u2013 a training regime that usually takes four months \u2013 in April 2021, while the star told Entertainment Tonight that: \u201cI do have a Wakanda visa, so I can go to Wakanda as much as I want. I have a passport and a Wakanda visa and I'm vaccinated, so I can go to Wakanda.\u201d The timelines check out with the Black Panther 2 production schedule, so don\u2019t be surprised to see Mackie in Wakanda Forever.",
    "While we don\u2019t know exactly how Black Panther 2 will fit into the MCU timeline, it\u2019s a good bet it\u2019ll be setting up the new Wakanda TV spin-off Coogler is developing for Disney Plus."
