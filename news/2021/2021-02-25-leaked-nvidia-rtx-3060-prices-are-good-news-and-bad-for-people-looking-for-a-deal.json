    "Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card is unleashed later today, and we\u2019ve just witnessed a fresh bunch of leaked prices (following similar leakage earlier this week, and indeed previous to that).",
    "As highlighted by Tom\u2019s Hardware, the pricing comes from Best Buy and Newegg, although the latter has since taken down the listings and prices (not before Twitter-based hardware leaker @momomo_us grabbed some screenshots of them, though).",
    "The prices are truly exorbitant at the top of the scale, with PNY\u2019s RTX 3060 XLR8 Gaming Revel Epic-X models commanding $630 and $625 from your wallet. This seems pretty odd, though, and so out of line with the rest of the pricing that it may be a mistake. Mind you, as this is leaked pre-release pricing, all of this info should be taken with a good handful of salt\u2026",
    "At any rate, MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060 Gaming X is the next card down in the list of spilled prices, pitched at $540, with other models from MSI, Asus, and Gigabyte pegged around the $500 to $520 mark.",
    "At the (relatively) more affordable end of the spectrum, there are graphics cards from Zotac and EVGA at about the $400 mark, and then \u2013 shock horror \u2013 at the foot of the RTX 3060 pricing league, we have a pair of cards which are actually pitched at Nvidia\u2019s recommended price. That\u2019s $330, and the video cards in question are the Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle and EVGA RTX 3060 XC Black Gaming.",
    "So there\u2019s apparently some hope yet for more wallet-friendly RTX 3060 products, but as we\u2019ve already mentioned, we need to be cautious around any leak \u2013 whether we\u2019re being despondent or hopeful.",
    "What is telling here is that the RTX 3060 leak from Coreteks that popped up earlier this week pretty much matches the prices given here, albeit with slight variations of $10 to $20 or so (which is to be expected with prices from different retailers anyway). This does suggest that much of the pricing mentioned here may be on, or at least close, to the mark.",
    "The overall picture still looks like something of a ridiculous one, whereby some RTX 3060 Ti models will be cheaper than RTX 3060 cards. For example, Gigabyte has a 3060 Ti Eagle selling for $480 at Best Buy \u2013 and that\u2019s cheaper than most of the RTX 3060 prices we\u2019ve just been through.",
    "Of course, the problem is none of those RTX 3060 Ti models are in stock, so you can\u2019t buy them \u2013 and you\u2019ll (theoretically) be able to purchase an RTX 3060 later today (the telling difference). Or at least you will be able to briefly \u2013 exactly how quickly available RTX 3060 inventory will sell out isn\u2019t yet known, but the word \u2018flash\u2019 springs to mind.",
    "If you\u2019re going to be on the hunt for stock later on, then you\u2019ll likely need all the help you can get \u2013 so head on over to our where to buy the Nvidia RTX 3060 article, which does all the hard work for you in terms of keeping an eye on inventory levels at different retailers. And for those who don\u2019t get lucky, it\u2019s a great resource to bookmark and keep an eye on going forward."
