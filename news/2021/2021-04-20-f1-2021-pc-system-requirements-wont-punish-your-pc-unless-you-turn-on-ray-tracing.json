  "summary": "Ray tracing support is in, but it\u2019s (unsurprisingly) a good deal more demanding",
  "article": [
    "F1 2021 was recently revealed by EA with a launch date of mid-July, and now we\u2019ve been provided with the full PC spec requirements which indicate that the game will support ray tracing lighting effects.",
    "As ever, both minimum and recommended system requirements have been detailed, with additional notes on what\u2019s needed for ray tracing on top \u2013 which is obviously a clear enough indication that F1 2021 will indeed come with ray-traced graphics, even if nothing has been officially announced yet. F1 fans will doubtless recall that the 2020 version added DLSS \u2013 so it\u2019s safe to assume that\u2019ll be in the mix too.",
    "Here are the requirements for F1 2021 in full (as found on the game\u2019s Steam page):",
    "Minimum requirements",
    "Minimum with Ray Tracing requirements",
    "Recommended requirements",
    "Recommended with Ray Tracing requirements",
    "They aren\u2019t a big ask, then, and the spec is actually pretty much identical to F1 2020, with only slight changes here and there. The only big differences are the new ray tracing requirements which are predictably a major step up, calling for an RTX 3070 or RX 6800 on the recommended front.",
    "With DLSS support presumably being maintained, as mentioned, hopefully it won\u2019t be too much trouble to maintain smooth frame rates \u2013 but obviously we won\u2019t know until we see the game in action.",
    "Given the speed you\u2019re whizzing round the track in normal gameplay, F1 is a title which puts a premium on smoothness rather than finer visual details, of course."
