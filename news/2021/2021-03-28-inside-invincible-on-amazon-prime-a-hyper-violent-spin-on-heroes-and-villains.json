    "It\u2019s been 18 years since Invincible subverted expectations of what superhero comics could be. Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker\u2019s iconic graphic novels, which predated his other successful series - The Walking Dead - by nine months, rewrote the rulebook for many comics fans. Invincible is many things, but its violent nature, coupled with its subversive and thematically rich subject matter, means that it retains a loyal following despite The Walking Dead becoming Kirkman\u2019s major hit.",
    "Now, almost two decades on from its initial launch, Invincible is primed to shock and delight 21st century audiences. Kirkman and Walker\u2019s comics have arrived on Amazon Prime Video as an animated series, and Kirkman is excited to see how viewers react to its savagery and timely topics.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few superhero comics that has a definitive beginning, middle and end,\u201d Kirkman tells us. \u201cYou see the main character go on a defined journey that changes them by its conclusion. Through the lens of superheroes, we can make [the violence] a much more dangerous and traumatic prospect. To be able to tell that journey again in animated form is exciting because you get to tinker with things and make them better.\u201d",
    "Invincible tells the tale of Mark Grayson, a seemingly ordinary teenager save for one small detail - his father, Nolan Grayson, is Omni-Man, the world\u2019s most powerful superhero. After he turns 17 years old, Mark begins to develop his own powers, and Nolan takes him under his wing to help Mark master his newfound abilities under the pseudonym Invincible.",
    "This father-son relationship is an integral part of the comics, not least for the fact Mark eventually learns that Nolan\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t as heroic as he thinks. Finding the right voice actors for each role, then, was vital if Amazon\u2019s adaptation was to carry the same emotional weight that the source material does.",
    "In January 2019, Amazon revealed that J.K. Simmons would portray Nolan/Omni-Man as part of an all-star cast including Mark Hamill, Sandra Oh, Seth Rogen, Zachary Quinto, and Lauren Cohan. Steven Yeun, who Kirkman worked with on AMC\u2019s Walking Dead TV series, was also hired to play Mark, and it\u2019s a role that Kirkman believes was tailor made for the Minari star.",
    "\u201cSteven is one of the hardest workers I know,\u201d he explains. \u201cI think he\u2019s embodying Mark in a really compelling way, and he\u2019s very familiar with the comics. He\u2019s aware of the journey his character is going on all the way down to the smallest line of dialogue. He kept pulling me aside and saying \u2018Okay, I\u2019m saying this na\u00efve because I know of this later, and then season 2 I\u2019ll be like this\u2019, so seeing someone planning for his character\u2019s journey was great.\u201d",
    "Invincible may resonate with viewers with its real life struggles and themes, but obviously it isn\u2019t a family-friendly comic. The source material is full of barbaric brawls, death and destruction, and those moments are even more shocking and visceral when they're brought to life in the animated series. Some viewers may wonder if such gratuitously violent content is necessary, but Kirkman believes it\u2019s imperative to Invincible\u2019s story and subject matter.",
    "\u201cInvincible is very serious and dramatic,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of our drama has weight and it doesn\u2019t shy away from the ramifications of violence. Most stories told in this medium shy away from those consequences. There\u2019s an unending well of drama that comes from showing the myriad of consequences of realistically portrayed superhero battles.",
    "\"You want to hear superheroes say \u2018Our tactics led to this bridge collapse that killed 13 people. We have to get better as a team\u2019. We can have the more classical elements of superheroes that make them so fun and exciting and different, but also have the dramatic weight, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to make Invincible really stand apart.\u201d",
    "In that respect, Invincible isn\u2019t too dissimilar from another Amazon superhero adaptation: The Boys. This show has earned a huge following since it debuted in July 2019, with its unapologetic depictions of violence being key to its success. Invincible walks a comparable path. Zazie Beetz, who plays Mark\u2019s love interest Amber Bennet, believes that audiences want superhero productions to be grounded in reality despite their fictional characters and worlds.",
    "\u201cI think the emotions, family dynamic and even how the violence is depicted in Invincible is very real,\u201d she stated. \u201cWhat these characters sacrifice, and the trauma they suffer from having the responsibility of having to save the world, is a lot and I think people are interested in engaging what the reality of that would be. I get annoyed with films where a lot of death is happening, but I like that Invincible reckons with it. It adds a lot of layers and complexities, and speaks to broader themes happening in the story.\u201d",
    "While Amazon\u2019s adaptation sticks closely to Invincible\u2019s source material, there are certain changes that have been made. Amber\u2019s ethnicity has been altered from Caucasian to African-American, while Invincible\u2019s female characters have generally been given more agency than their comic counterparts.",
    "The comics\u2019 story, too, plays out differently in the animated series. Switching up the plot\u2019s order, Kirkman believes, freshens things up and ensures that even long-time Invincible fans won\u2019t know the story\u2019s twists and turns to come - including the series\u2019 most memorable moments.",
    "\u201cThere are very consequential events that happen - big tentpole moments - across the series that I think keeps things exciting,\u201d Kirkman admits. \u201cI\u2019m eager to get to them, and there are more than a couple every season. Invincible is famous for all of its pivots away from what you expect a normal superhero story to do. We\u2019re in the best of times to be able to come in and say \u2018you guys think you know what you\u2019re getting, but we\u2019re going to give you something completely different\u2019.\u201d",
    "What won\u2019t change is the exact nature of those major plot points. Fans of the comics will know which moments we\u2019re alluding to, here, and Kirkman and Amazon were determined to retain the core structure, emotional beats, and distressing elements of these sequences in order to adapt them as closely as possible. It\u2019s a sentiment that Gillian Jacobs, who portrays Samantha Wilkins/Atom Eve, agrees with, and one that she thinks stems from Kirkman\u2019s desire for Invincible to be a meta exploration of superhero comics that have recently exploded into the mainstream.",
    "\u201cI think, in the same way that when this came out as a comic, it felt like a response to other ones and the way they depicted superheroes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people really gravitated towards it and it\u2019s got such a devoted fan base. I hope, in a similar way, that the animated series will feel similar to those fans.\u201d",
    "Invincible\u2019s comic run may have ended in March 2018, but its legacy lives on. The series has already been turned into a motion comic, and a live-action adaptation from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg - a movie Kirkman will also executively produce - is in the works. For now, Kirkman\u2019s full attention is on Amazon\u2019s animated adaptation.",
    "The streamer hasn\u2019t greenlit future seasons yet but, if Invincible\u2019s TV show is as well received as its comics were, it could run for many years. There are many more arcs to adapt, and Invincible has the potential to sit alongside the elite tier of animated superhero shows.",
    "\u201cI hope it would honor Batman: The Animated Series,\u201d Kirkman admits when we poke at the subject. \u201cThat would be amazing, and I hope that we can live up to the amazing gravitas that that series accomplished. I think, by being animated, we\u2019re able to embrace the inherent silliness of the superhero genre while providing something new, dramatic and unexpected. I think it couldn\u2019t come at a better time because superhero media is so prevalent, and I\u2019m really excited to have the chance to do that.\u201d",
    "Invincible\u2019s first three episodes are available to watch now exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. Future instalments will be released weekly."
