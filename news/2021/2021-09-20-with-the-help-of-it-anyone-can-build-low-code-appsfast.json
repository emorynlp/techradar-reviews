    "The demand for new business applications has outstripped most IT department\u2019s ability to deliver. Yet the demand continues to grow and the enterprise \u201capp gap\u201d gets wider every day.",
    "One way companies are closing this \"app gap\" is by:",
    "Low-code platforms like ServiceNow's App Engine let everyday employees build digital workflow applications thanks to pre-made component modules such as self-service portals and workflow routing. Using the low-code tool\u2019s graphical drag-and-drop user interface, a citizen developer selects built-in components that become modular building blocks of their digital workflow app.",
    "Low-code solutions can decrease development time by as much as 50%-90% of development time compared to a coding language, according to 451 Research. This translates to lower cost-per-app and quicker turnaround from idea to deployment\u2014not to mention significantly reducing IT\u2019s app dev request backlog.",
    "The beauty of low-code is that most ordinary employees\u2014assuming they are motivated and have access to training\u2014can learn how it\u2019s done in a short amount of time. This new breed of citizen developers can make a huge impact on the organization by creating department-specific apps that save them and their colleagues a ton of time.",
    "Once trained in low-code application development, citizen developers can help automate manual business processes, create apps still on their department's wish list, and identify the need and opportunities for new business applications. These range from menial, repeatable tasks that have always been time-consuming, to processes made more difficult by COVID constraints and the move to remote work, to new workflows ideal for digitalization.",
    "While low-code makes it possible for citizen developers to build business applications, IT is an essential part of the process from beginning to end.",
    "IT stays in control of the process by:",
    "Thanks to this combination of low-code platforms, citizen developers, and IT as facilitators, businesses can respond to new business needs with agility while IT provides governance and oversight.",
    "This gives citizen developers the guardrails they need to develop apps that are scalable, secure, and compliant. Meanwhile, IT has the relief of knowing that non-IT can handle some of its own application requirements and requests\u2014but that these activities are still under its watchful eye."
