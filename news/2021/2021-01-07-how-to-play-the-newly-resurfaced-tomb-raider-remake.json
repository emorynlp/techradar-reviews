    "A lost edition of Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary has leaked online, and anyone can play it.",
    "The game was originally developed in 2006, when Core Design was working on a remake of the original Tomb Raider for Sony PSP. Despite being \u201calmost finished\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s according to studio manager Gavin Rummery (via Eurogamer) \u2013 it was canned in favour of a cross-platform remake by Crystal Dynamics, later released as 2007\u2019s Tomb Raider: Anniversary.",
    "Allegedly, the canceled project was picked up and reskinned into an Indiana Jones game, which also never saw the light of day following the shutting down of Core Design in 2010.",
    "Now, the assets have been rediscovered and posted in an internet archive, allowing nostalgic fans to launch and play a 15-year-old incarnation of Lara Croft. Steps to do so sound confusing, but are actually pretty simple, so we\u2019ll break down the basics.",
    "First, you\u2019ll need to download a patch into Microsoft Visual Studio, ensuring you also have access to a PS4 or Xbox 360 controller (keyboard controls haven\u2019t been figured out just yet). Then, you\u2019ll want to download artbase and extract it to C: drive (with a folder structure of C:\\artbase\\tombraider etc. \u2013 otherwise, the game won\u2019t run).",
    "From here, you can use run.bat to launch Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary. All the files for the game can be found in the internet archive, and a more detailed guide from Tomb of Ash reveals all the info on bug fixes, cheats and general updates to the game\u2019s functionality.",
    "When you do make it into the game, there are no enemies \u2013 consider it a more scenic experience \u2013 but you\u2019ll be able to explore levels in Greece, Peru and, of course, Croft Manor.",
    "Fans behind the resurrection of the canceled project say they made several requests to license holders for permission to publish the game, but never received a reply. Thankfully, an exemption designed to help the Internet Archive preserve vintage software means this 15-year-old Lara is likely to stick around for as long as is needed to climb, jump and swim your way through Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary\u2019s pixelated nostalgia."
