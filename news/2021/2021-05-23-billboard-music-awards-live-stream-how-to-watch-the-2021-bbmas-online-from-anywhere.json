    "The Weeknd, P!NK, BTS and Alicia Keys are just some of the headline acts at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards, which will honor the best-selling artists of the past year. Judging panels haven't covered themselves in glory over the past few years, but there's none of that at the BBMAs, where the charts decide who wins. Follow our guide below as we explain how to watch a Billboard Music Awards live stream online wherever you are.",
    "Three of the 50+ awards categories have already been decided, with Drake set to be named Artist of the Decade to recognize his unrivaled success at BBMAs past. P!NK, meanwhile, will be the 10th recipient of the exclusive Icon Award, and the rapper and activist Trae Tha Truth is Billboard's Change Maker of the year.",
    "It's been another wildly successful year for The Weeknd, who leads the way with nominations across an incredible 16 categories, amongst them the Top Artist award and Top Streaming, Top Selling, Top Radio, and Top R&B Song awards for the tune you may already be humming right now - \"Blinding Lights\".",
    "With Nick Jonas on hosting duties and people actually in attendance at LA's Microsoft Theater, it should be a fun night, so read on as we explain how to watch a Billboard Music Awards live stream from anywhere in the world right now.",
    "Below you'll find our run down of the broadcasters and countries showing the BBMAs. But if you're outside your country of residence and try to stream the Billboard Music Awards via your home broadcaster, you'll likely discover that you can't due to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Fortunately, there's an easy solution to this common problem. By downloading and installing a VPN, you can tell your device it's back at home and enjoy your home coverage wherever you are. Make sure you read all the fine print first, though, ensuring you're in compliance with any terms and conditions.",
    "Unfortunately for music fans based in Blighty, there's no official broadcaster for the Billboard Music Awards in the UK.",
    "On the bright side, that means there's no need to stay up until 4am on a Sunday night!",
    "If you really want to tune in to the BBMAs, your best bet is to explore the VPN route set out above, in order to tap into another country's broadcast. The show starts at 1am BST."
