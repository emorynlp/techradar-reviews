    "Nintendo is still keeping schtum about Breath of the Wild 2, and it failed to reveal any new information about the hotly anticipated sequel during the last Nintendo Direct.",
    "Bubbling in the background of Link\u2019s imminent return, however, are those ongoing Nintendo Switch 2 rumors \u2013 or Nintendo Switch Pro if you like \u2013 which refuse to go away. Speculation points to it being a more powerful iteration of the company\u2019s widely successful hybrid device, one that\u2019s capable of 4K visuals when docked.",
    "That leaves those of us with fanciful imaginations to sit and speculate, dream even, about what might be achievable on Nintendo\u2019s apparently impending new Switch model. Speaking of which, we\u2019ve often wondered what Nintendo could pull off with more powerful hardware \u2013 and thanks to the advanced horsepower of PC hardware and clever emulation, sometimes those daydreams are turned into reality.",
    "Case in point, Breath of the Wild running in 8K with ray tracing. In the video below, you can marvel at arguably the finest Switch game released to date running at a level of graphical fidelity that simply isn\u2019t possible on Nintendo\u2019s hardware (and almost certainly won\u2019t be feasible on Nintendo Switch 2 either).",
    "The video shows the Wii U version of Link\u2019s open-air adventure running on the CEMU emulator, and is the work of the Digital Dreams YouTube channel. As you can see, ray-traced global illumination makes the lush landscapes of Breath of the Wild look simply sensational, and the REVO Reshade Redux mod, which is created by Pascal Glicher, helps to make the game look more lifelike than ever before.",
    "Unfortunately, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll be waiting years before we ever see this level of detail in games from Nintendo. After the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo opted for a different approach compared to Sony and Microsoft, often choosing cheaper, more underpowered hardware that\u2019s designed to leverage a new controller or design idea.",
    "This idea-focused approach has paid dividends for Nintendo, though, with the Wii, Nintendo DS and Nintendo Switch selling millions upon millions of units. It doesn\u2019t always work out of course, as the Wii U so damningly proved, although the Nintendo Switch is certainly benefiting from the Wii U's library.",
