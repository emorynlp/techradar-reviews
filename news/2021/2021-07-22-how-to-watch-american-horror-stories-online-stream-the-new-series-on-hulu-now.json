    "With the promise of the return of Rubber Man from his first and only appearance in Murder House - American Horror Story's first season - American Horror Stories brings together all the charm and creepiness into episodic scary bites. An AHS spin-off, watch American Horror Stories online now, exclusive to Hulu in the US.",
    "American Horror Story subjected us to Murder House and a haunted summer camp, dragged us to a Florida freak show, and booked viewers into a hotel with a high mortality rate, with a fresh narrative and setting each season.",
    "If they didn't leave you with PTSD, you\u2019ll be delighted to know that each weekly episode of American Horror Stories offers an utterly unique tale of terror, in a vein similar to The Twilight Zone and Hulu's own Into the Dark.",
    "The series will feature fresh blood, including cast members Dyll\u00f3n Burnside (Pose), Nico Greetham (The Prom), and Kevin McHale (Glee), and chart of brand new horrors. Expect a Drive-in Cinema screening something sinister, a disgruntled axe-wielding Santa (Danny Trejo), and dozens of nightmare-inducing apparitions.",
    "But die-hard fans will be pleased that American Horror Stories remains true to the AHS universe. We'll return to Murder House, where Rubber Man is terrorizing its latest occupants, and be reunited with AHS alumni like Naomi Grossman, Billie Lourd, Matt Bomer, and John Carol Lynch (Twisty the Clown from season 4).",
    "Ready for seven twisted tales of terror? Then read on as we detail how to watch American Horror Stories online now.",
    "It's unclear where the home of American Horror Stories will be in the UK, with no release date available right now. Fox UK previously aired new seasons of American Horror Story, but that channel has recently been disbanded by parent company Walt Disney Studios. In light of this, and following the move of fellow Fox property The Walking Dead to Disney Plus via the Star portal, we\u2019d hazard a guess that American Horror Stories will follow in its footsteps and arrive on Disney's VOD service shortly. We\u2019ll update this page once we have more information.",
