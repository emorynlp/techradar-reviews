    "The Great is a historical comedy-drama starring two of Hollywood's brightest young stars, Nicolas Hoult and Elle Fanning. Originally a Hulu exclusive, you can now stream the show from nearly anywhere on earth - including for free online in the UK courtesy of Channel 4 and its 4OD platform.Read on to find out how to watch The Great online free from anywhere in the world right now.",
    "The 10-part miniseries offers a satirical take on the reign of Catherine the Great and her odious husband, Peter. Maleficent's Fanning play the long-reigning Russian ruler, while Nicholas Hoult (Skins, X-Men: Days of Future Past) is her partner in crime.",
    "Directed by Oscar-nominated writer Tony McNamara (\u2018The Favourite\u2019), The Great follows Catherine as she rises to become one of Europe\u2019s most powerful monarchs, having arrived in Russia as a German outsider.",
    "It plays pretty hard and loose with recorded events and at times almost reaches Blackadder-esq levels of absurdity, but it's a darkly fun if highly fictionalised history lesson that sees Katherine out to kill her husband and take the throne for herself after realising the depths of his depravity.",
    "Alongside Fanning and Hoult, there's a strong supporting cast with Sacha Dhawan, who plays The Master in Doctor Who, Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Gwilym Lee, and Charity Wakefield (Jack Whitehall\u2019s sister in Bounty Hunters).",
    "Now that it's landed on UK terrestrial TV, anyone located in the UK can watch The Great free online - here's how to stream every episode of the show online wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "If you're looking to watch The Great but find yourself abroad, you might worry that you'll be unable to watch the show using your normal streaming service, due to pesky geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Fortunately, there's an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch The Great no matter where you are. This simple bit of software changes your IP address so that you can access episodes live or on demand as they become available, just as if you were lying on the couch munching your favorite takeout."
