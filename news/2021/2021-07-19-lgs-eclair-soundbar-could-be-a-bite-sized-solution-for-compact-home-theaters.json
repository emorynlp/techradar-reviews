    "The LG QP5 \u00c9clair soundbar has now launched in the US, having been announced at CES 2021 back in January. Available in black and white, this bite-sized device could open up home cinema possibilities for those with a small amount of space, or for anyone that doesn\u2019t want their soundbar to take over their entire living room (if you can afford it, that is).",
    "The \u00c9clair\u2019s retail price is a little surprising, considering its pint-sized build, costing $596.99 in the US. If you\u2019re outside the States, LG has said that it will be rolling out to other territories, but is yet to confirm a worldwide release date. When it does launch globally, you can expect it to cost around \u00a3439 / AU$819.",
    "Despite its compact build, though, it looks like the \u00c9clair isn\u2019t skimping on premium features. The soundbar boasts support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X audio codecs, a 4K passthrough for truly high-definition audio, and has a subwoofer built-in with Meridian audio tuning.",
    "It\u2019s nice to see that the \u00c9clair\u2019s size is more than just a gimmick. We think there\u2019s plenty to love about smaller soundbars, especially one that still packs the premium features you\u2019d expect from a larger soundbar like the Sony HT-X8500 or the Samsung HW-Q90R.",
    "The \u00c9clair\u2019s size could present a double-edged sword, however. Appearances can shape a customer\u2019s first impressions of a device, and it\u2019s possible the \u00c9clair\u2019s price could ward people away given its relatively tiny build. Still, the \u00c9clair could be exactly what you\u2019re looking for if you want to set up a home theater in a smaller apartment space.",
    "In any case, we\u2019re impressed by the \u00c9clair\u2019s multitude of premium specs, many of which \u2013 including its 3.1.2 channel system and support for eARC lossless transmission \u2013 we\u2019d expect to see from the best soundbars you can buy today."
