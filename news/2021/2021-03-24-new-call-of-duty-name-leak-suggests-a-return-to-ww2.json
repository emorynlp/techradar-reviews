    "The new Call of Duty, which should appear later this year, is known internally as \"Call of Duty WW2: Venguard\".",
    "Sources spoke to ModernWarzone (via GamesRadar ) and claimed that Call of Duty 2021 will be developed by Call of Duty: WW2 developer Sledgehammer Games, with the game tentatively dubbed \"Call of Duty WW2: Vanguard\".",
    "The tentative name means that this is unlikely to be the final title of the new Call of Duty game for 2021, but it suggests that the next Call of Duty will again be set in World War II.",
    "As usual, this rumor should be treated with a great deal of caution (despite the fact that the source insists this is true). But while it's worth being cautiously optimistic about, it's worth noting that another prominent Call of Duty leaker previously claimed that the new game will take place in WWII.",
    "We already know that a new Call of Duty game is in the works due to be released in late 2021, but Activision has kept a low profile on the details, including who is working on Call of Duty 2021.",
    "With the game slated for later this year, we expect it won't be long before there is an official reveal - probably in the next few months."
