    "Looking to buy a turntable this Prime Day? While there are many different models available to buy from Amazon, Victrola record players are among the most prolific on the site \u2013 and you may be wondering whether you should take the plunge and buy one for yourself.",
    "These popular retro turntables are widely available on Amazon, and come in a range of styles, prices, and configurations to suit any vinyl enthusiast \u2013 and some are even portable, bringing some much needed convenience to the timeless form factor.",
    "As Victrola record players are sold on Amazon, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ll be heavily discounted during Prime Day 2021, which takes place between June 21 \u2013 22. A quick look at last year\u2019s deals shows that the deals on the brand\u2019s turntables were available throughout the sales period, so it\u2019s well worth keeping an eye out for discounts this year, too.",
    "Choosing a turntable brand can be tricky, though. There are lots of companies to choose from, with companies like Audio-Technica, Pro-Ject, and Denon offering fantastic record players \u2013 and that means it can be hard to know whether you should take the plunge and buy a Victrola record player.",
    "We\u2019re here to help. While we haven\u2019t tested Victrola\u2019s record player for ourselves, we\u2019ve taken a look at the brand\u2019s most popular models, and examined the specs and customer reviews so you can make an informed decision this Prime Day.",
    "Victrola has been making turntables since 1906, and today it offers a range of record players in lots of different designs. Here\u2019s an overview of some of its most popular models.",
    "Victrola\u2019s best-selling products include suitcase record players, which take all the components of a turntable setup, including the speakers, and put it into a box with a handle. These portable record players were popular in the 1960s thanks to their portability and affordability \u2013 and they\u2019re still worth buying today.",
    "Victrola\u2019s suitcase record players play up to the retro feel with vintage-inspired designs. One of its most popular models, The Journey, comes in a huge range of colors and styles, from pastel blue to psychedelic tie dye \u2013 but every version costs a budget-friendly $59.99 / \u00a359.99.",
    "For your money, you\u2019re getting a three-speed (33 \u2153, 45, and 75 RPM) belt driven turntable that comes with Bluetooth built-in, so you can use it to stream music from your phone as well as play your vinyl. There\u2019s also a 3.5mm AUX-in if you want to play music from a non-Bluetooth device.",
    "Its portable design includes two built-in stereo speakers, but there's an RCA line-in if you want to use your own external speakers, as well as a headphone jack.",
    "Those are some impressive specs for the price, and customer reviews are largely positive, praising its portability, easy setup, and attractive design. You\u2019re not getting higher-end specs like USB connectivity, and audiophiles will likely prefer a model that allows you to tinker with the tonearm, but The Journey could be a great, easy-to-use record player for beginners.",
    "It\u2019s already well-priced, but it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out for Prime Day deals on this record player, especially if you\u2019re looking for a budget-friendly model to ease into the world of vinyl.",
    "If you want to really dive into the retro aesthetic, The Hawthorne might be the best Victrola turntable for you. This Bluetooth record player is housed in a wooden cabinet, complete with an old-timey radio tuning dial and LED display that lets you know what kind of input you\u2019re using.",
    "It does look a little bulky, but it comes with so many connectivity options that we can forgive a larger footprint.",
    "As well as a three-speed belt driven turntable, The Hawthorne comes with a CD player, cassette player, and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to stream music from your device wirelessly.While it comes with built-in stereo speakers, you can plug in a pair of headphones, or hook up your own speakers with the included RCA line out cable. For non Bluetooth audio sources, there\u2019s a 3.5mm audio port, too.",
    "It also works as an FM radio player, with a wire antenna tucked away at the back of the device. And, if you want to record your vinyl to your computer, there\u2019s a USB port. Essentially, The Hawthorne can work as an all-in-one music player, and at $149.99 / \u00a3139.99, it\u2019s priced very competitively.",
    "Again, you\u2019re unlikely to get the audio clarity and detail that you\u2019d get from pricier turntables, but it could be a great choice for anyone who loves the retro aesthetic and wants to access all their music sources from one device.",
    "Not a fan of the overtly retro look? The Eastwood turntable might be a better option for you. This three-speed record player sports a much more minimal design than the other Victrola record players we\u2019ve looked at, with a modern bamboo finish and transparent plastic dust cover.",
    "It comes with built-in speakers, though you can connect it to external Bluetooth speakers wirelessly if you want a more powerful sound. At the same time, you can connect it to your smartphone wirelessly to stream your music, thanks to dual Bluetooth connectivity.",
    "Unlike The Journey and The Hawthorne, this model comes with an Audio-Technica AT-3600LA cartridge, which boasts a 0.6mm conical stylus. Audio-Technica is a well-respected cartridge manufacturer, so you may find that The Eastwood provides a more detailed sound than its siblings.",
    "Reviews are largely favorable, though some do mention its plasticky build \u2013 if you\u2019re looking for the very best in build quality, you\u2019ll probably need to spend a little more money than the $99.99 / \u00a3115 price tag the Eastwood comes with.",
    "While we\u2019d recommend looking out for Victrola record players over Prime Day, there are other models out there that will potentially deliver a better listening experience.",
    "The best turntable of 2021, the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo, offers a detailed and revealing listen, with the ability to focus on the minutiae even as it describes the complete picture very convincingly.",
    "However, it also comes with a $499 / \u00a3449 / AU$879 price tag, so it\u2019s not suitable for anyone on a strict budget, even if it is discounted over Prime Day.",
    "A more budget-friendly option is the Audio-Technica AT-LP60XB, which is a fantastic first turntable for any fledgling vinyl enthusiast thanks to its easy setup and $149 / \u00a3179 price.",
    "Both Pro-Ject and Audio-Technica are trusted names in the turntable industry, so you can be sure that you\u2019ll get your money\u2019s worth from these models.",
    "It\u2019s possible that both of these record players will be discounted over Prime Day, so it\u2019s worth widening your search beyond Victrola turntables during the sales event \u2013 you might just bag a bargain.",
    "While we haven\u2019t tested these Victrola record players for ourselves, an examination of the specs and customer reviews suggests that they could be good options for vinyl beginners.",
    "As they come with built-in speakers and wireless connectivity, they\u2019ll be easy to set up, and you won\u2019t need to mess around balancing the tonearm or tracking down an external preamp.",
    "For those on a budget that want portability above all else, The Journey is probably the best Victrola turntable to buy this Prime Day, while anyone who loves the retro aesthetic will get a kick out of The Hawthorne\u2019s vintage stylings.",
    "If you\u2019re more concerned about audio quality than looks, you may want to opt for The Eastwood, which comes with a cartridge from trusted manufacturer Audio-Technica.",
    "Of course, you\u2019re not just limited to Victrola record players if you want to buy a turntable on Amazon Prime Day. Look out for deals on records players from Pro-Ject, Denon, Audio-Technica, Technics, and Sony \u2013 and be sure to bookmark our Prime Day 2021 guide, where we\u2019ll be bringing you the best tech deals we can find, on everything from record players to laptops."
