    "You\u2019d think that the appetite for stories about the end of civilization would subside during a real-life global pandemic. But while many Netflix subscribers tried to forget about the outside world early on by immersing themselves in the madness of Tiger King, others doubled down on all the bleakness by sending Outbreak and Contagion to the top of the most-watched list.",
    "And the streaming giant has continued to cater to these gluttons for punishment in 2021: Awake, Sweet Tooth and a second season of Black Summer will all drop over the next month. If pure escapism isn\u2019t your bag, then check out 10 of the service\u2019s best post-apocalyptic originals.",
    "Apparently 45 million Netflix viewers celebrated Christmas 2018 by watching a claustrophobic horror about a mysterious entity that drives anyone who sees it to suicide. Bird Box may sound distinctly unfestive, then. But with one of Hollywood\u2019s most likeable A-listers as its blindfolded heroine and a plot that mirrored one of the year\u2019s big surprise hits, you can understand the reasons it became such a post-turkey dinner favorite. The adaptation of Josh Malerman\u2019s same-named novel doesn\u2019t quite hit the same heights as the similarly themed A Quiet Place. However, buoyed by Sandra Bullock\u2019s brilliantly gutsy lead performance, this is still a tense, taut survival tale that will have you glued.",
    "A hijacked plane must outrun the sun, after its rays wipe out the Earth-bound population. Into the Night sounds like one of the many high-concept one-season wonders that emerged in the wake of Lost. But Netflix\u2019s first Belgian original has already been renewed for a second series, thanks to surprisingly strong character development, an appealing and diverse cast, and an ability to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its six episodes. Even better, its short running time means you can binge through the whole thing in an afternoon. Just don\u2019t read too much into the science behind the catastrophe.",
    "Giving Orphan Black\u2019s Tatiana Maslany a run for her money, Noomi Rapace plays seven identical twins with seven distinctive personalities in this logic-defying but ever-entertaining dystopian sci-fi. What Happened to Monday? is set in a near-future, where a one-child policy has been enforced to combat overpopulation. But having spent 30 years posing as the same person, it\u2019s only now that Rapace\u2019s bunch of Karens must overcome several threats \u2013 including Glenn Close in a more overtly villainous form than Cruella de Vil \u2013 to stay alive. Sure, it\u2019s full of glaring plot holes, but director Tommy Wirkola (the man behind Nazi zombie-slaying horror Dead Snow) patches them up with plenty of B-movie thrills.",
    "A group of all-American teens (played by actors blatantly in their mid-20s, of course) return home from a field trip to discover that all other mankind has mysteriously disappeared. On the surface, The Society looks like your average glossy YA drama. But amid all the high-school cliches, there are also debates on the power of democracy, privilege and religion, aligning it with the existential mystery of HBO's The Leftovers just as much as the glossy mayhem of Riverdale. Sadly, events in the real world put paid to a second series, but the first still contains a satisfying enough resolution to make the investment worth it.",
    "After nearly a decade of increasingly bloated shenanigans in the DC Extended Universe, Zack Snyder returned to his genre roots this year with arguably his most entertaining film since Dawn of the Dead. Despite its title, this typically OTT mash-up isn\u2019t affiliated with his 2004 remake of the Romero classic. Instead, it\u2019s a separate franchise spawner (a prequel and animated TV spin-off will soon follow) where a motley crew of specialists plan to rob a casino, which, like the rest of its zombiefied Las Vegas setting, is about to get a government nuking. Sure, it\u2019s completely ridiculous, but unlike most of Snyder\u2019s comic book fare, it doesn\u2019t forget to be fun.",
    "Reportedly conceived in response to Brexit, Tribes of Europa follows three gung-ho siblings attempting to reunite the continent after a cataclysmic event dubbed Black December splits it into several warring factions. And a mysterious cube found in an air crash wreckage appears to hold the key. Set in 2074, 45 years after said disaster, this dystopian sci-fi isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted. There\u2019s almost as much brutality and bloodshed in its six episodes as there is in the entirety of Game of Thrones. But since it's produced by the team behind Netflix\u2019s breakout German hit Dark, such hyperviolence is counterbalanced by beautiful cinematography and a rich mythology that deserves to be explored further.",
    "George Clooney pulls double duty in this decidedly chilly end-of-the-world drama that suggests he was taking notes while filming Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Solaris. Returning to screens for the first time since 2016, the director plays a terminally ill Arctic Circle-based scientist who must warn a space crew heading back from Jupiter that a radiation-stricken Earth is no longer hospitable. Drenched in melancholy, The Midnight Sky is far more interested in ruminating on human connection, redemption and the future of civilization than delivering high-octane action. Although set-pieces, including a perilous spacewalk, ensure there\u2019s still plenty to feast the eyes, while Alexandre Desplat\u2019s evocative score ensures it sounds equally majestic.",
    "Had The Rain arrived in the midst of the dystopian young adult boom, rather than the tail end, it would have deservedly garnered more attention. In this Danish original toxic rain is the enemy, having wiped out almost the entire Scandinavian population, with siblings Rasmus and Simone \u2013 who\u2019ve just emerged from an underground bunker after six years \u2013 the reluctant heroes. As they search for both the father who left them and a cure, the pair join forces with several other engaging young survivors, most of whom have fascinating backstories of their own. If you thought that Nordic TV was all about noirish crime and woolly jumpers, think again.",
    "Adapted from a same-named short film released four years earlier, 2017\u2019s underrated and understated Cargo brings something a little different to the overcrowded zombie stable. Firstly, there\u2019s the scorched Aussie outback setting, which allows directors Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke to explore all the undead drama from an Aboriginal perspective. Then there\u2019s the fact that anyone bitten takes 48 hours to turn into a full-blown flesh-eater \u2013 a delay that gives Martin Freeman\u2019s newly infected father the chance to find his infant daughter a carer before he meets the same rabid fate as his wife. Few zombie flicks have tugged at the heartstrings as effectively.",
    "Don\u2019t let the fact that this outlandish comedy drama was cancelled by Netflix after just one season deter you. Laughing both with and at Generation Z, Daybreak is a joyously anarchic adaptation of Brian Ralph\u2019s same-named comic book series that combines the postmodernism of Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick even shows up) with the post-apocalyptic tribalism of Mad Max.",
    "Colin Ford takes center stage as the transfer student determined to find his absent girlfriend in the wake of a nuclear explosion that\u2019s turned all adults into bloodthirsty mutants. But it\u2019s his pyromaniac tween and bully-turned-samurai pals that steal the show in a refreshing alternative to all the self-serious YA fare."
