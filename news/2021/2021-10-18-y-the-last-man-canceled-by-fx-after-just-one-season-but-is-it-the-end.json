    "After just one highly-anticipated debut season, Y: The Last Man won\u2019t be returning for a second season \u2013 on Hulu and Disney Plus, at least.",
    "The news comes after showrunner Eliza Clark took to Twitter to announce that the TV adaptation of Brian K. Vaughan\u2019s acclaimed graphic novel series \u201cwill not be moving forward with FX on Hulu for season 2.\u201d",
    "Y: The Last Man \u2013 which follows the plight of Yorick Brown, the last cisgender male human on Earth \u2013 spent more than a decade in development with various studios, enduring several failed attempts to bring its comic book story to the screen before FX finally commissioned a TV show in 2018.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean a second season definitely won\u2019t happen, mind. \u201cWe\u2019re sad YTLM is not going forward [at the studio],\u201d Clark said in her tweet, \u201cbut we know that someone else is going to be very lucky to have this team and this story [...] We are committed to finding Y its next home.\u201d",
    "It seems, then, that a presumptive second season for Y: The Last Man is up for grabs to any streamer or studio willing to take it on.",
    "In our review of the series\u2019 first season, we described Y: The Last Man as \u201ca show that just about deserves your attention\u201d \u2013 which is rather indicative of the decidedly lukewarm reception to the live-action adaptation, and one evidently shared by FX itself.",
    "That reception likely didn\u2019t come as a surprise to Y: The Last Man\u2019s creator, either. During a recent appearance on THR\u2019s dedicated TV podcast, Vaughan acknowledged that his comic is concerned with \u201cchallenging subject matter\u201d that makes (and made) big-screen adaptation problematic.",
    "Speaking of previous attempts to theatrically adapt his story, Vaughan said Y: The Last Man was often diluted and sanitized so much that it \u201clost everything\u201d and was bordering on \u201cbecoming cartoonish,\u201d adding that \u201c[the story] can only be [told] on television.\u201d",
    "Showrunner Clark also told THR\u2019s podcast that she envisioned the show as a five-season, 50-episode series \u2013 signing off her announcement tweet by saying \u201cwe don\u2019t want it to end.\u201d",
    "As for whether Y: The Last Man will find a new studio home and receive a second series, then, the jury is out. As acknowledged by both Vaughan and Clark, this is a difficult story that demands \u2013 and perhaps deserves \u2013 telling across more than just a single season.",
    "The show\u2019s first season was by no means bad, either. Y: The Last Man boasted a cinematic quality to match some of the biggest shows out there right now, one that meant its complex themes were explored in a very visceral and comprehensive way \u2013 its episodes just needed to move a little quicker.",
    "But perhaps that ponderous pace, one that reflected an equally slow development cycle, proved the final nail in the coffin for a show that looks to have crash landed on takeoff."
