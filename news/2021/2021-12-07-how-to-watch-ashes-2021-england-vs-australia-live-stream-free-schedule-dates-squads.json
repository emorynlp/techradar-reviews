    "The time for trash talk, controversies and will predictions is over and the time for the serious on-field business of Ashes cricket has arrived. The most storied rivalry in the sport has returned Down Under for five Tests between Australia and England. You can bank on blood, sweat and tears on the wicket, but all you need to do is sit back, relax and discover how to watch a 2021 Ashes live stream from anywhere - including for FREE in some places.",
    "Few sporting events drum up national fervour quite like the Ashes, as Australia and England do battle on the cricket pitch over one of the oldest (and smallest) trophies in sport. And come six weeks time, one of Joe Root or Pat Cummins will have cemented their place in the annals of cricket history, the other consigned to national derision... until next time, at least.",
    "Nothing trumps the Ashes for most cricket fans of an English or Australian persuasion. It's pure theatre that almost always goes well over the line, which is precisely what makes it so compelling.",
    "Australia, the No. 3-ranked Test side in the world, have retained the iconic urn twice in a row, but have been dealt a major blow with the late withdrawal of regular skipper Tim Paine.",
    "World No. 4-ranked England, meanwhile, are still without top bowler Jofra Archer, but their talisman Ben Stokes has returned from a four-month break from the game, and single-handedly makes the team far more imposing.",
    "It's one of sport's great soap operas, so follow our guide for all you need to know to watch a 2021 Ashes live stream no matter where you are - and, perhaps best of all, fans in Australia can watch the Ashes free on TV on Channel 7. Kayo Sports is how to watch the Ashes 2021 online and on your mobile wherever you are, though (not 7Plus as previously reported).",
    "Keep reading for all the information you need, including details of the Test dates and schedule, the sides' teams and other key narrative around the series.",
    "Below we've got you covered with your official broadcasting options for major cricket loving countries (and the US!), but if you're outside your country of residence and try to start streaming Ashes cricket via your local broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Ashes cricket from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's stream - head to your home broadcaster's site or app and watch as if you were at home - so that's Kayo Sports for Aussies.",
    "The 2021 Ashes are being played in Australia, with each of the five Tests being played at a different venue.",
    "The Gabba in Brisbane hosts the opening Test, before play moves west to the Adelaide Oval, then east to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground, after which Perth Stadium will host the fifth, and potentially decisive Test.",
    "Pat Cummins (c), Alex Carey. Cameron Green, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson, Steve Smith, David Warner",
    "Joe Root (c), James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Dom Bess, Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Zak Crawley, Haseeb Hameed, Dan Lawrence, Jack Leach, Dawid Malan, Craig Overton, Ollie Pope, Ollie Robinson, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood",
    "For only the sixth time ever, the Ashes ended in a draw the last time the series was played, which was in 2019.",
    "Australia won the first and fourth Tests, and England took victory in the third and fifth Tests, while the rain-disrupted second ended in a draw.",
    "That means Australia, who entered that series as the holders, having been victorious in the previous edition, retained the Ashes for just the second time this century.",
    "The Ashes are contested roughly once every two years, 71 series having been played since its inception in 1882.",
    "Australia have the upper hand, having won 33 Ashes series outright to England's 32.",
    "Six series have ended with the honours even, with Australia retaining the trophy on five of those occasions.",
    "The Test results are far less evenly split, Australia having won 136 to England's 108, and 91 ending in a draw.",
    "The Ashes founding myth is one of the most famous in all of sport.",
    "It started with Australia dishing out England's first ever defeat on English soil in August '82, a low-scoring affair that provoked hysteria from local media outlets. Some things never change.",
    "A multitude of mock obituaries for English cricket were published, but it was the elegy penned by The Sporting Times' Reginald Shirley Brooks in early September, which gave birth to the concept:",
    "In Affectionate Remembrance",
    "of",
    "ENGLISH CRICKET,",
    "which died at the Oval",
    "on",
    "29 August 1882,",
    "Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing",
    "friends and acquaintances",
    "R.I.P.",
    "N.B.\u2014The body will be cremated and the",
    "ashes taken to Australia.",
    "Weeks later, England captain Ivo Bligh pledged to \"recover those Ashes\" during the team's subsequent 1882-83 tour of Australia. His quest was successful, and the story goes that Bligh was presented with a tiny urn containing the ashes of a burned bail.",
    "The urn is now on display at Lord's Cricket Ground, with a symbolic terracotta replica awarded to the winning team instead.",
    "England's victory in 2005 ended the longest winning streak in Ashes history, a 17-year era of Australian dominance during which England won just seven Tests, compared to Australia's 28.",
    "The series is, therefore, celebrated as a classic within English circles, the two-run winning margin in the second Test - the smallest in Ashes history - evening up the scores after Australia comfortably took the opener, and spurring England to their first Ashes triumph since 1987, and their first on home soil since '85."
