    "It feels like Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes only just burst onto our screens in Disney Plus' small screen MCU exclusive, yet the finale of The Falcon and the Winter Solider is here with its sixth and final instalment already. A part of Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and following on from the success of WandaVision, ensure you're tuned in for another episode of blockbuster action scenes from the next phase of superheroes.",
    "Read on as we explain how to watch The Falcon and the Winter Solider online and stream all-new episode 6 by getting Disney Plus from just $7.99/\u00a37.99 today.",
    "*Warning: spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier episode 5, The Avengers and other Marvel content exist below. Scroll down to avoid these and get straight to our The Falcon and the Winter Solider streaming guide*",
    "The stand-off we've all been waiting for, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier finally go head-to-head with Captain America 2.0, John Walker, who brutally murders a Flag Smasher in public, causing a severe fall from grace in the eyes of the US Army. But not before complete carnage ensues, seeing Walker tear the Falcon's wings from his back, and Falcon snap one of Walker's arms in return in the process of prying the shield from his grasp. Iconic.",
    "Still, this isn't the last we'll be seeing of Walker. Disenchanted with the US Army - the very institution that created him into a weapon - episode 5 sees Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine swoop in in a match that could only be bad.",
    "You can learn more by reading our full The Falcon and the Winter Solider episode 5 recap, which also includes full spoilers. Or, read on for how to watch The Falcon and the Winter Solider finale online and stream episode 6 wherever you are right now. Looking to save some time and get straight to the next episode? All you need is a great value Disney Plus subscription!",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck in to we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at a mere $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN Plus to your subscription price.",
    "The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as The Great, Upload, Helstrom and Normal People - as well as being the only place to watch Britney Spears documentary right now. Bringing further great value ESPN Plus offers loads of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "Disney Plus is showing no signs of slowing down since the service first launched last November. WandaVision is just the latest in a string of recent blockbuster releases exclusive to the platform, including Soul, The Mandalorian, Mulan, Hamilton, and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "Also, now that Disney has set the precedent of releasing its live-action Mulan remake on the service instead of in theaters through its Premiere Access program, expect the company to keep bring more blockbuster films that were originally intended to be shown on the big screen to Disney Plus in 2021 - it's the place to watch Raya and the Last Dragon right now, for instance.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star on Disney Plus that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy. It costs a tiny bit more, but is worth it based on our initial impressions - and you can still save big by going with an annual subscription.",
