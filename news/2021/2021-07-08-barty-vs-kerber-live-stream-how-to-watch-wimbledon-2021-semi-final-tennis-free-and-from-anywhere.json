    "A match-up fit for a classic Wimbledon final, Ashleigh Barty and Angelique Kerber are meeting for a tantalising semi-final today at the 2021 championship. They've both had fantastic tournaments, but only one can proceed to Saturday's final. Read on as we explain how to watch Wimbledon tennis online and get a Barty vs Kerber live stream wherever you are right now - including ways to see today's match absolutely FREE.",
    "It's now been over 50 years since an Australian has won the women's singles title at SW19, but nobody has been better placed than Ashleigh Barty this this year. After a fairly sluggish start to the fortnight, she has come good at the right time. Barty hasn't dropped a set since the first round, vanquishing newly crowned French Open champion Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 along the way. Is it time for the 25-year old to finally add to her Grand Slam tally?",
    "Across the net is a former champion in her own right, as Angelique Kerber tasted glory here after a famous win against Serena Williams in the final three years ago. Her passage this time around hasn't been quite as smooth as Barty's, with her three-and-a-half hour marathon sticking in the memory. But overcoming the impressive Coco Gauff in the last 16 before coasting past Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 in the quarters should mean Kerber is brimming with confidence.",
    "It's the first match on Centre Court today, so we'll be ready for a prompt 1.30pm BST start at SW19 today. Watch all the drama unfold as it happens by following our Barty vs Kerber live stream guide to watch Wimbledon 2021 tennis online today.",
    "If you're abroad during Wimbledon, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred Barty vs Kerber live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
