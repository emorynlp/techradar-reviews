    "Darkness. In flashbacks to Captain Marvel, the voice of Maria Rambeau says she can\u2019t leave Monica; Monica talks about building a spaceship; and Carol Danvers says, \u201cWhen they were handing out kids they gave her the toughest one.\u201d",
    "Monica Rambeau rematerializes in a hospital room \u2013 she\u2019s returning from the \u2018Blip\u2019 that wiped out half of life in the universe when Thanos snapped his fingers. She\u2019s sitting next to an empty bed.",
    "Monica rushes into the corridor where other people are appearing out of thin air \u2013 there is much confusion. She says she\u2019s looking for a patient.",
    "Eventually a doctor recognizes her. Monica says she\u2019d been in the room since her mother, Maria, came back from surgery \u2013 that she may have fallen asleep but no longer than 20 minutes. The doctor says Maria after her cancer came back, but Monica says that can\u2019t be right, that the procedure went well, and her mother was due to be discharged today. The doctor says Maria died three years ago \u2013 two years after Monica disappeared.",
    "Monica arrives at SWORD (Sentient Weapon Observation Response Division) Headquarters, but her key card doesn\u2019t let her into the building. Just as it looks like a sarcastic security guard is going to block her way, Captain Rambeau is recognized by Director Tyler Hayward, who offers to \u201ccatch her up\u201d.",
    "It\u2019s three weeks after the \u2018Blip\u2019 and Monica is the first to return to work. She asks about the astronaut training program and Hayward says it\u2019s in a dismal state \u2013 half were lost in the \u2018Blip\u2019 and half of those remaining have since lost their nerve. They\u2019ve shifted away from manned missions to robotics, nanotech and AI \u2013 \u201cSentient weapons, like it says on the door\u201d. She points out that it also says \u201cobservation and response\u201d on that door \u2013 not \u201ccreation\u201d. He points out that the world is not the same as when she left it, that there are a lot of threats in space. She counters that it was always dangerous \u2013 but there are also allies out there.",
    "Hayward acknowledges that the situation is awkward \u2013 especially as Maria built SWORD, and Monica grew up there. He explains that the FBI is \u201cin a tizzy\u201d over a missing persons case in New Jersey, and is requesting use of an imaging drone that needs a chaperone \u2013 aka Monica. Monica questions the mission, but Hayward says she\u2019s restricted to terrestrial missions for the time being. It\u2019s based on her mother\u2019s protocols in the case of \u201cvanished personnel\u201d returning. He says the positive to take away from it is that Maria always thought she\u2019d come back \u2013 and that she\u2019ll be doing him a big favor if she helps out. She says she\u2019s good to go.",
    "Monica arrives on the outskirts of Westview. She\u2019s greeted by FBI agent James E Woo. He explains that he\u2019s got a witness set up in the Witness Protection Scheme down the road in Westview and nobody can find him \u2013 in fact, none of his associates or relatives have even heard of him. To make things even weirder, the local sheriff tells them that the town of Westview doesn\u2019t exist. Woo explains that he\u2019s working his way through the phone numbers of the residents but up to now he\u2019s had no response. \u201cSo you can\u2019t reach anyone inside and everyone on the outside has some sort of selective amnesia?\u201d asks Rambeau.",
    "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a missing persons case, Captain Rambeau,\u201d Woo responds. \u201cIt\u2019s a missing town.\u201d",
    "She asks why he hasn\u2019t been inside to investigate, he replies that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to\u201d, that nobody\u2019s supposed to go in.",
    "Monica launches the drone towards the town, and wonders why only she and Woo seem to know about Westview \u2013 is it because they live outside a certain radius or because they don\u2019t have a personal connection? The drone suddenly disappears, along with the video feed from it.",
    "Monica walks towards the point where the drone went missing and realizes there\u2019s an energy field surrounding the town. She touches it and is sucked through, leaving Woo alone.",
    "24 hours later, a van drives towards Westview. Among the passengers is astrophysicist Dr Darcy Lewis, who asks about everyone\u2019s specialities \u2013 nuclear biology, artificial intelligence and a chemical engineering. Darcy says the variety means SWORD has no idea what they\u2019re dealing with.",
    "They arrive at the hastily erected SWORD Response Base outside Westview.",
    "Darcy watches as a drone pass through the energy field. She asks what data they\u2019re getting and a SWORD officer says that\u2019s \u201chighly classified\u201d, so Darcy deduces that means they can\u2019t see anything. She also points out that it\u2019s a \u201cbona fide, joint, multi-service response. I\u2019m really looking forward to the commemorative t-shirt\u201d.",
    "Darcy realizes there\u2019s a colossal amount of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation coming from the town, and notices there are longer wavelengths superimposed over the noise. She runs the signal through some diagnostic equipment and says she needs an old TV \u2013 \u201clike, not flat\u201d.",
    "Outside, Hayward sends a SWORD Agent Franklin (wearing a yellow protective suit) into the sewer network to try and infiltrate Westview. Woo says he\u2019s sceptical about the mission because there\u2019s no reason to suspect the energy field doesn\u2019t extend underground.",
    "Inside headquarters, Hayward hears studio audience laughter coming from the WandaVision broadcast. They\u2019re watching the \u201950s-set first episode. Darcy points out that Vision is supposed to be dead \u2013 \u201cnot blipped, dead\u201d. When Hayward asks what\u2019s going on, Darcy says she has no idea if it\u2019s recorded, fabricated, in real time\u2026all she knows is that the TV signal is entwined with radiation created by the Big Bang. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying the universe created a sitcom starring two Avengers?\u201d asks Woo.",
    "At a briefing, Woo explains that the mission is getting intel on Monica Rambeau, but originally the case was about a missing person so they\u2019re going to start there \u2013 identifying individuals within the anomaly. They start to identify Westview residents \u2018starring\u2019 in the sitcom.",
    "Then Darcy drops her food as she spots Monica in character as Geraldine in the show. Is Monica in deep cover, playing along\u2026? Woo asks if it\u2019s an alternative reality, time travel, \u201csome cockamamie social experiment\u2026\u201d",
    "Darcy isn\u2019t sure, but she does have an idea involving Wanda\u2019s kitchen radio. \u201cThe next time she\u2019s washing dishes, which by my count happens about once an episode, barf, we\u2019ll shoot a signal to that little guy.\u201d They should be able to communicate with her. Before they attempt to broadcast, an agent hands Woo a screen capture of a \u201cretro version of a SWORD drone\u201d that appeared in the episode \u2013 monochrome except for the red toy helicopter.",
    "Darcy watches the episode 2 scene by the swimming pool where Wanda and Monica/Geraldine are talking with Dottie. \u201cWanda, Wanda, can you read me, over?\u201d says Woo over the radio. Darcy spots something weird but says it\u2019s nothing and assumes the mission was a failure.",
    "Inside the sewer, Agent Franklin crosses the energy field. His protective suit turns into a beekeeper suit and he\u2019s surrounded by bees. The wire connecting him to SWORD is severed.",
    "He emerges from the manhole and sees Wanda and Vision.",
    "Back at the mobile SWORD HQ, Darcy and Woo are watching the \u201970s episode of the show. \u201cWhy does it keep switching time periods?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt can\u2019t be purely for my enjoyment, can it?\u201d Wanda gives birth in the episode, and Monica/Geraldine makes that unexpected reference to Ultron killing Wanda\u2019s brother, Pietro.",
    "Woo and Darcy are taken aback because it\u2019s the first time the sitcom has referenced reality. In the episode, Wanda tells Monica/Geraldine to leave, and the show suddenly jumps to credits. They run the video back and see that one second Monica/Geraldine is standing next to Wanda, the next she isn\u2019t. \u201cSomeone is censoring the broadcast,\u201d says Darcy.",
    "An alarm sounds, warning the base that the boundary has been breached.",
    "Back inside the sitcom episode, Wanda repeatedly asks Monica/Geraldine who she is. \u201cWanda, I\u2019m just your neighbor,\u201d says Monica/Geraldine. \u201cThen how could you know about Ultron?\u201d Wanda asks.",
    "Wanda fires up her magical powers, and tells Monica/Geraldine she\u2019s a \u201cstranger and an outsider, and right now you are trespassing here.\u201d She blasts Monica/Geraldine out of the house, through multiple walls and beyond the energy field. Wanda then uses her powers to restore the house. Vision gets home and asks where Geraldine is.",
    "Monica wakes up in the real world.",
    "Wanda tells Vision that Geraldine had to leave, that she had to rush home. She turns around and sees Vision with dead eyes, the Mind Stone removed from his forehead. Initially shocked, she looks back and sees him as normal. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can go wherever we want.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo we can\u2019t,\u201d she replies. \u201cThis is our home. Don\u2019t worry, darling. I have everything under control.\u201d",
    "As doctors treat Monica, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s Wanda. It\u2019s all Wanda!\u201d",
    "Back in sitcom-land, Wanda picks up one of the twins and asks what they should watch tonight. Vision looks worried as Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u2018Voodoo Chile\u2019 kicks in on the soundtrack. The camera returns to 4:3 and the audience applauds.",
    "PLEASE STAND BY.",
    "Verdict:",
    "WandaVision episode 4 goes big on exposition and it comes at just the right time for the season. While the era-specific sitcom-set episodes have been lots of fun, a fourth in succession may have signalled the start of a shark jump. That \u2018We Interrupt This Program\u2019 is able to shift the focus of the series so massively proves that Marvel\u2019s mastery of storytelling has survived the transfer to TV, with everything unfolding like clockwork. Even the use of aspect ratio is ingenious.",
    "In fact, seeing the events of WandaVision\u2019s \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s episodes from outside Westview puts an entirely new perspective on what we\u2019ve seen before. With Wanda and Vision little more than bit-part players, Monica Rambeau briefly becomes the show\u2019s protagonist \u2013 until her mishap with an energy field passes the baton to familiar faces Jimmy Woo and Darcy Lewis. From that point on it\u2019s business as usual in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with its trademark quips, self-awareness (why were those shapes hexagonal?) and sense of spectacle. For the wider MCU, it\u2019s also important that we get to see scenes of the \u2018blipped\u2019 returning to an unsuspecting and confused world.",
    "But while the episode doubles down on reveals \u2013 about what\u2019s happening outside Westview, at least \u2013 it asks just as many questions as it answers. If, as is heavily hinted, Wanda really is in control of this sitcom world, why did she take over an entire town? How did she make everyone outside forget about it? Why does everything go retro when it passes through the energy field? And what\u2019s Vision\u2019s status? (That shot of a zombie Vision suggests that all is not right\u2026)",
    "When WandaVision\u2019s sitcom odyssey moves on to the \u201980s, we\u2019ll be tuning in with all that extra knowledge about Wanda and her world. WandaVision just elevated itself from very good to excellent.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
