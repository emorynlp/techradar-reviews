    "Adobe's huge 40% discount on the Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps suite has returned once more, but it's only available for a very short time. (Not in the US? Scroll down for the best Adobe Creative Cloud deals in your region).",
    "This deal is usually a Black Friday special, but has returned again to give you bargain access to Adobe's full range of creative apps. These include pro stalwarts like Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, Premiere Pro and Illustrator, but also increasingly useful lighter apps like Fresco, Spark and Premiere Rush.",
    "The good news is that the deal saves you $240 on the Annual pre-paid plan, dropping from the usual $599.98 price to just $359.88. But you'll have to be quick to snap it up, as the deal only runs until April 30.",
    "The Creative Cloud All Apps subscription gives you access to Adobe's 20 premium apps, plus all the usual Creative Cloud benefits.",
    "These include 100GB of cloud storage for your creations and the chance to create your own website with Adobe Portfolio. If you've been looking to spruce up your creative output and online presence, this deal could be a fine opportunity to do just that.",
    "The bundle also gives you access to Adobe Fonts' many typefaces, plus there's also the added option of a 30-day trial to Adobe Stock's photos, graphics, vectors and videos.",
    "If you've been thinking about trying out Creative Cloud's many apps, it's a great time to do it for reasons beyond this deal, too. Many of Adobe's apps have been given hefty updates recently, with Photoshop and Illustrator recently given remote collaboration powers to help you work on the files of friends or colleagues from afar, and Adobe Spark also given a new 'shared templates' feature just yesterday.",
    "It's unlikely that we'll see this deal re-emerge again before the summer, so if you've been looking to supercharge your creative work, it could be a fine to time to sign up to Adobe's full range of apps."
