  "article": [
    "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap for Nintendo Switch is coming April 30, but those expecting a massive Pok\u00e9mon adventure may be disappointed.",
    "The file size for the game has been revealed to be just 6.8GB, which is a fraction of the size of recent Pok\u00e9mon games like Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, which takes up a more hefty 10.3GB of space on the Switch's built-in storage (or a Nintendo Switch microSD card).",
    "It's one of the smaller Pok\u00e9mon games in recent memory, then, though that does stack up with what we know of the game. As a remake of Pok\u00e9mon Snap, the classic Nintendo 64 game that released in 1999, it will again be an on-rails camera shooter and won't, it seems, feature the kind of open world exploration of a mainline Pok\u00e9mon RPG.",
    "It makes sense, then, that the game wouldn't need as many assets \u2013 especially since there'll be a limited Pok\u00e9dex of just 200 pocket monsters, instead of hundreds more creatures you could hypothetically 'capture'.",
    "This information comes direct from Nintendo's product page for the game \u2013 which also specifies that New Pok\u00e9mon Snap will be a single-player experience.",
    "There is, however, mention of online capabilities \u2013 for those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription \u2013 which, if not referring to multiplayer, likely means there'll be collective online events, such as rare Pok\u00e9mon that only appear for a select number of days within the game.",
    "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap joins the likes of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury as one of the most anticipated Nintendo Switch releases this year. We're also expecting to see Breath of the Wild 2 in 2021, but Nintendo has been awfully quiet about how the game has been progressing since its initial reveal.",
    "Nintendo is also set to release a new Nintendo Switch Mario Red and Blue Edition console, which launches alongside Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury on February 12, though there's still no word on the long-rumored Nintendo Switch 2.",
    "For those who have been waiting decades for a sequel to Pok\u00e9mon Snap on Nintendo 64, the unique point and shoot gameplay that New Pok\u00e9mon Snap looks set to provide is likely to be well-received. Maybe we'll get a Pok\u00e9mon Snap VR game one day?"
