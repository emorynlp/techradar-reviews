    "Many broadcasters worldwide are covering the Olympics, and many of them are airing it for free too. BBC / BBC iPlayer in the UK is offering coverage of key events, while Channel 7 / 7Plus in Australia has perhaps the most comprehensive free coverage there is.",
    "ARD and ZDF in Germany are a few of the broadcasters that are providing free coverage of the Tokyo Olympics, as well as RTE in Ireland.",
    "The official Olympics website is broadcasting the events for free as well, but their coverage may be limited compared to that of domestic broadcasters.",
    "No matter where you are around the world, there should be an Olympic Games stream to ensure you can watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, whether paid-for or free. However, you may find your preferred domestic coverage is geo-restricted when abroad, or that your place of work, college, or school has prevented the ability to access your chosen service and watch online.",
    "Thankfully, there's any easy work-around. Simply download a VPN and you can spoof your device into appearing as if it's located somewhere else. Essentially, then, you can appear as if you're where your coverage is geo-locked to and watch as if you're right at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location, i.e. UK for iPlayer, US for Sling TV",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to BBC iPlayer",
    "With many countries around the world taking part in the Olympic Games, you can find a broadcaster to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in most countries, whether free or platforms that charge.",
    "For those countries we haven't mentioned above, Wikipedia's dedicated page allows you to see a breakdown of Olympic Games TV channels to tune into."
