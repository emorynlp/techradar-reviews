    "Did you know you could access Amazon Prime Video on Chromecast? One of the world\u2019s most watched streaming services is available through the popular streaming dongle, Chromecast - and it\u2019s a match made in heaven, making it easier than ever to watch Amazon Prime Video on just about any TV.",
    "Chromecast is an incredibly simple to use and portable device, and once you download the Prime Video app to an iOS or Android device, you can start watching your favorite shows in minutes\u2014wherever you are. Read on to find out how to get started.",
    "Yes, but it hasn\u2019t always been easy. Now all you need to do is download the app, plug in your Chromecast, and off you go.",
    "Before, a dongle feud between Amazon and Google made the process a lot more difficult. You were only able to stream Prime Video through the Chrome browser on your desktop, and if you wanted to use a smartphone or tablet, you had to install the Google Home app first.",
    "It was a highly convoluted process. Thankfully, Google and Amazon have settled their differences and compatibility is no longer an issue.",
    "The very first thing you need to do is install the Amazon Prime Video app on your device. Open it, then select the Cast icon and the Chromecast device that you want to stream from.",
    "Make sure your device (plus Google Play Services for Android devices), Prime Video app, and Chromecast are up to date, and that both your device and Chromecast are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.",
    "Next, choose something to watch. You'll see the name of the title appear on the display of the screen your Chromecast is streaming to and you're good to go.",
    "You can also download the Prime Video app to a Chromecast connected to Google TV and use the device's remote control to navigate Prime Video. Be aware, you can't use Chromecast for streaming via the Prime Video app on an Amazon Fire tablet.",
    "Of course, if you haven't already, you should also get yourself signed up to Amazon Prime Video.",
    "Amazon Prime Video is a leading streaming service, and there are hundreds of movies and TV shows to choose from. As well as content from other channels and networks - like the addictive reality TV show Below Deck - the service hosts Amazon's original content.",
    "Amazon Studios has produced some stand-out shows and movies in recent years, like the alternate-reality wartime thriller The Man in the High Castle, and Sacha Baron Coen's controversial second helping of the Borat series - yep, you can watch Borat 2 on Amazon Prime Video.",
    "On top of this, you can watch other dedicated channels such as StarPlayz, MGM, and the Discovery Channel. Sports fans can even enjoy live streaming of major events like the Australian Open.",
    "If Amazon Prime Video isn\u2019t enough for you, you might want to look at the other streaming services available, including:",
    "There are plenty of ways to watch Amazon Prime Video as well as on Chromecast. You can get Amazon Prime Video on Roku. Of course, it's also available to watch on Amazon's very own streaming device, the Amazon Fire Stick. You'll also be able to download the Prime Video app to iOS and Android devices, as well as being able to access it via most Smart TVs."
