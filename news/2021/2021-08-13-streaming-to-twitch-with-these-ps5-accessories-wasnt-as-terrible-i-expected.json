    "Streaming to Twitch is something that I\u2019ve dabbled with in the past, but I\u2019ve been curious to know whether streaming directly from my PS5 \u2013 using the laziest setup possible \u2013 could provide a somewhat enjoyable experience for any unfortunate viewer who stumbled across my channel.",
    "You see, while I\u2019m aware that you can significantly improve the quality of a stream by using a capture card and dedicated broadcast software like OBS, I honestly can\u2019t stomach sitting in my office a minute longer than I have to these days. I wanted to determine, then, if it was possible to stream while slumped on my couch, using just the PS5, Sony 3D Pulse Wireless Headset and PS5 HD Camera.",
    "And you know what? It\u2019s not as bad as I thought it would be.",
    "It wasn\u2019t long before I encountered my first stumbling block, however. The PS5 HD Camera\u2019s quality, especially in low light conditions, isn\u2019t great. In fact, it\u2019s pretty awful. This can be combated somewhat using a decent softbox light but, for my cheap and cheerful setup, it was rather disappointing that the PS5\u2019s proprietary camera (you can\u2019t use any other webcam, annoyingly) wasn\u2019t a bit more capable.",
    "A feature that I did enjoy, though, is how you can make the PS5\u2019s camera focus directly on your face. As I sit much further away from the TV than I would a monitor, the ability to have the camera zoom in to capture my grizzly visage is a huge plus, but I did notice that I had to set the PS5 HD Camera up to capture my face each time I turned it on.",
    "Another win for the PS5 HD Camera is how it lets you customize how the image will appear on screen. You can choose from various cutouts, like a circle or square, along with different types of filters, such as a monochrome or a scanline effect. There\u2019s even support for those who use a green screen.",
    "Not bad, then. But there\u2019s one big flaw you need to consider if you want to use a facecam on PS5: be prepared to sacrifice some precious screen real estate.",
    "Wherever you place the cutout of your face on screen when streaming on PS5, there\u2019s a high probability it will block some sort of key information. This isn\u2019t the case if you stream using a capture card and say, OBS, as only the viewer is subjected to your facecam layout, pop ups and notifications. On PS5, you\u2019re shown exactly what the viewer sees, so your camera will be permanently on screen, and will unfortunately mask information you really need to see during a game.",
    "Thankfully, Twitch\u2019s notifications aren\u2019t quite as intrusive. You\u2019ll be notified briefly if someone joins your stream to watch, and comments will appear on screen for a few seconds. Sure, it\u2019s not the most exciting or interactive experience out there, but for the most part it works. A little notification to indicate if you have a new follower would be welcome, though.",
    "But what about the audio quality when streaming? Again, it\u2019s a mixed bag. While I really enjoy the sound quality from the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset, the microphone isn\u2019t exactly broadcast quality \u2013 something which was immediately apparent after watching my Twitch stream back. It isn\u2019t the worst sounding microphone I\u2019ve ever heard, but it\u2019s muffled, lacking clarity and detail, and isn\u2019t really pleasant to listen to if you plan on retaining a captivated audience.",
    "This problem could be easily circumvented by using a different headset with a superior mic when streaming on PS5, but with the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset being such a popular choice, it\u2019s a shame the microphone is so bang average.",
    "One thing that particularly stood out when streaming to Twitch from a PS5, though, is just how surprisingly crisp and clear the actual video is. If the video quality wasn\u2019t up to snuff, then streaming from your PS5 just wouldn\u2019t be worth it. Period. Luckily, my zippy internet speeds (around 140MB/s down) meant I could stream at 1080p 60fps, and I must admit that the quality was excellent throughout. There\u2019s little sign of artefacts, barely any visible stutters or frame drops, and the audio balance is good, if not a touch quiet for my liking. Overall, there\u2019s nothing to complain about here.",
    "So is streaming to Twitch using nothing but Sony\u2019s official PS5 accessories worth it? Well, I think I actually summed it up best during my stream of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered:",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s nice being able to just stream off the couch, no worries, and I\u2019m not having to sit at my desk. Yeah, the lighting isn't that great, the mic\u2019s probably not that great, and I can\u2019t have fancy notifications. And it\u2019s annoying that my picture sits over the game. But it\u2019s easy \u2013 it\u2019s like the McDonald\u2019s of streaming.\u201d",
    "You can watch the whole stream here."
