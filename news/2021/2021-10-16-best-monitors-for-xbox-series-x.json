    "Only the best monitors for Xbox Series X can truly do that next-gen console justice. Trust us on this: where your Xbox gaming experience is concerned, an excellent 4K monitor with HDMI 2.1 ports, 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR capability is this console\u2019s ideal match. After all, the Xbox Series X is packing power massive enough to handle even 8K gaming (according to Microsoft, at least), so anything less than 4K/60fps gameplay might put a damper on things.",
    "The only snag is that while 4K gaming panels have been around for a while, they\u2019re not exactly all-around affordable. Budget and mid-range 4K monitors have to make sacrifices while the kitted-out ones will cost you an arm and a leg. So, before you commit, know that the price of entry isn\u2019t going to be wallet-friendly. However, if you do have the cash, that ultimate monitor for your Xbox Series X will be more than worth the splurge.",
    "To help you narrow down your options and make it easier to choose, we gathered the best monitors for Xbox Series X below. For good measure, we\u2019ve even included our price comparison tool \u2013 so that you might save a few bucks if a monitor deal is available.",
    "Also our top pick as the best monitor for PS5, the Acer Nitro XV282K\u2019s appeal to console gamers is undeniable. It has all the makings of an excellent Xbox Series X and PS5 display without the incredibly steep price. Don\u2019t get us wrong; it\u2019s still plenty expensive, but less so than other options out there. As long as you\u2019re okay with a smaller 28-inch screen and only DisplayHDR 400. Neither are deal-breakers anyway, especially since you\u2019re getting that impeccable ultra HD resolution and up to 120Hz refresh rate thanks to its two HDMI 2.1 ports. Plus, that size is just perfect for desk gaming.",
    "The Acer Predator CG7 might burn a 43-inch monitor-sized hole in your bank account, but there\u2019s no denying this is the ultimate monitor for console gaming. Its massive size isn\u2019t the only thing that will put you smack in the middle of the action; its 4K resolution and proper DisplayHDR 1000 will as well. Being a sort of TV replacement, there\u2019s also a whole lot of ports here, so if you also want to use it to connect your PS5, gaming PC, and laptop \u2013 not to mention, your slew of peripherals \u2013 have at it. We\u2019re also fond of its RGB lighting in the back so be sure to turn that on. We only wish it also supported Dolby Vision, especially considering its price.",

    "Those who cannot afford a monitor over $1,000/\u00a31,000 \u2013 you\u2019ve just splurged on an Xbox Series X, after all \u2013 will be glad to know that they have a cheaper option. The more affordably priced LG 27UD88-W will deliver that sharp 4K gameplay you want in a 27-inch package without costing a fortune, and it\u2019s a terrific prospect for those who aren\u2019t too picky about picture quality. There is a caveat, however. Its HDMI 2.0 ports mean that your Xbox Series X experience tops out at 30fps so it isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest. Still, its an excellent monitor to tide you over until you\u2019ve replenished your savings",

    "The Gigabyte Aorus FV43U is the monitor that rules them all, size-wise, HDR support-wise \u2013 and if you have a lot of money to spare, it\u2019s worth taking a look. While it does have the same features as the Acer Predator CG7 \u2013 DisplayHDR 1000, 120Hz refresh rate, 4K resolution \u2013 and also sits around the same price point, it has a few aces up its sleeves. That includes its terrific sounding 12W speakers and its Quantum Dot panel for even more vibrant colors and much better viewing angles, not to mention a higher DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. And, that\u2019s while being ever so slightly cheaper as well.",

    "You\u2019ll quite easily forgive the exorbitantly-priced Gigabyte Aorus FO48U for not missing out on things like Dolby Vision. This absolutely gorgeous gaming monitor already has most of the things you could want from an Xbox Series X monitor \u2013 an almost 50-inch display, ultra HD resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, Adaptive-Sync, and HDR \u2013 and then some. And, by some we don\u2019t just mean its speakers that blast excellent audio quality, though that is a nice addition. We actually mean its OLED panel that delivers deep blacks, vibrant colors, and excellent contrast. Gaming on this is an absolutely glorious experience, and if you haven\u2019t gotten into OLED monitors yet, here\u2019s a compelling reason to do it."
