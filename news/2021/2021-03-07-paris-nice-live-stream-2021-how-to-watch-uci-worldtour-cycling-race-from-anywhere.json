    "The Race to the Sun sounds like something we could all get on board with right now, and the 79th edition of Paris\u2013Nice has become something of a beacon of hope on the cycling calendar. Last year's race was the last on the UCI WorldTour schedule to go ahead before the rapidly worsening Covid situation forced a four and a half month break - and a year on it feels slightly surreal to be back. Read on as we explain how to get a 2021 Paris-Nice live stream today and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online wherever you are right now.",
    "Eight stages have tentatively been planned, though the possibility of a strict lockdown in France means that proceedings may have to end early again.",
    "Max Schachmann won last year's abridged Paris-Nice, and he's back to defend his title with Bora-Hansgrohe. Last year's race was a belter, which saw the German seize the yellow jersey after a blustery opening stage and never let go.",
    "The route will run a total of 1,235km, starting in Saint-Cyr-l\u2019Ecole near Paris and snaking down through the heart of France towards Nice and the beautiful C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, which is where the views become almost as breathtaking as the hill climbs.",
    "The race starts out with two flat stages that should expose the riders to potentially tumultuous crosswinds, before the Stage 3 individual time trial, followed by a motley mix of flat, lumpy and hilly stages, with the summit finish at La Colmiane on the Queen Stage set to be a potentially key climb.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a Paris-Nice live stream from anywhere in the world.",
    "Best of all, you can watch a FREE Paris-Nice live stream in loads of countries. In Australia, SBS Viceland is providing free coverage of the race.",
    "Or you can dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book, because anyone in Italy can watch for free on RaiSport, cycling fans in Belgium can tune in for free on Sporza, those in France can get the race on France 3, and viewers in Spain can watch on Teledeporte - all without paying a penny.",
    "If you're a resident of Australia, Italy, Belgium, France or Spain and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "Our latest 2021 testing showed our recommended VPN working well on these platforms from abroad, and we'll be sure to confirm for this race as soon as it's underway.",
    "If you're desperate to watch every stage of the Paris-Nice but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
