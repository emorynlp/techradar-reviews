    "Spoilers follow for Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy is a superhero TV show that subverts viewers\u2019 expectations on more than one occasion. There are numerous big twists throughout Netflix\u2019s adaptation of Mark Millar and Frank Quitley\u2019s comic books, but the series\u2019 most shocking moment is reserved for the season 1 finale - and it\u2019s an ending that hints at a darker narrative to come.",
    "Ahead of the release of Jupiter\u2019s Legacy on Netflix, TechRadar sat down with Millar to discuss episode 8\u2019s biggest moments, including that villainous turn, and how the finale\u2019s events set up a potential Jupiter's Legacy season 2.",
    "Walter Sampson, aka Brainwave, isn\u2019t the man (or superhero) that audiences thought he was. As the season 1 finale reveals, it\u2019s Walter, and not George Hutchence, aka Sky Fox, who is behind the series' major mystery.",
    "As we find out, it\u2019s Brainwave who cloned the supervillain Blackstar, with the latter killing a bunch of superheroes, including Tectonic, during episode 1\u2019s major battle. That led to Walter\u2019s nephew Brandon Sampson (Paragon) killing the Blackstar clone in order to save his dad - Sheldon Sampson (the Utopian), who is also Walter\u2019s brother - and leads to Brandon breaking the Union\u2019s \u2018no killing\u2019 rule. It\u2019s a move that causes Sheldon to lash out at his son and forms a rift in their relationship.",
    "That\u2019s not all. Brainwave is also the individual who frees the original Blackstar from his prison cell in the finale, which results in Sheldon further alienating Brandon after the duo team up to take Blackstar down. Sheldon hesitates when Blackstar, who is holding Brandon captive, baits Sheldon to kill him in order to save his son. Sheldon doesn\u2019t as he wants to uphold the Union\u2019s \u2018no killing\u2019 rule, which - after Blackstar is defeated - leaves Brandon feeling even more distant from his father.",
    "Ultimately, Walter\u2019s plan is to destroy Sheldon and Brandon\u2019s relationship until it\u2019s irreparable. In doing so, he hopes to convert Brandon to his cause, overthrow Sheldon and the other superheroes, and install himself as the Union\u2019s new tyrannical leader. This plays out in a similar way to the events of the comics, too, so long time Jupiter's Legacy fans won't feel that there's been a major departure from the source material.",
    "To cause further instability within the Union, Walter claims that Sky Fox, the world\u2019s greatest supervillain, is the one behind Blackstar\u2019s clone and who released the original from his cell. It\u2019s a move that not only disguises his true intentions to those closest to him, but also to audiences.",
    "Why does Walter do this? For one, he's tired of his fellow superheroes doing nothing to actually save the world (more on this later). The main reason, however, is that he's jealous of Sheldon. Despite being the older brother, Walter has lived in Sheldon's shadow for over a century by the time we reach the TV show's present day setting. The constant sniping he received from George back in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as Sky Fox's banishment from the Union, also gives Walter a scapegoat on which to pin all of season 1's modern day events on.",
    "Fans of Millar and Quitley\u2019s comics will know of Walter\u2019s plan, but non-readers may be shocked by his villainous turn - and it\u2019s one that Millar can\u2019t wait for viewers to witness and react to.",
    "\u201cI think it was almost a magician's trick, because there\u2019s a sleight of hand [on Walter\u2019s part], he explains. \u201cYou aren't looking at Walter; the whole time you\u2019re thinking about Sky Fox because his name\u2019s getting dropped as an external threat from episode one. Eventually, you realize that the threat is much closer to home, and I think that\u2019s really interesting as a final episode twist.\u201d",
    "Walter\u2019s scheming against Sheldon isn\u2019t the only familial betrayal in season 1\u2019s finale. As we find out, Raikou - a telepath like Brainwave - is Walter\u2019s daughter, and it\u2019s the superpowered mercenary who is the audience\u2019s way into finding out about Walter\u2019s plan.",
    "Raikou is the one who reveals that he created Blackstar\u2019s clone and whose subtle conversations with Brandon have started to turn him against his father. Raikou has no allegiance to the Union, but she knows that her father has turned on his own and plans to remove them by any means necessary.",
    "How does Raikou know this? Well, when Walter is \u2018trapped\u2019 inside the mind of Blackstar\u2019s clone, it\u2019s Raikou who uses her powers to stop him from being imprisoned forever. By keeping this psychic doorway open, Raikou determines what Walter\u2019s plan is and tries to use it to blackmail him during a later conversation.",
    "That chat doesn\u2019t end well for Raikou. As it happens, the pair\u2019s tense discussions have occurred inside one of Brainwave\u2019s mind palace scenarios. When the mirage ends, we see that he\u2019s killed Raikou. It\u2019s a grisly end for the telepathic assassin, but it shows how far Walter is willing to go in order to succeed with his plan. Comic book fans will also know there are other major shocking moments still to come, but we\u2019ll refrain from spoiling them here in case Jupiter's Legacy gets a second season.",
    "While Walter is primed to be the TV show\u2019s main antagonist in future seasons, Millar reveals that he does have some sympathy for him. Walter\u2019s intentions, Millar claims, come from a good place, albeit one with extremely questionable methods and ideals.",
    "\u201cWalter has noble intentions, but he's willing to do anything to get there,\u201d Millar says. \u201cUltimately, like all the best bad guys, he thinks he\u2019s right. He\u2019s like \u2018These superheroes have done nothing for 90 years. This planet is as messed up as it was in 1929 with the fiscal cliff we\u2019re on, nationalism is on the rise and it\u2019s a complete nightmare\u2019. He thinks he\u2019s got to stop these superheroes from letting it happen all over again, so he might have to take out a few people [to do so].\u201d",
    "As for what Raikou\u2019s death at her father\u2019s hands means for the series moving forward, Millar stresses that it\u2019s just the start of how dark Jupiter\u2019s Legacy can get from this point on.",
    "\u201cYou know that any future story is going to go in a completely unpredictable direction, because nothing\u2019s going to get in Walter\u2019s way,\u201d he says. \u201cHis own daughter\u2019s death was actually a good way of showing his ruthlessness and single mindedness. You can also see why his plan would be attractive to the younger superheroes. It\u2019s like Paradise Lost, where he\u2019s like Lucifer whispering in the ears of the younger angels, so it [the TV show] is going to go to interesting places.\u201d",
    "Those \u201cinteresting places\u201d, which Millar alludes to, concern Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2. Despite Millar\u2019s assertions, in an interview with the Scotland Herald, that development on a second chapter is coming in 2022, the comic writer tells us that future instalments for the TV series would depend on how well it\u2019s received by audiences.",
    "\u201cWe do have our little private chats,\u201d Millar says when we ask about a potential season 2. \u201cBut the thing is it all depends on what people think. We hope it's as big as we think it's going to be, and we\u2019re quite confident people are going to like it. So, fingers crossed, we get a second season.\u201d",
