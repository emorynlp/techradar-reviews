    "We'd already got word that Samsung was holding a major event on August 11, and now all of the devices that it has in the pipeline have been shown off \u2013 the Galaxy Z Fold 3, the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the Galaxy S21 FE, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, the Galaxy Watch 4, and the Galaxy Buds 2.",
    "That's quite a list of new devices, and well-known tipster Evan Blass has revealed the full lot with some 360-degree GIFs on Twitter. Quite how long they'll stay online remains to be seen, but it would appear to be confirmation that we're getting six new gadgets.",
    "We've actually seen most of these pictures before, but this time they're all in one Twitter thread: we've got the Z Fold 3 in black, olive green and white, the Z Flip 3 in black, gold, olive green and purple, and the Galaxy S21 FE in black, olive green, purple and white.",
    "The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic shows up in black, silver and white, the Galaxy Watch 4 offers black, green, pink, silver and white, and it looks like the Galaxy Buds 2 will be available in green, purple and white.",
    "These pictures look authentic enough to have been swiped straight from the PR department at Samsung, and it seems that the August 11 and not August 3 is going to be the big launch day.",
    "Around the same time as the renders were posted online, we heard that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE \u2013 a more affordable variant of the Samsung Galaxy S21 \u2013 might only be launching in Europe and the US, because of the ongoing global chip shortage (as per The Korea Herald via SamMobile).",
    "Only yesterday we got advance notice of a few key specs around the smartphone courtesy of a filing at the TENAA agency in China, including a suggestion that the phone would come with a microSD card slot, which is something Samsung hasn't been particularly consistent about lately.",
    "Whatever the official specs of these devices, we don't have long to wait to actually see them. With foldables, phones, wearables and earbuds to show off, the next Samsung Unpacked event is going to be a busy show, and we will of course bring you all the announcements as they're made.",
    "Numerous leaks and rumors have already spilled out about the upcoming Samsung devices, but one piece of hardware we're unlikely to see is the Galaxy Note 21 \u2013 it seems Samsung has decided not to release a Note in 2021, though it remains to be seen whether the series will return again next year."
