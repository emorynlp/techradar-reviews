    "The American adult cartoon sit-com is back for a fifth season, following mad-scientist Rick and his grandson Morty. Whether you're a dedicated viewer back for season 5, or prepared to embark on a binge-watch of this kooky sci-fi, here's how to watch Rick and Morty online where you are.",
    "The series originated from a short parody of Back to the Future and charts the misadventures of mad scientist Rick - a drunk with serious sociopathetic tendencies - and his well-meaning but slightly naive 14-year-old grandson, Morty.",
    "Created by Dan Harmon (of Community fame) and Justin Roiland, it first aired in 2013 and has since transcended mere cult status, with previous seasons featuring guest stars like Taika Waititi, Elon Musk and Liam Cunningham to name but a few. It was renewed for a further 70 episodes at the end of season 3, which at current pace would take it to at least a tenth season.",
    "With that in mind, here's where to stream every season of Rick and Morty online - including how to watch Rick and Morty season 5 from anywhere in the world.",
    "If you find yourself abroad in a country where your preferred streaming service isn't available or you can't log-in to watch the show as usual, that's probably down to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Thankfully, help is at hand. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite show no matter where you are, simply by changing your IP address to one that's back in your country of residence. Here's how to get started with this essential bit of streaming software."
