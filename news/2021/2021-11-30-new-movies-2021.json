  "article": [
    "Everyone knows that 2020 was a disastrous year for theaters. The global pandemic forced the unprecedented closure of cinemas en masse, with major studios subsequently left with no choice but to pull movie after movie from their annual release schedules.",
    "But in 2021, as the successful rollout of vaccines in many countries continues to provide a belated source of optimism, things are looking up for Hollywood. In fact, this year has turned out to be one of the best for film fans in living memory.",
    "Not only will we have seen four Marvel movies released come the end of 2021 (Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Eternals and Spider-Man: No Way Home), but we've also already enjoyed the big budget action of theater-first flicks like No Time to Die and Dune.",
    "It's not all sunshine and rainbows just yet, though. Paramount has again delayed its 2022 release schedule (meaning both Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 will arrive later than anticipated), while many of Warner's movies are still launching simultaneously on HBO Max.",
    "Still, what remains of 2021, coupled with a promising outlook for 2022, paints a refreshingly positive picture of an industry in rude health. Below, you'll find every new movie worth getting excited about over the coming months.",
    "Release date: December 10, 2021 (theatrical)",
    "The year is set to go out with a song and dance, as all eyes turn to Steven Spielberg\u2019s first ever big screen musical. And let's be honest, the legendary director of Indiana Jones, Jaws and Saving Private Ryan couldn\u2019t have chosen a bigger act to follow. Robert Wise's Oscar-winning 1961 movie version of the classic Bernstein and Sondheim production is undoubtedly one of the greatest screen musicals of all time, so it\u2019ll be exciting to see what Spielberg can bring to the party.",
    "Release date: December 17, 2021 (theatrical)",
    "The most remarkable thing about Spider-Man: No Way Home is that it exists at all. Thankfully, rights holders Sony were able to settle a dispute with Marvel Studios that could have seen Tom Holland\u2019s Spidey going solo, and now the Wallcrawler will continue to operate within the labyrinthine continuity of the MCU.",
    "The mid-credits twist of Far From Home makes that particularly welcome news, having plunged Spidey into new territory when Mysterio revealed Peter Parker\u2019s secret identity to the world. It also looks like he'll be exploring the multiverse, with several rumors suggesting that two former screen Spideys, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, are joining the action. Old villains like Electro, Doc Ock and Green Goblin are already confirmed to appear, thanks to teasers in the movie's first trailer.",
    "Release date: December 22, 2021 (US, theatrical and streaming via HBO Max and UK, theatrical)",
    "The Matrix saga was supposed to be done and dusted after the twin disappointments of Reloaded and Revolutions, but Warner Bros. is inviting us to take the red pill once more in this unexpected follow-up. Lana Wachowski, half of the original writer/director team, is back for the reboot, along with stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss. Both their characters died in the original trilogy, so we\u2019re not sure how this movie fits in with the predecessors \u2013 the Wachowskis were secretive even before JJ Abrams and Christopher Nolan made it fashionable, so concrete information is thin on the ground. Still, in the cyber-world of The Matrix, pretty much anything should be possible, so expect to see bullet-time taken to the next level.",
    "Confirmed to be called The Matrix Resurrections, the movie's first teaser trailer was unveiled at this year's CinemaCon event, and we've broken down 11 things we noticed.",
    "Release date: December 22, 2021 (theatrical)",
    "After the fun action of Kingsman: The Secret Service, the franchise quickly went off the rails with the overblown The Golden Circle. There's a lot riding on this third instalment, then, which may be why it's gone in such a radical new direction, heading back to World War I to show the early days of top-secret, impeccably tailored spy organization The Kingsmen. Ralph Fiennes is the M-type figure (shouldn't be too much of a stretch\u2026) who recruits Harris Dickinson's Conrad to the club to combat an early 20th century brand of villainy. Sounds like a retro James Bond to us, and there's nothing wrong with that.",
    "Release date: December 31, 2021 (theatrical)",
    "BBC Culture has already described Julia Ducournau\u2019s Titane as \"the most shocking film of 2021,\" which has us more excited than we otherwise usually would be to see a movie about a woman with a unique attraction to cars. Titane follows Alexia (Agathe Rousselle in her feature film debut), a woman who, after being injured in a car accident as a child, has a titanium plate fitted into her head. Ducournau wowed audiences with her 2016 debut, Raw, so we've got high hopes for this one.",
    "Looking further ahead, these are the big movies coming up in 2022.",
    "Release date: January 28, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Having had a monster hit with Venom in 2018, Sony plunders Spider-Man's rogues' gallery once again, with a movie focusing on one Michael Morbius. The so-called \"living vampire\" is a scientist who uses an experimental serum to cure a debilitating condition, and ends up turning himself into a bloodsucker.",
    "Jared Leto, who has comic book movie form as the Joker, takes on the role of Morbius, alongside former Doctor Who star Matt Smith as Loxias Crown, a villain with the same bloodsucking affliction as the title star. Daniel Espinosa is at the helm \u2013 a remarkable piece of synergy, seeing as his 2017 movie Life was once rumored to be a Venom prequel.",
    "Release date: February 4, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Wow, an entirely new horror IP? Not exactly. The Black Phone will see director Scott Derrickson adapt a 2004 short story of the same name by Joe Hill, which follows the plight of a kidnapped child who communicates \u2013 through, you guessed it, a black phone \u2013 with his kidnapper\u2019s previous victims to try and escape. Sounds like a neat premise, at least.",
    "Release date: February 11, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Kenneth Branagh directs the sequel to his Murder on the Orient Express adaptation, where he returns to his role \u2013 and that impressively sculpted facial hair \u2013 as Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot. As in the first movie, he's taken a dazzling ensemble cast along for the ride, this time including Gal Gadot, Sex Education\u2019s Emma Mackey and Black Panther's Letitia Wright. Don't expect any massive surprises in the plot \u2013 the story's over 80 years old \u2013 but with whodunits like this, the fun is always in watching Poirot sleuthing up a storm.",
    "Release date: February 18, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Tom Holland stars as PlayStation-originated hero Nathan Drake in this adaptation of Naughty Dog's games, which also co-stars Mark Wahlberg. This one's been kicking around the schedules for years, and this time director Ruben Fleischer (Venom, Zombieland) is attached to make it. The games themselves were pretty cinematic, so it'll be interesting to see if this film can contribute anything new to Drake's story.",
    "Release date: March 4, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Robert Pattinson follows in the footsteps of Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale and Ben Affleck as the latest man to don the most famous cowl in cinema. Dawn of/War for the Planet of the Apes director Matt Reeves gets the keys to the Batmobile in the latest reboot of the most versatile hero in comics, and he\u2019s promised his take on the Caped Crusader will feel \u201cvery psychological, very emotional\u201d.",
    "Gotham City is traditionally defined by its villains, however, and The Batman has plenty, with Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as Riddler and Colin Farrell as The Penguin. This could be a worthy successor to Christopher Nolan\u2019s superlative Dark Knight trilogy.",
    "Release date: May 27, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Tom Cruise climbs back into that famous fighter jet cockpit for the first time since Top Gun made him the biggest star on the planet over three decades ago. Resurrecting the most '80s of movies in the cut and thrust of the 21st century marketplace is a gamble, even for Cruise, but the production team are doing everything they can to recapture the old magic \u2013 as well as real action with real planes, they've brought back synth legend Harold 'Axel F' Faltermeyer on music duties. Plot wise, Pete \u2018Maverick\u2019 Mitchell is still an instructor at the Top Gun school, while one of his students (played by Whiplash's Miles Teller) just happens to be the son of Mav's late co-pilot, Goose. We're still feeling the need for speed...",
    "Release date: June 10, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "If there\u2019s one certainty in Hollywood, it\u2019s that \u2013 like life \u2013 major franchises find a way. So, despite production having been halted by coronavirus restrictions in March 2020, the sixth Jurassic movie got back in front of the cameras in July of last year. The big news this time out is that Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard will be joining forces with Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, all reprising their roles from the original Jurassic Park. But with dinosaurs now loose on American soil after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, this movie promises to be very different to its prehistoric predecessors.",
    "We were supposed to be seeing this in June 2021, but you can fill the hole with short film Battle at Big Rock (above).",
    "Release date: September 30, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "Tom Cruise will have hit 60 by the time the seventh Mission: Impossible movie smashes its way into cinemas. Don\u2019t expect him to give up his mantle as Hollywood\u2019s leading action star anytime soon, however, as there\u2019s still plenty of spectacular stunts for Cruise to risk life and limb for \u2013 part of the fun of the series is finding out what its leading man will dare to try next. Having delivered the long-running franchise\u2019s best instalments with Rogue Nation and Fallout, Christopher McQuarrie is back behind the camera for part 7 and its follow-up. Plot details are currently wrapped up tighter than a government vault, but Mission: Impossible is a brand that tends to deliver.",
    "Release date: December 16, 2022 (theatrical)",
    "James Cameron is anything but prolific these days \u2013 Avatar 2 will be his third movie in 25 years \u2013 but when he does step behind the camera, you know you\u2019ll be seeing something groundbreaking. He tends to spend the long gaps between releases waiting for filmmaking technology to catch up with his vision, so his return to the spectacular alien ecosystem of Pandora will feature world-first underwater performance capture sequences.",
    "Kate Winslet (who held her breath for an incredible seven minutes during filming), Jemaine Clement and Cliff Curtis join the cast alongside Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana. Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang also return, despite their characters being presumed dead.",
    "While this sequel was delayed a year as part of Disney's massive Covid-19-induced release date shake up, you won\u2019t have to wait another decade for more Avatar \u2013 part 3 is set for December 2024, with a fourth and fifth movie also in the works."
