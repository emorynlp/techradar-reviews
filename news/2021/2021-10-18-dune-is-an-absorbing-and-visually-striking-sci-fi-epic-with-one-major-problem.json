    "Getting a movie adaptation of a popular book right is a massive challenge: get it wrong, and a series' devoted following won't be happy. It's even more challenging if that book is especially complex, and hasn't historically made the leap to the big screen with much creative success or cohesive storytelling.",
    "This sums up the situation surrounding Dune, Warner Bros\u2019 upcoming movie adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s seminal 1965 novel. The sci-fi epic possesses a diehard fan base and a convoluted plot \u2013 a potential recipe for disaster for whoever is brave enough to turn it into a film.",
    "With Dune fanatic and Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve at the helm, though, Warner Bros\u2019 big screen treatment of Herbert\u2019s iconic novel may have a better chance of succeeding than David Lynch\u2019s maligned 1984 offering.",
    "So how does Villeneuve\u2019s version hold up? Dune is an enthralling adaptation that does justice to Herbert\u2019s grand sci-fi saga, although there are some issues that hinder it during its two and a half hour runtime.",
    "Set in the far future, Dune follows Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), the heir to House Atreides, as he and his family are entrusted with Arrakis, a dangerous desert planet, by the galaxy\u2019s emperor.",
    "Also known as Dune, Arrakis is the only source of 'spice', the universe\u2019s most valuable substance, which grants its users superhuman abilities and makes interstellar travel possible.",
    "It isn\u2019t long, though, before House Atreides finds itself fighting on multiple fronts. Archrivals in House Harkonnen enviously eye Arrakis\u2019 'spice' mining operation. The planet\u2019s natives in the Fremen, as well as mammoth sandworms that swim across the deserts, present sizable threats, too. What follows is a sci-fi chronicle for the ages, complete with numerous twists and turns that\u2019ll leave viewers on tenterhooks.",
    "Dune\u2019s elaborate nature is exemplified by the sheer size of its cast. Alongside Paul, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Villeneuve\u2019s adaptation introduces us to 16 main and supporting characters.",
    "With each one portrayed by a star name, and given that they\u2019re all key to Dune\u2019s expansive plot, you might think it's an impossible task to seamlessly introduce audiences to each character, their personality and their motives.",
    "Not so. A pleasing balance is struck that gives us an insight into Dune\u2019s major players, and allows us to occasionally relate to each character.",
    "We see, for example, how Paul is weighed down by the expectation of leading House Atreides one day, while we're given the opportunity to take stock of how flawed these characters are as individuals and a collective. Witnessing how various characters including Gurney (Josh Brolin), Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya) interact with Paul and each other, too, offers many humorous and tense moments throughout the film. There\u2019s an eclectic mix of actors in Dune and their talents are satisfyingly used to maximum effect.",
    "The same can be said of how Dune establishes Herbert\u2019s fictional universe. Villeneuve does a good job of immersing us in the movie\u2019s numerous locations, allowing Dune\u2019s sweeping vistas and scenic splendor to periodically take center stage and break up the narrative. It\u2019s a visually impressive film: you can certainly spot the cinematic similarities between Dune and Villeneuve\u2019s previous works, including Arrival and Blade Runner 2049.",
    "Even when Dune\u2019s plot starts to steer towards exposition territory, it has a novel way of supplying audiences with key information that doesn\u2019t disrupt its flow. Paul\u2019s holographic educational logs provide enough explanation about important subjects, such as Arrakis\u2019 history, without being overly complex or holding viewers\u2019 hands. It\u2019s used effectively throughout Dune\u2019s runtime, breaking down its lore into bite-sized chunks that are easier to digest.",
    "As far as its action goes, Dune provides breathtaking set-pieces and more intimate fight sequences in equal measure.",
    "The scope of its largest battle is a sight to behold and, honestly, it needs to be seen on the big screen. Yes, there are plenty of VFX elements that bring the drama to life, but Greig Fraser\u2019s cinematography also adds a layer of visceral realism to the extravaganza. It\u2019s a hard fought and at-times harrowing spectacle that plays out in multiple mini-acts, taking its cues from similarly gigantic set-pieces seen in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",
    "Eventually, Dune\u2019s major battle gives way to smaller-scale skirmishes, and it\u2019s here where some of the movie\u2019s biggest shocks and plot twists take place. There\u2019s certainly a Game of Thrones sensibility to these moments but they help to embellish, rather than hinder, the emotional story beats that play out on screen.",
    "The main problem that Dune has is that, after this key moment, its plot starts to meander towards a slightly dissatisfying and rather abrupt conclusion.",
    "After building momentum towards its climactic battle, Dune passes this crescendo moment and strangely begins to outstay its welcome. There are a couple of post-battle surprises in store, as well as a few necessary scenes that speak to the traumatic events that have just unfolded.",
    "But Dune\u2019s final 20 minutes feel like the beginnings of a potential second movie, rather than the perfect stopping point that this first part requires. Villeneuve always planned to tell Dune\u2019s story across two movies, so you can semi-accept this film\u2019s cliff-hanger finale. Still, the final part of its third act feels a tad unnecessary. If it had ended sooner, it might have made for a tighter or more cohesive epilogue.",
    "Dune\u2019s finale is its main issue, but there are a couple of other problems that are slightly grating.",
    "For one, it\u2019s sometimes difficult to hear what certain characters are saying. As in some of Christopher Nolan's recent films, specific lines of dialogue are hard to make out: that\u2019s problematic for a film that requires viewers\u2019 full attention to understand what\u2019s going on. Dune\u2019s sound editing is otherwise superb \u2013 Hans Zimmer\u2019s score is thunderously glorious \u2013 which makes scenes with indiscernible chatter all the more frustrating.",
    "Dune somewhat falls into the trap that other large ensemble movies have been a victim of, too. While it does a great job of introducing us to its sizable cast, there\u2019s not enough time for each to undergo significant character development. Or for them to resonate with audiences on an emotional level before things go awry.",
    "Sure, Chalamet\u2019s Paul, Ferguson\u2019s Rebecca and Jason Momoa\u2019s Duncan Idaho have a number of moments that leave a lump in the throat. It\u2019s unsurprising that this trio are the highlights of Dune\u2019s excellent cast, then. But, Isaac\u2019s Leto aside, nobody apart from this triumvirate gets any emotional payoff for their characters. That\u2019s a touch disappointing when they\u2019re supposed to be integral to Dune\u2019s overarching story.",
    "\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d Zendaya\u2019s Chani tells Chalamet\u2019s Paul in Dune\u2019s final moments.",
    "She\u2019s right, of course. Dune is only the first entry in Villeneuve\u2019s planned film duology, while an HBO Max spin-off called The Sisterhood is also in the works.",
    "Dune isn\u2019t without its faults but, by and large, Warner Bros does have a potential hit on its hands. It\u2019s an atmospheric, brooding and expansive cinematic marvel that, while its source material predates them, has shades of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Mad Max and even Gladiator in its execution. It\u2019s also a thematically dense movie that explores familial legacy, politicking, the longevity of empires and environmentalism.",
    "It\u2019s an accomplishment, too, that Villeneuve is able to present Hebert\u2019s intricately detailed work in a way that makes it accessible to a wider audience. Dune doesn\u2019t forgo the ambitious nature of its source material to appeal to general cinemagoers: it commits to Herbert\u2019s convoluted novel while mostly making it easy to understand. Compare that to David Lynch\u2019s famously divisive attempt in 1984, and that\u2019s no mean feat.",
    "Dune aspires to do justice to its source material, and it does so with aplomb. If Dune Part 2 is similarly faithful, providing it\u2019s greenlit by Warner Bros off the back of its risky hybrid streaming release, there\u2019s every chance that Villeneuve\u2019s adaptation, like Herbert\u2019s book, can become the director\u2019s seminal work of art. Unless that second movie gets the go-ahead, though, Dune feels a tad incomplete.",
    "Dune arrives in UK cinemas on Thursday, October 21. It lands in theaters and on HBO Max (with an ad-free plan) in the US on Friday, October 22."
