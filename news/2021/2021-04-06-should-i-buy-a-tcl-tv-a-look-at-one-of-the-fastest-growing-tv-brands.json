  "article": [
    "Should you buy a TCL TV in 2021? If you're shopping for your next television, and you're trying to choose between the various budget TV brands out there, you may well have come across the TCL name \u2013 but knowing what to make of it is another matter entirely.",
    "That's why we've brought together everything you need to know about the established Chinese electronics brand, including the most recent models we've tested, new and upcoming models and what you can expect to pay for them.",
    "Usually, we'd expect a brand to unveil all its plans for the coming year at CES 2021 (the biggest tech expo of the year). However, TCL runs on a slightly different release schedule than many TV brands, which can mean CES was a bit light on concrete information.",
    "You can find out what's new for TCL in our TCL TV 2021 guide, where we run through the new QLED and 8K TV models we saw last year and the ones that are expected over the next twelve months, as well as what upgrades older favorites like the 5-Series and 6-Series are getting to stay up-to-date and competitive with more recent models. (Hint: it's a lot of QLED and Mini LED.)",
    "While TCL's biggest audience is unsurprisingly in its homeland of China, it now ships televisions all over the world, with a strong presence in the US, Europe, Australia, and SE Asia.",
    "It's recently started rolling out the new 6-Series R635 models in the US alongside new 5-Series TVs that, for the first time ever, use QLED technology.",
    "After a hesitant launch in the UK in 2018, too, TCL is expanding its UK range with two new QLEDs (the C71 and C81) and the promise of 8K TVs to come too \u2013 which could well make more of an impact than the low-end DP648 and EP658 models we've seen so far.",
    "TCL recently confirmed its range of Roku TVs were coming to Europe and South America, and most likely the UK too. More details on this will likely come at IFA 2020",
    "So how do TCL\u2019s TVs differ from the competition, and are they worth your money? Read on for everything you need below.",
    "TCL\u2019s main advantage in the TV market is its aggressive pricing. It manufactures televisions at a large scale and has passed on a lot of those savings to consumers in a bid to win over a worldwide audience. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap television that offers a lot for the price, TCL will often be a good bet \u2013 often for very large-sized televisions too.",
    "If the thought of forking out for one of the best 55-inch TVs or best 65-inch TVs has got you sweating, know that TCL won\u2019t charge you through the nose for it \u2013 and the TV-maker offers everything from compact 32-inch TVs to massive 75-inch TVs.",
    "There is always a cost vs performance question to consider, as cheaper televisions almost inevitably mean a drop in quality from their more premium counterparts.",
    "Picture processing is often the first thing to suffer, with basic processors unable to really cope with the demands of high-resolution television. TCL\u2019s televisions tend to go quite heavy on picture processing, which some would say provides a dynamic picture, but can lead to off-color pictures and middling contrast.",
    "4K resolution is increasingly the norm for smart TVs these days, which is great for those wanting to watch TV and films in crisp Ultra HD detail. You\u2019ll often get high dynamic range (HDR) bundled in too, though a TV under $500 / \u00a3500 / AU$700 won\u2019t usually have the specs to really draw out HDR\u2019s expanded color gamut \u2013 so be aware that a cheap 4K HDR set from TCL won\u2019t provide the same picture as a higher-end television.",
    "TCL has used a number of operating systems for its TVs over the years, so it\u2019s worth making sure you\u2019re getting a decent smart TV platform with your television. Many of its mid-range US sets use the Roku TV smart platform, and makes for a breezy, thought-out interface with plenty of your favorite streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.",
    "Other TCL sets, like the DP648 in the UK, use a much more basic Linux OS. Most new TCL TVs, though, come with the same Android OS \u2013 in an attempt to standardise across the board \u2013 which is a good all-rounder smart platform also used by Sony and Hisense.",
    "TCL has some more experimental TV designs now and then, largely closer to its home market in China.",
    "At CES 2020, TCL announced plans for a new fleet of Mini-LED TVs \u2013 to compete with OLED models \u2013 which use smaller LEDs for more precise brightness control than traditional LCD screens.",
    "Those TVs just started rolling out in the US in the form of the new 6-Series R635 models and launch alongside new 5-Series TVs that, for the first time ever, use QLED technology. Read our TCL 6 Series QLED review to find out more.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that TCL doesn\u2019t support HDR10+, sticking instead to the leading Dolby Vision format for its fancier TVs, though this will only really make a difference if you plan on watching a lot of premium HDR formats.",
    "Overall, your choice of a TCL TV may come down to where you live. In the US there are plenty of TVs we\u2019ve reviewed well, and TCL has built up an understanding of the market and what US viewers want from their televisions.",
    "In the UK you have fewer options, which aren\u2019t quite as competitively priced. If you do opt for a TCL television, though, you can be sure you\u2019re getting a good value TV.",
    "So that's the background on TCL, but what did we actually think of the televisions we tested out?",
    "We've reviewed TCL televisions at a range of prices, sizes, and specifications \u2013 and you check out the most important ones below."
