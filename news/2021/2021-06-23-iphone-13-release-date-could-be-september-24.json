    "The iPhone 13 was always likely to land in stores in September, as that\u2019s when Apple typically releases its new phones (although last year's iPhone 12 launch and release were pushed back to October by the pandemic). And we now have a prediction for the actual on-sale date, with September 24 possibly being the day you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on the 2021 iPhones.",
    "We\u2019ve arrived at that date based on a claim from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who \u2013 according to Barron\u2019s \u2013 has said that the iPhone 13 range is likely to be announced in the third week of September.",
    "Ives didn\u2019t provide an exact date, but Apple usually holds its launch events on a Tuesday, which would mean an announcement on September 14 \u2013 although occasionally it's a Wednesday, so it could be September 15.",
    "Either way, based on Apple\u2019s usual schedule we\u2019d then expect preorders to open on the Friday \u2013 September 17 \u2013 and then for the release date to be one week later, which gets us to September 24.",
    "While it\u2019s not clear where Ives got this information from, he\u2019s a respected analyst and likely has sources in the supply chain, so it could well be accurate.",
    "These dates make sense too, as Apple usually unveils its new iPhone ranges on either the first or second Tuesday (or occasionally Wednesday) in September, so we\u2019d already narrowed the likely dates down to a few possibilities, and these are among them.",
    "Ives also reiterated previous claims he\u2019s made about the iPhone 13 range, including that there will apparently be a 1TB storage option, and that all four models will get a LiDAR scanner. Notably, another source recently disputed both of these things, so it remains to be seen who\u2019s right here.",
    "The dates above though very likely are right, unless Covid-19 disrupts proceedings again. But reports so far suggest that the iPhone 13 range is on schedule, so September \u2013 and probably September 14 or 15 \u2013 is looking likely for the announcement.",
