  "article": [
    "The Crown season 5, like previous seasons, will adapts real-world events through the prism of prestige drama \u2013 but it doesn't have a release date yet. Filming is happening right now, with Netflix now having released our first look at Charles and Diana in the show, played by Dominic West and Elizabeth Debicki.",
    "The Crown seasons 1-4 has covered years and years of history at a time, and proved to be an education for those who aren't familiar with the ups and downs of the Royal Family.",
    "Season 4 took us up to 1990, while season 5 will take us deeper into the decade. The Crown season 5 will give viewers another cast shake-up as we leap through time once more for the show's final couple of seasons, and Netflix has finally started talking about who's being added for this next run. The show's most recent development is West's casting, which we'll discuss below.",
    "Spoilers follow, as we go in-depth with everything we know about The Crown season 5 so far.",
    "Release date: The Crown season 5 is filming now, and has a release date window of November 2022.",
    "Story: With The Crown season 4 ending in Christmas 1990, expect this next season to explore the end of Charles and Diana's marriage, John Major's time as Prime Minister, and the Queen's annus horribilis in 1992.",
    "Cast: Imelda Staunton will take on the role of Queen Elizabeth II, with Jonathan Pryce playing Prince Philip, Elizabeth Debicki cast as Princess Diana, Lesley Manville taking on the role of Princess Margaret and Jonny Lee Miller playing John Major. In August 2021, Dominic West was added to the cast as Prince Charles, after a long period of rumors.",
    "The future: The Crown has already been renewed for a sixth and final season, which is apparently set to cover up until the early 2000s.",
    "The Crown season 5 will release in November 2022, Netflix revealed during its Tudum event in September 2021.",
    "There will be a longer wait than usual for season 5 of The Crown. Deadline reported back in July 2020 that filming wouldn\u2019t start until June 2021, with the series set to hit Netflix in 2022. The break in production is actually not down to the ongoing pandemic \u2013 the show had planned to take a gap year long before COVID presented the world of TV and film with numerous challenges.",
    "The same report says season 6 is set to film in 2022, so the gap between the next two seasons should be slightly shorter.",
    "Filming is ongoing.",
    "The fifth season of The Crown will undergo another sizeable cast shake-up, as our ageing royal family enters the 1990s \u2013 The Crown season 4 ended in late 1990, as we'll discuss further down.",
    "We\u2019ll be waving farewell to Olivia Colman and welcoming Imelda Staunton to take on the role of Queen Elizabeth II. You may recognize Staunton from her role as the abominable Professor Umbridge in Harry Potter. Similarly, Tobias Menzies will be stepping aside to allow fellow Game of Thrones co-star Jonathan Pryce to take over as Prince Philip.",
    "Additionally, we\u2019ll see Phantom Thread\u2019s Lesley Manville assume the role of Princess Margaret, and Elizabeth Debicki, who you may know from Christopher Nolan's Tenet, will play the slightly older version of Princess Diana. After a 2020 report suggested Dominic West was joining the cast as Prince Charles, Netflix finally confirmed he was part of the show in August 2021.",
    "While the main cast changes have been confirmed, we are yet to find out who will fill the shoes of some of the key supporting cast. The roles of the Queen\u2019s children, Anne, Edward and Andrew, are still unconfirmed, as are Camilla Parker Bowles and the Queen Mother.",
    "Season 4 also ended with the resignation of Thatcher, which means we\u2019ll see a new Prime Minister enter the fray. Season 5 will follow the tenure of John Major, and we\u2019ll likely also get a short burst of Tony Blair, who was in office during Diana\u2019s death.",
    "In June 2021, Netflix finally added another cast member to the list: Jonny Lee Miller as John Major. That likely means we're not too far off learning who the rest of the cast is going to be, especially if filming is happening now.",
    "The Crown season 4 picked up in 1977, but the first episode honed in on 1979 with the election of Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson). It also showcased the murder of Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance), claimed by the IRA, which served as the show's entry point into focusing on the ongoing Troubles in Northern Ireland. We also started to see the show come into what might be termed recent history, with focuses on working class struggles, the dissolution of Apartheid, and Diana\u2019s influence on the public.",
    "The Queen (Olivia Colman) also took an early shining to Princess Diana (Emma Corrin) as Charles\u2019 (Josh O'Connor) perfect, prospective bride. After passing \u2018The Balmoral Test\u2019 with flying colors, the royal family pressured Charles into marrying Diana.",
    "The Queen\u2019s relationship with Thatcher also began on kind grounds, but slowly neutralized over the course of the season as ol\u2019 Maggie\u2019s rule got more and more ruthless. The pair\u2019s personal relationship soured, but ends in a dignified fashion with mutual respect shown for the traits they have in common.",
    "Season 4 also did a fantastic job of making each and every cast member pretty unlikeable. The substantial age gap between Charles and Diana makes for a turbulent dynamic \u2013 Charles\u2019 petulant reactions to Diana\u2019s personal struggles paired with his unwillingness to let go of Camilla (Emerald Fennell) makes him hard to watch in season 4.",
    "Throughout the season, the Queen observed Thatcher\u2019s weakness when it came to her children, particularly her son Mark who she cited as her favorite. Upon learning this, The Queen sets off on a personal journey to reconnect with her own children, and discovers that they all carry their own indiscretions, emotional baggage and personal struggles.",
    "The Crown season 4 wrapped up in 1990 with the resignation of an unpopular Thatcher and a particularly frosty Christmas at Balmoral Castle. During the festivities, both The Queen and Prince Philip tire of Charles and Diana\u2019s marriage complaints. While the Queen simply and coldly urged Charles to focus on his royal duty, Philip turned a darker corner, with a quiet warning of the consequences Diana will face if her marriage fails.",
    "Hey, maybe that's why some critics want to see a pre-show disclaimer reminding people that The Crown is a fictional drama, and not a documentary (something Netflix has confirmed it has no plans to do).",
    "With Thatcher gone and Charles and Diana\u2019s unhappy union in full swing, we\u2019ll be sailing full speed ahead into the 1990s. It has also been confirmed that there will be a sixth and final season of The Crown, set to conclude in the early 2000s. Showrunner Peter Morgan has said that \"season six will not bring us any closer to present day \u2013 it will simply enable us to cover the same period in greater detail.\"",
    "The season doesn\u2019t have an official plotline yet, but we can take a swing at what might happen in season 5 based on real-life royal events, with an additional season taken into account.",
    "1992 was a particularly rough year for the Windsor clan. It saw the breakdown of not one, but two royal marriages \u2013 Prince Andrew\u2019s separation from Sarah Ferguson, and Princess Anne\u2019s official divorce from long-term husband Captain Mark Phillips. Prince Andrew\u2019s wedding featured briefly in The Crown season 4, and we get a glimpse into Anne\u2019s spousal struggles too, which suggests they may have a more pivotal role in season 5.",
    "Of course, we\u2019re in for a further ride with Charles and Diana\u2019s relationship, and that was not shy on scandal. In June 1992, author Andrew Morton released \u2018Diana: Her True Story\u2019, a bestselling autobiographical book that detailed Diana\u2019s struggles and the turbulence of her marriage, with her own personal input. The book was published while she was still married to Charles. As you can imagine, it didn\u2019t go down too well with the rest of the family, so we suspect it might crop up in the next season.",
    "And to top off that year, we may see a fiery, fictionalized spectacle based on the 1992 Windsor Castle fire. The real fire burned for around 15 hours and caused six minor injuries to staff \u2013 and a great big castle fire is a good old excuse for some top-notch TV drama, isn\u2019t it?",
    "All in all, the Queen dubbed 1992 her \"annus horribilis\" in a famous speech. That's bound to be great material for the writers of Netflix's hit series.",
    "We\u2019ve also got scope for a number of scandals inside the British Government in the 1990s. Notably, we have John Major\u2019s 1993 \u2018Back To Basics\u2019 campaign, designed to promote traditional familial values, but ultimately fell into ruin following a number of scandals inside the Conservative Party.",
    "The Arms to Iraq affair that coursed through the 1990s may also make for juicy plot developments in The Crown, as government-approved sales of weapons to Iraq made John Major quite unpopular in the run up to Tony Blair\u2019s winning election in 1997.",
    "Finally, the core of The Crown season 5 will undoubtedly be the breakdown of Charles and Diana\u2019s marriage, until their divorce in 1996, and Diana\u2019s tragic death in 1997. We all know that there\u2019ll be ample room for tension and drama there, and lots of us remember the impact that Diana\u2019s death left on the world.",
    "What remains to be seen is how true to real life The Crown will remain, and how much justice it serves Diana in her final moments. With season 6 on the cards, it is also unclear as to whether season 5 will even get to Diana\u2019s death. It may serve as a dramatic season finale, or simply be left for the final series.",
    "Still, we won\u2019t be seeing any of that until 2022 at the earliest. In the meantime, maybe it's worth binging a few documentaries about the royal family and reminding yourself about what truly happened."
