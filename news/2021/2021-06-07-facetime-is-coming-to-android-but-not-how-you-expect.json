    "FaceTime is one of the main things that might leave Android users looking jealously at iPhone owners, but with iOS 15 they won\u2019t have to be quite as jealous anymore.",
    "As part of its WWDC 2021 keynote, Apple has announced that FaceTime users will soon be able to send a link for people to join a call from, and these links aren\u2019t exclusive to Apple devices \u2013 Android and Windows users can join via them too.",
    "FaceTime calls will still be end-to-end encrypted, even for people not on iOS devices, so it sounds like Android users will be able to get pretty close to the full FaceTime experience once they\u2019re on a call.",
    "That said, there still won\u2019t be a dedicated FaceTime app on Android sadly. While we\u2019d love for Apple to add that so Android users could fully use FaceTime, it\u2019s understandable that the company hasn\u2019t, and this is still a big step.",
    "This won\u2019t just benefit Android users but also Apple ones, who will be able to keep using FaceTime while chatting to their Android friends. And maybe some of those friends will even be tempted to buy an Apple device when they\u2019ve experienced FaceTime, so this seems like a smart move from Apple.",
    "We\u2019re still hoping for a full FaceTime app on Android one day, and this news makes that look slightly more likely than it once did \u2013 but we still doubt it will happen.",
    "WWDC is in full swing at the time of writing, with more announcements still to come, so head over to our WWDC 2021 live blog for all the news as it emerges."
