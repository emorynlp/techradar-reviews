  "article": [
    "The launch of the 5.9-inch Asus Zenfone 8 will be a litmus test for whether or not phone buyers care about small, powerful phones \u2013 or whether Asus will regret withholding a plus-sized Zenfone 8 Pro.",
    "Many of the best small phones, like the Google Pixel 4a and iPhone SE, offer mid-range specs to go with low prices for bargain shoppers. Anecdotally, some critics and consumers like these devices, but it\u2019s not clear whether people buy these phones because they\u2019re easier for one-handed browsing, they fit smaller hands, or simply because they\u2019re more affordable.",
    "Obviously, that\u2019s a matter of preference. Different people will see their phone as a simple browsing and texting hub, a gaming powerhouse, a streaming display, or something else that requires more or less screen space. And folks with cartoonishly large or dainty hands will have different definitions of \u2018one-handed\u2019 phones.",
    "But I suspect that most people choose cheap, one-handed phones for the price, and because large cheap phones can have underwhelming displays. Meanwhile, many buyers choose larger, expensive phones in part because Apple, Samsung and the rest reserve their best cameras and displays for the \u2018Max\u2019 or \u2018Ultra\u2019 handsets \u2013 not necessarily because of the mini-tablet size.",
    "That\u2019s what makes the Zenfone 8 \u2013 with its powerful specs in a condensed, boring frame \u2013 such a rare bird. It doesn\u2019t have a Pro or XL model, except for the novelty Zenfone 8 Flip that retains the flipping cameras but doesn\u2019t upgrade much on last year\u2019s model. We liked the Zenfone 7 Pro, but Asus evidently decided to push people towards its flagship and let more affluent buyers go for the 6.8-inch ROG Phone 5 instead.",
    "Will a mid-range, one-handed phone stand out in a crowded smartphone market? Our reviewer was generally impressed by its quality, but by omitting last year\u2019s flipping camera, Asus left the Zenfone 8 without many standout qualities besides its compact frame. And other similar phones arguably haven\u2019t performed well in recent years.",
    "One of Apple\u2019s best-selling phones in recent years is the budget iPhone SE, of which Apple allegedly sold about 24 million units in 2020. It successfully cut into the cheap phone market that had previously been dominated by Android phones, the Samsung A series in particular.",
    "Compared to that, the iPhone 12 mini \u2013 Techradar\u2019s favorite small phone \u2013 reportedly accounted for just 5 percent of Apple smartphone sales in January 2021, according to Reuters. Apple had reportedly slashed its 12 mini production targets by \u2018more than 70 percent\u2019, Nikkei Asia reported in March.",
    "In our iPhone 12 mini vs iPhone SE breakdown, we ruled strongly in favor of the mini for its display quality, performance, camera capabilities, 5G speeds and durability, though its lower battery capacity can be an issue. But more people are consistently buying the 4.7-inch SE than the more expensive 5.4-inch 12 mini.",
    "Both are much smaller than the 5.9-inch Zenfone 8, but the 6-inch Google Pixel 5 and 5.8-inch Pixel 4a offer an even more appropriate case study. The Pixel 5 is a mid-range, one-handed flagship with a middling chipset and good point-and-shoot cameras; the Pixel 4a has a cheaper build, worse chipset, less RAM, disappointing battery life and other compromises to make it half the price as the Pixel 5.",
    "We don\u2019t have hard Pixel sales figures, but we do know that the downgraded Pixel 4a quickly sold out at launch; we also learned from Nikkei Asia that Google\u2019s internal estimates suggested it would sell just 800,000 Pixel 5 phones, compared to about 2 million Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G units.",
    "Plus, back in 2019, Google was apparently very disappointed by its Pixel 4 sales numbers \u2013 around 2 million in its first six months \u2013 while it sold upwards of 7 million Pixel 3a units, per Android Authority. Again, the bargain phone triumphed while the mid-range, 5.7-inch flagship flopped by comparison.",
    "Overall, flagship phone displays these days tend to be at least 6.1 inches (iPhone 12) or 6.2 inches (Galaxy S21), with Pro, Plus or Max displays trending about a quarter- or half-inch larger. Aside from the iPhone 12 mini, most manufacturers aren\u2019t making compact flagships, only downgraded models with different names.",
    "Sony used to reliably release a Compact version of its best Xperia every year, but stopped with the Xperia XZ2 Compact in 2018, while the rumored 2021 Sony Xperia Compact turned out to not be real.",
    "Generally speaking, phone industry data provider Counterpoint found that small phone sales numbers have consistently dropped over the past couple of years (via Reuters). Phones under 6 inches represented 50 percent of sales at the end of 2018. By December 2020, that number was just 10 percent.",
    "That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people don\u2019t like small phones! We know that recent chip shortages have limited how many phones that companies can manufacture; in fact, Google will supposedly limit the number of Pixel 5a phones it sells in order to save more chips for the Pixel 6. It could just be that companies are prioritizing massive phones that turn a greater profit until more chips become available again.",
    "That\u2019s why I respect Asus\u2019 plan to sell just one reasonably-sized flagship (the novelty Flip aside), instead of cannibalizing its sales figures with a cheaper downgrade or a larger Pro version. It will be a useful test to see if small phones still have a place in the $500+ smartphone market.",
    "Personally, I have a variety of phones for work and personal use, from a 5.6-inch Pixel to a 6.5-inch OnePlus. As an avid gamer, I generally prefer laying down with a larger screen so I\u2019m not straining my eyes. At the same time, I\u2019m currently reckoning with my steadily worsening carpal tunnel syndrome, and find myself preferring to hold a narrow phone that doesn\u2019t strain my hand and wrist for daily use.",
    "The Zenfone 8 hits that sweet spot for buyers who want a new, affordable phone with great specs in an easy-to-hold package, without any FOMO for a Pro version that\u2019s too big and expensive but gives you better performance.",
    "I\u2019m just curious how many other folks besides myself find that particular blend of qualities appealing enough to buy it \u2013 and in numbers that convince phonemakers to keep trying out new small-format devices."
