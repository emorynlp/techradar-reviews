    "Two years in the making, Wimbledon 2021 has had it all - from giant killings and five-set marathons, to the number 1 seeds dominating and maybe (but hopefully not) the last time we see Roger, Andy and Serena grace the grass. And yet, there's still so much to see as we head into the semi-finals. Discover how to watch a Wimbledon live stream no matter where in the world you are - including ways to see it absolutely FREE.",
    "With Naomi Osaka missing out and Serena Williams proving an early victim to the slippery lawn, predicting the women's championship was always going to be tricky. But World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty is now finding her rhythm but has the rejuvenated Angelique Kerber - the only remaining former champ - on her side of the draw. Second seed Aryna Sabalenka is looking intimidating, too, with one of women's tennis's nearly-women - Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 - standing in her way next.",
    "The awesome Novak Djokovic is seeking a threepeat and looking as unstoppable as ever. Young guns Denis Shapovalov and Queen's winner Matteo Berrettini are hoping to thwart the Serb. Then, of course, there's the vanquisher of the GOAT... can Hubert Hurkacz's fairy-tale continue to go all the way to Sunday's final?",
    "It all amounts to an unmissable second week at SW19. Here's how you can live stream Wimbledon 2021 tennis action from wherever you are in the world.",

    "If you're abroad during Wimbledon, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred Wimbledon live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",

    "The annual tournament takes place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) in south west London. The venue has held the Wimbledon Tennis Championships \u2013 the sport\u2019s oldest tournament \u2013 since its inception in 1877.",
    "Since 2007 there\u2019s been parity in what the winners of the Ladies' Singles and the winner of the Men's Singles each receive.",

    "The Wimbledon Championships are played under Grand Slam tournament rules.",
    "This means that the Men's Singles competition uses the best of five sets format, where the player who can clinch three sets first wins the game. For the Women\u2019s Singles it\u2019s a best-of-three format, whereby winning two sets ensures victory.",
    "The Men\u2019s Doubles, Women\u2019s Doubles and Mixed Doubles also use the best-of-three format at Wimbledon.",

    "The Women's Singles is more open, with Simona Halep facing competition from a wide pool of contenders, including world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, superstars in the making Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff, French Open winner Barbora Krejcikova, and of course Serena Williams.",
    "Wimbledon usually attracts an attendance of around half a million people, but a degree of capacity control will be enforced this year, with at least the early parts of the tournament set to be played in front of a reduced crowd.",
    "The process for buying tickets has also changed to meet Covid safety precautions, with purchases only open to fans based in the UK who register with myWimbledon, and tickets limited to a maximum of two people, and only one day of the event.",
    "Attendees are also required to show proof of Covid status upon entry."
