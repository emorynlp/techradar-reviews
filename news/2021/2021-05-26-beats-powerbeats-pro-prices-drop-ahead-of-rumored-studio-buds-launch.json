    "The Beats Powerbeats Pro are among the best wireless earbuds in the world \u2013 and right now, they're subject to some incredible discounts in the US and the UK.",
    "If you're in the US, you can get these workout-friendly wireless earbuds for just $159.99 at Best Buy, a price cut of $90 compared to their original $249.99 RRP.",
    "Meanwhile, UK readers can get their hands on the Powerbeats Pro for \u00a3139 at John Lewis, saving you \u00a380 on the Beats earbuds. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for the best Powerbeats Pro prices in your region.)",
    "Bear in mind, that both of these deals only apply to select color variants, so make sure you double check the price before you head to checkout.",
    "The Beats Powerbeats Pro deliver a powerful, balanced sound with dynamic range and noise isolation. Built for athletes, the true wireless earbuds are sweat and water-resistant and feature adjustable, secure-fit earhooks for lightweight, all-day comfort.",
    "They provide an impressive nine hours of battery life, and each earbud has full volume and track controls, so you don't need your device to adjust your music. While a new model may be on the cards \u2013 the so-called Beats Studio Buds \u2013 the original true wireless Beats headphones are still well worth buying, particularly at this price.",
    "Saying that, if you need your buds to come with noise cancellation, be sure to check out models like the AirPods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3; pricier than the Beats, these buds are capable of blocking out annoying environmental sound, letting you listen to your music in peace.",
    "It's also worth bearing in mind that Prime Day deals will start rolling in soon, with the sales event expected to land in June. It's possible that the Powerbeats Pro will be discounted even further, though we'd still recommend snapping them up at this price if you've had your eye on them for a while.",
    "The Beats Studio Buds are rumored to be the next wireless earbuds from the Apple-owned brand \u2013 and they might launch soon, with a substantial leak giving us our first look at the new earbuds.",
    "Information on the Studio Buds was discovered in Apple\u2019s latest beta software for tvOS and iOS, revealing that the new earbuds will likely come with active noise cancellation.",
    "Spotted by MacRumors and 9to5Mac, the software even revealed images and animations of the yet-to-be-announced earbuds, and it looks like the devices will be available in red, white and black.",
    "While Apple hasn\u2019t yet confirmed the existence of the Beats Studio Buds \u2013 or even if that will be their official name \u2013 the recent leak was substantial enough to suggest that the earbuds will launch soon, perhaps even in June.",
    "And, with Powerbeats Pro prices dropping, a June release date is looking even more feasible.",
