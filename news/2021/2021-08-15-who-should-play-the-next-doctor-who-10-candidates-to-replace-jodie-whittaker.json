    "In the UK \u2013 a country where everyone can recognize a Dalek \u2013 the question of who should play the next Doctor Who is guaranteed to be a hot topic of conversation. And since current star Jodie Whittaker and showrunner Chris Chibnall announced they\u2019ll be leaving the show next year, the debate about the identity of her replacement has moved up a notch.",
    "The decision is undoubtedly going to cause Who\u2019s new showrunner \u2013 Happy Valley creator Sally Wainwright is rumored to be the frontrunner for the gig \u2013 some major headaches. The Doctor is a lead role like no other, an alien hero who doesn\u2019t use guns, for whom quirkiness is as integral to their DNA as a second heart.",
    "And now that Whittaker has played the show\u2019s first female Doctor, there\u2019s another complex element to the casting. Indeed, bringing in another white man \u2013 as the Doctor was for their first 12 (13 if you include John Hurt\u2019s War Doctor) incarnations \u2013 could feel like a retrograde step for a show that\u2019s made a concerted effort to embrace diversity.",
    "Established Hollywood stars like Benedict Cumberbatch, Olivia Colman and Idris Elba are almost definitely out of the BBC\u2019s reach. And other names \u2013 such as Death in Paradise\u2019s Kris Marshall and James Bond\u2019s Ben Whishaw \u2013 routinely come up whenever there\u2019s a vacancy in the TARDIS.",
    "In the list below, we\u2019ve pulled together 10 actors who could play the next Doctor Who. Some are more likely than others, but bear in mind that it\u2019s just as likely the casting will take us all by surprise. After all, few had heard of Matt Smith before he got the keys to the TARDIS in 2010.",
    "While the Years & Years singer is currently the bookmakers\u2019 favorite to play the next Doctor Who, his manager, Martha Kinn, has denied the rumors, telling Instagram that, \u201cEven though Olly is often contacted by Cybermen, I\u2019m afraid I have to exterminate this speculation.\u201d Alexander does have experience acting alongside Daleks in Channel 4/HBO Max drama It\u2019s a Sin, but this is one to file under unlikely \u2013 especially as the rumor seems to have started when former Who showrunner Russell T Davies told SFX magazine: \u201cOlly would make a marvellous Doctor Who\u201d.",
    "From his signature sitcom role as Moss in The IT Crowd, to his hosting gig on UK game show The Crystal Maze, there\u2019s always been something slightly otherworldly about Ayoade. His unconventional line delivery and gift for physical comedy seem to be the only reason he\u2019s perpetually linked to the role, however, seeing as nothing on his resum\u00e9 \u2013 he\u2019s more likely to be heard voicing characters in Soul or The Mandalorian than appearing on screen \u2013 suggests he\u2019d be up for headlining such a high-profile show.",
    "Doctor Who has probably missed the opportunity to sign up one of British TV\u2019s most sought-after talents, now that her I May Destroy You has put her on the Hollywood map. Coel has a major role in upcoming Black Panther sequel Wakanda Forever, and as with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fact that she\u2019s a talented writer shepherding her own projects to the screen, may make her reluctant to commit so much time to someone else\u2019s show.",
    "The British actor will soon have some extra time on his hands with Supergirl coming to an end, and after stints on Homeland and Selfie, he has plenty of experience of living on the treadmill of a long-running TV show. The fact that he\u2019s already guest starred on the show shouldn\u2019t count against him, either \u2013 Twelfth Doctor Peter Capaldi, and former companions Freema Agyeman and Karen Gillan, all played other roles before becoming series regulars. But, like Kris Marshall and Ben Whishaw, Harewood seems to be one of those names who are perennially linked to the role, yet never make it past rumor territory.",
    "Another popular choice with the bookmakers, MacDonald arguably has the right level of stardom to be a good fit for the role. While she\u2019s never been on Hollywood\u2019s A-list, the Trainspotting star has worked on high-profile projects like Boardwalk Empire, No Country for Old Men and Brave, while her recent turn on the final (?) season of hit BBC crime drama Line of Duty can\u2019t have harmed her chances. Also, the Doctor has been Scottish before\u2026",
    "Martin has one huge advantage over her rivals, seeing as she\u2019s already played the Doctor on screen. Thanks to the new \u2018Timeless Child\u2019 storyline, it\u2019s been revealed that the Doctor had numerous previous regenerations we didn\u2019t know about \u2013 of which Martin\u2019s Doctor was one. We think she\u2019s a long-shot for the lead role, however, not least because it would make it rather more difficult for Doctors from different timelines to cross paths in future seasons.",
    "Considered a leading candidate to play the next Doctor Who before Jodie Whittaker got the gig, Maxine Peake continues to be one of the favorites with the bookmakers. One of British TV\u2019s most versatile stars \u2013 she\u2019s moved between comedy and drama, including Black Mirror episode \u2018Metalhead' \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019s got all the necessary qualifications for the role. The bigger question is whether she\u2019d be comfortable moving from \u201cI know you from somewhere\u2026\u201d status to genuine superstardom.",
    "The Welsh actor has just topped a RadioTimes.com poll as the fans\u2019 choice to be the next Doctor Who, and it\u2019s easy to see why. From Twilight to Masters of Sex, Frost/Nixon to Tron: Legacy, he\u2019s shown himself to be a brilliant, versatile actor who\u2019d undoubtedly put his own spin on British TV\u2019s most iconic role. But is he too in-demand elsewhere \u2013 he\u2019s attached to the second season of Amazon Prime\u2019s Good Omens \u2013 to take on such a big commitment? If he has any questions, he could always check in with his Good Omens/Staged co-star, Tenth Doctor David Tennant.",
    "This one\u2019s slightly out of left-field, perhaps, seeing as the Doctor has never regenerated into a previous incarnation. Nonetheless, Who canon has an impressive history of reinventing itself to fit circumstances, and if the BBC wants to make Doctor Who hot again, they could do worse than reinstating the most popular Doctor since the show\u2019s 2005 comeback. Tennant did return for 50th anniversary special \u2018The Day of the Doctor\u2019, but we suspect he\u2019d be reluctant to risk retreading old ground.",
    "Like her Fleabag co-star Andrew Scott, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has the sort of screen presence and unquantifiable energy that memorable Doctors are made of. Unfortunately, reality may get in the way of this particular dream piece of casting. An in-demand writer on Fleabag, Killing Eve and No Time to Die, Waller-Bridge signed a multi-million-dollar development deal with Amazon in 2019 \u2013 the chances of her sacrificing that to run around space and time in the TARDIS seem slim.",
    "Doctor Who returns to BBC America and BBC One later this year."
