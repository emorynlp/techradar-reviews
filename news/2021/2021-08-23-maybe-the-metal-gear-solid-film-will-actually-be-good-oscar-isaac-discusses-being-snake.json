    "They\u2019re getting better, but we\u2019re still yet to have a truly great video game movie adaptation. Could the upcoming Metal Gear Solid film, starring Oscar Isaac and directed by Kong: Skull Island\u2019s Jordan Vogt-Roberts turn the tide?",
    "We\u2019re quietly hopeful \u2013 speaking in a new interview about his starring role as Solid Snake, Isaac is certainly saying all the right things to get us excited.",
    "\"I just loved the game,\" Isaac told Total Film when asked what brought him to the project.",
    "\"I love the feeling that the game would give me every time I\u2019d play. It\u2019s just a strangely isolated, mournful, lonely game to play that has these incredible moments of violence and terror, with these weird, psychedelic concepts and villains. But, yes, it\u2019s kind of like psychedelic military horror things that happen.",
    "\"And the truth is, underneath the whole thing, it\u2019s an anti-war story. So I think those are the elements I really love. And, like I said, I love the feel of playing it, and the big question of: can something like that be transferred \u2013 or can you explore those themes in a really interesting way \u2013 on film?\"",
    "It\u2019s been a busy few years for video game movie adaptations, from the light hearted Detective Pikachu to the gory Mortal Kombat, and now looking forward to Tom Holland\u2019s Uncharted movie and an upcoming The Last of Us TV show. Film adaptations like Detective Pikachu, Sonic the Hedgehog and Mortal Kombat punched above their weight and delivered movies that, whilst not all out classics, hit the right beats to keep fans smiling.",
    "So what\u2019s changed since the god awful 90s adaptations, such as Super Mario and Street Fighter, on the silver screen? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a three-fold change.",
    "Firstly, we\u2019ve got a wave of younger directors who grew up with the games and have a reverence for the source material that they\u2019re working on. In the case of the Metal Gear film, Vogt-Roberts is just 36 years old, and was a fan of the Metal Gear games growing up. He doesn\u2019t need to be sold on what makes the series special \u2013 he was there alongside every other PlayStation gamer the first time around.",
    "Secondly, in the case of games like Metal Gear Solid, they themselves were directly inspired by films, and (compared 8-bit and 16-bit franchises) were built on technologies that allowed for cinematic presentations. Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima has always been a cinephile, and Metal Gear Solid\u2019s fixed-perspectives allowed him to ape the drama that movie-style camera angles bring. It\u2019s something that Vogt-Roberts can lift wholesale if he likes.",
    "Finally, there\u2019s been a shift in power between the Hollywood studios and the games companies whose properties are being developed. According to Mordor Intelligence\u2019s industry reports, the global gaming industry is expected to be worth $314.40 BILLION by 2026.",
    "By comparison, 2020 saw a decline in global revenue for the film industry down to $80.8 billion \u2013 admittedly a knock on effect of the pandemic, but regardless exists as part of a trend that sees cinema slowly shrinking in comparison to gaming\u2019s growth. Hollywood needs the properties recognised by a generation of video game players, arguably more than the video game industry needs Hollywood. And gamers are a vocal bunch \u2013 if their favorite titles are butchered on the silver screen, they\u2019ll let the studios know it, so it\u2019s in the studio\u2019s interest to deliver faithful adaptations.",
    "In Metal Gear Solid, we potentially have a star and director on the same page as the fans of the games the film draws inspiration from. The fact that Isaac (and, by extension, Vogt-Roberts) can identify the psychedelic nature of characters including Psycho Mantis, and the games\u2019 underlying anti-war message, as opposed to turning the whole thing into a Rambo flick with mechs, is sending the exact sort of reassurance that fans of the series will want."
