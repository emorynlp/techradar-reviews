    "A gritty and volatile take in the lives of modern-day high-schoolers, Euphoria is a coming-of-age drama, plunging us into a world brimming with drug abuse, sex, and trauma as we follow a gang of misfits attempting to navigate the tricky landscape. Lead by an ensemble of young, promising talent, here's where to watch Euphoria online.",
    "Rue, a 17-year-old drug addict, is fresh out of rehab, with no intention of staying clean. Then there's Jules, a transgender girl looking for validation and love in the wrong places. Nate is the typical jock, struggling internally with his own sexual insecurities. Meanwhile, Cassie is grappling with rumors of her sexual history circulating around the school. Throughout, we are introduced to a number of characters and their personal struggles as the show progresses, reminiscent of the UK series, Skins.",
    "Euphoria has a terrific aesthetic - both visually and in terms of its pacing - and it deftly combines themes of sexuality, drug abuse, friendship, and love. Although it succeeds spectacularly at giving an authentic account of the anxiety-ridden lives that high-schoolers can lead, it is an overwhelmingly dark series that might not be for everyone.",
    "You can watch Euphoria on HBO Max, but there are other streaming options too. Read this article to find out where you can watch Euphoria online in your country."
