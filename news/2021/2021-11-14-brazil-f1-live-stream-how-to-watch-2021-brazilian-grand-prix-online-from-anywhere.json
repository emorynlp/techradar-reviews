    "Having not topped the podium since Russia, and with the previous couple of GPs not perfectly suited to the Mercedes machine, it seems like Lewis Hamilton has gone off the boil \u2013 and being confined to the back of the Sprint Qualifying grid didn't exactly help.",
    "But this is the seven-time world champion we're talking about, and he produced a staggering performance to fight his way to tenth on today's grid.",
    "With 19 points between Hamilton and Verstappen, it's by no means a given that Max will walk away with his first championship with ease \u2013 we can almost guarantee that this will be a battle to the death. Any hint of misfortune at this stage could end the title hopes of Hamilton or Verstappen, but it's unlikely either will pull any punches or go easy when the championship is in touching distance.",

    "If you're abroad for this weekend's Brazil GP, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual Formula 1 coverage like you would at home.
