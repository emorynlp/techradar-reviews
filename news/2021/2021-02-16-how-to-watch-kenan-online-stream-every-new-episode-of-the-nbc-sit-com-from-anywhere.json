    "One of the hardest working and funniest comedians on TV is finally back with his own show, as SNL mainstay Kenan Thompson gets his own NBC primetime slow with the cast member front and center. Read on as we explain how to watch Kenan online and stream every episode online wherever you are today.",
    "As part of an all-new NBC Tuesday night primetime line-up that also features Young Rock, Kenan casts Thompson as an eponymous widowed father with a morning talk show whose stressful life bringing up two daughters solo sees him begrudgingly rely on the help of an amusing cast of characters.",
    "These include his sax-loving father-in-law (Don Johnson), while fellow SNL cast remember Chris Redd also plays an integral part as Thompson's brother. Redd brings plenty of manic energy for the more laid-back Kenan to riff off, recreating a tiny bit of that vintage Kenan and Kel magic from Nickelodeon without ever truly threatening its legacy.",
    "With 17-years-and-counting as an SNL ensemble member, it's about time Kenan got his own show back, so while it's impossible to say based on a short trailer if we're looking at a hit or miss, it's well worth a watch if you're a fan of the comedian and actor's work in general.",
    "Follow our guide below as we explain how to watch Kenan online and stream the new NBC show from anywhere.",
    "For those of you abroad when Kenan lands, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the series due to annoying regional restrictions.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream Kenan online no matter where you are. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home.",
