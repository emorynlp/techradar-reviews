    "All eyes are on five-time winner Michael van Gerwen heading into this year's UK darts Masters. While the Dutchman has recently lost his top spot in the world rankings to 'The Iceman' Gerwyn Price, the good news is MVG - along with Price, Peter 'Snakebite' Wright, and the rest the world top eight - has automatically qualified for the second round of this year's tournament. Read on for how to get a darts live stream today and watch the darts Masters 2021 action today and all weekend long.",
    "The Dutchman didn't make it past the first round last year and Mighty Mike has spoken candidly about a recent crisis of confidence that means he'll be throwing a brand new set to darts at the Marshall Arena this weekend, having decided to retire the set that brought him his five titles in the UK Masters so far. But with all that silverware to his name, he still enters as the pre-tournament favourite with the bookies.",
    "World Championship winner Gerwyn Price and his old adversary, defending Masters champion Peter Wright, are the other two main contenders for the tournament, which sees a slightly tweaked format whereby the top eight PDC ranked players get an automatic first round bye. At this year's tournament, the first round will be best of 11 legs, the second round and quarter-finals will be best of 19, and the semi-finals and final will be best of 21.",
    "The quarter-finals, semi-finals and final are all set to be played on a bumper final day of action this Sunday, January 29, so make sure you don't miss out. Follow our guide below out how to watch a 2021 darts Masters live stream from anywhere - including for FREE in the UK where all the action is on ITV!",
    "If the tournament clashes your travel plans for whatever reason, or you just can't make it to your living room when the arrows are on, you'll want a VPN so you don't miss the action. This'll help you circumvent the geo-blocking that could otherwise stop you watching a 2021 darts Masters live stream in particular parts of the world.",
    "Virtual Private Networks are a legal means of getting around this issue, and while they used to be considered pretty fancy stuff, they're now super easy to set up and operate. Here's how it's done.",
    "This year's Masters has a 24-player pool instead of the usual 16, but it's still a rapid tournament, with all of the action being played within five sessions from Friday evening (January 29) to Sunday evening (January 31).",
    "The first round sees the players ranked 9-24 on the PDC Order of Merit face off in a fixed draw, with 2020 runner-up Michael Smith falling on the wrong side of that line.",
    "The winners of these ties go on to face the top eight in the second round. Tantalisingly, that means we could get a repeat of the showdown that saw world No. 18 Jonny Clayton bring van Gerwen's five-year Masters dominance to a shock end a year ago, as he gets his tournament started against Jose de Sousa before the winner advances to face MVG."
