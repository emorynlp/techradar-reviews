    "Available for a limited time only, these exclusive vehicles are part of the Dragon Raja X Evangelion crossover event \u2013 or more specifically, the second crossover. In addition to experiencing a whole new set of stories and missions, players will have the opportunity to unlock new limited battle uniforms, including the outfits of Asuka Langley and Rei Ayanami. The event also features an entirely new limited game mode, known as Video Game Duels, Evangelion Version.",
    "This event will see players face off against other players in card matching battles to hone their skills and prove themselves the best of the best.",
    "This crossover would be exciting enough, but it's happening concurrently with something else. Something big. Dragon Raja's PC launch features enhanced graphics, optimized gameplay, and full support for cross-platform play. If you already have an account all you need to do to play on PC is log in.",
    "And you should be logging in. To celebrate its PC launch, Dragon Raja is offering an unprecedented amount of free gifts and login rewards, including Special Stat Boosts, Coupons, Evolution Stones, and Avatar Frames. Better yet, if the number of active players on PC exceeds the developer's milestone number, everyone will receive even more gifts.",
    "This is in addition to 5 Polishing Dye and 5 Underworld Flames provided to any player that logs into either of the two new servers brought online to support the launch.",
