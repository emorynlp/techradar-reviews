    "The Samsung Galaxy Note 21 would have been one of the most high-profile phones of the year, but in a surprising move Samsung canceled it, leaving Note fans with just the Samsung Galaxy S21 range and foldable phones instead if they wanted a new high-end handset.",
    "So the big question now is, will there be a Samsung Galaxy Note 22? While there\u2019s no conclusive answer to that yet, we are starting to hear some rumors, which we\u2019ll break down in the release date section below.",
    "Then, further down you\u2019ll find information on the specs and features that the Samsung Galaxy Note 22 might include if it does launch. We\u2019ll also be adding to this article whenever we hear anything new about the phone, so check back here for updates.",
    "If the Samsung Galaxy Note 22 launches \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if \u2013 it will probably do so in August of 2022. Specifically, it will probably be announced in the first half of the month and go on sale in the second half, as that\u2019s Samsung\u2019s typical pattern for the range.",
    "However, it\u2019s currently unclear whether there will even be a Samsung Galaxy Note 22, given that the Galaxy Note 21 isn\u2019t happening.",
    "Most of the recent news and leaks suggest there won\u2019t be one, with Samsung not renewing the Galaxy Note trademark while it renewed those for the Galaxy S, Galaxy Z, Galaxy M and Galaxy A series, and with at least one source flat out saying there won\u2019t be any more Samsung Galaxy Note phones.",
    "Or at least, there apparently won\u2019t be any more of them in the form we\u2019ve come to expect, though this source claims that Samsung internally thinks of the Galaxy Z Fold range as the \u2018Note Z\u2019, so it\u2019s possible a future foldable will have Note branding. Elsewhere we've similarly heard that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra could instead launch as the Samsung Galaxy Note 22 Ultra.",
    "All that said, not renewing a trademark right now doesn\u2019t mean Samsung won\u2019t in future, and the company itself has previously said that it\u2019s expected that the Samsung Galaxy Note range will continue in 2022. That claim predates the conflicting reports above, but coming direct from Samsung it carries a lot of weight.",
    "Plus, a leaker claimed in September 2021 (so more recently than many of the rumors) that a supply chain source has seen evidence of the Samsung Galaxy Note 22.",
    "But even more recently a source has claimed that there's no new Note models in Samsung's 2022 product roadmap.",
    "So will there be a Samsung Galaxy Note 22? We doubt it. Leaks aside, with Samsung adding S Pen support to the Galaxy S and Galaxy Fold ranges, and with the S22 Ultra rumored to even have an S Pen slot, the Note has somewhat lost its main selling point, which suggests there might not be any more of them \u2013 and that if there are, the range\u2019s days are probably at least numbered.",
    "So, how much will the Samsung Galaxy Note 22 cost if it does launch? This far away from its likely launch timing there unsurprisingly aren\u2019t any price rumors yet, but it might cost a similar amount to the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 range.",
    "That started at \u00a3849 / AU$1,499 for a 4G model (with the US not getting that version) and $999 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,649 for a 5G version. That\u2019s for the standard Samsung Galaxy Note 20 though, opt for a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and at launch it would have cost you upwards of $1,299 / \u00a31,179 / AU$1,849.",
    "If there is a Samsung Galaxy Note 22, there may or may not also be a Samsung Galaxy Note 22 Ultra, but for any models that do launch, those prices seem a likely ballpark.",
    "So far we don\u2019t know anything about the Samsung Galaxy Note 22, with all the leaks and rumors so far simply being focused on whether or not there will even be such a phone.",
    "There are some things that we can be quite confident of though if the Note 22 does launch. For one thing, it\u2019s obviously going to have an S Pen stylus, and unlike the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 \u2013 which also have stylus support \u2013 the Note 22 is sure to come with the stylus as standard, and have a built-in slot to store it.",
    "We\u2019d also expect the Samsung Galaxy Note 22 to have top-end power, probably packing the best available Snapdragon chipset in some regions (including the US), and the best available Exynos one in others (including the UK). That\u2019s typically what happens with this range.",
    "Beyond that, there\u2019s a chance that it will have an under-display camera, now that Samsung has equipped the Galaxy Z Fold 3 with one, but we\u2019re less sure of that.",
    "It will probably also have a lot in common with the Samsung Galaxy S22, so once that phone launches (probably in January) we\u2019ll be able to say more."
