    "On paper, this England team may look a little different to what we're used to, but you can prepare yourself for a familiar battle at Twickenham against an old, bitter enemy. Read on as our guide explains how to get an England vs Australia live stream and watch the huge Autumn International rugby match online today - no matter where you.",
    "Some fixtures don't need added spice, but this is the first Cook Cup fixture since England knocked Australia out of the World Cup more than two years ago. Things always get tasty when these two sides lock horns and Eddie Jones has gone very leftfield with his selection.",
    "However, with Jones set to field Manu Tuilagi on the wing, Owen Farrell at inside-centre and Marcus Smith at fly-half, there are plenty of worried noises coming out of the England faithful. Is it a case of blending youth and experience, or trying to forced square pegs into round holes?",
    "The Wallabies have never beaten England under Jones, losing seven consecutive games in a miserable run stretching back to 2016, and they come into this encounter off the back of a sapping defeat to Scotland. Michael Hooper won't care too much about that. He'll be desperate to prove that his team can cope without Quade Cooper, Samu Kerevi and Sean McMahon.",
    "There will be fireworks, so follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a rugby live stream, including ways that you can watch England vs Australia for FREE.",
    "If you're abroad right now and try to stream the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
