  "article": [
    "After months of rumors, it was no surprise when the BBC finally confirmed on July 29 that Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker and showrunner Chris Chibnall would be leaving the show in 2022. Now the speculation about the show\u2019s next incarnation can begin in earnest \u2013 and for Who fans, that\u2019s always been part of the equation.",
    "On a show that calls the whole of space and time its playground, it\u2019s perhaps appropriate that Doctor Who\u2019s past and future often seem more important than its present. No other science fiction TV show \u2013 not even Star Trek \u2013 has nearly six decades of existing lore to live up to. Meanwhile, theorizing about the next resident of the TARDIS is a national sport in the UK, where everybody tends to have an opinion on who\u2019d make a good Time Lord, regardless of when they last watched the show. It\u2019s as big a deal as casting the next James Bond.",
    "Right now, however, the identity of the next Doctor, should be a relatively low priority for the BBC.",
    "Unless the truncated, six-episode series 13 (due later this year) and three subsequent specials lined up for 2022 manage to end Whittaker\u2019s rein in a blaze of glory \u2013 and we\u2019ll be delighted if they do \u2013 the era of the Thirteenth Doctor will not go down as a vintage one for the show. But that\u2019s as much down to the culmination of several years of decline as it is about any particular failings of the current production team.",
    "If Doctor Who is going to return to the glory days of David Tennant and Russell T Davies \u2013 when it regularly went toe-to-toe with the likes of The X-Factor in the ratings and fuelled water-cooler conversations galore \u2013 there needs to be a major rethink about what Who is, and what it should be.",
    "As showrunner, Chibnall \u2013 who wrote episodes for earlier seasons of Doctor Who, and was also in charge of spin-off series Torchwood \u2013 has done an admirable amount to regenerate the show. When he cast the fun, likeable Whittaker (who he\u2019d previously worked with on crime drama Broadchurch), he gave Who its first female Doctor, as well as introducing its most diverse roster of companions (or \u201cfriends\u201d, as they\u2019re now known) in Ryan (Tosin Cole), Yaz (Mandip Gill) and Graham (Bradley Walsh) \u2013 a policy he repeated on the other side of the camera with an all-new line-up of writers and directors.",
    "Historical episodes also moved into politically relevant time zones, with \u2018Rosa\u2019 taking in the US civil rights movement, \u2018Demons of the Punjab\u2019 travelling to partition-era India, and \u2018The Witchfinders\u2019 visiting 17th century witch trials.",
    "Alongside a move to make the show feel more cinematic with anamorphic lenses, Chibnall has also overseen some brave storytelling decisions, from a talking frog (much better than it sounds), to the Timeless Child arc. Indeed, as divisive as it was, the idea that the Doctor is the source of the Time Lords\u2019 regeneration abilities is arguably the biggest shake-up in the show\u2019s mythology since William Hartnell regenerated into Patrick Troughton over 50 years ago.",
    "And yet, despite the first Whittaker/Chibnall season getting Doctor Who\u2019s best ratings for years \u2013 although there was a significant drop-off in their second year, the numbers were still comparable or better than predecessor Peter Capaldi\u2019s final run \u2013 the execution hasn\u2019t always matched the ambition. Too many stories have been inoffensively average, with the humor that characterized the Russell T. Davies and Steven Moffat eras largely conspicuous by its absence \u2013 how the show has missed the sort of memorable gags that could put a sticking plaster over a misfiring plot.",
    "Aside from classic villains the Master, the Daleks and the Cybermen, few monsters have stuck in the memory, and while that\u2019s no crime in itself \u2013 of the New Who pantheon, it\u2019s arguably only the Weeping Angels who\u2019ve earned themselves a place at the bad guy top table \u2013 there haven\u2019t been enough of the PG-friendly scares that have traditionally been one of the show\u2019s hallmarks.",
    "Perhaps most importantly, this era of Who has repeatedly suffered from an overly-packed TARDIS, with the Doctor\u2019s travelling companions proving that three\u2019s a crowd; Yaz was particularly underserved by her first season, while Ryan and Graham\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day departure was spectacularly anti-climactic.",
    "Fundamentally, though, Chibnall hasn\u2019t changed much about the Doctor Who formula, and he\u2019s perhaps unfortunate to have inherited the series over a decade into its rebooted run. Even in Matt Smith and Capaldi\u2019s tenures (both under Moffat\u2019s watch), the show was starting to feel less essential \u2013 suddenly, a show that many would have moved mountains to watch \u2018live\u2019 on TV was relegated to catch-up status.",
    "As much time has now passed since Doctor Who\u2019s triumphant return as it was off air following the BBC pulling the plug in 1989. Where Davies had the luxury of making his early seasons an \u2018entry point\u2019 show \u2013 knowing that an entire generation had been unable to see the TARDIS on TV \u2013 Chibnall is wrestling with 16 years of New Who continuity, and the perception that we've seen it all before. That\u2019s before you\u2019ve even addressed the legacy of the show\u2019s original 26-year run.",
    "In a world where big-budget sci-fi TV has become the norm on Netflix, Amazon, Disney Plus and beyond, Doctor Who has simply started to feel like part of the furniture. So, rather than rushing to find replacements for Whittaker and Chibnall, the BBC needs to work out what adventures through space and time look like in the era of streaming giants \u2013 even if it means going away for three or four years to do it.",
    "Doctor Who is among the greatest, most versatile TV formats on planet Earth. It shouldn\u2019t take a Time Lord-size intellect to make it feel like a must-watch once again.",
    "Doctor Who returns to BBC America and BBC One later this year."
