    "We\u2019ve all been told that sharing is caring. But when does it become a matter of concern for Walt Disney\u2019s legal team?",
    "Long gone are the days when families gathered in the living room to enjoy that evening\u2019s prime time TV together. The ability to watch divergent content on multiple devices, to be streamed from various areas of the house, is a modern must, and that flexibility has been factored into Disney Plus account sharing.",
    "It\u2019s acknowledged that a degree of Disney Plus account sharing is inevitable. And it\u2019s hardly stunting the platform\u2019s growth: the House of Mouse roared to over 100 million subscribers in just 18 months. However, if it\u2019s discovered that you\u2019re seriously taking the Mickey, then at the very least expect your account to be blocked.",
    "Below we\u2019ll detail what an appropriate amount of account sharing looks like; how to create additional user profiles for your nearest and dearest; and the total number of devices you can stream from at any one time.",
    "There\u2019s nothing explicitly denouncing Disney Plus account sharing in the Subscriber Agreement. The emphasis is instead on the account holder\u2019s responsibility to keep this information safe, stating that they, rather than Disney Plus, will be liable for any damage arising from their login details being misused by others.",
    "It\u2019s laid out in Section 1 that \u201cYou are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password and for all activities that occur on or through your Disney+ and ESPN+ accounts. However, if you allow others to access your Disney+ or ESPN+ account, this Agreement, as well as any specific consents you may have provided, also applies to their access, use, and disclosure of information\u201d.",
    "So, Disney Plus is aware that subscribers may choose to provide their login details to family and friends. And that\u2019s okay. The platform\u2019s functionality basically encourages this, with each account able to run multiple concurrent streams from different devices, and offering the ability to create up to 7 individualized profiles. But, if your account starts being accessed from dozens of devices over many geographic locations, this is likely to be flagged as \u201csuspicious activity\u201d which may lead to your account being blocked or terminated.",
    "Been too free with your password? You can change it in your account settings and gradually ice out your loved ones. Or \u2013 a much nicer idea \u2013 buy them a Disney Plus gift card for a special occasion.",
    "First off, you need to be a paying Disney Plus member. You can check out everything a subscription offers in our Disney Plus price guide and the best deals available.",
    "Then, you can create up to 7 user profiles. Each one maintains the individual\u2019s viewing history, produces a line-up of \u2018Recommended\u2019 titles based on this, and lets them create their own unique \u2018Watchlist\u2019.",
    "Setting up a personalized profile for a child, partner, parent or friend is easy. Just follow the instructions provided below:",
    "Alternatively, you can delete a profile by clicking on \u2018Edit Profiles\u2019, selecting the pencil icon under the relevant avatar, and selecting \u2018Delete Profile\u2019 at the end of that webpage.",
    "With Disney Plus account sharing you can watch content on four different devices at the same time. That means your youngest enjoying Muppets Now on the smart TV while Marvel-loving teens kick-back with The Falcon and the Winter Soldier on their iPad. If you receive Error Code 13 trying to stream your favorite show, though, it\u2019s likely your account is being accessed by more than four people at once...",
    "Disney Plus delivers great value at $7.99 per month, especially compared to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max, whose entry-level plans only provide between one and three streams.",
    "Additionally, you can download content to a whopping 10 mobile devices to view offline too. That way you need never endure a dull moment in the Post Office queue or on your way to work.",
    "As we detail in this piece on Disney Plus devices, there\u2019s lots of tech compatible with the Disney Plus app, all of which you could use to stream exciting original TV shows like Loki and new Disney Plus Premier Access releases like the Emma Stone-starring Cruella."
