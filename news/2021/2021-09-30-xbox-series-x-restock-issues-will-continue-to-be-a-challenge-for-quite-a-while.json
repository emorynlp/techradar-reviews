    "Xbox Series X stock issues are set to continue into 2022, according to Head of Xbox Phil Spencer.",
    "Spencer told The Wrap (thanks, VGC), that the ongoing global chip shortages that are impacting the development of cars, phones, and televisions, aren\u2019t the only hurdle that\u2019s stopping Microsoft from getting more Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles into the hands of retailers.",
    "\u201cI think it\u2019s probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cWhen I think about, what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a console today, and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are multiple kinds of pinch points in that process. And I think regretfully it\u2019s going to be with us for months and months, definitely through the end of this calendar year and into the next calendar year.\u201d",
    "Spencer\u2019s admission will undoubtedly be met with disappointment from those who are still searching where to buy an Xbox Series X, particularly as the console is approaching its one-year anniversary on November 10, 2021, and it\u2019s something Spencer is all too aware of.",
    "\u201cThe thing that\u2019s most disappointing is just the fan disappointment,\u201d Spencer admitted. \u201cPeople really want this new generation of consoles \u2013 they\u2019re good consoles, both from us and the other platform holders \u2013 and they want the new functionality. We\u2019re working hard to bring them to market but it\u2019s going to be a challenge that we\u2019ll work through for quite a while.\u201d",
    "As Spencer notes, Microsoft isn\u2019t the only console manufacturer that has been plagued with supply issues. Sony\u2019s PS5 continues to sell out almost instantly whenever stock does appear, and Nintendo reportedly canceled a Nintendo Switch Pro model due to supply issues, something which the company has now categorically denied.",
    "Earlier in September, Toshiba\u2019s Takeshi Kamebuchi told Bloomberg: \u201cThe supply of chips will remain very tight until at least September next year. In some cases, we may find some customers not being fully served until 2023.\u201d",
    "The situation is looking rather bleak, then, but if you\u2019re still on the hunt for a PS5, Xbox Series X, or a Nintendo Switch OLED, we\u2019re constantly on the lookout for the latest restocks to help you can snag your console of choice.
