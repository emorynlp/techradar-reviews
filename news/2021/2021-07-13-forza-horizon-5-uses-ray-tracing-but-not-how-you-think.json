    "We already knew Forza Horizon 5 will take advantage of ray tracing in its Forza Vista mode \u2013 which is a graphical technique that uses realistic lighting and reflections to make car models look more gorgeous than ever \u2013 but developer Playground Games has also revealed that the game will use ray tracing for audio.",
    "Speaking on the episode 3 of the Forza Horizon 5: Let\u2019s \u00a1Go! series, creative director Mike Brown and lead audio designer Fraser Strachan were quizzed about the game\u2019s audio, and what petrolheads can expect when careering around the beautiful biomes of Mexico.",
    "It turns out that Forza Horizon 5 will use ray tracing to affect the game\u2019s audio, which is used throughout the world. The game will send out ray-traced audio paths that can detect walls, buildings and ceilings as well. This means you\u2019ll hear the roar of your car\u2019s engine sounds bouncing off of all the buildings around you, and that will change depending on the environment.",
    "\u201cAs soon as we turned it on, it grounded the world in reality,\u201d Strachan said. \u201cIt made the world really feel alive. If you\u2019re listening with spatial audio, something like Dolby Atmos with your headphones on, you\u2019ll be able to hear your car bouncing off the roofs as well.\u201d",
    "\u201cEvery material in the game has been set up with a different absorption coefficient, which is kind of an acoustic term which essentially says if it\u2019s concrete it will bounce off more than foliage, which actually absorbs the sound, so it\u2019s really dynamic to the world around you.\u201d",
    "Ray-traced audio will also affect multiplayer modes by using occlusion, as the game can detect where every single car is in relation to your car. If a car\u2019s behind a building, for example, you\u2019ll know not to head directly there as their engine will sound muffled. This means you could choose to cut them off instead, as you\u2019ll be more of their location.",
    "Forza Horizon 5 will also sound better on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as the new consoles unlock a new compression format that allows for much higher fidelity audio. It\u2019s apparently imperceptible to an uncompressed version, which should please audiophiles. This means that every aspect of the game will sound \u201ccleaner and more refined\u201d on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, including car sounds, music and even dialog.",
    "The team also delved into how car recordings are made, which involves meticulously recording hundreds of cars on an airfield track, and Strachan revealed that there will be over 320 brand new recordings.",
    "Strachan also said that Forza Horizon 5 will feature a modular system for the very first time, which has been highly requested by the game\u2019s community. It means that when you upgrade your car, you\u2019ll hear the difference in real time and how they affect the sound of your vehicle.",
    "Forza Horizon 5 was revealed during Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase during E3 2021, which took place in June. It's set to release on November 9, 2021, and will be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on day one on Xbox consoles and PC."
