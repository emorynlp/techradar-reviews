  "summary": "A thorough web hosting security checklist",
  "article": [
    "Whether you\u2019re providing a product or a service, maintaining a web presence is a critical component of modern business.",
    "And in the current landscape where threats are seemingly everywhere, web hosting security is key to ensuring you don\u2019t suffer an online attack that compromises your customers\u2019 details - and ruins your brand reputation.",
    "Naturally, not all hosting providers are created equal. Moreover, there are different types of hosting services for different needs. In this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at exactly what you need to do when choosing a web host that\u2019s right for you in terms of the security it offers.",
    "Web hosting services take many forms, but there are four that stand out:",
    "Shared hosting",
    "VPS hosting",
    "Dedicated hosting",
    "Cloud hosting",
    "Shared hosting is the most basic form of web hosting available. It\u2019s highly cost-effective and suitable for basic websites that aren\u2019t engaged in e-commerce.",
    "Resources are shared by multiple websites on a single server. This is the primary reason why costs are low. Each site hosted on the server will be awarded a limited number of resources based on the hosting plan.",
    "If you expect your website to attract heavy traffic, this isn\u2019t the best option for you. If another site also experiences a traffic spike, you\u2019ll end up with performance issues and maybe even some downtime.",
    "Shared hosting is better suited for beginners, bloggers, or any non-retail website that doesn\u2019t attract large volumes of traffic.",
    "Those who sign up for a VPS Hosting plan still share a single server with other customers - but not as much as on a shared hosting plan. In fact, you\u2019ll share the server with a significantly lower number of websites (lowering your exposure to risk).",
    "VPS hosting describes the process where the primary server is split into several virtual servers. These can be customized to the specific needs of the website and the business.",
    "VPS hosting is fairly secure but it depends entirely on the software on which it is running.",
    "Dedicated hosting provides a dedicated server for your website. With this hosting model, you don\u2019t share anything with other customers.",
    "As no resources will be shared, this is the most expensive type of web hosting available. However, it comes with added benefits like peak performance, complete technical control over server settings, and more. It\u2019s best suited for large businesses that attract more than 100,000 visitors a month.",
    "A dedicated host is one of the most secure types of web hosts you can use. However, it\u2019s still vulnerable to online attacks, which means you need to do all your can to keep it secure, such as using trusted networks only and keeping it up-to-date.",
    "Cloud hosting is similar to VPS hosting but on a larger scale. It\u2019s highly cost-effective and enables access to multiple remote servers.",
    "Each server is assigned a different set of responsibilities, so whenever one is compromised, the others will take over. This means that you won\u2019t have to deal with any unexpected downtime due to cyberattacks or server errors.",
    "Cloud hosting is also highly scalable. You can scale your resources on-demand depending on your present needs.",
    "How secure is cloud hosting? It is the most secure type of web host you can get, thanks to the fact that it uses encryption technology and, moreover, cloud hosting companies are known for employing sophisticated security measures to keep your data safe.",
    "Before committing, it\u2019s essential to know the difference between managed and unmanaged hosting because one demands significant technical skills while the other doesn\u2019t.",
    "Managed hosting",
    "Managed hosting services help you \u201cmanage\u201d the server where your sensitive data is stored. They do all the grunt work for you so that you can focus on your business. This could be anything from maintenance to upgrades and even repairs.",
    "Furthermore, in addition to Linux or Windows server operating systems, the managed hosting service provider will install and maintain all the necessary software and Content Management Systems (CMS).",
    "All you have to do is click a button to access and install hundreds of modules through a user-friendly cPanel. You also have access to features like automatic backup protocols, real-time monitoring, security sweeps, and threat alerts.",
    "Unmanaged Hosting",
    "Unmanaged hosting comes with a very limited number of services. Most often, you just receive server space with the operating system.",
    "If you don\u2019t have the required technical skills for unmanaged hosting, you\u2019re going to get stuck quickly. You\u2019ll need to install and manage specific software without any support from the hosting service provider.",
    "Whenever there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019ll be your responsibility to take care of it. If you don\u2019t have highly technically skilled individuals in-house, unmanaged hosting isn\u2019t for you.",
    "Before you make a final decision, let\u2019s take a look at all the other important variables that will impact your website in the long term.",
    "What\u2019s their uptime?",
    "Time is money, so every second longer your site takes to load can equal significant losses. This is especially true for e-commerce platforms as delays can lead to missed sales opportunities - and damage to brand value.",
    "For example, the infamous Amazon Web Services outage caused by human error cost businesses more than $150 million over three hours.",
    "On the plus side, most hosting service providers guarantee a certain amount of uptime. Whenever there\u2019s an unplanned outage (and there will be), they will reimburse you based on your Service-Level Agreement (SLA). These grantees usually range from 99% to a 99.9% uptime threshold.",
    "Load time can sound the same as uptime. The difference is that uptime refers to the amount of time your website is live and available to customers, while load time refers to the amount of time your pages take to load.",
    "And after you\u2019ve put in all the work to build a beautiful and responsive website, the last thing you want to do is annoy visitors with slow load times.",
    "Look for hosting reviews with actual server speed tests and look at specific features that ensure fast-loading websites.",
    "If your potential hosting service provider has a history of data leaks and breaches, it\u2019s not for you.",
    "Also, be on the lookout for subdomain takeovers where hackers took over subdomains with the help of some external services. These types of attacks are hard to trace, but not impossible.",
    "Some hosting service providers and e-commerce platforms like Squarespace and Shopify, for example, are known not to handle the subdomain ownership verification correctly. However, once your site is live, you can leverage an asset monitoring tool to avert hostile takeovers.",
    "If you\u2019re hosting a WordPress website, know that some plugins can leak information. Security researchers have in the past identified plugs that have put hundreds of thousands of WP sites at risk.",
    "Customer service and support are important, especially when you\u2019re dealing with hosting issues.",
    "If you\u2019ve signed up with a managed service provider, you need to be sure that they\u2019re available 24/7, all year around. This is especially vital when you\u2019re under attack from threat actors.",
    "Understand the difference between hosting models before choosing",
    "Do your own research, and be thorough",
    "Read reviews extensively",
    "Check the provider\u2019s uptime record",
    "Check their loading time and speed",
    "Check what security protocols are in place",
    "Did they experience a data breach?",
    "What about hostile subdomain takeovers?",
    "Lookout for pricing tricks",
    "Check their customer service and support record",
    "Be thorough with SLA agreements before signing them",
    "Before choosing a web hosting plan, you need to look at all the different variables that ensure security, scalability, and business relevance.",
    "The right choice for you depends on your business model, target audience, your own personal technical prowess, and long-term business goals. Just ask yourself, \u201cwhat do we need right now? What\u2019s our budget and which hosting plan will help us achieve our security goals?\u201d",
    "Whatever you do, though - don\u2019t sell yourself short. If a plan is too risky, always consider spending a little extra for more peace of mind."
