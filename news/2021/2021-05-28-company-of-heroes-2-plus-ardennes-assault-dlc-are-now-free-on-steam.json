    "Company of Heroes 2 normally runs to $17.49 (or \u00a312.49) on Steam, but right now, you can grab the World War 2 RTS for free.",
    "What you\u2019re actually getting for nothing is the base game plus the Ardennes Assault expansion, so that\u2019s a pretty sweet deal and it\u2019ll last over the weekend and through until May 31 at 1pm ET (6pm BST).",
    "That said, note that you might want to go for this offer sooner rather than later, because it\u2019s marked as \u201cwhile supplies last\u201d on the Steam product page, so there\u2019s a danger the allocation of freebie copies will run dry.",
    "According to the developer, some folks are encountering trouble while bagging the free game: \u201cNote \u2013 some people are experiencing a subscription error with this offer. We are working to resolve this, please check back shortly.\u201d",
    "Company of Heroes 2 is a real-time strategy affair from Relic released eight years back, and casts the player in the role of the Russians in WW2. The game was generally well-received \u2013 as was the Ardennes expansion \u2013 even if some criticism was directed at it for being a little rough around the edges.",
    "Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that a bunch of DLC for Company of Heroes 2 \u2013 and the Franchise Edition which is stuffed with DLC \u2013 have a 75% discount applied right now. So if you find that the free game is up your street at the weekend, you could always nab some of the DLC on sale, which is obviously the hope of the devs.",
    "Those hunting for freebies on PC right now should also be aware that the Epic Games Store\u2019s new free game is Among Us, which is a fun shout."
