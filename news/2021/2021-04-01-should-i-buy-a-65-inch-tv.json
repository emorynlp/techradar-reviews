    "Should you buy a 65-inch TV? The short answer is: if you can afford it, a bigger TV is often a better TV. In the UK, the average screen size grew from around the size of a 32-inch TV at the turn of the century up to that of a 40-inch TV by 2010. As 2019 became 2020, the average size of the new TVs sold in the UK was almost 50 inches. Who knows what that will mean the most popular size of 2021 will be by the end of the year.",
    "As you might expect, economies of scale mean that the more popular a certain screen size is, the more affordable (in relative terms) it becomes. You only need to check out the price of one of our favourite 50-inch TVs of 2020, the outstanding Panasonic HX800, to see what\u2019s what.",
    "When we reviewed the HX800 in June of last year, the 50-inch version cost \u00a3899 (around $1,200 / AU$1,650) \u2013 and it\u2019s now routinely available for \u00a3699 (around $950 / AU$1,270) or so. Compare this to the 40-inch version of the same television: \u00a3649 at launch, on sale now for around \u00a3599. If a much bigger screen is so relatively inexpensive, why would you choose the smaller one?",
    "The temptation when buying a new TV is to get the biggest one that\u2019s available within your budget. The average customer upgrades their TV once every six or seven years \u2013 so the last thing you want is to get home and be struck by small-screen buyer's remorse, right? So if your budget will stretch to a 65-inch 4K TV, why not?",
    "It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t quite a few worthwhile 65-inch TVs around, too, and for a range of prices. If you\u2019re absolutely determined to future-proof your new TV as much as possible, of course, then you\u2019re looking at an 8K resolution Samsung TV \u2013 the QE65Q950T will set you back the thick end of \u00a36,000 / $8,000 \u2013 or you might consider the less well-specified QE65Q800T alternative for about half of that amount. For the rest of us, though, there\u2019s plenty of choice where the more real-world 4K resolution is concerned.",
    "Our current favourite is LG\u2019s stunning CX OLED \u2013 for a fraction under \u00a32,000 ($1,799 / \u00a31,799 / around AU$2,700) you can be the proud owner of a super-slim, high-performance OLED TV with support for both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and HDMI 2.1 compatibility for your shiny new PS5 or Xbox Series X.",
    "But you shouldn\u2019t overlook Sony\u2019s almost-as-impressive A8H OLED. It\u2019s a little more affordable, enjoys typically Sony picture quality and has a fearsomely clever audio system that uses the entirety of its great big screen to produce sound.",
    "Of course, you don\u2019t have to go deep into four figures to treat yourself to a nice new telly. Hisense\u2019s admirable 65U7QF may not be as accomplished a performer as the alternatives from LG, Samsung, Sony and all the rest \u2013 but it\u2019s yours for less than \u00a3800 / $1000. Quite a bit less, if you shop around \u2013 which is a value proposition that\u2019s hard to argue with.",
    "Just because you can afford a 65-inch TV, though, it doesn\u2019t automatically follow that you should go straight out and buy one. There are factors to consider before you get out your credit card and start folding the back seats of your car down.",
    "The most fundamental question of all is: do you have the necessary space to accommodate a 65-inch TV? We don\u2019t mean the surface to put it on, or the wall to hang it on, either \u2013 we mean the distance from which you\u2019ll need to sit in order to enjoy a comfortable viewing experience.",
    "We\u2019ve all been to the cinema to see a popular film during its first few days of release, which means at some point we\u2019ve all ended up sitting too close to the screen. It\u2019s rotten, isn\u2019t it? Can\u2019t take in the whole screen at once, can\u2019t help but notice noise in the picture, can\u2019t help but be made to feel a bit queasy by rapid or unpredictable on-screen motion. Well, it\u2019ll be just the same if you\u2019re sitting too close to your TV.",
    "First of all, bear in mind that TV screen sizes are measured on the diagonal. So the \u201865-inch\u2019 measurement indicates the distance from the bottom-left corner of the screen to the top-right corner. This is especially relevant if you plan to mount your TV on the wall \u2013 in purely decorative terms it might look great above the fireplace, but unless you watch TV from a bar-stool it\u2019s almost certain to be too high to view comfortably.",
    "That means you need to measure the distance between where the TV is going to be and where you intend to sit when watching it.",
    "4K resolution screens are easier to watch from a short distance than 1080p Full HD equivalents \u2013 thanks to the massive uptick in pixel quantity \u2013 but nevertheless you don\u2019t want to be too close. A good rule of thumb for 4K screens is to consider a distance of somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times the screen size as the minimum viewing distance. That means you need to be sitting no closer than 2.5m to your new 65-inch television \u2013 and, ideally, more like 3 to 3.5m.",
    "Sit too close and you won\u2019t be watching your TV screen so much as watching the pixels that make up the picture. So if you can\u2019t get the sort of distance from your screen that we recommend, well, you\u2019re better off facing the facts and selecting a slightly more modest television.",
    "But if you can put sufficient distance between yourself and the screen, you\u2019re good to go. But just because you can accommodate a 65-inch TV, does it automatically follow that you should? What tangible benefits are there to a big 65-inch television, anyway?",
    "Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, a bigger screen means a bigger image. That, in turn, means a more immersive, intense and life-like viewing experience \u2013 particularly if your new screen is equipped to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies like dynamic metadata HDR. If you\u2019re paying top dollar for a 4K Netflix subscription, or you\u2019ve got a 4K Blu-ray player for a truly premium picture, those extra inches will translate directly into a more vivid and cinematic watch.",
    "And if you give your money to Philips for a 65-inch version of one of its Ambilight-equipped OLED TVs (the 65OLED935+ is a truly outstanding TV, and \u2013 thanks to Bowers & Wilkins \u2013 for once it\u2019s a screen with audio quality to match up to the picture quality), the effect of those rear-facing LEDs beaming light onto the wall behind the screen is even more pronounced than it is on the smaller variants.",
    "Gamers, too, will enjoy those extra screen inches. As long as you make sure your new 65-inch TV is equipped with HDMI 2.1 \u2013 which rules out the Philips TV, but most definitely rules in the likes of Samsung\u2019s outstanding QE65Q95T QLED screen \u2013 every next-gen console feature can be accommodated. The likes of variable refresh rate, 4K/120Hz passthrough and HGiG HDR tone-mapping only add to the already thrilling visual experience served up by both the Xbox Series X and Playstation 5 \u2013 and here, too, a big screen really allows you to be drawn into the action.",
    "In short, then, there\u2019s no reason not to think long and hard about a 65-inch TV when you\u2019re researching your new TV \u2013 provided you have the space to get a realistic distance away from it, at least."
