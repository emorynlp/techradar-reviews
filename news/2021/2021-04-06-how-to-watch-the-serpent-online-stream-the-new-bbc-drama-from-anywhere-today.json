    "From the writers of Ripper Street comes this pulse-raising new series, charting the murderous movements of Charles Sobhraj along the \u2018Hippie Trail\u2019 during the 1970s, and his eventual arrest in India. Starring acclaimed French actor Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) as serial killer Sobhraj, and Doctor Who\u2019s Jenna Coleman as his devoted accomplice Marie-Andr\u00e9e Leclerc, it\u2019s one gripping true-crime drama. We detail below how you can watch The Serpent online, and enjoy all eight episodes free in the UK and stream them from anywhere in the world.",
    "Cunning, clever, and deceptive, Sobhraj was nicknamed The Serpent due to his ability to evade police capture. He was a con artist, thief, and master of disguise, who murdered at least a dozen Western travellers along the Asian \u2018Hippie Trail\u2019 in the mid-70s.",
    "However, it wasn\u2019t until an encounter with Herman Knippenberg, a Dutch diplomat in Bangkok (played here by Billy Howle), that his nefarious crimes caught up with him. He was jailed for 20 years in 1977 \u2013 though not for the last time \u2013 and became something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre around the world.",
    "Director Tom Shankland (The Missing) captures the era\u2019s hazy hedonism and bohemian scene, while keeping the tension high as he switches between the ongoing criminal investigation and Rahim\u2019s cold-blooded crimes. It\u2019s another example of the BBC\u2019s investment in high-quality drama after Steve McQueen\u2019s Small Axe anthology and A Suitable Boy earlier this year: a compelling, dark, and addictive treat.",
    "So, discover the unbelievable true-story about this infamous 70s criminal, as we explain how to watch The Serpent online from anywhere \u2013 and completely FREE on the BBC for those located in the UK.",
    "If you're away over the holidays, or are now enjoying a winter vacation, then geo-blocking restrictions will stop you from watching The Serpent online via BBC iPlayer.",
    "Fortunately, there\u2019s a simple solution. By downloading a VPN \u2013 short for Virtual Private Network \u2013 you can alter your IP address to that of your country back home, and therefore stream TV content that would otherwise be inaccessible."
