    "Microsoft is working on an update for collaboration platform Teams that aims to minimize unwanted distractions by shielding users from pranksters and scammers.",
    "As per a new entry in the company\u2019s product roadmap, Microsoft Teams users will soon receive an alert in the event they receive a call from a suspicious number.",
    "\u201cThe spam call notification feature automatically evaluates incoming calls and identifies probable spam calls as \u2018spam likely\u2019 in the call toast,\u201d Microsoft explained.",
    "\u201cUsers will have the option to answer or reject the call, and all \u2018spam likely\u2019 called (regardless of whether they were answered or rejected) will also be reflected in the call history.\u201d",
    "The new feature is still currently under development, but is expected to roll out to all users by the end of the month.",
    "Although many businesses use Microsoft Teams exclusively for internal collaboration, plenty of others take advantage of the ability to place and receive phone calls via the platform too.",
    "Microsoft Teams Phone and other similar VoIP services enjoyed a significant surge in popularity during the pandemic, with companies forced to find a way to support remote employees who no longer had access to traditional business phone systems.",
    "However, this trend has also created a new avenue for scammers and spam callers, whether their goal is to phish for valuable personal data, promote a product or service, or whatever else.",
    "Much like similar protections deployed by smartphone vendors, Microsoft\u2019s new alert system should go some way to preventing Teams users from falling foul of call-based scams, as well as shielding against spam and nuisance calls.",
    "Presumably, the feature will also allow businesses to more easily create a blacklist that prevents calls from suspicious numbers reaching employees in the first place."
