    "The immediate future doesn\u2019t look particularly bright for the Halo Wars series after 343 Industries has said it has \u201cno current plans\u201d to add to its 2017 game Halo Wars 2 or to develop a sequel.",
    "Back in 2019, fans of Halo Wars 2 used a petition to ask that 343 Industries continue support for the game by adding new content, features and making quality of life improvements. 343 Industries responded to say that it was \u201cunable to commit to any future Halo Wars 2 continued development or support\u201d as the team that was bringing the Master Chief Collection to PC was \u201calso the team that helped make Halo Wars 2 a reality\u201d and that \u201cresources that were previously focused on Halo Wars 2 have been pulled over to help support MCC and Halo: Reach development.\u201d",
    "In the same post, 343 also said \u201cnever say never\u201d to the idea of returning to Halo Wars 2, so now that the Master Chief Collection has arrived on PC in full, some still-hopeful fans wondered if now might be the time, especially after a recent job listing (via IGN) hinted at \u201ca new project in the Halo universe\u201d.",
    "However, 343 has confirmed in a recent Waypoint post that\u2019s not to be the case and separately confirmed that the job listing was for Halo Infinite.",
    "In a new post on Halo Waypoint 343 community manager John Junyszek wrote \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to be open and transparent - particularly when we expect it\u2019s not an answer the community wants to hear - but we want to give it to you straight: 343 Industries has no current plans for further Halo Wars 2 work including content updates, balance patches, bringing the title to other platforms, or a new game in the series,\u201d adding, \u201dWe will, however, continue to monitor the game and ensure everything is working as expected.\u201d",
    "Junyszek did offer some hope by pointing out that \u201ccurrently\u201d doesn\u2019t mean never, saying, \u201cYes, we did use the word \u2018currently\u2019 because it\u2019s the truth \u2013 as of today, there is no plan for the development team to re-engage with Halo Wars 2 and we aren\u2019t working on a new game in the series at this time. But, we\u2019re specifically never going to say never because, well, who knows what the future may bring. \u201c",
    "The reason for the indefinite step back from the Halo Wars series is, according to Junyszek, simply down to \u201cthe realities of finite time, resources, and focus for the studio.\u201d",
    "He explained that 343 Publishing \u201chas no shortage of ideas and inspiration to pursue for MCC and plenty of ongoing work to support the Halo franchise. Meanwhile, the majority of the studio is incredibly focused working towards Halo Infinite\u2019s launch (and you may have also heard, \u2018launch is only the beginning\u2019).",
    "\u201cGiven the broader impact initiatives the studio is already committed to, we unfortunately can\u2019t devote the time and attention we\u2019d need to deliver additional updates and content for the Halo Wars franchise.\u201d",
    "Now that 343\u2019s plans around Halo Wars have been laid out, it looks like it\u2019s full steam ahead to Halo Infinite, which is expected to launch later this year for Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC."
