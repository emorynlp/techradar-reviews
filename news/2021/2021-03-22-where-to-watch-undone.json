    "Amazon\u2019s first animated original, Undone was one of 2019\u2019s best shows. This series takes us through the life of Alma, who gets into a deadly car crash that helps her realize her ability to manipulate time. As she comes to terms with what\u2019s happening within her, she attempts to uncover the truth about her father\u2019s death.",
    "Fair warning, watch Undone at your own risk, because it doesn\u2019t have a second season yet, and you\u2019ll definitely want more than 8 episodes of this masterpiece. This show comes from the creators of Bojack Horseman, so you can expect psychological complexity, but what truly stands out is the visuals.",
    "Undone\u2019s visuals are a result of rotoscoping, a difficult animation technique in which actors are filmed and then drawn over by animators. This type of animation creates visuals that appear realistic, but it also gives animators the freedom to produce incredibly unreal imagery, which they use to depict time manipulation.",
