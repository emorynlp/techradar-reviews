    "After going head-to-head in recent years, LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo are on the same team for this year's NBA All-Star Game, which is being staged at an empty State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. Follow our guide below to tune and see the best basketball players in the world shoot hoops for a good cause - here's how to watch a 2021 NBA All-Star Game live stream, no matter where you are in the world right now.",
    "King James got the first pick ahead of Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, and snapped up the Milwaukee Bucks' star man and two-time NBA MVP. Durant - who's been ruled out of actually playing due to injury - made his teammate Kyrie Irving his first choice. The All-Star draft ended with Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert going last, a bit of surprise given the two stars are responsible for the Utah Jazz's rise to the top of the Western Conference.",
    "Steph Curry (Golden State Warriors), Luka Doncic (Dallas Mavericks) and Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets) make up the rest of Team LeBron's starters, while Irving will be lining up alongside Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers), Bradley Beal (Washington Wizards) and Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics).",
    "We're sticking with the same format that was used last year, which means the team that scores the most points during each of the first three 12-minute quarters will earn a prize for their charity (Thurgood Marshall College Fund for Team LeBron and the United Negro College Fund for Team Durant).",
    "The clock will be turned off in the fourth quarter and a Final Target Score will be set based on the leading team\u2019s overall score, plus 24 points in honour of the late Kobe Bryant.",
    "Many people's highlight of NBA All-Star events, the Slam Dunk Contest, will take place at half-time, while the 3-point Contest and Skills Challenge will be pre-game affairs. It should be a great game, so read on as we explain how to get a 2021 NBA All-Star Game live stream from anywhere in the world today.",
    "Scroll down for a guide to NBA live streaming services all over the world, but first, know that if you can't watch an NBA game on your usual TV channel or streaming service, it might be due to a coverage blackout (in the US) or a geo-blocking restriction (in international markets).",
    "Both can stop you from watching the coverage you want and most likely pay for, especially with many games being shown on national TV.",
    "When either of these are the case, the simplest and most reliable solution is to use a VPN service to change your IP address to a difference location. This will generally let you tune in to your local coverage, just as you would from home, and means you don't have to trawl the sketchier corners of the internet for an illegal stream.",
    "Use a VPN to watch NBA All Star Game from anywhere",
    "That depends. NBA League Pass subscribers in the US and Canada will not be able to watch the NBA All-Star Game using the service - but international subscribers will. This is because games that are shown on national television (TNT in this case) are subject to NBA blackouts.",
    "While you won\u2019t be able to watch Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game with League Pass, a replay of the game will likely be available once it airs on television."
