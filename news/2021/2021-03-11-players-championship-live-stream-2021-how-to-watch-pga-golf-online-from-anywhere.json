    "Get ready to turn it up to 11, golf fans, as after a relatively and refreshingly normal start to 2021, the sport's unofficial 5th Major is getting under way at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Verda Beach, Florida. Read on as we explain how to watch a Players Championship live stream - catch every round 1 tee-time, shot and all the PGA golf action online wherever you are right now.",
    "This year's Players Championship takes place from Thursday, March 11 through Sunday, March 14 and boasts a $15 million purse - a larger prize than any of golf's four official Major tournaments, with a cool $2.5 million going to the winner.",
    "Designed in 1982, the par 72 Stadium Course at Sawgrass once again hosts the prestigious event, which ground to a halt after just 18 holes were played in 2020 due to the arrival of a certain pandemic in the US. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama led at the time after a record-tying first round score of 63, ahead of (then and still) defending 2019 winner Rory McIlroy, among others.",
    "TPC Sawgrass features 7,200 yards of testing terrain, including one of the sport's most breathtaking holes - the par 3 17th and its iconic island green. As you'd expect, there's a world-class Players field with tee-off times scheduled in Florida today, the likes of Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas and Jon Rahm all joining McIlroy down in the Sunshine State.",
    "Even without Tiger, the Players is still one of the game's most illustrious competitions. Follow our guide below as we explain how to live stream Players Championship round 1 action and watch PGA golf online from anywhere today.",
    "There are loads of easy ways to watch golf in 2021 including in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and almost anywhere else in the world. Scroll down for a full breakdown of options, but the first thing you should know is that anyone away from their home country can still tune into the action as usual by using one of the best VPNs.",
    "These services will allow you to get around any geo-blocking and and let you watch the same legal, high-quality golf live stream you would at home. Best of all, they only take a few minutes to set-up.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Players Championship golf from anywhere",
    "There are four official Players Championship featured groups for the first two rounds at TPC Sawgrass this year.",
    "The Players Championship round 1 tee-times for those trios are as follows:",
    "Sadly, Tiger Woods is not playing golf in the The Players Championship 2021 - the sports legend's injury woes continuing for the foreseeable future after a car accident earlier this year. Along with Brooks Koepka and Matthew Wolff, he's one of the few absentees this week."
