    "Anyone paying attention to 2021\u2019s new Samsung TVs will notice that there\u2019s some new terminology being thrown around: Neo QLED.",
    "Yes, there are enough acronyms in the TV market already, and you may feel exasperated at having to constantly learn new words and terms. However, Neo QLED does mark a significant change in Samsung\u2019s TV technology, and if you want to keep abreast of the latest and greatest televisions, you\u2019ll want to get your head around it.",
    "It's not the same thing as QLED, which has been Samsung's premium TV technology for the past few years.",
    "So what is Neo QLED, what marks it out from regular QLED, and what TVs does it apply to? Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
    "Neo QLED is an evolution of Samsung\u2019s existing QLED technology, which stands for \u2018quantum dot LED\u2019. That\u2019s because QLED TVs use a \u2018quantum dot\u2019 filter to increase contrast and color vibrancy.",
    "Samsung has made sure its premium televisions all use QLED technology since 2017, when it rebranded its SUHD (Super UHD) range, at least partially to invite comparison with the \u2018OLED\u2019 televisions that now hold sway over the market.",
    "The impact of a QLED panel varies depending on a variety of factors, though, including but not limited to the processor being used, as well as the efficacy of the backlight behind the panel.",
    "Lower-end QLED TVs make do with an edge-lighting system that \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 lights up the panel from two sides, rather than directly behind it. This allows the TV to stay somewhat slim, but means that the light is spread inconsistently across the screen, and won\u2019t make for the best picture.",
    "High-end QLED TVs will use a Direct Full Array backlight, which shines light through the panel from behind, and will offer more precise brightness control and consistency (therefore allowing better contrast between light and dark parts of the screen, crucial for effective HDR highlights and general picture excellence).",
    "Even these TVs vary in quality of backlight, though, depending on the peak brightness available (1,000 nits, 2,000 nits, etc) and the number of \u2018dimmable zones\u2019 that can vary in their level of brightness. More zones means more control over small and specific areas of the screen, so you want as many as technically possible.",
    "Neo QLED changes things up a little. The direct array is replaced by a Mini LED backlight, using tens of thousands of tiny LEDs for vastly more precise brightness control. It\u2019s not quite on the level of OLED, with its individual pixel control, but it\u2019s certainly a step up for LCD screens.",
    "If it\u2019s deployed effectively, Mini LED backlighting should allow LCD panels to get much closer to OLED levels of performance than has been possible before. These theoretical advantages are pretty compelling.",
    "And, of course, that\u2019s without OLED\u2019s perceived problems: LED/LCD technology has never been the subject of screen-burn scare stories, nor does it fall prey to the eventual but inevitable drop-off in performance that\u2019s the price of the \u2018organic\u2019 element of OLED.",
    "Of course, the success of Mini LED will come down to the way the technology is implemented. There\u2019s a lot of variation in the performance of similarly priced, similarly specified LED-backlit LCD screens \u2013 you only have to have a quick glance at our numerous TV reviews to see that. And if some TVs are found wanting when it comes to controlling a few dozen backlight dimming zones, can they really be expected to be any better when they have control of what could be thousands?",
    "Read more: What is Mini LED?",
    "2021 will be the first year we see Neo QLED TVs enter the market. All of Samsung\u2019s new 8K TVs will be Neo QLED, continuing Samsung\u2019s tradition of piling together the most advanced TV specifications at the top of its range.",
    "That means the QN900 8K QLED, QN800 8K QLED, and QN700 8K QLED all feature Mini LED backlights.",
    "The QN95A, QN90A and QN85A are all Neo QLED 4K TVs too; the easiest way to tell is that the product name starts with \u2018QN\u2019 rather than just \u2018Q\u2019, as with the Q80A that sits just below those other 4K sets.",
    "The cheapest Neo QLED, the QN85A, starts at $1,299 (around \u00a3900 / AU$1,650) for a 55-inch size, but the largest 85-inch size of the QN900 8K QLED will cost you a whopping $8,999 (around \u00a36,500 / AU$11,700). So that\u2019s the price range for this year\u2019s Neo QLED TVs.",
    "Samsung isn\u2019t the only TV maker pushing Mini LED technology, though. LG is also introducing a \u2018QNED\u2019 range that uses Mini LED backlights, while Philips is doing the same with some of its high-end LCD sets. TCL has been one of Mini LED\u2019s biggest cheerleaders too \u2013 but you can get more information on each manufacturer's TV ranges from the links below."
