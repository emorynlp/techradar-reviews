    "Spoilers follow for The Suicide Squad on HBO Max.",
    "The Suicide Squad, Warner Bros\u2019 latest DC Extended Universe (DCEU) movie, has arrived on HBO Max \u2013 and there\u2019s a fair bit to unpack from James Gunn\u2019s R-rated superhero (or should that be supervillain?) film.",
    "Now that the credits have rolled, we imagine you have questions, including who lived and died, and what went down in the movie's post-credits scene.",
    "Below, we\u2019ll break down how The Suicide Squad ends, as well as cover how its final few scenes will affect at least one DCEU project. It\u2019s obvious to say, but we\u2019re about to dive into major spoiler territory for The Suicide Squad, so turn back now if you haven\u2019t watched it in its entirety.",
    "It would be easier to list those who actually survived. Ahead of the film\u2019s release, director James Gunn continually stated that there would be major casualties among the movie\u2019s sizable cast \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t joking.",
    "The majority of the film\u2019s ensemble cast didn\u2019t make it past the Saving Private Ryan-inspired beach assault in the first act. Of that number, the demise of Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) was the most shocking, given that he had featured prominently in the 2016 movie adaptation of Suicide Squad.",
    "Of those who made it into the heart of Corto Maltese, though, two characters' journeys wouldn\u2019t progress much further.",
    "Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is murdered by Peacemaker (John Cena) after the pair fought over a vital piece of evidence. The item in question \u2013 a hard drive \u2013 contained evidence of the US government\u2019s involvement in funding experiments surrounding Starro, with Flag and Peacemaker divided over what to do with it.",
    "Feeling betrayed by the very people he conducted these missions for, Flag wants to upload the drive to the internet and reveal the US government\u2019s secret to the world. As a loyal patriot, however, Peacemaker has other ideas. He wants to give the evidence to Task Force X\u2019s leader Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to ensure that the footage never sees the light of day.",
    "After a brutal, hand-to-hand battle, it\u2019s Peacemaker who comes out on top. As Flag tries to suffocates him with a lead pipe, Peacemaker grabs a nearby piece of broken porcelain and stabs Flag in the heart, thereby killing him.",
    "Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian) is the other major casualty of the movie\u2019s third act. Helping his fellow supervillains to halt Starro\u2019s rampage across the island, he\u2019s crushed by one of the starfish kaiju\u2019s five limbs \u2013 but not before he heroically shouts \u201cI\u2019m finally a superhero!\u201d for doing something good with his life. It\u2019s a semi-honorable death and one that, ironically, he\u2019d asked for earlier in the film.",
    "So, who did survive to the very end? Of the 15 supervillains who made up this version of Task Force X, only six lived to tell the tale.",
    "Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Harley Quinn (Margo Robbie), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), King Shark (Steve Agee/Sylvester Stallone), Weasel (Sean Gunn) and, surprisingly, Peacemaker are the sextet who make it out alive.",
    "It\u2019s the latter two of that group, though, who have the biggest questions surrounding them, and this is where The Suicide Squad\u2019s post-credits scenes come into play.",
    "Yes. In fact, there are two \u2013 one immediately after The Suicide Squad\u2019s title card appears, and one once the credits have rolled.",
    "The first concerns Weasel. Presumed dead after it seemingly drowned before the beach assault, Weasel coughs up some sea water and awakens to find itself alone on the shore. Unaware of the events that have just played out, and with no way of getting off the island, Weasel heads into the nearby jungle \u2013 presumably to live out its days as a Corto Maltese urban myth.",
    "If The Suicide Squad\u2019s first end credits scene is meant to be slightly humorous, its second could set up an intriguing future for one DCEU production.",
    "John Economos (Steve Agee) and Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), two of Waller\u2019s aides, arrive at an unknown hospital and are led to a particular patient\u2019s room by a doctor. The camera pans around to show who is in the room\u2019s hospital bed \u2013 and it\u2019s none other than Peacemaker.",
    "It\u2019s a surprise to see Peacemaker alive. Having killed Flag, Peacemaker realizes that Ratcatcher 2 watched him murder their former teammate in cold blood. The hard drive, meanwhile, was tossed to the ground in the ensuing melee \u2013 and Ratcatcher 2 now has it in her possession.",
    "A chase ensues as Peacemaker tries to retrieve the evidence and he eventually corners his prey. Despite her pleas not to shoot, Peacemaker draws his weapon to kill Ratcatcher 2, but Bloodsport shows up in the nick of time.",
    "The duo exchange fire, but it\u2019s Bloodsport that lands a telling long-range blow and seemingly kills Peacemaker. Fast-forward to the after credits scene, however, and Peacemaker clearly isn\u2019t dead.",
    "So how does this set up the DCEU\u2019s future? For one, it\u2019s likely that The Suicide Squad\u2019s post-credits scene is setting up events for Peacemaker\u2019s forthcoming TV show, which is due to launch on HBO Max in January 2022.",
    "Billed as a series that will \u201cexplore the origins\u201d of Peacemaker, many fans had been led to believe that the show will be a prequel to The Suicide Squad. While that may still be the case \u2013 we may get flashbacks to how Cena\u2019s character becomes Peacemaker in the first place \u2013 it\u2019s also possible that the TV series will be set after The Suicide Squad.",
    "Given that Agee\u2019s Economos and Holland\u2019s Harcourt will be supporting characters in the show, The Suicide Squad\u2019s post-credits scene is clearly a setup for Peacemaker\u2019s TV show.",
    "The eight-part series has been written and directed by Gunn, too, so it\u2019ll be closely tied to The Suicide Squad regardless of whether it\u2019s a prequel, sequel or a combination of the two.",
    "If Peacemaker survives his next ordeal, we may see him appear in future DCEU movies \u2013 especially any that may star Bloodsport. He\u2019ll want revenge, after all, and that could even set up events for a Suicide Squad sequel. Here\u2019s hoping we get one."
