    "We\u2019re now heading into the AFL\u2019s grand final, with the Melbourne Demons set to face the Western Bulldogs in Perth this Saturday, September 25.",
    "The Melbourne Demons have found stellar success this year and, tonight, they\u2019ll be playing in their first grand final in 21 years. If you want to cast your mind back to when they last won a grand final, you\u2019d have to go back to 1967, some 57 years ago. It\u2019s a long running premiership drought, and it could be broken tonight.",
    "The Western Bulldogs will be looking to spoil that fairytale ending though. They broke their own premiership drought when they won the grand final in 2016, which brought an end to their 62 seasons without the flag.",
    "When the Demons hit the field on Saturday, they\u2019ll only have one man on the squad with grand final playing experience. The Bulldogs will be the more experienced team on the night, with nine players who were part of the grand final win in 2016.",
    "When these two teams last met in round 19, the Bulldogs won 85-65. And before that, in round 11, Melbourne led by 28 points. Now that it\u2019s grand final day, it all comes down to which team wants it more.",
    "The AFL grand final will be broadcast live on free-to-air on Channel 7 and live streamed on 7plus if you\u2019re in Australia. If you\u2019re overseas, there are options for you too. Here\u2019s how you can watch it all unfold to see who takes home the flag.",
    "The only place to catch this year\u2019s grand final live is on Channel 7.",
    "As the Seven Network has broadcast rights to the AFL grand final, you\u2019ll also be able to stream the game live or on demand on the Channel 7\u2019s catch-up app, 7plus. This platform is available on a web browser, and has apps for both Android and iOS.",
    "The grand final decider won\u2019t be available on Fox Footy or Kayo until after the match is finished, where it\u2019ll be aired as a replay.",
    "If you\u2019re a footy fan who happens to be living outside of Australia, New Zealand or the Pacific Islands, don\u2019t worry. You can watch every moment no matter where you are on the Watch AFL streaming service.",
    "For the grand final, Watch AFL has a new streaming option called the Grand Final Pass, which temporarily replaces the monthly plan. It gives customers the ability to watch the grand final live for US$29 / \u00a322 / \u20ac25 / AU$40.",
    "If you\u2019re outside Australia and still want to tune into the matches, you\u2019ll quickly find that online access is geo-blocked. In order to get around that \u2013 and assuming it complies with the Ts & Cs of the broadcaster in question \u2013 you can download and use a VPN.",
    "How to use a VPN:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN: as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location: open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream: so if you\u2019re an Aussie abroad, just head to Kayo and stream like you were back at home"
