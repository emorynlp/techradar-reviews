    "Your PS4 console could be rendered completely useless in the future if its internal clock battery dies. You won\u2019t be able to play any PS4 games on it, regardless of whether they\u2019re digital copies or on disc.",
    "That\u2019s according to trusted hacker, Lance McDonald, who shared the extremely worrying news that PS4 consoles will be nothing more than an expensive paperweight, should the internal system clock die.",
    "But how could this potentially catastrophic oversight prevent the PS4 from playing games? Well, it\u2019s apparently all tied to how trophies work, and more specifically, how the PS4 uses the console\u2019s internal clock to prevent users from manipulating PS4\u2019s trophy system.",
    "As McDonald points out on Twitter, \u201c...Trophies on PS4 require the internal system clock (the one you can\u2019t see / alter) to be correct, so people can\u2019t change their PS4 date/time to make it look like they got trophies earlier than they really did. If your PS4 clock battery dies, all your games die.\u201d",
    "McDonald goes on to say \u201cIf your system clock resets to zero, the only official way to correct it is to connect to the PSN network\u201d, which implies that should Sony decide to do away with PSN in the future, the console will be bricked as you wouldn\u2019t be able to correct the clock by connecting it to the PSN network.",
    "McDonald\u2019s statement was in response to a tweet from Does It Play, an account that\u2019s dedicated to video game preservation. Does It Play stated that when \u201cthe PS4 CMOS battery dies (and it will) it renders all PS4 digital files unusable without a server reconnection and in PS4 it also kills disc playback.\u201d",
    "Replacing the CMOS isn\u2019t too troublesome, apparently, but Does It Play told IGN India the fact the internal clock also affects the PS4\u2019s ability to play discs is concerning. \u201cCMOS can only have it\u2019s time fixed by PSN or hacks,\u201d Does It Play said. \u201cThe fact it kills discs is lunacy.\u201d",
    "McDonald also suggested that Sony could fix this issue with a firmware update, but doesn't see it happening anytime soon, if at all.",
    "The main question is, then, should you be worried? Potentially. The fact that the PS4\u2019s internal clock battery dying could have such dire consequences is definitely worrying, particularly as Sony hasn\u2019t got the best track record when it comes to video game preservation.",
    "The company is reported to be shutting down the PS3, PSP and PS Vita storefronts from July, which means players who own either system won\u2019t be able to purchase new games, DLC or apps; however, they should still be able to download previously purchased content.",
    "If Sony were to pull the plug on PSN down the line, it could render over 100 million PlayStation 4 consoles all but dead. And while that might not seem probable right now, the fact that it\u2019s even a possibility is rather disconcerting.",
    "The PlayStation Network was infamously taken down by hackers in 2011, which resulted in the online service being down for 23 days and thousands of user accounts were compromised.",
    "We\u2019ve reached out to Sony for comment and will update this article should we hear more."
