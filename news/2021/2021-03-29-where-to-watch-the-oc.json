    "When outsider Ryan Atwood is welcomed into the Cohen family, he also enters into a world of wealth and, subsequently, the drama of some of Newport Beach's seemingly most close-knit families. A classic straight from the noughties, get your teen drama fix and find out how to watch The OC.",
    "There isn't a warm-hearted man on earth quite like Sandy Cohen, who takes on his role as Ryan's attorney a little too far, plucking him from his unsettled life in Chino and taking him to his extravagant home to live with wife, Kristen, and awkward son, Seth.",
    "What's more, it doesn't take Ryan long to meet Marissa Cooper - the definition of girl-next-door - sparking a love story for the ages.",
    "Giving the perspective of outsiders looking in as Ryan and Seth become friends and navigate the horrors of being an American teen in high school, The OC packs a lot into its four seasons of pure teenage heartache. From drug use to sexuality and relationships, broken families and loss, it's true that they just don't make teen dramas like they did in the noughties - especially when it comes to cargo pants, flip phones, and a whole lot of angst.",
    "You can now watch The OC in full on HBO Max - but where else can you binge it around the globe? Keep reading to find out.",
    "Unfortunately for those after some Seth Cohen action north of the States, there isn't currently anywhere to stream The OC. However, you can choose to buy it from iTunes for $54.99 or Google Play store $29.99 per season."
