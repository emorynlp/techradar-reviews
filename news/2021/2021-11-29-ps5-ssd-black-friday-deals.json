    "Cyber Monday 2021 is now well under way now that Black Friday has ended, with the annual sales extravaganza extending beyond the last Friday of November every single year. However, several of the best discounts on compatible PS5 SSDs still remain and are running until end of day Cyber Monday or until stock runs out.",
    "PS5 SSD Cyber Monday deals are proving popular now that Sony has unlocked the console's internal SSD bay, allowing users to add more super-fast storage. So if you're running out of space on your PS5's internal drive, which is more than likely now that the console's been on sale for over a year, there's never been a better time to pick up some additional storage.",
    "Some of the best PS5 SSDs such as the Samsung 980 Pro and WD Black SN850 have dropped in price, though most of the best SSD deals we've seen are for drives that require a heatsink to be installed. Supply is clearly a limiting factor, as some of the best SSDs are still sold out or being resold for far higher prices.",
    "Demand for compatible PS5 SSDs will undoubtedly be higher than last year, particularly as more great PS5 games have been released, which means we're expecting NVMe SSDs in particular to be some of the most sought-after PS5 Cyber Monday deals.",
    "We'll be rounding up the very best PS5 SSD Cyber Monday deals below. Make sure you check back soon or bookmark this page so you don\u2019t miss out on any PS5 storage discounts.",
    "Even though Black Friday has ended, many of the best PS5 SSD Black Friday deals are still available and should continue throughout Cyber Monday on November 29.",
    "The selection below includes compatible SSDs for PS5, so you can buy with confidence knowing that the products below are guaranteed to work. Remember, though: Sony recommends buying an SSD with a heatsink, so if you\u2019re buying a stock drive, you may need to purchase a heatsink separately.",
    "We've already seen some early Cyber Monday offers from various retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy, and we're expecting more discounts now Cyber Monday has sort of begun. Amazon is also a great place to grab a deal, as the online giant tends to price match its competitors. We've rounded up a selection of early PS5 SSD Black Friday deals below.",
    "If you're after the best PS5 SSD Cyber Monday deals in the UK, we've rounded up the best UK deals below. Remember, all of these SSDs work on PS5, but some may require a heatsink to be installed.",
    "As we've mentioned, some SSDs need a heatsink installed. This can often work out cheaper than purchasing an SSD with a heatsink built-in by the manufacturer but takes a bit more user input. Here's the best heatsink we recommend for PS5.",
    "With the PS5 continuing to be incredibly popular, it\u2019s likely that demand for compatible SSDs for PlayStation 5 will be high now that Black Friday is here. Black Friday could represent the perfect opportunity to grab a solid state drive on the cheap.",
    "The best PS5 SSD Black Friday deals can be found on 500GB and 1TB capacity drives, though we may see some discounts for 2TB and 4TB versions. Remember, though: the higher the capacity, the more expensive your chosen drive will be \u2013 and NVMe solid state drives tend to be very expensive in general.",
    "The holiday sales event seems to get more popular every year, and according to data from Adobe, $9 billion online sales happened on Black Friday alone. Ecommerce sales between November and December reached an eye-watering $188 billion, which tells us that whatever product you\u2019re after during Black Friday, millions of others will have their hearts set on it too.",
    "We saw several price cuts on PS5 SSDs, with the two most popular capacities being 500GB and 1TB. Demand has scuppered some of the best deals as they sold out fast.",
    "Trusted brands such as Seagate, Samsung, WD_Black and Western Digital all had PS5 SSD Black Friday deals, so you can buy with confidence should you see any offers that take your fancy.",
    "Sony has outlined a very specific set of requirements that compatible SSDs must follow to work on PS5. From the dimensions of the drive to its overall read speeds, you need to ensure that any NVMe M.2 SSD meets the specs listed below. Of course, we\u2019ll only be including compatible SSDs in this roundup, so you needn\u2019t worry about the technical side of things.",
    "Note: You can store PS5 games and PS4 games on an external drive, but to play PS5 games you\u2019ll need to copy it over to your PlayStation 5\u2019s internal SSD storage. Here's how to upgrade PS5 internal storage.",
    "If you\u2019re looking to upgrade your PlayStation 5\u2019s storage, we also rounded up the best Black Friday PS5 external drive deals so you could make an awesome saving. There was a wide variety of external drive deals on Black Friday, and they're a great option if you have a library of PS4 games you still want to play, but don't want to sacrifice any space on the PS5's internal storage.",
    "If you're still searching where to buy a PS5, you're not the only one. Sony's console continues to remain extremely hard to find as demand is still outstripping supply, even though the PlayStation 5 has been out for almost a year. Some retailers did have PS5 restocks last year, and sold a limited amount of consoles as part of their Black Friday sales. However, we only saw a few retailers offering PS5 consoles on November 26. UK shoppers may have a bit more luck finding a PS5 before Christmas at least, as Sony is air-lifting in more stock to help retailers meet demand."
