    "With Apple Silicon now available in most of the consumer Macs, it only made sense to see exclusive features arrive to the M1 line for macOS, which is happening sooner than you may think.",
    "It looks like macOS Monterey, which was recently announced at WWDC, is more of a refinement this year, bringing many useful features that almost makes it seem that it\u2019s preparing for the rumored prosumer Macs, such as the MacBook Pro and iMac Pro lines, which could come with an updated M1X/M2 chip.",
    "This could be why we\u2019re already seeing exclusive features on Monterey that will only appear on M1 Macs and not on your Intel Mac.",
    "There\u2019s already a few exclusive features that may tempt you to upgrade to an M1 Mac earlier than you were planning to, especially where FaceTime and Spatial Audio is concerned:",
    "Apple\u2019s next version of macOS is scheduled to release towards the end of this year. There\u2019s currently a developer beta available, but that requires a developer account. However, there will be a public beta in July if you wish to try it out.",
    "As past releases have gone, there\u2019s going to be updates to the beta versions as we near the final release, so some features may change or even disappear. While the above features aren\u2019t likely to change for M1 Macs, we may see new features appear if new Macs with M1X/M2 chips are indeed on the way.",
