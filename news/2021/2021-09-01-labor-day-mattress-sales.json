    "The Labor Day mattress sales have officially started. There are hundreds of deals to choose between today, with big offers from popular sleep brands including Nectar, Purple and Tempur-Pedic competing with discounts from heavyweight retailers, such as Macy's and Bed, Bath and Beyond. We've searched through them all, and rounded up the very best Labor Day mattress sales here to help you bag the biggest bargain.",
    "The best Labor Day mattress sale comes from Nectar. With $400 off every Nectar mattress - plus $399-worth of free gifts added to your order (luxury pillows, a mattress protector and sheet set) it's a tough offer to beat, dropping the price of a queen-size from $1,298 to $899. All Nectar's memory foam mattresses come with a year's risk-free trial, too, and a forever warranty. No other mattress deal comes close for value for money.",
    "If you have a little more to spend, or prefer an innerspring mattress, we recommend the luxury Saatva Classic. We think it's the best mattress you can buy, and the company has continued its usual discount for Labor Day: save $200 when you spend over $950.",
    "But there are plenty of Labor Day mattress deals to browse today. Whether you're looking for the cushioning support of memory foam, the bounce of springs, a cooling hybrid option, or an ultra-durable and sustainable choice like organic latex, we've got you covered. Here's our pick of the best Labor Day mattress sales today.",
    "Buying a mattress online is probably easier than you think, if you've never done it before - and it's likely cheaper too. Increased competition online has led to lower prices for consumers. Plus, many brands have been able to save money by choosing not to have physical stores and have instead invested in better quality materials, so you often get more for your cash when you buy online too.",
    "To help you find exactly the right mattress, all the top brands now offer long, risk-free sleep trials so you can test them properly (and safely) by sleeping on them in your own home. Most of them come with free deliveries and returns, too - all of which makes buying online an easier, quicker and more reliable way of ending up with the right mattress than spending five minutes testing one in a showroom.",
    "Here are five things to look for when buying a mattress online.",
    "1. Choose a mattress with at least a 60-night trial The only way to know whether a mattress is right is to sleep on it. That's why most top brands now offer a risk-free trial, and promise to collect the mattress and give you a full refund if you don't like it (as long as it isn't damaged).",
    "We've made sure all the mattresses in our Memorial Day mattress sale round-up come with at least a 60-night trial - the majority come with 100-nights, and some, such as Nectar, give you an entire year to decide whether you like it.",
    "2. Check for free returns As part of the risk-free trial, most brands offer a full refund and free returns if you decide the mattress isn't right for you. However, some do charge a fee for collection, around $75, so check the policy first.",
    "3. Read third-party T&Cs We usually recommend buying your mattress directly from the manufacturer so that you can make the most of generous sleep trial and warranties. You're more likely to get a better deal from the manufacturer too, with competitive discounts and free gifts often added to your order.",
    "However, sometimes a third-party retailer can run a deal that makes it slightly cheaper than buying through the manufacturer. If you're looking for the cheapest price possible, this can be a good way to get it - however bear in mind that you may not receive the same trial or warranty benefits if you buy from a retailer such as Amazon, so always read the T&Cs carefully first.",
    "4. Ensure it's the right size with the elbow test Do the elbow test to work out what size mattress you need. Lie back with your hands behind your head. If you share a bed, your elbows should be able to extend without touching your side of the bed or your partner's elbow; if you don't share a bed, your elbows should be able to extend without touch either side of the bed.",
    "5. Try a new mattress for three weeks It can take up to 21 days for your body to adjust to a new mattress. So even if it isn't comfortable initially and you wake up with aches and pains, stick with it - particularly if your body is used to sleeping on a much older mattress. If after three weeks you still don't like it, then you know it's because it isn't right - rather than because your body still hasn't readjusted from sleeping on a less supportive or different mattress."
