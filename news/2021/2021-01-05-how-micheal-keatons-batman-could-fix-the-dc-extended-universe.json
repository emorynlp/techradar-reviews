    "If you\u2019re a fan of Batman\u2019s silver screen adventures, you almost certainly fall into one of two camps \u2013 those that are fans of Christian Bale\u2019s gritty and grounded Bruce Wayne, and those that prefer Michael Keaton\u2019s gothic take on the Caped Crusader. There\u2019s a third camp for anyone who favors Val Kilmer, George Clooney or Ben \u2018Batfleck\u2019 Affleck, but that\u2019s a camp for idiots.",
    "Fans of the Keaton / Tim Burton era of the Gotham Knight may finally be spotting a bat signal in the sky that they like the look of again. According to DC Films boss Walter Hamada, Michael Keaton is returning as Batman in the 2022 movie The Flash, almost 30 years after hanging up the cowl following 1992\u2019s Batman Returns.",
    "This is potentially great news, not only because Keaton is perhaps the finest Bruce Wayne that cinema has ever seen, but for the potential ramifications an older Batman could have on the wider DC cinematic universe.",
    "Here\u2019s how that could work, and why you should be excited.",
    "Staring Ezra Miller (and teased in the Justice League film), The Flash is essentially a comic book take on the Back to the Future concept \u2013 Barry \u2018The Flash\u2019 Allen uses his powers to travel back in time to prevent the murder of his mother, but in doing so creates an all-new DC timeline.",
    "In the world of comic books, DC used this so-called \u2018Flashpoint\u2019 event to wipe the slate clean of its timeline continuity, kicking off the DC\u2019s \u2018New 52\u2019 universe \u2013 a jumping-on point for readers who couldn\u2019t keep up with the mounting decades\u2019 worth of comic book lore.",
    "It\u2019s here where Micheal Keaton\u2019s Batman will make an appearance, likely as an older mentor-like figure in the same vein as Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Nick Fury in the rival Marvel cinematic universe. Though in the original Flashpoint comic, the older Batman character was Thomas Wayne, rather than Bruce.",
    "Such a continuity-shaking event would give ample room for new creative directions for the DC Extended Universe, which, despite box-office success from the likes of Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, hadn\u2019t glued cohesively together by the time the Justice League team-up movie debuted.",
    "A Flashpoint cinematic event, creating alternate universes for these characters to exist in, allows for the in-universe justification of smashing these characters (and in-contract actors) together with a degree of plausibility. Keaton can coexist alongside Pattinson, while a potentially-returning Henry Caville-shaped Superman could appear with them, as could Jason Mamoa\u2019s well-received (and very bankable) Aquaman and Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman.",
    "Keaton\u2019s Batman could be offered a new lease of life too \u2013 an older Batman would allow for live action takes on Batman Beyond (where Wayne mentors a younger breed of Batfolk), or even a Dark Knight Returns adaptation \u2013 often considered the finest of Bat tales.",
    "And then there are the unfinished threads of Tim Burton\u2019s Batman films themselves. What happened to Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s Selina Kyle? What if Billy Dee Williams\u2019 Harvey Dent had made the transformation to Two-Face? The possibilities are near endless, and Keaton\u2019s return would allow a very messy DC slate to be wiped clean."
