    "We're just hours away until Prime Day deals expire. Before the clock clicks down to the end of Amazon Prime Day for another year, there are two drone savings worth considering. The highly-rated DJI Mavic Mini and DJI OM 4 - Handheld 3-Axis Smartphone Gimbal Stabilizer are available at great prices for a limited time.",
    "As we noted in our recent review, the \"Mavic Mini remains one of the best beginner-friendly drones you can buy. It's since been succeeded by the 4K-shooting DJI Mini 2, but the Mavic Mini otherwise offers a very competitive blend of portability, image quality, price, and convenience. It weighs no more than five golf balls, lasts a solid 30 minutes in the air, and fits into a large jacket pocket when folded down. Only that lack of 4K video and object-tracking powers show its age.\"",
    "Also highly recommended, the DJI OM 4 offers a unique way to capture smooth cinematic video using your smartphone and its built-in magnets, which attach using a gimbal arm. Innovative features like DynamicZoom use advanced algorithms, so all you have to do is tap and walk. With the interesting \u201cHitchcock effect,\u201d you can deliver a Hollywood feel with minimal effort.",
    "Looking for more? With Gesture Control, you can take a selfie or group photos with terrific ease. ActiveTrack 3.0 locks onto subjects for improved image composition."
