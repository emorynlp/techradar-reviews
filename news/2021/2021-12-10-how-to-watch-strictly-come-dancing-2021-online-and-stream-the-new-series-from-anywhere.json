    "Now down to just four couples, this Saturday our celebrities will be dancing not one but two routines in this weekend's live shows as the semi-finals arrive at Elstree Studios. Well and truly putting AJ, Rose, John, and Rhys through their paces, it's all to play dance for with very few steps between our couples and seeing who will raise that Strictly Glitterball above their heads. Tune into the semi-final this week and make sure you know how to watch Strictly Come Dancing online live and on-demand for free in the UK and abroad.",
    "It's Strictly tradition that, as we creep closer to the final of Strictly, more challenges are thrown at our line-up of celebrities. In this week's semi-final, our couples will have to learn double the amount of steps with two routines to perform each.",
    "The bookie's favourite, Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice will be performing an Argentine Tango and a waltz. The latter will be danced to Ellie Goulding's 'How Long Will I Love You'. Meanwhile, the highest scorer of this year's competition, John Waite, will be performing a Chive to Coldplay's 'Higher Power' and their Couple's Choice with partner Johannes Radebe.",
    "TV presenter AJ Odudu and her Strictly Pro Kai Widdrington will be juggling a Latin and ballroom number - the rumba and quickstep - to songs 'Show Me Heaven' and 'Sing, Sing, Sing'.",
    "Lastly, Rhys Stephenson, a children's TV presenter, is performing a Samba to the dulcet tones of Michael Buble's 'It Had Better Be Tonight' and a tango to 'One Vision' by Queen.",
    "But who will be scoring a 10, and which three couples will win their place in the 2021 Strictly Final? Find out how to tune in and watch Strictly Come Dancing online below.",
    "For anyone abroad right now who still wants to experience the glitz and glam of Strictly, you might struggle from outside of the UK. But don't let geo-restrictions come between you and your weekly fix of ballroom dancing.",
    "Simply downloading and installing a VPN to your device will let you watch Strictly Come Dancing on the BBC iPlayer from anywhere. A VPN effectively tricks your device into thinking it's in another location by changing the IP address to elsewhere in the world.",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to watch Strictly Come Dancing",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - we recommend ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location i.e. UK for iPlayer",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - in this case, head to the BBC iPlayer",
    "Although the country is well on its way back to normality (touch wood), the Strictly producers aren't taking any risks and have Covid-19 measures in place again in 2021.",
    "This time around anyone working on the show will be tested weekly and professional dancers will bubble up with their celebrities like last year.",
    "The group numbers for the series have already been filmed and there will be no group chats with Claudia and Tess, with couples sat in the audience instead, which will also be of limited numbers.",
    "The shortened isolation period after a positive test from fourteen days to ten should help the show to run smoother. Last year a positive test meant that the first same-sex couple on the show, Nicola Adams and Katya Jones, had to leave the competition early. However, the new rules should allow anyone that does test positive to miss a single week of live shows rather than end their time in the ballroom entirely.",
    "The Strcitly Come Dancing spin off show, It Takes Two, will return this month to curb that Strictly fever between live shows. The show will be back every weeknight to give you all of the behind the scenes exclusives.",
    "You can tune in to Strictly: It Takes Two on BBC Two at 6.30pm BST Monday to Friday. The half an hour show kicks off on Monday September 27 and will air for the duration of Strictly Come Dancing 2021. Remember, you can watch free on the iPlayer live or on demand.",
    "After a ten year stint on the show, Zoe Ball won't be returning in 2021. But fear not, the tea time show is in safe hands, with Ball's co-presenter, Rylan Clark-Neal, and long established professional dancer, Janette Marara, taking over presenting duties on It Takes Two this year.",
    "The sideshow is usually packed with training footage, interviews, opinions from the judges and much more, so for unseen behind the scenes extras, it's worth tuning in."
