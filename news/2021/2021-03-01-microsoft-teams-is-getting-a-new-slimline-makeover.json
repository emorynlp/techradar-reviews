    "There will soon be a whole new version of Microsoft Teams as the company looks to make its popular video conferencing tool available on more devices than ever.",

    "The news comes shortly after Microsoft revealed a range of other upgrades for Teams as it looks to make the service available for users everywhere.",
    "This includes a new update that means the Microsoft Teams gallery layout will now display attendees with active video feeds only, pushing meeting attendees off-screen if they have not activated their webcam.",
