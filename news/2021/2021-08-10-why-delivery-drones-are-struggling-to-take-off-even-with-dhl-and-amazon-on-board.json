    "Delivery drones have long been thought of as a reasonable next step towards humanity\u2019s robot-filled future. Not quite as ambitious as flying cars but leagues ahead of the humble mailman, cargo-carrying quadcopters once seemed an inevitable extension of the impressive aerial tech we\u2019ve seen from the likes of DJI and Sony.",
    "But not all forward-looking concepts are destined for lift-off. Drone delivery projects from industry heavyweights including UPS and Amazon are struggling to get off the ground \u2013 and analysts have told us why these airborne couriers aren't likely to replace their ground-based equivalents anytime soon.",
    "DHL, for instance \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest mail networks \u2013 has now officially abandoned its Parcelcopter delivery drone project, eight years after the multi-billion dollar company first began developing the technology.",
    "Reports from Germany (via DroneDJ) suggest the international delivery service no longer intends to manufacture its own drones nor continue testing its Parcelcopter in any capacity, just weeks after Amazon announced a similar shuttering of its equivalent program, Prime Air, in the UK. So why are drones failing to become our aerial couriers?",
    "The Parcelcopter was first launched by DHL in 2013, and was, back then, basically a prototype quadcopter capable of carrying small parcels up to one kilometre. In the years since, the company modified the drone to fly faster, for longer and increased its cargo capacity with every iteration \u2013 though the last prototype came in 2018.",
    "It never reached a commercially-viable state, either, and DHL has now branded the whole enterprise an \u201cimpressive proof of concept\u201d within a drone industry awash with \u201cunrealistic hype.\u201d",
    "Unlike DHL, Amazon hasn\u2019t yet hammered the last nail in the coffin of its Prime Air project \u2013 despite the stripping back of its UK operations, the company remains committed to getting the service off the ground \u2013 though insiders recently told Wired that the whole program is \u201ccollapsing inwards.\u201d",
    "But that doesn\u2019t mean years of research and development by companies like DHL and Amazon should go to waste. Sure, it seems prudent to acknowledge the difficult realities facing a future of drone-based deliveries \u2013 security, safety and practicality among them \u2013 though that same development can (and perhaps should) now be totally re-directed towards more practical applications of the technology.",
    "The Parcelcopter\u2019s last rodeo, for example, saw DHL partner with sustainable development agency GIZ and drone-maker Wingcopter to deliver medical supplies to remote regions of east Africa.",
    "That\u2019s certainly a more useful application of DHL\u2019s delivery drones, and big-hitters like Amazon have the capacity to follow suit and accelerate this more practical approach even further.",
    "TechRadar spoke to David Benowitz, Head of Research at Drone Analyst, who told us of the warped public perceptions surrounding this still-developing technology.",
    "\u201cWe have seen drones for last mile deliveries dominate the public perception of what drones can achieve in the commercial space for years now,\u201d Benowitz says, \u201cdating all the way back to when [Jeff] Bezos initially claimed Amazon would provide drone deliveries by 2019. While we have certainly seen some advancements in this space, the regulations lag behind and existing delivery networks have gotten more sophisticated.",
    "\u201cI don't expect drone deliveries to never happen,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut they may only play a big role where it is economically beneficial to use them. In the meantime, it's important for the world to know just how much work drones are doing in fields like public safety, infrastructure inspections, agriculture mapping and spraying, and so much more.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s clear, then, that a market exists for these drones in industries other than logistics and postal delivery, with the current networks in place for the latter, as Benowitz puts it, already fit for purpose.",
    "Lukas Schroth, Senior Market Analyst at Drone Industry Insights, shares Benowitz\u2019s skepticism. \u201cIn my opinion, the near future for drone deliveries in urban areas, especially for consumer goods, does not look that bright,\u201d he told TechRadar. \u201cThere is still a lot to be done, especially in terms of legislation, but the lack of infrastructure and social acceptance are also major challenges.\u201d",
    "That idea of social acceptance is an important one. Does anybody actually want flying delivery drones? It\u2019s unlikely that many would be comfortable with the technology in its current state, especially given the adequacy of existing hand-delivery systems. Save for the occasional launched-over-the-fence package, delivery companies are, for the most part, impressively efficient.",
    "In 2021, drone deliveries remain a pipe dream. Not only has the technology failed to come far enough since DHL\u2019s early efforts and Bezos\u2019 2019 promise, but the very concept is neither practical nor wholly desirable.",
    "The question of whether we see more drones roaming the skies in the near future is altogether larger \u2013 but they certainly won\u2019t be delivering Christmas presents any time soon."
