    "Chairman and CEO of Proofpoint, Gary Steele explained in a press release how the deal is a testament to its successes over the past few years with 2020 marking a high point for the company, saying:",
    "\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testament to the strength of Proofpoint\u2019s people-centric approach to cybersecurity and compliance and underscores our important role preventing, defending and responding to today\u2019s threats. We have made tremendous strides in expanding the sophistication and scale of our offerings, and in 2020 we generated more than $1 billion in annual revenue \u2013 making Proofpoint the first SaaS-based cybersecurity and compliance company to reach that milestone.\u201d",
