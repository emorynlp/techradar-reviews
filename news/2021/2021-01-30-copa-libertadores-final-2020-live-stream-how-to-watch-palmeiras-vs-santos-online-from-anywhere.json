It's a fixture that never disappoints, so follow our guide as we explain how to get a Palmeiras vs Santos live stream and watch the Copa Libertadores Final online right now.",
    "Considering their domestic dominance, Palmeiras have traditionally underperformed in this competition, having reached the final four times and captured la Copa just once, back in 1999.",
    "Santos have enjoyed far more success, having been crowned champions three times, and a win today would make them Brazil's most successful Copa Libertadores club.",
    "Abel Ferreira's men have cruised through most of the competition, but they came close to throwing away a 3-0 first-leg lead in the semis, just about managing to hold on as River Plate threatened to complete a remarkable turnaround. Cuca's team, on the other hand, have grown stronger as the Copa Libertadores has progressed, and made easy work of Boca, in a game that will be remembered for a beautiful strike from Yeferson Soteldo.",
