    "The DJI OM 5 is the latest version of DJI's popular smartphone gimbal \u2013 but while the new model brings new features like full-blown selfie-stick powers, it's not quite the five-star success we saw with the DJI OM 4. (Looking to jump to our in-depth verdict? Head to our full DJI OM 5 review).",
    "Despite being smaller and lighter than its predecessors (it weighs 290g, compared to the 390g DJI OM 4), the DJI OM 5 packs in a built-in extension rod that extends out to 215mm. So while it isn't the world's longest selfie stick, it does crucially come with three-axis gimbal stabilization to help keep your smartphone videos smooth.",
    "To further help with this, the OM 5 also comes with a newly-designed magnetic phone clamp, which now goes over smartphone cases and is compatible with more phone models than its predecessor. There's also now an optional Fill Light Phone Clamp ($59 / \u00a342 / AU$79), which has two built-in LED strips to give your videos a boost in high-contrast situations.",
    "The final two improvements over the DJI OM 4 are a new ShotGuides feature and improved ActiveTrack 4.0 autofocus in the app.",
    "ShotGuides walks you through capturing stylized clips thanks to its 30 sets of shooting tutorials, which includes auto-edits. We found this to be useful option for newbies, but even more useful is the boosted ActiveTrack 4.0 \u2013 this now supports tracking at up to 3x zoom, and our review found it to be a \"clearly an improvement over past generations\".",
    "Not all of the DJI OM 5's changes are a huge success, though, and some may find the DJI OM 4 to be more than enough for their video needs. For example, the OM 5's battery is significantly smaller than its predecessor's, so only lasts half as long on a full charge (6.4 hours, compared to the OM 4's 15 hours). And, unlike the OM 4, you can't use the OM 5 as a portable battery bank for other devices.",
    "Also, the fact that the OM 5's gimbal needs to work when it's in both selfie-stick mode (with the arm extended) and traditional gimbal mode means it rotates differently to the OM 4. If you don't see yourself ever using the extended selfie-stick functionality, you might find the OM 4 has more flexibility in its 'roll' movements.",
    "Still, if you do want a smartphone gimbal that does have that extended reach, our DJI OM 5 review found it to be the best option around. You can buy it now in either Sunset White or Athens Gray for $159 / \u00a3139 / AU$239, while the Fill Light Phone Clamp is available for an extra $59 / \u00a342 / AU$79.",
    "The DJI OM 5 is an example of what happens when a product hits peak evolution, but needs to deliver a sequel anyway \u2013 it's better in some ways than the OM 4, but not in others. And that means it isn't necessarily the best choice for everyone.",
    "If you do like to shoot a lot of videos at arm's length, rather than placing a smartphone gimbal on a flat surface with a mini tripod, then our review found the DJI OM 5 to be the best choice around, and superior to the more affordable Zhiyun Smooth X.",
    "The OM 5 brings an elegant design, much-improved ActiveTrack 4.0 autofocus tracking in the app, and lots of flexibility thanks to that extending arm. It's also impressively small and light, fitting into a large jacket pocket.",
    "But the flipside of those design changes is some reduced functionality, and an inferior battery life compared to the DJI OM 4. The OM 5 still lasts over six hours on a charge, but the OM 4 runs far longer at 15 hours, and also doubles up as a USB power bank for other gadgets.",
    "Previous DJI Osmo Mobile gimbals also match the OM 5's level of stabilization \u2013 and if you don't like the idea of having a magnetic attachment living on your phone, you may prefer an older DJI OM 3 or Zhiyun Smooth X.",
    "According to DJI, the DJI OM 4 \"will remain on sale but won't be manufactured anymore\", so it could be worth picking one of those up if you see a discount. But if you do need that extra reach of the DJI OM 5's extending arm, then it's the best gimbal-stabilized option around, even with that price premium over its rivals."
