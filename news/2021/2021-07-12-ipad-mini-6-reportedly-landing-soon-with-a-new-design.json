    "A few different sources have now suggested that the iPad mini range will be getting a redesign with the iPad mini 6 this year, and we\u2019ve now heard the same again, along with an agreement on the likely release window.",
    "In Bloomberg\u2019s Power On newsletter, Mark Gurman (who has a great track record for Apple information), claimed \u2013 according to 9to5Mac - that the iPad mini 6 will have a similar design to the iPad Air (2020), meaning no home button and presumably thinner bezels.",
    "Gurman reportedly described this as \u201cthe biggest redesign in the nine-year history\u201d of the iPad mini range, and added that it will also include the latest processor. It\u2019s not clear exactly what Gurman means by that, since we\u2019d be surprised if it has the M1 chipset found in the iPad Pro (2021) range, but perhaps it will have the A14 Bionic chipset of the iPhone 12 range and the iPad Air (2020).",
    "Finally, Gurman apparently said that the iPad mini 6 \u201cshould be a go\u201d for a release this \u201cfall\u201d (likely meaning September, October or November).",
    "This is all in line with what we\u2019ve heard before from multiple sources, so it\u2019s likely the case, and with Gurman reiterating these rumors now it seems nothing has changed on the design or release date front since those previous leaks.",
    "Of course, we still can\u2019t be certain of any of this, but it seems very likely that a redesigned iPad mini will be out before the end of the year. That\u2019s good news for fans of Apple\u2019s smaller slates, as the iPad mini 5 landed all the way back in March 2019, and it wasn\u2019t as much of an upgrade as this sounds like it will be."
