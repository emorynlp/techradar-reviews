    "More than two years on from his last fight, Adrien Broner steps into the ring for a comeback bout that few had seen coming. 'The Problem' has spent much of the past two years living up to his nickname, and needs to perform against the little-known Jovenie Santiago if he's to avoid going down in the history books as little more than a Floyd Mayweather tribute act. Read on as we explain how to watch a Broner vs Santiago live stream right now and catch all the boxing action online from anywhere in the world now.",
    "It's been quite a downfall for Broner, once ranked amongst the best pound for pound boxers in the world, but with two defeats and a draw from his last three bouts. The most recent of those was a defeat to Manny Pacquiao by unanimous decision at the MGM Grand in January 2019 - a world away from the Mohegan Sun Arena.",
    "But, regardless of whether you think he deserves it or not, he's now got a chance to resurrect his image. In the opposite corner is undefeated Puerto Rican boxer Jovenie Santiago, who like Broner is also 31.",
    "This is the first time 'El Lobito' (The Wolf) has fought in the US, and though he's relatively unknown he has good pedigree, boasting a 14-0-1 record, with 10 of those victories coming by knockout.",
    "It looks set to be yet another blockbuster night in the life of Adrien Broner, so follow our guide below to catch the comeback fight on Saturday - here's how to watch Adrien Broner vs Jovenie Santiago online and get a Broner vs Santiago live stream from anywhere.",
    "Yes - in the US the fight is being shown on Showtime, but you can get access to the channel via a free trial with subscription streaming service Sling TV.",
    "In other parts of the world you have to pay, but unlike many other boxing events, which tend to be eye-wateringly expensive PPV affairs, you can get the fight dirt cheap.",
    "If you're abroad and discover that your usual coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that does is showing the fight.",
    "The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Adrien Broner vs Jovanie Santiago anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "The Adrien Broner vs Jovanie Santiago fight takes place on Saturday, February 20 at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut.",
    "The night's main card is set to get underway at 9pm ET/ 6pm PT in the US and 2am GMT, 1pm AEDT in the UK and Australia respectively.",

    "Broner vs Santiago ring walk times",
    "Once one of the biggest draws in boxing, Adrien Broner had a reputation for being just as brilliant inside the ropes as he was a trouble-maker outside them.",
    "The 31-year-old was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and turned professional in May 2008, after a stellar 300-19 amateur career.",
    "Broner's peak years spanned 2011-2016, during which he held world titles in four weight classes, including the WBO Super Featherweight title, WBC Lightweight Title, WBA Welterweight title, and WBA Light Welterweight title.",
    "But since then, a multitude of issues in his personal life have coincided with a steady decline in the ring, and Broner has won just one of his past four fights, beating Adr\u00edan Granados in February 2017 - four years ago.",
    "He comes into tonight's fight with a 33-4-1 record, with 24 of his victories by knockout.",
    "Born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, six months after Broner, Jovanie Santiago turned professional a year before his opponent, but has fought 23 fewer fights.",
    "He has a near-perfect record of 14-0-1, with 10 knockout victories, and will be looking to make his mark in the US, where he's fighting for the first time.",
    "Though Broner is the favourite, it's Santiago who has the height and reach advantage, but can he make them count?",
    "Alongside the intriguing main event, there's also a strong supporting card featuring former heavyweight world champion contender Dominic Brezeale, who's looking to bounce back from a chastening defeat at the hands of Deontay Wilder.",
    "It was only the second loss of a professional career that's spanned nearly 10 years, but it was a humiliating one, with the American hitting the canvas in the first round.",
