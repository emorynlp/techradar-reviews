  "article": [
    "Writer and producer Craig Mazin has confirmed that HBO\u2019s upcoming The Last of Us TV show will have a 10-episode first season.",
    "The news comes from a comment made by Mazin during a recent appearance on the Scriptnotes podcast (good spot, Culture Crave), where he also confirmed that there are only two directors left to be announced for the hotly-anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's iconic PS3 game.",
    "We already know Jasmila Zbanic, Ali Abbasi and Kantemir Balagov will be directing episodes, and that Chernobyl director Johan Renck was forced to pull out of helming the pilot due to scheduling conflicts. Both Mazin and co-writer Neil Druckmann will also be serving as executive producers on the show.",
    "Given that HBO-series episodes tend to run about an hour long, it\u2019s fair to assume that season one of The Last of Us TV show will tell its tale in around 10 hours. As for what that length tells us about its plot? Well, not all that much.",
    "We still don\u2019t know whether the series will mirror the plot of the first game in its entirety, or whether it will combine the stories of both the original and The Last of Us 2 across multiple seasons.",
    "The series will also \u201cdeviate greatly\u201d from the source material in some episodes, according to showrunner Druckmann, but only in terms of its focus on drama over hardcore action. He also revealed that, for himself and co-writer Mazin, the \u201cphilosophical underpinnings of the story\u201c were the essential aspects they wanted to get right with the adaptation.",
    "Troy Baker, voice actor for main character Joel in the games, has provided a vague window of \u201cthree [or] four seasons\u201d being necessary to match the story beats of the original at an appropriate pace \u2013 rather than constraining its plot to a rushed single season.",
    "HBO has also made passing reference to \"future seasons\" beyond an initial first season, though any continuations are likely to depend on the success of season one.",
    "Beyond this recent confirmation of its initial episode-count, though, the only other concrete details we\u2019ve got so far regarding The Last of Us TV show revolve around its cast.",
    "Bella Ramsey, who starred in Game of Thrones, is set to play Ellie, while Joel will be portrayed by fellow Game of Thrones actor-turned Mandalorian Pedro Pascal.",
    "We know Tess (Joel's partner of sorts), Marlene (a member of the Fireflies), Riley (a childhood friend and romantic interest of Ellie), and Maria (wife of Joel's younger brother) are all going to be part of the show, too, though we haven\u2019t yet had casting details for every character.",
    "Merle Dandridge will play Maria in the series, while Gabriel Luna will also star as Tommy, Joel's younger brother. Joel's daughter, Sarah, has also been cast \u2013 she will be played by newcomer Nico Parker.",
    "As for its release date, all we know is The Last of Us TV show is \"coming soon to HBO\" \u2013 though early 2022 seems the most likely arrival time.",
