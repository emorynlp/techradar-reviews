    "Spoilers for the first four episodes of Loki follow. Watch them first before reading this, and don't miss the Loki episode 4 post-credits scene.",
    "Once upon a time, it was easy to tell the comic book superheroes from the villains they thwarted. Sure, the good guys usually had some minor flaws to deal with, but there was never any question that the likes of Superman, Spider-Man, Wonder Woman and their counterparts fought on the side of the angels.",
    "In recent years, however, the lines between good and bad have become more blurred \u2013 Batman overstepping numerous moral boundaries in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy; Iron Man and Captain America becoming enemies in Civil War \u2013 but you could still (nearly) always tell them apart.",
    "Loki is different. The late, great Obi-Wan Kenobi once said that \u201cmany of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view,\u201d and \u2018The Nexus Event\u2019 feels like it\u2019s been built around that principle. It\u2019s the culmination of four episodes where almost every major character has flirted with being hero and villain, sometimes even in the same scene. It\u2019s also fun and clever, and comes with some killer twists at the end \u2013 but more on that later\u2026",
    "One of the fundamental ideas behind Loki\u2019s fourth outing is that one small piece of information can completely alter the way you view a character. Indeed, while on one level the episode\u2019s title refers to a key scene on Lamentis-1, it\u2019s also a handy catch-all term for a succession of life-changing revelations.",
    "Last week\u2019s bombshell that every TVA agent is a Variant plucked out of their own timeline proves particularly pivotal. For the no-nonsense Hunter B-15, it means a glimpse at an existence where she was \u201chappy\u201d and reason to question everything she takes for granted. In the case of the unfortunate Hunter C-20, meanwhile, impact is more tragic, as we gradually learn that her knowledge of a past life frightened the TVA management so much that they had her eliminated.",
    "For Sylvie herself, the perception shift comes courtesy of a flashback to her childhood on Asgard. As soon as we learn she was abducted from her home as a kid (by Ravonna Renslayer, no less), she instantly shifts from antagonist to victim. Subsequent revelations that she spent her childhood on the run, growing up leaping from apocalypse to apocalypse, humanize her further, making sure you sympathize with her mission to take down the TVA 100 per cent.",
    "Now we\u2019ve established they\u2019re (probably) on the same side, Loki and Sylvie\u2019s relationship has moved to another level \u2013 there\u2019s even a hint of unlikely romance. This is undeniably weird, yet feels appropriate for a character as unashamedly narcissistic as the god of mischief \u2013 who else could win a Loki\u2019s heart but a Loki?",
    "When their shared \u2018moment\u2019 on the doomed world of Lamentis-1 creates the eponymous Nexus Event that allows the TVA to find them, the episode skirts perilously close to the \u2018love is a powerful force\u2019 trope that\u2019s become a sci-fi clich\u00e9 everywhere from Interstellar to Doctor Who. It works here, however, because it\u2019s played for laughs, the writing team totally embracing the ridiculousness of the situation. Kudos also to the underplayed nature of their rescue.",
    "But the real star of the episode is undoubtedly Owen Wilson\u2019s Mobius. Seeing him verbally sparring with Loki once again, you realize just how much episode 3 missed the TVA\u2019s biggest jet-ski aficionado \u2013 there\u2019s no question his relationship with the god of mischief is now one of Marvel\u2019s greatest double-acts.",
    "Initially hurt by Loki\u2019s betrayal at the Roxxcart superstore (\u201cYou\u2019re just kind of an asshole, and a bad friend\u201d), Mobius quickly turns the tables by throwing the Asgardian into an ingenious Groundhog Day-inspired prison, where he\u2019s forced to relive an awkward moment with Lady Sif again and again and again \u2013 a fun surprise cameo from Jaimie Alexander, reprising her role from the Thor movies.",
    "What this big reveal means for the show \u2013 and the MCU as a whole \u2013 is anyone\u2019s guess, but it\u2019s an intriguing twist in a series that\u2019s proved masterful at giving you key information at exactly the right time. And if Loki survived his own pruning, maybe there\u2019s hope that his new pal Mobius is still out there too\u2026",
    "But as Mobius gradually starts to process Loki\u2019s claims about the TVA\u2019s questionable recruitment policies, he turns detective. What really happened to C-20? Why does Sylvie \u201cscare the hell\u201d out of Renslayer? And why do the Time-Keepers want to witness Sylvie\u2019s \u201cpruning\u201d for themselves? We eventually see a new side to the lifelong company man, as he steals his boss\u2019s TemPad, and decides to join Team Loki.",
    "Unfortunately for Mobius, we don\u2019t get to find out if the alliance could have grown into a beautiful friendship, thanks to his Renslayer-sanctioned pruning in the series\u2019 biggest shock moment so far. He didn\u2019t even stick around long enough to see B-15 turn hero by freeing Loki and Sylvie, or witness the MCU\u2019s answer to the \u2018what\u2019s behind the curtain?\u2019 reveal in The Wizard of Oz when the Time-Keepers turn out to be robot fakes. He also missed Loki being vaporized in an epic final battle.",
    "If there\u2019s one thing the MCU has taught us, however, it\u2019s that a Loki rarely stays dead for long. Here it\u2019s mere minutes before his survival is confirmed, as a surprise scene in the closing credits shows him on the surface of a new world, face-to-face with three (maybe four\u2026) alternative Loki Variants.",
    "\u201cIs this Hel? Am I dead?\u201d he asks.",
    "\u201cNot yet. But you will be unless you come with us,\u201d comes the cryptic reply from a man dressed like the comic book version of Loki.",
    "Verdict:",
    "After episode 3 attracted entirely justified comparisons with Doctor Who, this week\u2019s instalment of Loki shifts gears once again, ensuring that the most predictable thing about the show is its unpredictability.",
    "While early episodes established Sylvie as the villain of the piece, the title of \u2018antagonist in chief\u2019 now seemingly belongs to Ravonna Renslayer \u2013 especially now the Time-Keepers have been revealed as a sham. The question is, is she working alone, or is some higher power pulling the strings? If so, how much will Renslayer divulge to Sylvie?",
    "Just like WandaVision earlier this year, Loki revels in making you question what you think you know about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, its rules may be shifting before our very eyes as episode 4 takes the show in a whole new direction.",
    "\u201cI think episodes 4 and 5 [are my favorites],\u201d star Tom Hiddleston told theoriesbyt. \u201cThe two of them together, the whole series takes off in a direction that I certainly didn\u2019t see coming when I read it, and I\u2019m really excited for the audience to see it. That\u2019s where we just expand into new territory.\u201d",
    "We can\u2019t wait to find out what he means\u2026",
    "New episodes of Loki debut on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
