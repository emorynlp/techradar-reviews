    "If you\u2019re here, then you have likely run into that very unfortunate circumstance where despite running an antivirus (well, hopefully), you\u2019ve realized that malware is on your PC \u2013 or perhaps you merely suspect that\u2019s the case. Either way, that\u2019s obviously not a comfortable situation.",
    "Alternatively, you may just be curious about how to remove malware just in case this scenario crops up at some point in your computing life. It can happen to the best of us, after all.",
    "If you think that you are suffering from a malware infection, don\u2019t panic... help is at hand, and you have options for dealing with this worrying situation. In this article, we\u2019re going to cover what you need to do to attempt to rescue your system, so you can get right on with applying the cure, with the best option generally being malware removal software.",
    "If you know that malware is on your system, or think it might be \u2013 perhaps your PC is now running very sluggishly for apparently no reason, or weird and inexplicable things are happening, or maybe you\u2019re being spammed with pop-ups \u2013 the first question we\u2019d ask is do you have an antivirus app installed? If not, and you don\u2019t want antivirus on your system \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 then you should get yourself a dedicated malware removal tool.",
    "You\u2019ll first need to install a piece of malware removal software on your PC (assuming you don\u2019t already have one present). Our top recommendation for this job is Malwarebytes, which you can find at the official website here with products for Windows PCs and Macs. Running Malwarebytes or software like it for on-demand scans - either alone or alongside your antivirus - will immediately give you better defences against murky malware.",
    "Head to the main menu of Malwarebytes, and simply click on the \u2018Scan\u2019 button, sit back and watch as the files (plus memory, registry, and so forth) on your PC are fully vetted.",
    "If there is malware on your system, Malwarebytes \u2013 or whichever tool is your preferred option \u2013 will use its in-depth detective powers to hopefully locate it, and having done so, neutralize the threat.",
    "If you don\u2019t run an antivirus, you really should seriously consider installing one - at least on Windows systems. Remember, there\u2019s always the next-to-no-effort step of turning Microsoft Defender back on (which delivers solid enough protection these days). Mac users may not be in quite the same boat, with a more secure (and less threatened) OS, but it\u2019s still worth thinking about an antivirus for Mac.",
    "If you do have an antivirus installed, as a first step, it\u2019s worth going into that application and firing up a virus scan manually. Before doing that, though, make sure the antivirus has got the latest malware definitions (there should be an option to \u2018update\u2019 via the main menu, so run that).",
    "Now, before scanning, for Windows users it\u2019s worth rebooting sand starting in \u2018Safe Mode\u2019 to stand the best chance of uncovering any threat. We\u2019ve got a full guide on how to start Windows 10 in safe mode. So follow those steps and boot without networking as you don\u2019t want to be online when attempting to find malware and if you suspect your PC might be infected then it\u2019s probably best to remain offline as much as you can full-stop - that should disrupt any attempts malware may make to communicate or propagate further.",
    "When in Safe Mode, head to your antivirus and start a virus scan, making sure it\u2019s a \u2018full\u2019 scan (of all installed drives, including every option turned on, such as scanning compressed files) \u2013 and not just a \u2018quick\u2019 scan \u2013 to see if that finds anything. The antivirus may now discover and quarantine (box away safely) or otherwise remove any threat that exists on your system, and if that happens \u2013 great, breathe a sigh of relief.",
    "Of course, the antivirus app\u2019s real-time protection should have stopped the malware from getting a foothold on your system in the first place. However, antivirus software isn\u2019t infallible \u2013 particularly some of the less high-quality offerings out there (stick to our recommend best antivirus recommendations) \u2013 and more sophisticated malware can slip through the net, evading real-time protection, and perhaps also hiding under the radar during the aforementioned full virus scan.",
    "So, if your antivirus has come up empty-handed after the scan, it\u2019s now time to probe your system even more thoroughly. Try repeating the above process of running a full scan in Safe Mode.",
    "Otherwise, the next step is to enlist the help of a dedicated anti-malware which is different to antivirus in that it specializes in detecting more sophisticated threats (based on their behavior) and fully removing them once discovered."
