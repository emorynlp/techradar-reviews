  "article": [
    "After pushback, OnlyFans has suspended its planned ban on sexually-explicit content, which was set to occur on October 1.",
    "OnlyFans announced the decision via Twitter, explaining that the company had \u201csecured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community.\u201d",
    "Presumably, the company is referring to assurances from financial institutions (banks and payment providers) \u2013 when OnlyFans previously announced that it had changed its policies to ban sexually explicit material, it did so \u201cto comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers,\u201d according to an official statement.",
    "In a recent Financial Times article, OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely laid the blame squarely on banking: \u201c\u201cThe change in policy, we had no choice \u2014 the short answer is banks.\u201d He cited increased roadblocks from financial institutions, which claimed reputational risk in permitting such services and made it harder for payments to go to creators.",
    "Stokely rejected that providers like Mastercard or investor pressure were to blame, as suggested in the initial Bloomberg report laying out the potential reasons behind OnlyFans\u2019 decision."
