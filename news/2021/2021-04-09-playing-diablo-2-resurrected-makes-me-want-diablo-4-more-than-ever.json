  "article": [
    "Click. Kill. Loot. Repeat. It\u2019s good to be back, adventuring among the demon-filled fields of Old Tristram in Diablo 2: Resurrected. But revisiting these familiar blood-soaked caverns and crumbling ruins made me long for what\u2019s coming next with Diablo 4, more than anything else.",
    "The classic action-RPG (ARPG), which first released way back in 2000, is back this weekend in its remastered form as developer Blizzard puts the game through its paces in a \u201ctechnical alpha\u201d stress-test for a select number of players. Those able to access the test will be able to play through two acts of the campaign (in single-player only), and have access to three of the final seven character classes \u2013 the Barbarian, Amazon and the Sorceress.",
    "It\u2019s a generous chunk of game to show off, considering there\u2019s still no release date for the re-release beyond a rough \u201c2021\u201d window. I've been slashing my way through its fantasy killing fields and, while it's as addictive as it ever was under its new lick of paint, it has made the wait for Diablo 4 all the more unbearable.",
    "For the uninitiated, Diablo 2 was / is the daddy of ARPG titles. You take a lowly hero, click-to-kill thousands of demonic baddies, loot them of their gear to amass a better arsenal of weapons and armor, and upgrade your characters' skills, moves and stats to allow you to take on even more ghastly beasts. It has become the basis for many competitors (Torchlight, Path of Exile) and inspired a whole genre in itself, spawning looter-shooters like Borderlands, Destiny and Outriders.",
    "Diablo 2 is still incredibly addictive \u2013 so much so that the game has retained a hardcore player base for the past two decades. And everything that made Diablo 2 so special remains intact for Resurrected \u2013 this is an incredibly faithful remaster, playing almost identically to the original with just a few small modernization tweaks.",
    "These include auto-collecting gold (which can be toggled on and off), and a well-considered gamepad control option \u2013 partly inspired by the sequel, Diablo 3, and actually my preferred way to play Resurrected, as it allows easier access to your range of skills, individually mapped to face buttons. Otherwise, everything from the 8-way character direction movement to the harsher-than-you-remembered inventory management remains the same as it did many moons ago.",
    "So what has changed? There\u2019s 7.1 remastered audio, a shared item stash for your characters, cross progression with the eventual console releases, a new modding system, the benefits of modern Battle.net integration and some features not quite ready for this alpha release \u2013 including all-new cutscenes and accessibility features including a colorblind option.",
    "But the biggie, as you might have expected, is a completely overhauled 4K facelift for the game\u2019s graphics. With the push of the \u2018G\u2019 button, you\u2019ll swap from the low-res pixel graphics of the original release, to a brand new 3D rendering of Diablo 2, complete with dynamic lighting effects and detailed character models.",
    "It\u2019s really nicely done. We\u2019ve seen similar instant-remake-visual transitions happen before (the Halo remasters being the perfect example), and being able to swap to and fro on the fly shows you how far we\u2019ve come in the 20 years since the original release. You\u2019ll now see believable shadows cast by light sources, shiny and reflective puddles, and really nasty-looking monster skins, from the blood red Fallen to the furry shag of the Gargantuan Beasts. It\u2019s all in keeping with the original vision of the game \u2013 dark, gothic and moody.",
    "It\u2019s perhaps a bit more realistic, which could be jarring for veteran players. Like a good book brought to life on the screen, the space for imagination between those crude pixels of the original game might not quite match up with the fully-realized characters of Resurrected.",
    "I\u2019ve played a nice chunk of the first act of Diablo 2: Resurrected, and it\u2019s been a blast so far. Despite being a technical alpha, it\u2019s stable to play, with no major bugs, and all the elements that are available to try right now work just fine. It\u2019s like climbing into a comfy bed that\u2019s just had fresh sheets put on it \u2013 it\u2019ll be hard to go back to the legacy version of Diablo 2 after this, preserving everything that was great about the original, while touching up some pain points that have endured over the years.",
    "And yet, more than anything, playing Diablo 2: Resurrected has made me all the more desperate to get my hands on Diablo 4. I know it has its detractors, but I\u2019m a big fan of Diablo 3, and have spent my time with that successive game more than Diablo 2 in recent years. I was surprised how many little features I\u2019d grown to take for granted from Diablo 3 that were missing from Diablo 2: \u2018Massacre\u2019 killstreak multipliers, quick-view loot stats, destructible environments, action-oriented dodges on the console versions, a full range of motion beyond the 8-way directions \u2013 and that\u2019s just off the top of my head. It had a difficult launch, but Diablo 3 over the years has grown into a stonking dungeon crawler.",
    "So my longing for something brand new is now greater than ever \u2013 something that takes the learnings of Diablo 3, and wraps that in the gothic, gory atmosphere that made Diablo 2 so imitable and inviting. And, from what we\u2019ve heard about and seen so far from Diablo 4, that\u2019s exactly what it will be, bringing open-world mechanics, slick visuals and always-online drop-in-and-out multiplayer on top of all the modern advancements the series has built up over Diablo 3's lifespan.",
    "Diablo 2: Resurrected shows just how rich the heritage of this series is, and feels like it's well worth investing in for fans craving a fresh(ish) Diablo hit. Now we just can\u2019t wait to see what comes next."
