    "LG has just unveiled the pricing and availability for its 2021 OLED TV lineup, including the flagship C1 OLED and G1 OLED models.",
    "Pricing for the LG C1 OLED, the replacement to last year\u2019s LG CX OLED, starts at $1,799 for the 55-inch OLED55C1PUB which will be available by the end of March and reaches up to $5,999 for the monstrous new 83-inch version, which is due out in May. Pricing for the UK has yet to be announced.",
    "For the LG G1 OLED, the replacement to last year's LG GX OLED, you\u2019re looking at $2,199 for the 55-inch model (OLED55G1PUA) that's available in April; the $2,999 65-inch OLED65G1PUA will be available by the end of March.",
    "If you\u2019re looking to spend even less on an LG OLED this year, the company says its new entry-level A1 OLED series will be available starting in April for $1,599 with the 55-inch OLED55A1PUA, and will drop down to just $1,299 when the 48-inch OLED48A1PUA comes out in June.",
    "Some of the TVs are pretty pricey, sure, but considering that the LG A1 OLED will start at just $1,299 and only go down in price as we creep toward Black Friday 2021, these prices are much better than previous years' models.",
