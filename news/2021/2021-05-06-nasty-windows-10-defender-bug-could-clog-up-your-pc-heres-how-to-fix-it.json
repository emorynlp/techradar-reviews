    "After a bug from Microsoft\u2019s anti-virus application for Windows 10 caused thousands of files to fill up space on many hard drives, there has now been a fix to alleviate this anxiety-induced incident.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s Defender software has had its ups and downs since its debut in 2008, originally appearing to help the once-lacklustre security of Windows XP. In recent years though, it\u2019s become a much stronger contender in scanning your PC for any unwanted spyware and viruses.",
    "However, this recent bug will do no favors to new users looking for anti-virus software, but now that there\u2019s a fix and hard drives are claiming back space, it will hopefully be quickly forgotten.",
    "Recently, issues were reported on forums and Reddit, detailing users\u2019 plight on thousands of files appearing out of nowhere. These would eventually appear so much that users would have next to no space on their main hard drives.",
    "Users would try to delete the files as fast as they appeared, but they would duplicate over a short period of time, rendering their PC unusable due to there being no space on the hard drive.",
    "These files would appear in the \u2018Windows Defender\u2019 folder, found in the \u2018Program Data\u2019 folder.",
    "To fix this issue, make sure to go to \u2018Windows Update\u2019, found in \u2018Settings\u2019, and see if there is an update available for \u2018Microsoft Defender\u2019.",
    "Once update \u20181.1.18100.6\u2019 has been installed, the bug will be fixed.",
    "However, while the fix has put a stop to the duplication, the files are still there. To remove them, you need to do the following:",

    "Once the fix has been installed and the files have been deleted, Microsoft Defender will work as intended.",
