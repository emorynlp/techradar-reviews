    "Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles have been on sale for a few months now but it seems that there are still some new platform updates to look forward to if a recent interview with Xbox\u2019s director of program management, Jason Ronald, is anything to go by.",
    "Speaking with Larry Hryb, Major Nelson, on the official Xbox podcast about his team\u2019s plans for the future, Ronald said that when it comes to the Xbox platform, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of really exciting things that are coming down the pipeline over the coming months and over the coming years\u201d, adding that \u201cAt launch, we say it all the time internally, this is really just the beginning.\u201d",
    "Although the exact nature of these \u201cexciting things\u201d wasn\u2019t revealed, Ronald did say that he and his team are \u201cpartnering really closely with key game developers from all across the industry to really take full advantage of all the next-gen capabilities that we put in the Xbox Series X and Series S.",
    "\u201cWe really are excited as we get further into the year and closer to this holiday to start sharing more of the details about what\u2019s in development, and how you can really take advantage of these next-gen platforms.\u201d",
    "It seems that some of these updates will at least be revealed in the near future as Hryb said that Ronald would be back on the podcast \u201csooner rather than later\u201d and that there would be some \u201cenhancement news coming soon\u201d.",
    "Ronald has previously confirmed on his Twitter that players would be hearing more about previously announced backwards compatibility enhancements like improved frame rates in 2021, so it\u2019s possible that some of this news that\u2019s coming soon could be related to that, though we can\u2019t know for sure.",
    "As well as long-term plans for the future, in the interview Ronald touched on some of the more immediate quality of life improvements that his team is working on now that users have the consoles in their hands and are providing feedback.",
    "He mentioned a focus, for example, on getting the \u201cquick resume experience on all the titles that people are playing\u201d after it was disabled on some titles at launch. Ronald also mentioned responding to reports of controller disconnects and making improvements to broadcasting and sharing, as well as upcoming updates for the Xbox mobile app to bring in missing features like Achievements.",
    "Of course, getting your hands on an Xbox Series X at the moment isn\u2019t the easiest thing in the world. After a successful launch, stock has been hard to come by and Microsoft has warned that stock could be constrained for a little while longer. At TechRadar we\u2019re keeping an eye on where you can get your hands on the console so keep checking back if you\u2019re still on the hunt.",
