    "The Best Buy Black Friday sale is underway with hundreds of products already on sale. We've cast our eyes across all the early deals to bring you some of the very best right here so do have a browse below. You'll find everything exciting from the world of tech, including TVs, laptops, cell phones, Chromebooks, headphones, iPads and air fryers.",
    "Remember, too, that the listed offers available from this date will be under the Best Buy Black Friday Price Guarantee, which promises that prices on these items will not drop lower before November 26. You can be sure an item is included by keeping an eye out for the 'Black Friday Prices Guaranteed' label above the price on the store page.",
    "If this isn't enough for you, Best Buy has also announced that its full Black Friday sale will officially begin on November 19 \u2013 a whole week before the day itself. Expect even more reductions from then.",
    "That's just some of the headline offers available right now in Best Buy's first wave of Black Friday deals. We'll add more standouts as and when we come across them, but there are hundreds to go through! Remember, too, that over the coming weeks you'll be able to find many more of the highlights in our round-up of this year's Best Buy Black Friday deals as the sale continues.",
    "We're seeing multiple retailers picking up speed now, as we've recently had some news on this year's Walmart Black Friday deals as well. Meanwhile, the Epic Amazon Deals promotion is set to continue for the next two weeks as a prelude to the Amazon Black Friday deals event in November.",
    "Cautious about pulling the trigger too early on a Black Friday deal this October just in case a better reduction is made available over the coming weeks? Best Buy is calming those fears with its Black Friday Price Guarantee.",
    "Detailed in Best Buy's latest announcement, it promises that any products featured in the sale from October 19 will not go any lower in price before Black Friday. If for some reason, they do, you'll be able to reclaim the difference back. For My Best Buy and Best Buy Totaltech members, the process is simple and you'll be automatically refunded. Others will need to contact Best Buy customer care or pop into a store to show their receipt and you'll be reimbursed the difference through the retailer's Price Match Guarantee.",
    "It's important to stress that this guarantee only applies up to Black Friday - not including. So, if a product in the early sale is reduced even further on November 26 you won't be able to claim the difference back. However, you do ensure you get your most wanted items as early as possible \u2013 something highly encouraged this year with the ongoing global supply chain issues."
