    "LG\u2019s OLED TVs range continues to lead the market when it comes to showcasing the advantages of OLED panel technology. With truly impressive images, aided by deep blacks, vivid colors and an infinite contrast ratio, it\u2019s little wonder that more and more people are choosing OLED.",
    "The release of this year\u2019s new LG C1 OLED (a successor to last year\u2019s popular LG CX) and G1 Gallery Series OLED (which manages to up the brightness, thanks to a new OLED evo panel structure) is likely to only consolidate LG\u2019s reputation as the forefront of OLED televisions too \u2013 while gaming overlays, low input lag, and extensive HDMI 2.1 support make it a great option for those planning to plug in new home consoles like the PS5.",
    "There is one area where the LG OLED TV range appears to lag behind its competitors, though \u2013 and that\u2019s audio.",
    "The primary consideration for any TV purchase should be its picture. How crisp is the 4K resolution, how bright are the highlights, how smooth is the motion, how impactful is the HDR? A TV that excels in everything except the picture quality, after all, isn\u2019t really a television anyone would recommend.",
    "But we are getting to a point where several big-name TV manufacturers are offering exceptional picture quality in their sets, and they\u2019re having to look to other, secondary considerations to really mark themselves out from the crowd.",
    "This is something we mused on back in January, with TV makers seemingly focusing their 2021 ranges on gaming features (post-launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X) as well as sound and ambiance, rather than upgrades to picture quality.",
    "A representative for Panasonic went so far as to say that \u201cWe\u2019ve got to a level where there\u2019s really not very much more we can do [to the picture]. It\u2019s so good, and it\u2019s only going to be incremental improvements at this point \u2013 that's why we\u2019ve shifted our focus to the feature set, say with gamers, and I think you\u2019ll be surprised with how much that\u2019s been improved.\u201d",
    "Panasonic\u2019s OLED range has long stood out in the world of TV audio, largely offering similar picture quality across mid-price and high-end models but varying the total volume and complexity of the speaker system. Last year\u2019s Panasonic HZ2000 offered 140W of Dolby Atmos audio and upward-firing speakers, while the HZ1000 made do with a less 30W. This year\u2019s JZ2000 flagship takes things further with side-firing speakers for more dynamic, all-directions sound, even as it drops total audio output to 125W (though, let\u2019s be honest, no one was going up to 140W anyway).",
    "Samsung had a similar realization a couple of years back after a 2019 QLED TV range that skimped on its audio offering. The company went on to create its OTS (Object Tracking Sound) audio system, and its flagship QLED and Neo QLED sets now ship with OTS+ (a 10-driver speaker system with side-firing audio) that drastically ups the immersion and verticality of the system\u2019s sound, while its mid-spec models make do with a more basic OTS system. Samsung's cheap QLEDs, like the Q60A, offer a software solution known as OTS Lite. These systems aren't perfect \u2013 they don't offer Dolby Atmos, for one, presumably because of the proprietary arrangement of Samsung's OTS drivers \u2013 but they do show evolution in the Samsung TV range.",
    "Even if Sony\u2019s Acoustic Surface Audio technology is somewhat divisive, literally shaking the panel of its screens to emit (often vague and muddied) sound, it certainly shows a TV maker looking to experiment in new technologies and offering something different from the rest of the market.",
    "Suffice to say, though, that LG isn't taking the same route.",
    "The LG 2021 TV range shows that not much has changed in terms of built-in audio capability, with the same 40W Dolby Atmos speakers across the LG B1 OLED, LG C1 OLED, and LG G1 OLED \u2013 while the entry-level LG A1 makes do with 20W instead.",
    "Given the hugely varying price points of these models \u2013 last year\u2019s B Series model launched at $1,399 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,995 for a 55-inch size, while the new G Series costs $2,200 / \u00a31,999 (around AU$3,000) for the same size \u2013 it\u2019s surprising not to see any variation in the audio output. Our reviews for the LG C1 and LG G1 so far have also shown that one major complaint from LG\u2019s 2020 models \u2013 namely, lack of clarity in the bass, which was also an issue with the company's high-end SN11RG soundbar \u2013 hasn\u2019t been amended either.",
    "That\u2019s not to say LG hasn\u2019t been hard at work on other things, such as its upgraded a9 Gen 4 AI processor, new Game Optimizer settings, and creation of its entry-level A1 OLED.",
    "There is some headway being made on the software side, too, with LG's AI Sound Pro processing technique \"identifies voices, effects and frequencies so it can then optimize the sound by genre for a more immersive experience\". But the underlying hardware, output and arrangement is yet to see the kind of evolution seen at other TV brands.",
    "We can't shake the feeling that built-in sound has become a second consideration for LG, meaning those looking for a well-rounded sensory experience or all-in-one home cinema screen won\u2019t find it with the company at the moment.",
    "There are ways around this, of course. A step-up soundbar or Dolby Atmos speaker would help matters, and broad support of eARC (enhanced audio return channel) on the best LG TVs means that lossless audio passthrough is much very possible. If you have an existing sound system you\u2019re happy with, you\u2019ll be well placed to upgrade your television with something from the LG OLED range.",
    "Today\u2019s televisions are increasingly beginning to offer entire home theater systems in and of themselves, though, or at least in one model in a TV maker\u2019s premium range \u2013 on that front, LG could do more."
