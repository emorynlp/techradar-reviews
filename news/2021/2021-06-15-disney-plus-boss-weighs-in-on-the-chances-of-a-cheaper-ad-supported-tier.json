    "Disney CEO Bob Chapek has responded to questions surrounding the potential introduction of advertisements on Disney Plus \u2013 and things don\u2019t look to be changing any time soon.",
    "Speaking at a Q&A session with Credit Suisse, Chapek spoke of the company\u2019s satisfaction with the streamer\u2019s current subscription model, and dismissed suggestions that a cheaper, ad-supported tier of Disney Plus would arrive in the near future.",
    "Chapek\u2019s comments come as HBO recently released a more affordable subscription package for its HBO Max service, joining the likes of Paramount Plus, Disney's own Hulu and Peacock, which also offer ad-supported tiers.",
    "When asked whether ads might ever find their way onto Disney Plus, Chapek said: \u201cwe won\u2019t limit ourselves and say no to anything, but right now we have no such plans for that.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re always reevaluating how we go-to-market across the world, but [...] we\u2019re happy with the models that we\u2019ve got,\u201d the Disney boss added.",
    "At $11.99 / \u00a37.99 / AU$11.99 per month, the streaming service is already one of the cheaper options on the market right now \u2013 for comparison, HBO Max\u2019s standard tier costs $14.99 per month, while its recently-introduced cheaper tier brings that price down to $9.99.",
    "Disney Plus is also providing a sizable chunk of the entertainment giant\u2019s revenue, which doesn\u2019t suggest a need to change a winning formula.",
    "\u201c40% of our sales this year were actually in streaming and digital,\u201d Chapek said, \u201cwhich I think speaks to the nature of how this business is rapidly changing, and obviously we\u2019re well positioned to do that as the business continues to evolve.\u201d",
    "The streamer hasn\u2019t wanted for quality content of late, either. The arrival of original Marvel shows like Loki and movies with concurrent theatrical releases like Cruella have ensured Disney Plus has maintained its sense of exclusivity two years on from its initial launch in 2019.",
    "The company\u2019s release of the Star catalogue outside the US, too, only adds to the streamer\u2019s future prospects, and suggests Disney Plus could, one day, challenge Netflix for the top spot on the streaming shelf.",
    "With all that being said, then, it\u2019s unlikely that Disney Plus will see a shake-up of its subscription model anytime soon. The quality content is arriving thick and fast, and the company\u2019s balance sheet is looking better and better as the streamer\u2019s library continues to grow.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Chapek did reiterate that Disney wouldn\u2019t \u201csay no to anything\u201d \u2013 but we\u2019re betting the House of Mouse is pretty happy with how things are going right now."
