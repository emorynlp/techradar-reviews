    "You\u2019d think the one place that you\u2019d never have a problem using the Apple Card is Apple\u2019s own website, but you\u2019d be wrong, because a number of customers reported problems when trying to use their Apple Cards to buy an iPhone 13.",
    "In many cases this led to them switching to a different card and missing out on the 3% cashback they\u2019d have been eligible for, but Apple is addressing this situation.",
    "MacRumors reports that affected customers have been receiving emails from Apple, which acknowledge the issues and say that the 3% cashback will be provided anyway.",
    "It seems that if you initially attempted to purchase an iPhone 13 with an Apple Card, had it declined, and then successfully purchased it with another payment method, you should get this email.",
    "As for the cashback, that will appear as a Balance Adjustment in the Wallet app, and will also appear on your October monthly statement. Users report that they\u2019re already getting this money credited to their accounts, so if you don\u2019t have it yet you shouldn\u2019t have to wait long.",
    "Apple\u2019s email finishes by saying that if you have any questions you should contact an Apple Card Specialist, which is presumably also what you should do if you haven\u2019t received this email and think you should have.",
    "This was clearly the right thing for Apple to do, and it\u2019s good to see the company making amends. It\u2019s a move that\u2019s also sure to build a lot of goodwill among customers.",
    "Yet some will probably have to wait longer for their iPhone 13 to arrive, since they failed to get payment through fast enough to be in the first batch of orders, so for them this won\u2019t be a complete fix.",
    "There\u2019s also the question of why this happened at all. Even giant companies are fallible of course, but it could shake consumer confidence in the Apple Card. Hopefully things will go more smoothly for the Apple Watch 7, which goes up for pre-order on October 8."
