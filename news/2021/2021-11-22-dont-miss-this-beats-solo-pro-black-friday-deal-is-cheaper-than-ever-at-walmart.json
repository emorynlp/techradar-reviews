    "Looking for a seriously fun pair of headphones? If so, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better pair than with this Beats Solo Pro Black Friday deal, as Walmart has currently discounted the headphones to the cheapest price we've ever seen from the online retailer.",
    "It's currently one of the best US Black Friday 2021 audio deals we've seen, taking the Beats Solo Pro down to just $99. Walmart previously had the headphones available for $149, but they've now been dropped a further $50. That's an astonishing saving considering the Solo Pro headphones usually retail for $299, though we often see the price dip well below that across many retailers.",
    "Among Apple's repertoire, the Beats Solo Pro can often be seen as a cheaper alternative to the AirPods Max. However, we actually prefer the Beats headphones in a number of key areas. Battery life, for one, is staggeringly high, ranging from anywhere between 22 to 40 hours on a single charge based on whether you have features like transparency and active noise cancellation switched on.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "There is a reason why the Beats Solo Pro headphones are so cheap right now. Apple has actually discontinued the product, alongside some other Beats stalwarts, to make room for newer products like the Beats Fit Pro true wireless earbuds. As such, we're now seeing retailers aggressively slash prices in order to sell through old stock, and there's never been a better time to get your hands on one of the best over-ear headphones you can buy.",
    "Interested in other Beats products? You can find all the best deals over at our best Beats Black Friday deals hub, which is constantly being updated with the best discounts from trustworthy retailers. There, you'll also find some of the best true wireless earbuds like the Beats Studio Buds, if over-ears aren't to your liking.",
    "You'll also find Beats products featured in our overall best Black Friday headphones deals, in case you're after a look at the wider scope of headphones deals across both the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals periods.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Beats Solo Pro from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
