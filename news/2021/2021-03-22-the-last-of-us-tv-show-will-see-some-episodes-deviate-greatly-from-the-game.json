    "HBO's The Last of Us TV show will feature episodes that \"deviate greatly \" from The Last of Us game, according to Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann.",
    "In an interview with IGN, Druckmann explained that while dialogue in some episodes of the TV show has been directly lifted from The Last of Us game, other episodes will \u201cdeviate greatly to much better effect because we are dealing with a different medium\u201c.",
    "\u201cFor example, in the game, there\u2019s so much action you have to have to train the player about mechanics,\u201c Druckmann added. \u201cYou have to have more violence and more spectacle to some degree than you would need on a TV show because you don\u2019t need to train people on how to use a gun.",
    "\u201cSo that\u2019s something that\u2019s been really different, and HBO\u2019s been great in pushing us to move away from hardcore action and focus more on the drama of the character. Some of my favorite episodes so far have deviated greatly from the story, and I can\u2019t wait for people to see them.\u201d",
    "In addition, Druckmann also revealed that, for himself and showrunner Craig Mazin, the \u201cphilosophical underpinnings of the story\u201c were the essential aspect they wanted to get right with the adaptation.",
    "\u201cAs far as the superficial things, like should [a character] wear the same plaid shirt or the same red shirt?\u201c he said. \u201cThey might or might not appear in it, that\u2019s way less important to us than getting the core of who these people are and the core of their journey.\u201c",
    "Pre-production for The Last of Us TV show looks to be well underway, with Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal of Game of Thrones fame having been cast in the key roles of Joel and Ellie.",
    "Season 1 of the show is set to follow along with the story of The Last of Us, which came out all the way back in 2013 on PS3, and instantly became a critical hit thanks to its incredible emotive story-telling and grim world. The story follows the journey of Joel and Ellie as they try and survive in a post-apocalyptic world and potentially help save humanity \u2013 and you know it's a good game because we gave it the number one spot in our roundup of the best games of the decade.",
    "HBO still hasn't announced when The Last of Us TV show will release, but we imagine it won't be in 2021, with a 2022 release date potentially looking more likely, given the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on TV and movie production schedules."
