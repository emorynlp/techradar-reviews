    "As the nation locked down amid the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 and physical retail stores felt the repercussions \u2013 85,000 businesses took advantage of online opportunities by building new websites. However, building a new eCommerce website doesn\u2019t instantly attract customers like physical stores get from high street footfall.",
    "Successful websites must navigate similar sales and marketing challenges to their bricks and mortar competitors, plus those in user experience, security and functionality.",
    "So, what are the key considerations for those looking to reap the rewards of a new eCommerce website?",
    "Ecommerce websites naturally entail more complexity than blogs or news platforms. Users must be able to access product descriptions, stock details and images, interact with products and make payments. And all of this must be done securely and intuitively.",
    "So, it\u2019s critical companies invest in a platform with this functionality built in. For some, this will mean building a fresh content management system (CMS) with a team of web developers, while for others, it means integrating an out-of-the-box eCommerce platform.",
    "Either way, businesses must first understand how customers interact with their brand and website at every stage in their buying journey and how they can cater to them.",
    "Another consideration is which other commerce channels the business operates on \u2013 like Amazon or social media pages \u2013 and which eCommerce platforms effortlessly integrate these with the website? Is it possible to customize the checkout experience, and if so, how easy does the platform make it to do so? How simple is it to customize and edit prices, sales and discounts?",
    "Failing to answer these questions in the research stage puts thousands at risk, and leaves businesses open to investing in the wrong platform and having to rectify costly mistakes.",
    "Once this functionality checklist is complete, companies can begin to compare popular platforms like Shopify, Magento and LCN\u2019s Online Shop.",
    "For smaller businesses, these platforms offer the responsiveness and technical support to successfully navigate teething issues. However, for established online retailers looking to migrate to a new website, the additional costs of building a CMS are typically offset by the benefits of scaling their website with custom apps and add-ons.",
    "Unfortunately for online businesses, it\u2019s not just enough to attract customers. To convert and retain these leads, the website experience must be simple, intuitive, and secure.",
    "This is because it takes less than a second for users to form an opinion of a website. If they encounter design issues, can\u2019t find the information they\u2019re after or worry about their data security, they won\u2019t hesitate to leave for a competitor.",
    "Modern consumers don\u2019t want to work for their content and demand their online shopping experience be effortless.",
    "Firstly, businesses must consider website design and content. Websites should be natural for the user to navigate, with comprehensive service and product pages, natural and useful calls to action and intuitive checkout processes.",
    "Using a website builder tool takes the guesswork out of meeting these user needs, providing tried and tested page designs \u2013 from blogs to product pages \u2013 that are speedy, responsive and flexible across all devices.",
    "Users should then be able to pay in a way that suits them. This means offering multiple payment gateway integrations \u2013 including third-party apps like Amazon Pay and Klarna \u2013 for flexibility and convenience.",
    "Those researching eCommerce platforms, like Shopify, should check integration with key payment platforms and third-party apps before committing to them.",
    "Online consumers are increasingly worried about their data when making payments \u2013 especially on new websites. A recent report even suggests three-quarters of businesses have noticed a change in consumer behavior when paying online, with many actively looking for the most secure method.",
    "However, the risks extend beyond the consumer, to businesses too. Studies suggest 44 percent of consumers would stop spending with a brand after a security breach, so it pays to be proactive with website security.",
    "In addition to common phishing scams and malware, there is an increasing number of cyberattacks directly targeting online checkouts.",
    "For example, \u2018e-skimming\u2019 attacks target checkout pages with a string of code to steal payment data. SQL injections allow attackers to interfere with app queries to retrieve confidential data like card details. Cross-site scripting (XSS) similarly attacks vulnerable websites with malicious code to compromise other users\u2019 interactions.",
    "Luckily, building security into a new website is typically safer and more cost-effective than taking a reactive approach \u2013 especially with the looming threats of reputation damage and hefty fines from failing to comply with data protection regulations.",
    "Cybersecurity should be a key consideration at every stage of website design. This should include adding an SSL certificate to new website domains to encrypt the data sent between user and host. Additionally, applying for a Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects websites against XXS and SQL injection by monitoring, filtering and blocking any suspicious interactions with the website."
