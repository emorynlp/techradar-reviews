    "There might be a lot of cheaper options out there, but they don\u2019t compare to the best MacBook for students 2021 has to offer. Of course, a student laptop mustn\u2019t break the bank, but it should also be able to do a few things, which is why Chromebooks are so popular for education.",
    "Still, although MacBooks come at a premium, they\u2019re still worth considering since they have a lot to offer. They are ideal for college students as they are incredibly easy to lug around from class to class, which is no surprise since Apple basically invented thin and light notebooks. They\u2019re also quite capable machines. Whether you end up with a MacBook Pro 13-inch or a MacBook Air, they\u2019ll be more than enough to handle school assignments and projects. They also come with an excellent battery life that will last all day, as well as a seamless user experience thanks to Apple\u2019s rock-solid operating systems, the latest of which is the upcoming macOS Monterey.",
    "And, while there's no getting around Apple\u2019s premium pricing, there are also ways of getting the cost down, whether that means looking at entry-level models, discounted or refurbished ones, or taking advantage of back to school discounts. To help you pick out the right Apple notebook for you, we took power, portability, and price all into consideration to find the most appropriate devices. Here are our top picks",
    "Apple rolled out their much-talked-about M1 silicon chip that\u2019s so far been a real game-changer. And, the first laptop to receive it is the company\u2019s thinnest and lightest, putting it on the list of the most exciting Apple laptops of recent years. With this new chip, the MacBook Air is better than ever, touting excellent performance alongside its brilliant battery life \u2013 without raising the price to keep it (fairly) affordable still. That makes it the best MacBook for students in 2021.",

    "The MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) may not have gotten a massive design overhaul, but what it lacks in that department, it makes up for big-time in performance and battery life. Thanks to Apple\u2019s groundbreaking M1 chip, the new MacBook Pro 13-inch delivers excellent performance and exceptional battery life. Its performance is so impressive, in fact, that it can easily handle 4K - and even 8K - videos. Whether you\u2019re in high school or in college, this is the best MacBook for students if you\u2019re looking for a powerful laptop that keeps things small and lightweight.",

    "Apple\u2019s thinnest and lightest MacBook is back in 2021 with a vengeance. Not only has it fixed a lot of the complaints with its predecessors \u2013 namely, that problematic keyboard is now gone, replaced by a drastically improved keyboard. But it also comes with new and more powerful internal components, even more storage space options, and a lower price of entry. There are a couple of things we\u2019d do better, like the muted screen and the average battery life, but this model of the MacBook Air is better than anything we\u2019ve seen from the line so far. And, it\u2019s definitely among the best MacBooks to date.",

    "The MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020)\u2019s entry-level model may miss out on some of the lineup\u2019s new toys. However, going for the higher-end configurations will get you new (and powerful) Intel processors and improved RAM speeds for better performance, all packed in the 13-inch incredibly svelte body. Apple rounds it all out with that incredible Magic Keyboard from the new 16-inch, finally getting rid of that problematic keyboard. Even if you don\u2019t go for the 10th-generation Intel Core configurations, you might still appreciate the fact that all models come with more storage capacity for the same price as their predecessors. This is the best MacBook for college students right now.",

    "While we are sad that Apple has retired the 15-inch MacBook Pro, we\u2019re more than happy to see the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) hit the shelves. As thin, light and sleek as ever, this doesn\u2019t feel like a 16-inch behemoth. If you\u2019re worried that this was going to be bulky and awkward to use, don\u2019t be. Yet, despite its svelte frame, you\u2019re still getting that extra real estate on that stunning display, as well as the latest and greatest components behind it. Apple then rounds those out with amazing (and loud) speakers and a much, much better keyboard. This is truly the best MacBook for film, design, and photography students.",
