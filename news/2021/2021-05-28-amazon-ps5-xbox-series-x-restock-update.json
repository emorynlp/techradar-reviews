    "Update: If you missed the Amazon PS5 restock, or GameStop PS5 and Xbox Series X restock this week, that means you aren't following our PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider, who will send you alerts \u2013 if you follow his Twitter account and turn on notifications. In the last 24 hours, the big restock news is that a second Amazon PS5 restock almost happened \u2013 and the Xbox Series X was a part of it, too. Sadly, Amazon is confirmed to have had a site-wide glitch, meaning the inventory could be held up for another restock date. If it's truely today, May 28, or another date and time, Matt will send you an alert via Twitter.",
    "Click on the example of a PS5 restock Twitter alert sent by Matt Swider. You'll be able to follow his Twitter account where he tracks both PS5 and Xbox Series X, and you can turn on notifications to receive restock alerts.",
    "There was a second Amazon PS5 and Xbox Series X restock that nearly happened on Thursday at 6pm EDT / 3pm PDT, about 32 hours after the first restock. Technically, only the PS5 Disc was available on Wednesday morning, while the PS5 Digital Edition and Xbox Series X were first-timers last night.",
    "However, no one was able to add these products to their Amazon cart and check out in the end. Update for today, May 28, people still haven't been able to get a console. Instead, they were greeted with an Amazon error message: \"This item cannot be shipped to your selected delivery location. Please choose a different delivery location.\" You could cart the console with various tricks we'll explain below, but you couldn't check out.",
    "At first, this Amazon restock was thought to be a limited regional drop based on the very specific error message. That made sense. However, we soon discovered \u2013 according to Matt Swider's two-thousand Twitter replies \u2013 that no one was able to cart a Microsoft or Sony next-gen console in the US.",
    "According to Amazon customer service support, there was a 'website issue' and both the PS5 and Xbox Series X will be back in stock 'soon'. It's important to note that this error message wasn't just limited to new consoles. We also saw the same problems with the newly announced Sonic Colors Ultimate: Launch Edition pre-order. Amazon refused to deliver it to our address or any address we tried in the US.",
    "The good news is that some Matt Swider Twitter followers were able to get a $40 discount from Amazon customer service reps for their trouble.",
    "Amazon officials also promised to call affected customers who complained once new PS5 and Xbox console inventory went live. That seemingly indicates that the next Amazon PS5 and Xbox Series X restock is imminent. Hence why you should follow PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider for his Twitter restock alerts today.",
    "However, we've also seen customer service chat reps throw out random answers at Walmart, Best Buy and just about every other American retailer. Basically, they're all about telling people what they want to hear. You could probably convince them to tell you there was going to be a PS5 restock today every single day of the week.",
    "In other words, take this news with a grain of salt.",
    "Knowing when the Amazon PS5 and Xbox restock will happen based on our Twitter alerts will get you halfway to buying a next-gen console. The other half requires you to successfully cart the item. To do that, we have some tips.",
    "The 'View List' strategy has been an Amazon trick that's been around for years, and it's become a crucial way to shop for the PS5 and Xbox Series X since their launches in November 2020. It doesn't always work, and some people will still see the infamous 'Amazon dogs' that appear whenever you hit a 'Page Not Found' error (Amazon's version of a 'Sorry' 404 error page), but it's helped thousands of people buy a PS5 or Xbox Series X when others couldn't.",
    "Of course, as we've said during our restock advice, persistence is much more important than speed. Getting to the page quickly after seeing our restock alert usually allows you to have more chances to try to add the PS5 to your cart. But oftentimes people give up too easily before the console is truly out of stock."
