    "If you\u2019re looking for a new comedy series to binge on, you may want to watch Transparent. Created by Joey Soloway, Transparent follows the members of a Los Angeles family after they find out that their parent is a trans woman.",
    "Jeffrey Tambor plays Maura, who comes to terms with her transgender identity late in life. In the opening episode, she comes out to her adult children Sarah, Josh, and Ali, who are played by Amy Landecker, Jay Duplass, and Gaby Hoffmann. Judith Light rounds out the cast as Maura\u2019s ex-wife Shelly. Over the series, Maura adjusts to life as a woman, while the other family members face struggles of their own. Transparent has been praised for its sincere and empathetic depiction of gender identity and for its relatable, likeable characters.",
    "The show ran for four seasons from 2014 to 2017 before returning for an extended finale episode in 2019. This drew an end to the series, so now is as good a time as any to catch up on the whole story. In this article, we\u2019ll explain where you can watch Transparent, whether you\u2019re in the US, UK, Canada, or Australia.",
    "In the US and Canada, Season 1 of Transparent is available to buy from Google Play. In the US, Season 1 costs $18.99, and in Canada, you must pay $2.99 per episode.",
    "However, Prime Video is the only place Seasons 2 to 5 are available, and it\u2019s unlikely this will change. And, in the UK and Australia, Prime Video is the only place you can watch any episodes of Transparent.",
    "If you find yourself abroad in a country but want to watch Amazon Prime as if you were at home, that's probably down to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Thankfully, help is at hand. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite show no matter where you are, simply by changing your IP address to one that's back in your country of residence. Here's how to get started with this essential bit of streaming software.",
