    "Samsung's latest 2021 QLED TVs are receiving huge price cuts right now at Best Buy. The offers are, quite possibly, the biggest discounts we'll see this side of Black Friday.",
    "Best Buy's OLED TV deals start with the excellent Samsung Q60A, which is on sale for $949.99 (was $1,099) on the 65-inch variant. Even though this one's the 'entry-level' panel from Samsung it's still capable of blowing away most cheap 4K TVs when it comes to overall picture quality. This 2021 model also comes with a few handy upgrades over 2020's Q60T - namely a better color gamut and faster response time.",
    "That response time is particularly good for gaming, although if you've managed to score yourself a PS5 or Xbox Series X we'd recommend the Samsung Q70A for $1,099.99 (was $1,399). This one's got an HDMI 2.1 port and is subsequently capable of a silky-smooth 120Hz refresh rate thanks to its VRR mode.",
    "Finally, you'll also find the stunning Samsung Q80A on sale for $1,299.99 (was $1,699) on its 65-inch model - a whopping $400 discount from release price. While very pricey indeed, this one's the only QLED TV deal on our list to feature an ADR panel - a super high-end display that's capable of an exceptionally bright picture in HDR.",
    "Note - we've included more information on each OLED TV deal just down below, including prices for other sizes. Outside the US? You'll also find the best cheap 4K TV deals in your region.",
    "We've got plenty more options in our weekly best OLED TV deals roundup. Also check out this week's best Amazon deals to find great smart home devices to pair up with these premium displays."
