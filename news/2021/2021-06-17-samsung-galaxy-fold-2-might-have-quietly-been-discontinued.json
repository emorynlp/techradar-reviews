    "Eager for the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3? We might have gotten another sign that its launch is right around the corner \u2013 because you can\u2019t buy its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, from Samsung\u2019s online store.",
    "The online Galaxy Fold 2 listing now just redirects to a mostly-blank page that says \u201cThe Galaxy Fold is no longer available for purchase on Samsung.com, however please take a look at additional options in the Galaxy family.\u201d And as pointed out by Android Police, which first noticed the listing\u2019s disappearance, this means there isn\u2019t a Fold option available to buy on Samsung\u2019s website right now.",
    "What\u2019s more, some US carrier listings for the Galaxy Fold 2 have also seemingly come down \u2013 by Android Police\u2019s estimates, sometime in the last 24 hours, as the Wayback Machine confirms. T-Mobile\u2019s Galaxy Fold 2 listing is down, while Verizon\u2019s listing is available for in-store pickup only. Only AT&T\u2019s listing seems to be buyable online.",
    "For now, you may only be able to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 2 from AT&T or online retailers.",
    "A recent report suggested that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 was entering production already, putting it on track for an August release. While the report suggested only components were being produced, not whole phones, it still suggests the phones are being assembled.",
    "Other leaks point to an August release date \u2013 and while others suggest it could come out as early as July, we\u2019d consider August the more likely date for a Samsung Galaxy Fold 3 launch. It fits Samsung\u2019s typical release window for late-year phone releases given that\u2019s when the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 launched in 2020. Though if we\u2019re going by predecessors, we could expect a September launch, as the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 was released in September 2020."
