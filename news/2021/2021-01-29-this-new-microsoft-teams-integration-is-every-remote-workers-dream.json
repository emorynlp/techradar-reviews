    "The new feature should improve productivity for remote workers, who will now find sharing conversations and email attachments with fellow Teams meeting participants much more straightforward. In addition, a Teams popup window will appear before any content is shared to make sure that the right people have been selected.",
    "The coming Microsoft Teams feature will reciprocate another new addition that the company confirmed earlier this month.",
    "Microsoft announced that Teams users would be able to share a conversation to an Outlook email without having to leave Teams \u2013 making it easier to share information with contacts outside of their team or organization.",
