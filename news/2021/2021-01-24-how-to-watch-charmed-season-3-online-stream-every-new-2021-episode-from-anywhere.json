    "Witchy sisters Macy, Mel, and Maggie, accompanied by their Whitelighter Harry, are back to stop The Faction and prevent the death of all magic. Just as well they\u2019ve got the Power of Three! But could all that be about to change? We detail here how you can watch Charmed season 3 online from anywhere, so you can find out for yourself.",
    "A quick recap if you\u2019ve spent the last decade trapped in another dimension. The original Charmed aired from 1998 to 2006, and starred Shannen Doherty, Rose McGowan, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano. It was rebooted in 2018 by The CW and developed by Jennie Snyder Urman, Jane the Virgin's executive producer.",
    "While the concept of three siblings discovering they\u2019re The Charmed Ones remains, it's gone much further regarding on-screen representation. There\u2019s a more ethnically diverse cast, including Melonie Diaz, Sarah Jeffery, and Madeline Mantock as the trio of Latina sisters, and the series\u2019 first leading LGTBQ+ character in middle-sister Mel.",
    "With season 3 comes even more supernatural drama, including the unproduced episodes of season 2 halted by the pandemic. And it\u2019s going to be epic! Having discovered Julian (Eric Balfour) presiding over a Faction facility full of creatures in suspended animation, the sisters must now unite their allies to help prevent the death of magic. But will the core trio endure? As the trailer implies, with a shot of a tombstone engraved with Melanie\u2019s name\u2026not necessarily!",
