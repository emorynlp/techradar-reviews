  "article": [
    "There\u2019s a new Switch in town, the Nintendo Switch OLED, and it boasts a bigger screen, a vibrant OLED display, and some much-needed quality of life improvements over the original model. But how does it compare to the Nintendo Switch Lite, Nintendo\u2019s handheld-only device that was released in 2019?",
    "We\u2019re going to take a closer look at the Nintendo Switch OLED vs Nintendo Switch Lite in this head-to-head comparison, and hopefully help you decide which of Nintendo\u2019s is right for you, and what the key differences are.",
    "There\u2019s more to consider than merely price alone, as the Nintendo Switch OLED and Nintendo Switch Lite address different consumer needs. However, that doesn\u2019t make the buying decision any more difficult, so let\u2019s compare and contrast the two models, shall we?",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED costs $349.99 / \u00a3309 / AU$539 and launches on October 8, 2021. It\u2019s technically the fourth version of the Nintendo Switch console, as Nintendo refreshed the original model in 2019 with improved battery life and a more efficient CPU, along with the release of the Nintendo Switch Lite.",
    "Speaking of the Switch Lite, Nintendo\u2019s handheld only model costs $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 / AU$329.95 and was released in 2019, which makes the new Switch model $150 more expensive than the Switch Lite.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED looks almost identical to the original Switch console, with removable Joy-Con controllers, the same button layout, and the same Neon Blue and Red color scheme available \u2013 though it also has a classy new White option. The biggest difference is the console\u2019s punchy OLED screen, which is 7 inches compared to the original\u2019s 6.2-inch display, with significantly thinner bezels that give the device a more modern look while barely expanding the console's size and weight.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED\u2019s kickstand has also had an overhaul. It\u2019s wider, more flexible, and lets you position the console at more angles during tabletop mode. The Switch OLED is equipped with better speakers, too, along with 64GB of internal storage \u2013 double the original.",
    "Those who pick up the Nintendo Switch OLED will get access to a nicer-looking dock than the original, which features rounded edges and a built-in ethernet port for providing a more solid connection when playing online. Here\u2019s what\u2019s inside the Nintendo Switch OLED:",
    "The Nintendo Switch Lite is a different proposition. It forgoes the Switch OLED\u2019s hybrid Joy Con-detaching nature in favor of being a handheld-only device, which gives it the enviable perk of being the only Switch with a dedicated D-Pad. You can\u2019t display games on a TV, though, nor can you pop off the Joy-Cons. Its portable focus means it\u2019s smaller in size, with a 5.5-inch display, which is 1.5-inches shorter than the Switch OLED. There\u2019s a wider selection of case colors to choose from over the new Switch as well, including Gray, Turquoise, Yellow, Coral and Blue.",
    "From a technical perspective, the Switch Lite is a match for the Nintendo Switch OLED, however, it doesn\u2019t have as impressive battery life \u2013 averaging three to seven hours as opposed to 4.5 to 9 hours.",
    "Here\u2019s what\u2019s inside the Nintendo Switch Lite:",
    "The good news is that both the Nintendo Switch OLED and Nintendo Switch Lite can play the entire library of Switch games available. Nintendo has noted that experiences with the Toy-Con accessories from the Nintendo Labo series may differ due to the Switch OLED\u2019s larger screen, but that seems to be the only issue.",
    "It\u2019s important to note that the Nintendo Switch Lite won\u2019t let you experience games on the big screen, though, as it's strictly a handheld-only device. You can\u2019t detach the Joy-Con for some multiplayer fun or use motion controls, either, and its LCD screen won\u2019t look as pleasing to the eye as the new OLED display. However, the Switch Lite is considerably cheaper and still a great way to play the latest Switch games.",
    "Another area where the Nintendo Switch OLED has a clear-cut advantage over the Nintendo Switch Lite when it comes to games is that it has 64GB of internal storage as opposed to 32GB. That means if you like to download your games digitally from the Nintendo Switch eShop, you\u2019ll have more room to play with. That being said, you can expand the storage of both Switch consoles thanks to the microSD card slot, which supports up to 2TB compatible cards. These tend to go for cheap, particularly during events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, so it\u2019s a negligible difference.",
    "Nintendo\u2019s updated Switch OLED model will certainly be appealing to newcomers who want the very best Switch experience available, but the Nintendo Switch Lite is still a compelling proposition due to its cheaper price point and its more portable form factor.",
    "While you can\u2019t go wrong with either model, the Switch OLED provides more flexibility, as you can play on the go or on the TV when docked. However, it won\u2019t look any different than the original Switch when playing on the big screen, as Nintendo opted against a 4K output. Where it does shine, though, is in handheld mode thanks to its vibrant and bigger OLED display.",
    "The choice between the two consoles will tend to come down to how you expect to use your Switch. If you can\u2019t picture yourself playing any other way than handheld mode and want a more compact form factor, the Nintendo Switch Lite may be the way to go. If you want to enjoy everything the Switch has to offer, though, including TV mode, handheld and tabletop mode, we\u2019d recommend picking the pricier Nintendo Switch OLED."
