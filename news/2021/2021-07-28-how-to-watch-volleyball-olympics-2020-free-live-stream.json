    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to BBC iPlayer and log-in as usual",
    "That's all there is to it! You'll now be able to watch all the Olympics action just like you would from the comfort of your own sofa.",
    "If you're not in one of these countries, don't worry - the Olympics are being shown in most places around the world, though you might not luck out with free streaming and coverage levels vary considerably by location.",
