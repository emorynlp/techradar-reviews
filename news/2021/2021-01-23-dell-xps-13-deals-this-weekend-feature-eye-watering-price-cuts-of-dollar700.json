    "Over at the official Dell site this weekend is a huge array of excellent Dell XPS 13 deals that could potentially save you up to $700 right now on a range of fantastic ultrabooks.",
    "We've picked out three Dell XPS 13 deals specifically which we think are particularly good buys for those looking to bag one of these awesome laptops. First up is this more entry-level 256GB model for $783.99 (was $1,108.99). Well, we say entry-level model; this machine still packs in a 6-core Intel Core i7 processor - a significantly speedy component that makes this it great value all around.",
    "For a more premium choice, we've picked out this 512GB SSD version for $881.99 (was $1,308.99). Inside this one you're bumping up to a 6-core i7, as well as 16GB of RAM, which means it's a fantastic buy if you're needing a machine that will really keep up when you're putting it through its paces on intensive applications.",
    "Our last pick is this stunning 4K 256GB Touch model for $1,034.99 (was $1,758.99). The main hallmark here is of course the incredible near bezel-less 4K display, which the other entries on our list don't feature. That said, the Intel Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM should keep things running along smoothly as well and that $700 saving is nothing to sniff at.",
    "Whichever Dell XPS 13 deal you go for, you're sure to get a top-dollar machine here. The Dell XPS series has featured on our best laptops buying guide for many years now, and they never fail to impress when it comes to their design, specs, and performance.",
    "Not in the US? See the best Dell XPS 13 deals near you just down below.",
    "Considering we normally see only Core i5 equipped machines with 256GB SSDs at the $700 to $800 price point, we'd say these are a fantastic set of Dell XPS 13 machines all around. Recent launches of the 11th generation of Intel Core processors has really brought prices down on these 10th gen variants but that doesn't mean these machines are old news - they're still plenty fast for all kinds of intensive modern applications.",
