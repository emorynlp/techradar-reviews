  "summary": "The DC Extended Universe picks up the pace with the Flash movie.",
  "article": [
    "It\u2019s long been claimed that Superman is faster than a speeding bullet. Compared to another member of the Justice League, however, the Man of Steel is something of a slow coach. The Flash movie is set to put DC Comics\u2019 speedster-in-chief in the spotlight, in a turbo-charged adventure that will take Barry Allen (played once again by Ezra Miller) on a journey through time.",
    "With the story inspired by the popular \u2018Flashpoint\u2019 arc in the comics, The Flash movie is also set to be big news for the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). When Barry travels back in time and changes history, he\u2019ll open the door to other parallel dimensions within DC\u2019s multiverse. He\u2019ll also come into contact with at least three other superheroes, including a new Supergirl and two Batmen \u2013 Ben Affleck\u2019s DCEU Caped Crusader will suit up alongside the Michael Keaton incarnation, with the actor returning to the role for the first time since 1992\u2019s Batman Returns.",
    "Ironically for a film about a man who\u2019d leave Usain Bolt trailing in his dust and still have something to spare, The Flash movie has taken its time getting to the big screen. But with production now underway and a release date set for November 2022, here\u2019s everything we know so far about The Flash movie story, cast, and what the supes will be wearing.",
    "In another corner of the multiverse, we might have seen The Flash movie back in 2018. But the DC Extended Universe\u2019s solo Barry Allen adventure has been in development hell for years \u2013 and has had its fair share of writers and directors attached along the way.",
    "As far back as 2014, just a year after the release of Man of Steel, DC and Warner had already lined up Ezra Miller to don the Scarlet Speedster\u2019s suit, with The Lego Movie\u2019s Phil Lord and Christopher Miller on board to write and potentially direct.",
    "When they left the project to work on Solo: A Star Wars Story (they were subsequently replaced by Ron Howard), Pride & Prejudice & Zombies author Seth Grahame-Smith signed up to script and direct, but \u2013 according to Variety \u2013 departed the movie in April 2016 due to \u201ccreative differences\u201d.",
    "Rick Famuyiwa, director of Dope and three episodes of The Mandalorian, was next to take the helm, but left the project less than five months later. Again, Variety said that \u201ccreative differences\u201d were to blame.",
    "Warner then tried to recruit (as reported by Variety) either Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis or Kick-Ass\u2019s Matthew Vaughn, but neither could make the scheduling work. The DCEU\u2019s Batman star Ben Affleck was also approached to direct, but he turned the gig down.",
    "Then it was the turn of Spider-Man: Homecoming writers/Game Night directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who were attached to the movie from March 2018 to July 2019. During this period, Ezra Miller teamed up with legendary comics writer Grant Morrison to write a new version of the script. Morrison told Collider that their take was \u201clike Back to the Future\u201d.",
    "It wasn\u2019t until July 2019 that Warner and DC finally settled on the team who would take the movie before the cameras. As reported by the Hollywood Reporter, they recruited Birds of Prey and Bumblebee writer Christina Hodson, and IT director Andy Muschietti.",
    "Production belatedly got underway in London in April 2021, with The Flash movie release date now confirmed for November 4, 2022.",
    "In the absence of Barry Allen-style time travel shenanigans, it\u2019s still a little early to be expecting The Flash movie trailer. In the meantime, you can make do with the animated logo treatment Andy Muschietti posted on Instagram to mark the start of filming.",
    "While we don\u2019t know many story specifics, we do know that The Flash movie plot is partially inspired by Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert\u2019s iconic 2011 comic-book story arc, Flashpoint \u2013 indeed, Flashpoint was set to be the title of the film for a time, before reverting to The Flash.",
    "In the comics version, Barry Allen finds himself in an unfamiliar alternative universe where his late mother is still alive. In movie, Barry will use his time-traveling abilities in an effort to save his mom, Nora \u2013 and in so doing, inadvertently make major changes to the space-time continuum.",
    "As director Andy Muschietti explained at DC\u2019s Fandome event in August 2020, \u201cHis mother was murdered, his father was framed and incarcerated, and all his journey from then was of a man trying to make things right.\u201d",
    "\u201cBatman lost his parents, Superman lost his planet, Harley Quinn lost her egg sandwich\u2026\u201d added screenwriter Christina Hodson, \u201cbut Barry, because he\u2019s got this ability to go back and manipulate time, he\u2019s the only one who can actually go and change his own personal story.",
    "\u201c[But] time travel isn\u2019t simple,\u201d Hodson warned. \u201cIt\u2019s not always a straightforward case of, \u2018Go back and change one thing, and another thing changes in the future.\u2019\u201d",
    "Crucially, just as the Loki season 1 finale opened the doors to Marvel\u2019s take on the multiverse, The Flash movie is breaking down the barriers between alternative dimensions within the DCEU.",
    "\u201cThe cinematic multiverse is going to be born out of this movie,\u201d Hodson revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s born out of Barry\u2019s story.",
    "\u201cThis film is immensely important,\u201d added star Ezra Miller, \u201cbecause if you look around the DC Universe, obviously you have all of these characters that exist within their own bubbles. We even have now multiple iterations of the same story. This movie, by opening that door that Flashpoint did in the comics, all of these stories and characters can start to collide.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis movie is a bit of a hinge in the sense that it presents a story that implies a unified universe where all the cinematic iterations that we\u2019ve seen before are valid,\u201d Muschietti told Vanity Fair. \u201cIt\u2019s inclusive in the sense that it is saying all that you\u2019ve seen exists, and everything that you will see exists, in the same unified multiverse.\u201d",
    "With two Batmen already confirmed to appear, and every screen iteration of every DC character now apparently in play, the debate over whether this Barry Allen is the one who survived the theatrical cut of Justice League \u2013 or the one who had a considerably more pivotal role in Zack Snyder\u2019s version of the movie \u2013 suddenly seems rather less important\u2026",
    "The confirmed cast list looks like this:",
    "Ezra Miller returns to play Barry Allen (aka The Flash) for the third time after appearing in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (briefly) and Justice League (more substantially, especially in the Snyder Cut).",
    "He\u2019ll be suiting up alongside two different incarnations of the Caped Crusader \u2013 and neither of them are the Robert Pattinson version from the upcoming The Batman. (Though, given the dimension-hopping nature of the movie, it wouldn\u2019t be a massive surprise if that Bruce Wayne did turn up.)",
    "Ben Affleck is back as the Dark Knight who fought Steppenwolf alongside Barry Allen in Justice League, and it looks like he\u2019ll be something of a mentor figure for his speedy colleague.",
    "\u201c[Affleck\u2019s Batman] is a very substantial part of the emotional impact of the movie, Muschietti told Vanity Fair. \u201cThe interaction and relationship between Barry and Affleck\u2019s Wayne will bring an emotional level that we haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s Barry\u2019s story, but their characters are more related than we think. They both lost their mothers to murder, and that\u2019s one of the emotional vessels of the movie. That\u2019s where the Affleck Batman kicks in.\u201d",
    "The director also describes Bat-fleck as \u201cthe baseline. He\u2019s part of that unaltered state before we jump into Barry\u2019s adventure.\u201d",
    "The other Caped Crusader we know about (so far) is played by Michael Keaton, who famously wore the famous cowl in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman and Batman Returns. After being the worst kept secret in Hollywood for the best part of a year, Keaton\u2019s comeback was only officially confirmed in April (via Entertainment Weekly). Muschietti says Keaton\u2019s part is \u201csubstantial\u201d.",
    "Elsewhere, the Hollywood Reporter confirmed in March that Kiersey Clemons will be reprising her Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League role (she was cut out of the theatrical release) as journalist (and Barry\u2019s love interest) Iris West.",
    "And the superhero roster will be bolstered by Sasha Calle (a star of long-running soap opera The Young and the Restless) who\u2019ll play the DCEU version of Supergirl. It\u2019s yet to be confirmed if she\u2019s Kara Danvers, Lara Lane-Kent or some other incarnation of the Kryptonian hero. \u201cI saw more than four hundred auditions,\u201d said Muschietti (via Deadline). \u201cThe talent pool was truly amazing and it was very hard to make a decision, but we finally found an actress who was destined to play this role.\u201d",
    "Muschietti passed on the good news about Calle\u2019s casting in an Instagram video:",
    "Y Tu Mama Tambi\u00e9n and Pan\u2019s Labyrinth star Maribel Verd\u00fa will play the pivotal role of Barry\u2019s mom, Nora Allen, while his dad, Henry, will look significantly different to how he did in Justice League. Variety revealed in March that Office Space\u2019s Ron Livingston will replace Billy Crudup in the role. Newcomer Ian Loh will play Barry Allen as a kid.",
    "The confirmed cast is rounded out by Derry Girls\u2019 Saoirse-Monica Jackson and YouTuber Rudy Mancuso in yet-to-be-announced roles.",
    "But don\u2019t be surprised if The Flash movie features big-name cameos from stars who\u2019ve played DC characters in previous films and TV shows. According to a report in CBR.com, Ray Fisher says he\u2019d potentially be up for reprising his role as Cyborg \u2013 on condition of an apology from Warner Bros for his treatment on the set of Justice League. There have also been rumors of comebacks for Superman Returns star Brandon Routh, and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s Catwoman.",
    "Most intriguingly of all, could this Barry Allen come to face with his counterpart from the Arrowverse version of The Flash? Miller\u2019s Allen has already crossed paths with the Grant Gustin incarnation in the CW\u2019s Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event, so it wouldn\u2019t be the first time:",
    "Muschietti revealed Barry Allen\u2019s new Flash suit at DC\u2019s Fandome event in 2020 (check out the concept art at Variety), claiming that, \u201cit\u2019s more organic, you can see the light embedded in it.\u201d It was also revealed that Ben Affleck\u2019s Bruce Wayne had some input in its design.",
    "The director has also taken to Instagram to tease Michael Keaton\u2019s batsuit\u2026",
    "\u2026and Supergirl\u2019s new outfit:",
    "Writer Tom Taylor, co-creator of the Lara Lane-Kent Supergirl, also tweeted some photos of Sasha Calle on set, comparing the new Supergirl with the comic books.",
    "You can look forward to seeing DC's Multiverses collide on November 4, 2022."
