  "summary": "Project Athia has a new name: Forspoken",
  "article": [
    "Forspoken is the name of the new action RPG from Square Enix formerly known as \u2018Project Athia\u2019 coming exclusively to PS5 and PC on May 24, 2022.",
    "Forspoken will have players to take on the role of Frey Holland (played by Ella Balinska), a fairly ordinary young woman who must harness her magical powers to survive what Square Enix calls a \"thrilling, otherworldly adventure\".",
    "Square Enix first unveiled Forspoken at Sony\u2019s PS5 games reveal in 2020 and the title remains a PS5 console exclusive. It\u2019s hard to say whether Forspoken will eventually end up on the Xbox Series X too. But, at the time of writing, Forspoken appears to be a genuine PS5 exclusive, and won\u2019t be available on PS4 or Xbox hardware.",
    "After a long period of silence, we've been able to learn a little more about the game from September's PlayStation Showcase, Square Enix's Tokyo Game Show presentation and The Game Awards 2021 trailer. If you\u2019re interested to learn more about Forspoken and what we might expect from the latest game from Square Enix, read on to find out everything we know so far.",
    "Forspoken will release on May 24, 2022, for PlayStation 5 and PC, making it a PS5 console exclusive. The game's release date was revealed during The Game Awards 2021 and was accompanied by a new trailer, which you can find below.",
    "A new trailer for Forspoken was revealed during The Game Awards 2021. The latest trailer shows off more of the game's story and action-packed gameplay, but also included the game's release date of May 24, 2022.",
    "The most recent look we've had at Forspoken happened during the PlayStation Showcase on September 9, 2021, giving fans a bit more insight into the game and its story, as well as protagonist Frey Holland.",
    "We also know the game will launch sometime in early 2022 on both PS5 and PC. Check out the new trailer below.",
    "This trailer for Forspoken revealed the game's official title and its targeted release window of 2022. This trailer gave us a sneak peek of the Forspoken's fast-paced, frenetic traversal and the gorgeous world it takes place in, along with some of Frey's magical abilities. Check it out below:",
    "Forspoken (or as it was called then 'Project Athia') was announced during Sony's Future of Gaming 2020 showcase with a teaser trailer lasting just over one minute long.",
    "The trailer gave us a very brief glimpse at Frey using some of her magical abilities, the world of Athia itself and some of the creatures we expect to encounter. Check it out below:",
    "Although not what you'd expect from a typical Forspoken trailer, an AMD FSR trailer all about Forspoken was released in June 2021.",
    "The primary aim of the trailer was to show how the new game will put AMD's graphics tech to use, but it also features some gameplay snippets from scenes we've already seen in previous trailers. One shows Frey making her way through a forest with her magical abilities, as well as fighting with a bear-like monster.",
    "Details on Forspoken's gameplay are still thin, but there have been some details we've been able to glean from the trailers we've seen so far and from what Square Enix has confirmed.",
    "The game received its own showcase during the Tokyo Game Show, during which members of its development team were able to shed a little more light on what we saw in the most recent trailer.",
    "Previous trailers for Forspoken have already shown us that the game\u2019s protagonist Frey will be able to use magic, and the game\u2019s co-director Takefumi Terada said Frey\u2019s learning to use \u201ca wide variety of spells\u201d will be a big part of the story.",
    "Magic is also, as trailers have hinted, a key part of gameplay in terms of combat and traversal. Players will be able to use magic to directly attack enemies or set traps for them as well as perform \u201cmagic parkour\u201d, covering huge distances over Athia, with Terada saying it \u201ccaptures what makes our style of development at Luminous Productions so special.\u201c Controls aren\u2019t going to be especially complicated by the sounds of it, as Terada also said that they want as many people as possible to enjoy the game. As such, it\u2019ll only take one button to use magic to attack or to use parkour skills, while different button combinations will allow for different kinds of magic.",
    "Giving some insight into the main character of Frey Holland, creative producer Raio Mitsuno described her as a \u201csmart but still slightly immature\u201d 20 year-old woman living in New York who, having had a difficult upbringing, \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust the world much\u201d and uses sarcasm and humor to deflect from her vulnerability. He called her \u201ca good person at heart\u201d who is desperate to escape to New York. It\u2019s at this point that Frey is transported to the mysterious world of Athia. Here, her arrival sets of a chain of events and the game\u2019s main story begins, following Frey\u2019s journey as she tries to find a way back home and learns to wield magic.",
    "We also got a look at a talking bracelet in the trailer and it turns out it\u2019s called Cuff. Cuff is another character in the game and while Mitsuno said it\u2019ll be a while before we learn more about them, Cuff will be important to the game and the story, guiding Frey though her journey. Frey and Cuff are described as \u201ctwo peas in a pod\u201d, both saying \u201cwhatever they think.\u201d As a result, they\u2019re \u201cconstantly bickering\u201d and will make small talk during Frey\u2019s journey.",
    "As far as Athia itself is concerned, it was a continent once at peace but now teeters on the brink of destruction, ruled by figures known as the Tantas. One of the Tantas that\u2019s been confirmed is Tanta Sila. Described as one who \u201clives for the battlefield\u201d and has \u201cimmense physical strength\u201d, she is in charge of Athia\u2019s defence. Each of the Tantas have been designed \u201cwith a specific virtue in mind\u201d.",
    "Tokyo Game Show 2021",
    "Forspoken may have skipped E3 2021 but since then we\u2019ve seen it twice: once during PlayStation\u2019s September showcase and again during Square Enix\u2019s October Tokyo Game Show presentations. The game received its own showcase during the Tokyo Game Show, during which members of its development team were able to shed a little more light on what we saw in the most recent trailer.",
    "Co-director Takefumi Terada and creative producer Raio Mitsuno offered more details on the game's story, the world of Athia and how central a role magic will play in the game. They also touched on the Tantas, one of whom, Tanta Sila, is seen battling Frey in the trailer. The official Forspoken Twitter account posted a clearer image of the Tanta of strength, which can be seen below:",
    "The team has \u201cbeen working on polishing the graphics every day\u201d and they're in peak production in the run up to the Spring 2022 release window.",
    "Designed for PS5 According to Square Enix, Forspoken has been \"designed specifically for the PlayStation 5, taking advantage of the new console\u2019s power and features to create a game that feels like a true next-gen experience.\"",
    "That means we're expecting Forspoken will feature DualSense controller support, meaning the game should feel even more immersive thanks to haptic feedback and adaptive triggers \u2013 however, these exact features haven't been confirmed yet.",
    "It's likely that Forspoken will also feature 4K and higher frame rates (potentially up to 120fps). But, again, these exact details haven't been confirmed."
