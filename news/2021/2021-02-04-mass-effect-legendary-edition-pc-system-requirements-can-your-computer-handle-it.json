    "If you're looking to play Mass Effect: Legendary Edition on PC, then the minimum and recommended system requirements have been released.",
    "The good news is that even the recommended requirements are pretty achievable for any gaming PC build bought in the past few years, so you should be able to play this remaster of the popular sci-fi franchise.",
    "Minimum requirements",
    "Recommended requirements",
    "These are pretty undemanding requirements, then, for the remaster that will bring improved graphics and 4K support, along with support for over 60FPS and ultrawide 21:9 monitor support on PC.",
    "While the CPU and GPU demands are relatively undemanding, and most PCs these days will be running with at least 8GB of RAM, there is one requirement that may cause issues: that 120GB of storage space.",
    "That's a big chunk of hard drive, and people with smaller capacity hard drives, or SSDs, could find that they need to clear some room to fit Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.",
    "While it does require a lot of storage, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is actually three games, which makes the capacity demands a bit more understandable. However, it seems you'll need to download all three together - there's no option to download each game separately to save space."
