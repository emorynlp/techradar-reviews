    "Invest in one of the best wireless keyboards to make your setup truly cable-free. You might be tired of dealing with all those cables or having all your peripherals tangled together. Getting one of these will at least minimize the amount of wires you have to deal with.",
    "Wireless keyboards have come a long way over the last few years. Just like the best wireless mice, they are much more reliable than in the past. They come with a longer range, lower latency, and a more reliable connection. That\u2019s partly due to the leaps and bounds that Bluetooth technology and USB wireless adapters have made, making these cable-free peripherals about as accurate and responsive as the best wired keyboards.",
    "These days, they come with impressively long battery life and range. And, some of the wireless gaming keyboards even come with features like RGB lighting without using up too much battery.",
    "Whether you want to live tangle-free or have a cleaner, more minimalist looking setup, one of these wireless keyboards will do the trick. And, no matter if you\u2019re gaming or getting down to business, they are in some ways better than their wired counterparts.",
    "Choosing the best peripherals isn\u2019t just about finding the best looking one. The Cherry Stream Desktop is proof of this, and while it might look like it time-traveled from the Aughts or the late 90s, this wireless keyboard is the most compelling choice out there overall.",
    "Extremely affordable, comfortable to use, and easy to set up, this keyboard from Cherry is a pleasure to type on because of its incredibly responsive performance and satisfying tactile feedback. It\u2019s a bit sparse on special features, but it also makes up for that with the wireless mouse it comes bundled with. Both utilize one USB wireless receiver, which means you\u2019re not only saving money, you\u2019re also hitting two birds with one single port.",

    "By premium, we don\u2019t just mean its price. Where do we even begin? The Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro comes with all the premium trimmings, from its build and impressive switches down to its multiple connectivity options, low latency connection, and deliciously plush wrist rest.",
    "In other words, there\u2019s much to love here to justify that admittedly higher price tag. Breaking its wireless feature and performance down, however, there are three modes of connection here: Razer HyperSpeed wireless, Bluetooth, and USB-C cable (if you\u2019re in the mood to be old school). That\u2019s not all; it also lets you pair up to three devices via Bluetooth, which means it can connect to up to five devices at the same time - a major boon to multitaskers. What\u2019s even more impressive is that both Bluetooth and USB wireless connectivities are equally reliable in range and responsiveness. You can have your computer in one room and be typing in another, and you won\u2019t notice the difference between these and a wired connection.",
    "We\u2019ve been using the Logitech K380 as our go-to work keyboard for months now, and we can honestly say that it\u2019s one of the best keyboards out there for writers, digital nomads, and folks who spend most of their time pounding away. But, even if you\u2019re not always typing on your computer, the fact that it\u2019s very cheaply priced for what it offers also makes it a fantastic choice for you.",
    "Adding to its value, it also comes with features like multi-device connectivity (specifically, up to three) and multi-platform compatibility. You can even toggle from one device to another with just a press of a button for the ultimate productivity if you\u2019re multitasking. That\u2019s without mentioning its super sleek and portable form factor, which makes it not just travel-ready, but also travel-friendly. We only wish Logitech made it rechargeable, but with a 24-month battery life, this missing piece is hardly a deal-breaker.",
    "Logitech G\u2019s G915 TKL Lightspeed keyboard is one of the best looking keyboards we\u2019ve ever used, touting a sleek and incredibly slim deck and even thinner floating keys. That\u2019s without mentioning its cool volume wheel and unique round keys for connectivity and media controls.",
    "It doesn\u2019t just go by looks alone, however. Its performance and feature set are just as impressive, rocking an actuation distance of 1.5 mm, long wireless range, and low latency. Rounding those off are its onboard memory that lets you save two lighting and three macro profiles, a battery life rating of 40 hours when its RGB is at 100% brightness, and its Game Mode button that disables the Windows key. And, while it\u2019s compact, it doesn\u2019t completely abandon its special and arrow keys. In other words, what you\u2019ve got here is a wireless keyboard that\u2019s just as great for productivity as it is for gaming, whether you\u2019re on-the-go or at your desk.",
    "There are quite a few impressive mini keyboards that recently hit the shelves, but only a handful deliver wireless connectivity and fewer still do so impressively. If we were to list the best mini keyboards with wireless connectivity, then the Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini Hyperspeed would be sitting at the very top.",
    "Despite its size, this new release from Razer more than punches above its weight, touting an incredibly robust build, vibrant RGB lighting, and satisfying tactile feedback. Go with Razer\u2019s yellow switches, and you\u2019ll also get a quieter typing experience without sacrificing your comfort. But, what\u2019s truly impressive about this wireless keyboard is its connectivity. Offering both USB wireless and Bluetooth connections, it not only boasts an impressively long wireless range, but also zero discernable latency (much like its full-sized brother, the BlackWidow V3 Pro). That\u2019s even when you\u2019re in one room with the keyboard and the computer it\u2019s connected to is in another. That\u2019s already impressive in its own right, but given the competition, that\u2019s really saying something.",

    "Who are we kidding? The best wireless keyboard for Apple\u2019s Macs and MacBooks is the actual wireless keyboard Apple specifically designed for them. Now touting the company\u2019s scissor switches, the Magic Keyboard is aptly named, as the experience of typing on it may be bordering a magical experience. It\u2019s true there\u2019s not really a lot of features here. Very much an Apple product, this one focuses more on form and function, and not as much on features. There\u2019s still much to love, however. It pairs incredibly easily with an Apple computer, and it\u2019s among the thinnest and most compact keyboards we\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of using. And, if you plan on investing in the new iMac 24-inch, you can even get it in the same shade (of which there are six on top of the usual silver). Unfortunately, you can only get these colors if you purchase the matching AIO, but here\u2019s to hoping Apple will make them available for individual purchase.",
    "Razer took all its gaming keyboard expertise and used them to create a keyboard for productivity. And, it paid off. You\u2019re getting the trifecta with Razer\u2019s Pro Type: beauty, sheer performance and comfort. The fact that this wireless keyboard is incredibly quiet for having mechanical keys is impressive; the fact that it connects up to four wireless devices without re-pairing and offers USB-C charging are just cherries on top. It may not be the cheapest option out there, but it\u2019s a price you\u2019ll be more than happy to pay for everything it offers.",
