  "article": [
    "Samsung\u2019s latest run of cheap Android alternatives to its Galaxy S21 range includes three new handsets that try to blur the lines between affordable phones and some of the very best phones on the market.",
    "The new Samsung Galaxy A52, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and Samsung Galaxy A72 have just been unveiled by the company at its latest Unpacked launch event. They sit alongside the previously announced Galaxy A32.",
    "These follow-ups to last year's handsets are marketed toward younger people who want an alternative to the company\u2019s top-end phones, but they look to be suitable for anyone who wants a smartphone that doesn\u2019t cost as much as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy A52 is the cheapest handset of these three new phones, and it differs quite a bit from the Galaxy A52 5G. It features a 6.5-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate.",
    "The Galaxy A52 5G features the same size display and Full HD+ resolution, but this time it has a 120Hz refresh rate.",
    "Then the Galaxy A72 comes with a 6.7-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. Each of these handsets comes with a punch-hole front-facing camera - that\u2019s a 32MP shooter - and they have in-screen fingerprint scanners.",
    "Both the Galaxy A52 and Galaxy A52 5G have 4,500mAh batteries, while the Galaxy A72 comes with a 5,000mAh cell. Unlike Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S21 series, you will get a charger in the box alongside the phone.",
    "Samsung has yet to confirm whether these devices feature wireless charging, so we think it\u2019s likely none of these phones feature the technology.",
    "All three of these handsets feature similar camera technology, and the three phones feature identical front-facing selfie shooters, with a 32MP camera.",
    "On the rear, you\u2019ll find a 64MP main camera with optical image stabilization paired with a 12MP ultra-wide shooter. The Galaxy A52 and Galaxy A52 5G both feature 5MP depth shooters and 5MP macro cameras too.",
    "The Galaxy A72 differs here with an 8MP telephoto camera instead of a depth sensor, and there\u2019s a macro sensor with a 5MP spec.",
    "The Galaxy A52 and Galaxy A72 both feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G chipset, while the Galaxy A52 5G opts for the Snapdragon 750G. The Samsung Galaxy A52 is available in versions with 4GB, 6GB and 8GB of RAM, while the other two phones are just available in 6GB or 8GB options.",
    "All three phones are IP67-certified dust and water resistant, they feature stereo speakers in collaboration with Dolby Atmos and each features microSD support up to 1TB.",
    "Each of these handsets comes in the choice of Awesome Blue, Awesome White, Awesome Violet or Awesome Black. The handsets have a plastic rear too.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy A52 won't be available in the UK, and we've yet to hear from Samsung whether it'll be offering the handset in the US, but it will be available to buy in Australia for AU$599.",
    "The Galaxy A52 5G and Galaxy A72 are both confirmed for the UK and Australia, and they cost \u00a3399 / AU$649 (about $550 in the US) or \u00a3419 / AU$749 (about $580) respectively.",
    "You can buy both of these phones in the UK now, but you will need to wait till April 9 in Australia to pick up one of these new A-series handsets."
