  "summary": "Underpowered processor reportedly good enough for NAS devices",
  "article": [
    "Taiwan-based QNAP has launched its first NAS device powered by an eight-core 2.50 GHz Chinese-made KaiXian KX-U6580 processor designed by Zhaoxin.",
    "Zhaoxin is a joint venture between Via Technologies and the Shanghai Municipal Government.",
    "Tom\u2019s Hardware believes the TVS-675 NAS is perhaps the first commercial device that\u2019ll be available in the US and Europe that\u2019s powered with the KaiXian CPU, which was developed primarily for the Chinese market.",
    "This is a departure to Qnap using either Intel Celeron or Arm-based systems-on-a-chip (SoC) in their entry level NAS devices designed for small businesses, shares Tom\u2019s.",
    "Although it wasn\u2019t satisfied with the performance of the KaiXian KX-6000-series x86 processor, Tom\u2019s reasons that the processor would perhaps work well in the TVS-675 since NAS devices don\u2019t put too much demands on the underlying hardware.",
    "The TVS-675 has six hot-swappable 3.5-inch bays for high-capacity SATA hard disk drives (HDD), along with two M.2-2280 slots for Solid State Drives (SSD) supporting a PCIe 3.0 x1 or SATA interface.",
    "The device also has two PCIe 3.0 x4 slots for SSDs or network cards, together with two 2.5 GbE ports, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A connectors, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, and one HDMI 2.0 output.",
    "The drive ships with 8GB DDR RAM, but its two SO-DIMM slots can be used to crank this up to 64GB in total.",
    "The Qnap TVS-675 is offered with either the Qnap\u2019s QTS operating system (OS) or its ZFS-based enterprise-grade QuTS OS.",
    "The device supports all the capabilities you can expect from an entry-level NAS, but Qnap hasn\u2019t yet shared any pricing information."
