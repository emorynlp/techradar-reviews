  "summary": "OPINION: The show\u2019s saccharine nature is nice, but it\u2019s the struggles with heavy topics that make it so relatable",
  "article": [
    "Critics of the show Ted Lasso have long complained that its cloyingly sweet characters and never-fail protagonist are, to put it nicely, unwatchable TV.",
    "Admittedly, if you only watch Ted Lasso for a few minutes each week and catch Ted giving an upbeat pep-talk to one of his players or peers, you might begin to suspect that the show is all fluff. Or rather, that Ted Lasso as a character is so saccharine in the way he methodically wins people over that he becomes unbearable instead of endearing.",
    "And I\u2019ll admit, as a longtime advocate of the show, I have to agree. Ted\u2019s affability can come off as annoying at times, especially if you\u2019re only catching the parts where he warms people up faster than a fried egg on a hot sidewalk. That said, in my experience, it\u2019s not the lighthearted parts of Ted Lasso that make it a great show \u2013 I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s the characters\u2019 struggles with divorce, failure and mental health issues that truly make it top-notch.",
    "To appreciate Ted Lasso you don\u2019t have to relate to the eponymous lead character\u2019s successes, try instead to relate to his failures.",
    "You\u2019ll find both minor and major spoilers for Seasons 1 and 2 ahead, up to and including the most recent episode, \u201cHeadspace\u201d.",
    "Right out of the gate in season one, you\u2019re given a front-row seat to Ted Lasso\u2019s utter destruction of a fictional Premier League team, AFC Richmond.",
    "The way the club slowly goes from top of the table to relegation is done in such a way that the loss never feels overwhelming - nor does it appear to even upset Ted Lasso - but it\u2019s clear from the outset that the town isn\u2019t a huge fan of Lasso\u2019s coaching style.",
    "This comes to a boil at the end of the first season, when the team loses in overtime and finally gets the boot to the lower league, leaving you to sympathize for the team as they wrap their heads around the loss.",
    "What I love most about the bittersweet scene is that it\u2019s crafted in such a way that you\u2019ll sympathize with Ted - believing in fact that AFC will make it back next season - while still feeling the pang of an important loss.",
    "The balance between optimism and sadness sets a perfect tone, and one I feel like that\u2019s easier to relate to than if Ted\u2019s coaching style won every game.",
    "Of course, football is sometimes a metaphor for some of the characters\u2019 other struggles.",
    "Ted Lasso provides not one just character going through divorce, but two of them. The club\u2019s manager Rebecca goes through the emotions of it in the front half of the first season as she gets revenge on her ex by sabotaging his favorite team, while Ted follows closely behind in the second half.",
    "These characters handle their emotional burdens differently (it\u2019s around this time that we see Ted actually has a drinking problem and is less than perfect) and yet you can empathize with both of them.",
    "On one hand, we see Ted\u2019s optimism begins to fade in the moments he talks about divorce. Ted\u2019s never-give-up mentality is like a steaming locomotive on a track laden with brick walls. Try as he might to keep smashing through them, the train finally runs out of steam and he finds himself \u2013 as many of us would \u2013 in a deep state of depression.",
    "While Rebecca\u2019s character arc has a few parallels to Ted\u2019s it does things in a different way. After her plan for revenge goes awry, we see Rebecca emerge renewed, cautiously optimistic about what\u2019s to come.",
    "Not only are both experiences relatable \u2013 but they\u2019re achingly heartfelt. Breakups and divorces have both components \u2013 dejection and eventual optimism \u2013 and the show illustrates both aspects beautifully.",
    "However, the show\u2019s best character flaw (if you can even call it that) is Ted\u2019s panic disorder. Who\u2019d expect that this genuinely kind, affable person struggles with something as heavy as panic and anxiety?",
    "Now, there have assuredly been portrayals of a panic disorder before Ted Lasso \u2013 not that many come to mind, however \u2013 but it feels more poignant here watching someone go through all the physical symptoms in real time.",
    "We\u2019ve gotten a glimpse of this in the past, specifically in the seventh episode of season one (\u201cMake Rebecca Great Again\u201d) when Ted has to leave karaoke, but it wasn\u2019t until last week\u2019s episode that it began affecting his on-the-job performance.",
    "That twist is, in my opinion, absolutely crucial. So many of us feel anxiety but until it affects how you feel on the job on an everyday basis, it feels less real \u2013 something you cope with but maybe not actually struggle with. The moment it impacts you at the place you spend most of your time, it becomes a Problem.",
    "Already Ted is trying to address his issues with the team\u2019s psychologist, the wonderfully terse Dr. Sharon Fieldstone (played by Sarah Niles). I'm afraid that the show might fast-track his counseling to speed things along, but seeing him anxiety at all in therapy is a huge blow to the stigma of going to see a counselor.",
    "Without moments like these, the show\u2019s humor and genuineness would feel insincere. With them, however, it\u2019s moments of joy feel more relatable, and its sadness, while painful, is just a part of the whole \u2013 just like life itself."
