    "Hate clutter but need a wireless speaker to play your tunes? The Zuma Lumisonic could be the answer you\u2019ve been searching for \u2013 you need only look up.",
    "That\u2019s because this innovative speaker comes hidden inside a ceiling light fixture, offering what the company describes as \u201ca clutter free audio experience that combines circadian rhythm and mood lighting.\u201d",
    "The \u00a3375 (about $520 / AU$680) Lumisonic is controlled via the Zuma app, which allows you to play \u201catmospheric soundscapes and combine them with sympathetic lighting tones.\u201d You can also control the speaker using your voice thanks to Alexa integration.",
    "So, are there any sonic benefits to installing a speaker into your ceiling? Well, according to Zuma, as the sound projects vertically from the ceiling, it\u2019s not being \u201cbounced around or blocked by furniture or people\u201d, which the company says allows the brain to \u201cabsorb the sound and process it in a more relaxed state.\u201d",
    "We\u2019re not too sure about that one \u2013 though the idea of using multiple Lumisonic speakers across your ceiling to create a canopy of light and sound is quite appealing.",
    "If you\u2019re more concerned about listening to your favorite Spotify playlists than recreating a spa-like experience in your home, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the speaker comes with support for AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, and Bluetooth 4.2. Plus, there\u2019s support for hi-res audio files.",
    "Aside from that, we don\u2019t know much about the audio specs on offer here \u2013 Zuma hasn\u2019t offered any information on the kind of drivers the speaker uses, for example.",
    "What we do know is the Lumisonic is set to get some further upgrades later this year, which should allow you to use the speaker in tandem with motion sensors, smoke alarms, and security systems.",
    "While some of the claims made by Zuma about the capabilities of the Lumisonic seem a little far-fetched (we\u2019re not convinced speaker placement can relax your brain, for instance), there is a growing trend for wireless speakers that can be disguised as fixtures or pieces of furniture in your home.",
    "The Sonos IKEA Symfonisk lamp speaker and the Bang & Olufsen Beosound Emerge, are just two examples \u2013 and although these speakers don\u2019t come with the added wellness features that you\u2019re getting with the Lumisonic, they do come from more established audio brands, so may appeal more to audiophiles."
