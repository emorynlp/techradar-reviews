    "Apple Arcade is a subscription service that lets you play 180+ games on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Mac.",
    "It hasn\u2019t been promoted anything like Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass, but is still a great deal if you\u2019re interested in trying something outside of mega-budget console games, particularly on Apple's family of mobile devices.",
    "Don\u2019t know what to try? Sifting out the gold in a big pile of titles you\u2019ve never heard of isn\u2019t easy, so we\u2019re going to do the heavy lifting for you and take a quick look at every single game on Apple Arcade.",
    "In just a few words we\u2019ll tell you what to expect and offer some micro-reviews based on our own play sessions. Ready?",
    "Three word review: Love obsessed puzzler",
    "It looks like a platformer but A Fold Apart is a puzzler in which you fold parts of the screen, like pages of a pulpy romance novel, to reunite a pair of sappy lovebirds.",
    "Three word review: Action heavy racer",
    "Take each car chase and driving scene from action movies of the last 50 years, leave them to simmer on the hob until you have a dense tangy paste, compress it all into a stock cube and you have Agent Intercept \u2014 a fast, action-packed vehicular romp.",
    "Three word review: Miniature environmental Zelda",
    "Don\u2019t miss this beautiful, relaxing adventure. Alba: A Wildlife Adventure has some of the world-building charm of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and a stronger environmental message. Alba\u2019s out to save the wildlife of the island on which her grandparents live. You take pictures of the local fauna, and the whole thing can be done and dusted in a few hours, so there\u2019s no open world bloat.",
    "Three word review: Avian road trip",
    "Help a chicken find its lost chicks by pausing and swapping the circles that highlight the obstacles and dangers in each level.",
    "Three word review: Endless desert sandboarding",
    "Somewhere between the magnificent indie adventure game \u2018Journey\u2019 and an endless runner game, you\u2019ll find Alto\u2019s Odyssey: The Lost City. This visually-stunning game tasks you with chaining together tricks across dunes, canyons and temples, whether that\u2019s sliding down vines, bouncing on hot air balloons or gliding along in your very own wingsuit.",
    "Three word review: Log-flipping puzzler",
    "Make your way from island to island by flipping logs which let you get over bodies of water. You\u2019ll need to position the logs carefully to get them in the right place, mind.",
    "Three word review: Birds bomb pigs",
    "If you\u2019ve had a smartphone in the last ten years, you know the drill. Using a catapult, you fire an assortment of birds at fortifications, aiming to knock them into the pigs within. Surprisingly addictive and perfect for touchscreen play, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s perhaps the best-known mobile gaming hit of all time.",
    "Three word review: Real fast cars",
    "This is a fast-paced and beautifully-modelled driving game, a glitzy arcade racer that includes cars and bikes alike. You\u2019ll never get bored with more than 400 career events, 1500 mystery challenges, six game modes, countless ways to upgrade your vehicles and multiplayer mode to challenge your friends. There\u2019s something very cool about driving gravity-defying Ferrari and Ducatis around impossible race tracks.",
    "Three word review: Broken gadget simulator",
    "This gentle puzzler from ustwo, the team of geniuses behind Monument Valley, sees you take apart and repair gadgets like watches and cameras. A relaxing experience with bags of style.",
    "Three word review: Rhythm game RPG",
    "This moody isometric RPG adventure turns into a rhythm game when you get into fights. There are puzzles too: a multi-faceted one, this.",
    "Three word review: It's just backgammon.",
    "If you\u2019re a fan of backgammon, you\u2019re in for a treat. Everyone else, keep moving, because this is, simply, backgammon with no bells and whistles or new elements to spice up the game. Instead, it\u2019s an easy-to-use and intuitive take on the board game classic that you can keep in your pocket.",
    "Three word review: Award-winning platformer",
    "An atmospheric, side-scrolling platformer, Badland started life as a paid-for app and is now, thankfully, part of the Apple Arcade library. Thanks to the magical, gorgeous visuals and smart puzzles you encounter on your journey through a dark and eerie forest, this one has become a mobile Game of the Year winner.",
    "Three word review: Ghibli meets Zelda",
    "Take the hand-drawn anime art style of the Studio Ghibli movies, and throw in some Zelda exploration gameplay, and you\u2019ve got Baldo. You might find this game to be a bit rough around the edges, with some steep difficulty spikes, but it\u2019s gorgeous to look at with some beautiful areas to explore.",
    "Three word review: It\u2019s baseball, stupid",
    "Animations with some of the snappy, vivacious aesthetic of games like Team Fortress 2 and Fortnite give this casual baseball game a punchy feel.",
    "Three word review: Cute vertical shooter",
    "A vertical shooter with a twist. You fire out your character into each level, bustin\u2019 baddies to reveal coins. And then a rope pulls you back to the start, when your net deploys to grab the cash.",
    "Three word review: Point \u2019n\u2019 click",
    "Gaming veterans take note. Beyond a Steel Sky is a sequel to the 1994 point \u2019n\u2019 click adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. Think a classic adventure with modern graphics. Newcomers who like a sci-fi adventure should also give it a go.",
    "Three word review: Chilled scuba diving",
    "A great showcase for the graphical power of iOS devices, Beyond Blue sees you swim through the sea, chasing down giant whale sharks, dolphins and other ocean-dwellers. It\u2019s relaxing, and even potentially educational for the little ones.",
    "Three word review: Mini games ahoy!",
    "Reaction-based mini games with a sport veneer. Big Time Sports has a distinctive visual style and is best played with friends.",
    "Three word review: 8-bit Dark Souls",
    "Don\u2019t be put off by Bleak Sword\u2019s ultra-pixelated graphics. It looks great in motion. This is a stylish and highly distinctive horror action game that has some of the same dark DNA as a title like Dark Souls or Bloodborne.",
    "Three word review: Join the dots",
    "An innovative puzzler, the aim of Blek+ is to draw flowing lines to connect colored circles on your phone. The key is managing to connect all of the dots without hitting the black holes on your screen. It\u2019s a simple concept but there are some surprisingly deep possibilities for puzzle solving.",
    "Three word review: Twin-stick MOBA",
    "A battle arena shooter without the violence, Butter Royale sees up to 32 players firing sauce at each other in a large arena. Has some of the appeal of today\u2019s online first-person shooters, but is viewed from top-down.",
    "Three word review: Card-y dungeon crawler",
    "You may be able to tell from the look, but Adventure Time creator Pendleton Ward had a hand in Card of Darkness. It\u2019s cute AF. But underneath that sits a compulsive card-based dungeon crawler. As you progress you\u2019ll find more powerful cards to use in each level. These levels represent a floor of the dungeon. It\u2019s an epic adventure shrunk down to iPhone-friendly proportions.",
    "Three word review: Magic the Gathering",
    "Cardpocalypse grafts a story onto the gameplay of a one-on-one card battler. Cute graphics and a kid-friendly theme make it more accessible than some of the \u201cgrown-up\u201d alternatives in this genre.",
    "Three word review: Castlevania goes mobile",
    "An all-new game in the long-running action-horror series. You\u2019ll see the return of favorite characters, like Alucard and Simon Belmont, who must battle through 60 side-scrolling levels with a wide range of equipment to unlock. This one\u2019s a bit more linear than the explorative nature of other entries in the series, more like the earlier, pre-Symphony era titles.",
    "Three word review: Feline action adventure",
    "You could easily pile 10+ hours into this friendly adventure. Yes, you\u2019re a cat, but there\u2019s solid hack and slash mechanics bolstered by character-upgrading RPG systems underneath, to appeal to the non-cat people. You can tell it\u2019s a console-grade game, not least because you can also buy Cat Quest II for PS4, Xbox One and Switch.",
    "Three word review: Color match auto-runner",
    "Finding something new to do with the auto-runner genre on mobile isn\u2019t always easy, but Chameleon Run adds a cool twist. You must jump and land on the correctly-colored platform to match your player. The graphics are cool and stylish and there are a bunch of fun jumping mechanics, like \u2018double jump\u2019 and \u2018head jump\u2019.",
    "Three word review: Football on fast-forwards",
    "Charrua Soccer is UK/European football played at intense speed, cramming the action of a 90-minute match into a time slot that suits a trip to the toilet. It\u2019s quick and fun.",
    "Three word review: It\u2019s checkers, stupid",
    "It\u2019s checkers, you know the rules! Jump the other player\u2019s pieces to win the game. This is an easy-to-use version of the classic game with different offline and offline modes, tournament options, and customisable rules.",
    "Three word review: You know, chess?",
    "Another board game classic brought to Apple Arcade. Chess Play and Learn+ boasts the \u201cworld\u2019s largest online chess community\u201d, offering online play, speedy \u2018Bullet\u2019 timed games and adaptive AI players who become more (or less) skillful depending on your in-game performance.",
    "Three word review: Retro game revival",
    "The original ChuChu Rocket! made its debut on Dreamcast way back in 1999. Now, it returns with a new space theme on Apple Arcade. Gameplay is much as we remember; you have to direct your space mice across each level to avoid the space cats.",
    "Three word review: Party golf action",
    "One of Apple Arcade\u2019s best games, Clap Hanz Golf is an action-oriented take on the gentleman's sport, reminiscent of Everybody\u2019s Golf on the PlayStation. Guide chibi-like golfers around arcade-oriented courses, with a control scheme well-suited to mobile play. A must-download this one.",
    "Three word review: Dark Animal Crossing",
    "Imagine Nintendo\u2019s Animal Crossing, but on a haunted, ever-changing island filled with ghosts and spirits. That\u2019s what Crozy Grove is. You\u2019ll be exploring the island while taking part in various activities, like crafting, fishing and decorating to help befriend the ghostly folk of Cozy Grove.",
    "Three word review: Learning is fun",
    "A great, fun educational app for kids, Crayola Create and Play+ is filled with different activities for children to develop their self-expression and artistic independence. This app is certainly more than just drawing and colouring. Kids can solve puzzles, practice spelling and even try coding.",
    "Three word review: Hand-drawn charm",
    "There\u2019s something about the hand-drawn art style of Creaks that instantly draws us in. It adds atmosphere, and a sense of world-building you don\u2019t always get in a puzzler like this. Explore an otherworldly mansion and be prepared for some mild brain-teasing. It comes from the makers of Machinarium, which is no surprise given Creaks\u2019 graphical style.",
    "Three word review: Pure physics insanity",
    "First things first: don\u2019t approach Cricket Through the Ages expecting a traditional cricket game. It has a much wider appeal than that. Levels include a battle between bone-wielding cavemen, jousting knights and exploding samurai. You might learn a tiny bit about how real-world cricket works, but it's gags and ridiculous cartoony physics that hold this game together, not cricketing.",
    "Three word review: Not Crossy Road",
    "The original Crossy Road is about, well, crossing increasingly unlikely roads. Crossy Road Castle is completely different, a platform with a co-op mode for up to four players.",
    "Three word review: Deliver the candy",
    "The award-winning and ever-popular puzzle game Cut the Rope is back with a beautiful 3D remaster. Cut ropes, avoid obstacles and use Newton's law of physics to deliver candy to the little green monster with a candy addiction.",
    "Three word review: Cartoon twin-stick mayhem",
    "A twin-stick shooter. You are a ghostbuster who racks up money for each ghost exorcised. It\u2019s fast and manic, and you get to upgrade your abilities between levels.",
    "Three word review: Literary word game",
    "There are countless word games for iOS, but Dear Reader uses actual text from works of literature that have slipped out of copyright, including classics from Jane Austen, Voltaire and Jules Verne. You fill in the right missing words, or swap them, to restore the original text. This one might even nudge a couple of you to read some of the classics afterwards.",
    "Three word review: Genre mash-up",
    "Not content with one genre, Decoherence dabbles in a bunch. It\u2019s part twin-stick shooter, part tower defense, part strategy game. Not the simplest, so this one is probably best experienced on iPad.",
    "Three word review: Explosions galore",
    "Race and drift around a track rigged with explosives and wrecking balls. Detonation Racing might be the most dangerous racing game you\u2019ve ever played. This game is easily accessible but hard to master, so play with friends online or choose the career mode, which is jammed full of challenges to beat the most hazardous tracks in Detonation Racing.",
    "Three word review: Obtuse, surreal, engaging",
    "A first-person puzzle adventure with an eerie atmosphere. Your aim is to restore color to a world turned monochrome. It\u2019s a quickie, with an average length of just over an hour according to howlongtobeat.com, but you might find yourself stumped by some of its puzzles.",
    "Three word review: Dodge the bullets",
    "Fight your way through the bullet-filled hellscape of DoDonPachi Resurrection HD+. Dash and weave past a flurry of bullets to beat the various bosses in the world of resurrection, but you\u2019ll need practice. Thankfully, you can test your skills in practice mode to stop you from dying all the time \u2013 or at least some of the time.",
    "Three word review: Colorful arcade retro",
    "Dodo Peak borrows gameplay mechanics from a few classic arcade games, like Qbert. Scale the mountain to rescue your lost chicks while avoiding enemies. This one gets middling reviews, but certainly has visual charm.",
    "Three word review: Martian tower defense",
    "One of the early Apple Arcade releases, Don\u2019t Bug Me! is an odd tower defense game set on Mars with some incongruous first-person shooter sections.",
    "Three word review: Please don\u2019t starve",
    "The award-winning dark survival game enjoyed by more than 20 million players across various platforms finally arrives on Apple Arcade. Explore, fight and craft to ensure your survival in the gloomy wilderness and discover its secrets. The aim of the game is to find your way back home without starving.",
    "Three word review: Your own universe",
    "Use your imagination to create your own universe in Doodle God Universe. You have four essential elements that you can combine to create hundreds of new ones and make your world come alive. Every time you create a new element, you\u2019ll be rewarded with the wit and wisdom of the greatest philosophers and comedians in history.",
    "Three word review: Breezy, brief puzzler",
    "A short isometric puzzler in which you play as a cut bulbous robot. Not too hard, not too long.",
    "Three word review: Charming isometric puzzler",
    "The beautifully drawn Down in Bermuda sees you explore various themed islands, each of which is packed with puzzles.",
    "Three word review: Pint-sized X-Com",
    "A turn-based battle strategy title. You have to save a ship from supernatural nasties across 20 decks.",
    "Three word review: Artistic aerial platforming",
    "Dragons have invaded earth. Earthnight is packed with the things. It\u2019s a platformer of sorts, but one in which you spend much of your time in the air, rather than sauntering along platforms.",
    "Three word review: Pain and gain",
    "Sequel to Enter the Gungeon, Exit the Gungeon is a hardcore single-screen quasi-platformer with 16-bit style graphics and a major focus on gunplay. Your weapon changes almost constantly, forcing you to change your strategy on the fly.",
    "Three word review: Aerial cat carnage",
    "Cats in planes shooting guns all day long. That is the Explottens way. You have to dart around each level constantly to avoid enemy fire. It\u2019s an unrelenting dogfight.",
    "Three word review: Mega Man wannabe",
    "A classic-style, Mega Man-inspired action platformer with virtual gamepad controls if you choose to use the touchscreen. Fallen Knight would be a good title to test a wireless gamepad.",
    "Three word review: A classic JRPG",
    "The legendary Final Fantasy game creator, Hironobu Sakaguchi, has created a new and beautiful RPG: Fantasian. Fantasian is a classic JRPG with the same turn-based combat, but it comes with several quality of life improvements, like the \u2018Dimengeon Battle\u2019, which will send enemies to another dimension to streamline combat.",
    "Three Word review: Upcoming slice-em-up",
    "Not yet available at the time of publishing, but Farm It! looks like fun. You swipe to slice a knife through crops and fields, which burst into blocks, and then use the resources to plant new stuff.",
    "Three word review: Bird-based runner",
    "Remember Flappy Bird? Fledgling Heroes is a more built-up take on that style of aerial gameplay. You tap to flap your wings, and have to manoeuvre to avoid obstacles, and pick-up collectables.",
    "Three word review: A new solitaire",
    "Solitaire has been played by many for years, but Flip Flop Solitaire shakes up the rules of the card classic. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air for fans of the traditional solitaire games and provides them with hundreds of achievements to collect.",
    "Three word review: A puzzle frenzy",
    "Solve hundreds of puzzles to conquer the 45 levels of Frenzic industries in Frenzic Overtime. There are daily challenges, multiple game modes and hundreds of mini-modes to complete.",
    "Three word review: Original Apple showcase",
    "Frogger in Toy Town was one of the main showcase games when Apple first unveiled Arcade. We can see why. It looks great. However, it\u2019s not the perfect execution of the frogger formula, where you hop through environments to avoid dangers.",
    "Three word review: Keep slicing fruit!",
    "Start frantically swiping again as the fruit-cutting epic, Fruit Ninja, returns. Slice as much fruit as you can to score points, but make sure to avoid chopping up those bombs. Fruit Ninja is even more fun now you can compete with your friends online to find out once and for all who has the best fruit-cutting skills.",
    "Three word review: Design great games",
    "Manage your own game company and create critically-acclaimed games in Game Dev Story+. Hire talented developers and train their skills to unlock more game genres and content to build into brilliant new games. If your company has what it takes, you could reach the pinnacle of the gaming industry.",
    "Three word review: Build that wall",
    "Pretty much the polar opposite of Telltale\u2019s graphic adventure Game of Thrones, Tale of Crows sees you take on the role of the Night\u2019s Watch. You send out expeditions and maintain the wall's defenses. But instead of watching the action happen, you issue commands and then come back to the game every now and then to see how it all turned out. It\u2019s not action-packed, but that's not the idea.",
    "Three word review: Sudoku is back",
    "The classic Sudoku puzzle arrives on Apple Arcade with Good Sudoku+. It comes with 70,000 sudoku puzzles, three daily puzzle modes and six levels of difficulty. If you love number games and the unique challenge of Sudoku, there\u2019s plenty of content here to keep you entertained for ages.",
    "Three word review: (Non) Bloody brilliant fun",
    "Want a truly unmissable Apple Arcade game? You\u2019ve found it. Grindstone looks a bit like Candy Crush but maps symbol-matching gameplay onto an adventure. It\u2019s made by Capybara Games, which produced classics like Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery and Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes. Looking for games for the kids? Don\u2019t worry. While there\u2019s plenty of slashing action here, there\u2019s no blood.",
    "Three word review: Roleplay meets novel",
    "A quirky RPG that is part visual novel, which should suit if you want a story and don\u2019t mind doing a bit of reading.",
    "Three word review: Six-sided puzzling",
    "No fancy visual themes here, just colourful hexagonal pieces and fast-paced action-infused puzzles. Make your way through the maze-like levels, moving left or right at each turn.",
    "Three word review: Solve your mystery",
    "Hitchhiker is a mystery game and you must solve the unique puzzle of your own backstory. You have no memory of your past, so you\u2019ll have to talk to five different strangers and solve environmental puzzles to decode your history, all while hitchhiking across a beautiful landscape.",
    "Three word review: Muddy multiplayer mayhem",
    "It\u2019s three versus one in this farm-themed multiplayer title. You play as either the farmer, who has to clean up the farm, or as one of the muddy pigs, spreading muck far and wide. We know which side we\u2019d choose.",
    "Three word review: Game show parkour",
    "Watched Floor is Lava on Netflix? This is a game based on the same idea. You can\u2019t touch the floor because, this time, it is literally lava. Parkour your way over platforms to complete levels. You\u2019ll need to spend a little time to master the controls but a wireless gamepad helps.",
    "Three word review: Slap-happy sport",
    "Take ice hockey, remove the ice, add even more violence and you have HyperBrawl: Tournament. It\u2019s a future-tinged 2-on-2 sports ball game with ultra-short rounds to keep the action snappy.",
    "Three word review: Pinball but artsy",
    "The award-winning Inks has put its own twist on the classic pinball game with a beautiful and unique art style. Bursts of color paint the canvas of the pinball machine, which records a visual history of your game as you perfect your score. Inks.+ features 100 different pinball tables to play on and there\u2019s an online scoreboard to share your high scores.",
    "Three word review: Spellbinding",
    "\u201cA moving story of loss and hope\u201d wound into a good-looking puzzle platformer. With play time of around three hours this is just the kind of game we want to see on Apple Arcade. Highly recommended for fans of games like Inside and Braid.",
    "Three word review: Positive role model",
    "A charming 8-10 hour adventure with a story-led approach and a liberal smattering of puzzles that won\u2019t leave you scratching your head for too long. The main meat of the game is played in side-scrolling platformer style.",
    "Three word review: High-flying Mayhem",
    "The global hit game Jetpack Joyride has made its way to Apple Arcade. This high flying manic side-scroller keeps you on edge by testing your reflexes against an endless amount of lasers and zappers that want to end your jetpack run. When you're done dodging guided missiles, upgrade your jetpack with a variety of ridiculous outfits.",
    "Three word review: Quickfire by design",
    "Jumper Jon is an exploration-based side-scroller where time is always an issue. A 30-second timer sits at the top of the screen. If it runs out, it\u2019s game over and you have to head back to the last checkpoint. Fill it up by picking up items or killing enemies.",
    "Three word review: Endless enemies",
    "Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD is taking tower defense games to a whole new level. Defend your lands against over 40 enemies using various attack abilities, like pestilence clouds and death riders. Even if you manage to fight them off the first time, different difficulty modes means enemies will always be a challenge.",
    "Three word review: Big-headed battler",
    "Train a team of giant-headed warriors to take into battle. This one looks cute, but be prepared to get your head around some reasonably deep systems as you progress.",
    "Three word review: Jumping Flash 2021",
    "Explore islands and pick up enough gems to free the prince, who has been locked in the castle. We get strong Jumping Flash vibes from Kings of the Castle. For those not as ancient as us, that was an early PlayStation game.",
    "Three word review: Solve a mystery",
    "The aim of the game in Layton\u2019s Mystery Journey is to find your missing father. Discover clues, deduce the truth and solve multiple puzzles as you\u2019re whisked around London\u2019s famous landmarks. This game has the most extensive collection of puzzles in any Layton series title and a new cast of characters to meet.",
    "Three word review: Old-school Zelda-ing",
    "The top-down isometric action of Legend of the Skyfish 2 reminds us of the earlier Zelda games. But that\u2019s no bad thing.",
    "Three word review: Defend your kingdom",
    "Journey through a medieval fantasy world in this turn-based RPG with rogue-like elements. Become a leader of a party of heroes and stop enemies in their tracks with a combat system that\u2019s easy to learn, but hard to master. Strategy is key to combat. You\u2019ll need to move your heroes on a grid based on their combat skills and you\u2019ll never get bored as there are over 100 narrative events.",
    "Three word review: Super Smash Brickers",
    "Super Smash Bros. meets Capture the Flag, LEGO Brawls is a chaotic fighting game. Up to eight can play at once.",
    "Three word review: LEGO gets deep",
    "What\u2019s this? A deep and meaningful LEGO game? That\u2019s right. A great way to relax after a session with LEGO Brawls. You complete construction puzzles using, obviously, LEGO bricks.",
    "Three word review: Use the force!",
    "Set your hyperdrive to a galaxy far, far away and lead your favourite LEGO Star Wars characters in this multiplayer game with tower defense battle arenas inspired by different Star Wars locations. Build LEGO towers on the battlefield to defend your base against attacking enemies or capture enemy territories. You can also use characters abilities, like Darth Vader\u2019s force slam or toss enemies away using Luke Skywalker\u2019s force push to disable them.",
    "Three word review: Roll to gold",
    "Play as Leo, a green furball with a moustache, in this award-winning platform adventure game. Your aim is to hunt down a thief who has stolen your gold. Every level is intricately detailed with stunning visuals and lush environments. But don\u2019t let the beauty fool you, as traps and puzzles are scattered throughout the levels.",
    "Three word review: Art meets gaming",
    "A hypnotic and beautiful Apple Arcade title in which you control a little blob of light. Experiment with how Lifelike\u2019s swarms of particles (or creatures) react to solve its levels.",
    "Three word review: Paper plane simulator",
    "Pilot a paper plane through 21 levels. We\u2019ve enjoyed chilled glider games like this since the early days of the App Store. Lifeslide isn\u2019t a true exploration game as you effectively fly downhill through a wide corridor, but sink into it and you\u2019ll feel your heart rate dropping as you relax.",
    "Three word review: High production values",
    "An adventure puzzle-platformer from The Chinese Room, makers of games like Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture and Death Esther, Little Orpheus aims for madcap rather than meaningful. Still, it\u2019s beautiful and has the great sound design you\u2019d expect from a developer with The Chinese Room\u2019s reputation.",
    "Three word review: So very Nickelodeon",
    "Loud House: Outta Control probably isn\u2019t the sort of game you\u2019d expect from a glance. It\u2019s not an adventure or a light role-player. It\u2019s an air traffic control game like iOS classic Flight Control, but you direct family members rather than planes.",
    "Three word review: Illuminating puzzler?",
    "This one is listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d at the time of writing so we haven\u2019t had a chance to play, but it\u2019s one of those familiar puzzlers where you direct light beams to send them to a certain spot in a grid-based play field.",
    "Three word review: Keep on matching",
    "A simple Mahjong game, which means you need to match the tiles to win. With more than 2000 boards available to play, you\u2019ll never get bored \u2013 assuming you\u2019re a fan of Mahjong.",
    "Three word review: Trippy gravity puzzles",
    "A first-person puzzler in which you play with gravity to make progress and, quite possibly, scramble your brain in the process.",
    "Three word review: Marble Madness reborn",
    "Control a marble and guide it through mazes of ever-increasing complexity. Marble It Up: Mayhem! uses a camera that sticks close to your ball for a real sense of speed. Exciting, if perhaps a little too challenging for some, as the controls battle with the later levels\u2019 designs.",
    "Three word review: Fantasy roller disco",
    "A co-op adventure in which the main characters stand atop rolling marbles. Play with friends for the most fun.",
    "Three word review: Become a chef",
    "Become the ultimate chef in MasterChef: Let\u2019s Cook. This is a fun and fast-paced cooking competition game. Compete against other players online, choose the right ingredients and make sure you cook your dishes properly using the touch controls. Once you\u2019ve cooked your dish, MasterChef judges will assess it based on your performance and speed. You can also complete and unlock new recipes, mini-games and challenges along the way.",
    "Three word review: Stress versus calm",
    "Vertical shooters like Mind Symphony are usually high-stress experiences in which you constantly move to avoid enemy fire. This one claims to offer meditative gameplay, at least in its \u201cCalm\u201d mode. The \u201cRelease\u201d play mode offers the more traditional shoot \u2018em up play style. Both are sync\u2019d up to the game\u2019s soundtrack.",
    "Three word review: Be efficient!",
    "In this award-winning game you must design a subway for a growing metropolitan city by drawing lines between stations. However, as new stations begin to open, you\u2019ll have to start redrawing the subway lines to keep them running efficiently. The game ends if you can\u2019t keep the trains moving.",
    "Three word review: Mini Metro Redux",
    "Played Mini Metro? It's a satisfying, if difficult, casual-style metro management sim. Mini Motorways takes the action above ground, and sees you drawing roads to connect a city. This one\u2019s mechanics are even deeper.",
    "Three word review: Colorful musical nonsense",
    "Monomals\u2019 vibrant game world and chip tune-inspired music are sure to put a smile on many faces. You unlock musical notes and elements in the swipe-controlled action levels, and can then compose tunes in the baked-in synthesiser to try to get them up the charts. This one is hard to explain. Just give it a try.",
    "Three word review: Make monster friends",
    "The critically acclaimed JRPG Monster Hunter Stories has made its way onto Apple Arcade. Embark on a new adventure as a Hunter fighting powerful beasts and monsters, all to defeat the threat of the Black Blight. Befriend monster companions and build a bond with them, then they\u2019ll fight beside you in battle and in the multiplayer mode against other online players.",
    "Three word review: Beautiful art piece",
    "Manipulate the beautiful architecture of the environment around you as you guide a princess through optical illusions and hidden paths to outsmart the crow people of Monument Valley. Each world is stunningly designed and could be a work of art in its own right. This game is best experienced with headphones on in order to also hear the atmospheric soundscape of each world you visit.",
    "Three word review: Whodunnit?",
    "A crime-solving adventure in which you have to interview subjects. Has an episodic structure, and the story was written by \u201cprofessional film and TV writers\u201d, apparently.",
    "Three word review: Definitely a grower",
    "Don\u2019t miss Mutazione if you play games for their stories and characters. This is a beautifully drawn adventure. Its developer calls Mutazione a \u201cmutant soap opera\u201d, but forget all the negative associations you may have with that term. The significance here is that the story is informed by the humdrum lives of its characters as much as the grander events that take place in the plot. If you\u2019re up for a slower-paced, contemplative title, check this one out.",
    "Three word review: Play some basketball",
    "Live out your basketball dreams in NBA 2K22 on Apple Arcade. Choose your favourite NBA teams and then take on competitors or other players in an online match. Want to take the game even more seriously? You can become a general manager or head coach in MyCareer mode and you can manage the NBA roster, make trades and scout for new players.",
    "Three word review: Play more basketball",
    "Just like in NBA 2K22, you can fulfill all your basketball dreams in NBA 2K22. Play as your favourite basketball team in a quick match or join your friends online for a head-to-head game. Dive into MyCareer mode and manage your own basketball team, making trades to win games and tournaments.",
    "Three word review: Deathly visual novel",
    "A pretty visual novel heavy on the themes of death and necromancy. Don\u2019t download it for the gameplay. But that applies to every visual novel style game.",
    "Three word review: For cat lovers",
    "If you love cats, this game is a must-have. Discover all kinds of different types of cats in Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector and become a master cat collector. Attract more than 40 different varieties of cats \u2013 plus some rare ones \u2013 with food and toys, then log them in your catbook.",
    "Three word review: Cyberpunk cabbie detective",
    "A novel concept: you are a taxi driver chatting to your passengers. And through those conversations you find more and more about the disappearance of your friend. A compelling but ultimately relaxing experience.",
    "Three word review: Atmospheric platformer",
    "A boy wakes from a coma and finds the world changed. Neversong is an action-puzzle platformer.",
    "Three word review: Mobile space opera",
    "Next Stop Nowhere is a space adventure. You play a courier dragged into a dramatic story. The game was originally criticised for being buggy, but is worth a play if you are a fan of story-driven adventures.",
    "Three word review: Tim Burton\u2019s farm",
    "Maintain a farm. Grow stuff. Wear goth make-up. Nightmare Farm is the kind of game that might be riddled with micro transactions were it not on Apple Arcade.",
    "Three word review: Space Miner II",
    "No Way Home reminds us of one of the greatest mobile games most people haven\u2019t played: Space Miner. It\u2019s a top-down space shooter with twin stick controls. The basic action is fun enough, but the story and mechanic of gathering swag for upgrades elevates it to another level. It supports controllers, too, if you find the touch controls imprecise or fiddly.",
    "Three word review: Damn those squirrels",
    "A highly stylised game with overtly singular mechanics. You set up surveillance cameras around Melmoth Forest to observe the movements of a gang of squirrels. But, of course, the story isn\u2019t quite as simple as that. May remind some of you of Firewatch.",
    "Three word review: Apple Arcade\u2019s Zelda",
    "Oceanhorn 2 is about as close as you can get right now to Zelda: Breath of the Wild on your iPad. Of course, you\u2019ll have a better time with this 10-12 hour adventure if you don\u2019t go in comparing it like-for-like with one of the most celebrated games of the last decade. Oceanhorn 2 is a beautiful open-world title that won\u2019t suck as much of your time as the average console game of this genre.",
    "Three word review: Oceanhorn goes retro",
    "It may be set 200 years after Oceanhorn 2, but Chronos Dungeon takes a more old-school approach. This is a top-down dungeon-crawler RPG. Why not dabble in both Oceanhorns to see which suits?",
    "Three word review: Real-time Hitman Go",
    "Operator 41 is a stealth game with levels broken up into a grid. You might expect a turn-based experience, like that of Hitman Go or Lara Croft Go, but this one takes place in real-time.",
    "Three word review: Build \u2018em up",
    "Build a town and watch it run through the days and weeks. It\u2019s serene and rewarding, and there are no micro transactions involved here. Bliss.",
    "Three word review: FTL Roadtrip Edition",
    "Aliens have invaded. You have to keep your band of survivors alive as you trek across the US. The action is split into ambush events, when you bump into aliens along your travels. These are turn-based, and your job is to survive rather than smash those aliens into dust. As these encounters are randomly generated you could spend dozens of hours playing Overland.",
    "Three word review: Alpine adventure",
    "A narrative-led spy adventure in which your choices influence the story as you travel across Switzerland by train.",
    "Three word review: PAC-Man\u2019s on something",
    "Classic PAC-MAN gameplay is given a 2021 boost with shinier graphics and power-ups. If you can play multiplayer (up to four can play at once) this is a must-try.",
    "Three word review: Bizarre splosh-a-thon",
    "Run around splashing paint onto everything within your reach. But the locals aren\u2019t fans of your redecoration and will start forming a mob to take you out. Fast-paced chaos.",
    "Three word review: Mindful jigsaw puzzles",
    "Patterned is a jigsaw puzzle game. You start off with a pencil sketch and have to reinsert the full-colour pieces into place. It\u2019s a great one to try if the world is getting you down and you need a little zen restored.",
    "Three word review: Charming card adventure",
    "A hand-drawn adventure from the folks behind Machinarium. You pick up cards that represent items. These are used to solve puzzles throughout your travels. Quirky as they come, and a great fit for both iPhone and iPad, you can finish Pilgrims in roughly an hour. It\u2019s a good way to spend part of an evening.",
    "Three word review: Follow the crowd",
    "This one isn\u2019t yet available at the time of writing. Populus Run is an endless runner in which you control a whole group of people rather than just one.",
    "Three word review: It\u2019s about perspective",
    "This quick and clever puzzler plays with 3D space. In each scene you\u2019ll see objects that appear to be disjointed, or floating in the air. You have to move the camera so they appear to be in the \u201cright\u201d place. It\u2019s a relaxing play with a strong sense of visual style.",
    "Three word review: Shadow puppet theatre",
    "One of those \u201cmeaningful\u201d platformers, this time based around shadow puppetry.",
    "Three word review: Sci-fi street fighter",
    "Punch Planet is a one-on-one fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. You don\u2019t see too many of those on iOS.",
    "Three word review: Auto-run Raymond",
    "Like several of the more recent Rayman games, Rayman Mini is an auto-run platformer. This keeps the pace up, making you tear through its lovingly-drawn vistas at speed.",
    "Three-word review: No rules chess",
    "It\u2019s chess, but really bad chess. When you begin, you\u2019re given random chess pieces to play. For example, how about using four queens in a game, why not? This is an excellent twist on the classic board game, which is a fun challenge for chess-lovers and anyone interested in strategy games.",
    "Three word review: Beautiful bogey blaster",
    "A pretty 3D space shooter. Blast your way through levels and upgrade your ship with new shields and weapons.",
    "Three word review: Strategy made simple",
    "A mobile-friendly strategy game from Ninja Kiwi, the developer behind the hugely popular Bloons TD games. It\u2019s no wonder Red Reign\u2019s simplified real-time strategy has a more than hint of tower defense flavor.",
    "Three word review: Keep your throne",
    "Created by the brilliant indie developer Devolver Digital, Reigns is a fun, historical strategy game with events that span centuries. The game allows you to live out your dreams as a medieval monarch as you handle a gauntlet of requests from advisors, peasants, enemies and allies. But these requests come with many serious implications and deadly consequences that could put your reign and family at risk.",
    "Three word review: Rockstars use Tinder",
    "The story: you are a rock band travelling to different planets to raise your profile through the galaxy. The reality: gameplay involves swiping left or right on decision cards. There are also rhythm game-adjacent sections where you drag your guitar across the screen to hit the right notes. It all sounds a bit bizarre, but makes sense in context. Just about.",
    "Three word review: Peggle dungeons",
    "Ever played Peggle? You shoot a ball into an arrangement of blocks you need to bash and hope for the best. Roundguard takes this Pachinko concept and adds to it, making every level a \u201cdungeon\u201d complete with enemies, mana potions and healing potions. Different characters have their own abilities, too, which can be fired-off mid-air.",
    "Three word review: Late 90s action",
    "Samurai Jack is reminiscent of the 3D platformers of a few console generations ago. Of course, it\u2019s much more likely to appeal to a slightly younger audience, those fans of the TV series this game is based around.",
    "Three word review: Rhythm gone wild",
    "This hypnotic, entrancing rhythm game is a must-play, even if you think you\u2019ll end up bouncing right off its play style. The visuals and music are quite something to behold. While the fireworks are going off, you control your character by dragging across the screen to collect objects. It\u2019s best played with a controller as, judging by our playthrough on iPad, the touch controls aren\u2019t great.",
    "Three word review: Streets of Trash",
    "A garbage-themed side-scrolling beat \u2018em up in the vein of Streets of Rage, complete with a soundtrack that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in that era. That\u2019s no trash talk, by the way.",
    "Three word review: AR awkwardness",
    "Want to try iOS augmented reality? Secret Oops! isn\u2019t a bad place to start. The aim is to protect a spy as he goes about his sneaky business.",
    "Three word review: Lauded retro platforming",
    "This is the fifth game in the Shantae series, which is a boon for those who wish game companies had never stopped making the 16-bit platformers that stuffed shelves back in the 90s.",
    "Three word review: Underwater Metroidvania",
    "Capcom\u2019s Shinsekai into the Depths takes exploration elements of the Metroid and Castlevania games and slots them into a beautiful (if kinda creepy) underwater environment.",
    "Three word review: Flying car carnage",
    "Shockrods is a 3D action-packed car deathmatch game where the cars can launch into the air using the equivalent of a jetpack. Silly chaotic fun.",
    "Three word review: Cats and puzzles",
    "Help Simon and his cat in this matching puzzle game. By completing the puzzles, you\u2019ll earn stars to unlock the next phase of the story and win coins to purchase helpful game boosts that\u2019ll assist you in completing challenging levels.",
    "Three word review: Become Tony Hawk",
    "Control your skateboard on this touch-interactive game. Learn new tricks and skills to become a master skateboarder while immersing yourself in the beautiful cities of LA, Barcelona and Miami. Then put all of your skills to the test in challenge mode.",
    "Three word review: Gigantic sword silliness",
    "This one is slightly hilarious. You wield a talking sword that can grow in length in Slash Quest!, and rather than controlling your character directly as such, you control which way the sword points - and you head in that direction. It doesn\u2019t have the depth of a Zelda-a-like, but makes up for it in sheer cuteness.",
    "Three word review: Furry stealth antics",
    "Sneak around town as the hirsute mythical Sasquatch, raiding people\u2019s picnics for goodies. Dripping in character.",
    "Three word review: Traditional football, lads",
    "Sociable Soccer 2020 is a football game for people who like football. So if you like football, give it a go. Others are more likely to appreciate the less strait-laced approach to the sport.",
    "Three word review: Simply just solitaire",
    "This is simple solitaire, with daily challenges, customization options, personal leaderboards and statistics.",
    "Three word review: Storylines for solitaire?",
    "It\u2019s nothing more than solitaire, but now with an exciting and difficult storyline, global challenges and customization options.",
    "Three word review: Guess the song",
    "SongPop Party is a fun, music-based trivia game. Play with family and friends to find out who has the most outstanding musical knowledge by guessing the song. In arena mode, you can challenge other players online in a music trivia frenzy.",
    "Three word review: Mario Kart-a-like",
    "A Mario Kart-style racer featuring Mario\u2019s old nemesis Sonic. It\u2019s one to try if you want something other than Mario Kart Tour, although that game\u2019s dynamics are mostly better than this one\u2019s.",
    "Three word review: Engaging adventure",
    "South of the Circle is a cinematic narrative-led adventure with animations that look almost rotoscoped. Don\u2019t come expecting the most involved, advanced gameplay, but if you want an engaging, well-told story it is well worth trying. Offers around 4 hours of play.",
    "Three word review: Space Marine war",
    "A turn-based isometric strategy game. It\u2019s a little like X-Com, but the simplified game dynamics make each level something of a puzzle to solve.",
    "Three word review: Speed racer",
    "A top-down racing game focused on giving you a sense of speed and traffic-based peril.",
    "Three word review: Clever, simple puzzler",
    "Spek. looks dead simple in screenshots. A ball travels along a line to pick up other objects. But it is a little smarter than that. Each level\u2019s \u201cline\u201d is actually the outline of a 3D model that can be turned around to let the ball, our protagonist, reach new areas.",
    "Three word review: Strategy card game",
    "A turn-based battle game with a card deck mechanic thrown in. The cards look like they\u2019ve been taken straight out of Magic the Gathering thanks to their fetching artwork.",
    "Three word review: Scrabble and Tetris",
    "Combine Scrabble and Tetris and you\u2019ll get SpellTower. Letters rise from the bottom of the screen, and you\u2019ll need to find the words as they appear. But act fast, if letters make it to the top row, the game is over.",
    "Three word review: Keep on swinging",
    "Swing, swing and swing some more in this one-button, calming puzzle game. Avoid obstacles and progress to the next stage in over 250 levels and other daily challenges. Earn new characters and unlock secret challenge modes by getting a perfect score.",
    "Three word review: Thrills from 1995",
    "If it\u2019s still the mid-90s in your heart, you might like Spidersaurs. This action platformer has visuals and sound inspired by 90s cartoons and the games we used to play on Genesis and SNES.",
    "Three word review: Destruction > creation",
    "Spire Blast looks like a tower building game. It's the opposite. You use the familiar colour-matching mechanic to zap blocks, firing balls into the brickwork. The aim is to take down the tower as soon as possible.",
    "Three word review: Audiovisual Spongebob perfection",
    "Patty Pursuit does not re-write the rulebook. It\u2019s a fairly familiar simplified platformer, but it nails its graphics and sound. This one should appeal to all the SpongeBob fans out there. And who doesn\u2019t love SpongeBob?",
    "Three word review: Pretty robot-spy adventure",
    "Crawl around detailed 3D environments as a spider-like spy robot, alongside plenty of cartoony characters. This wouldn\u2019t look out of place on console. We recommend using a pad if you can, though, as we found the touch controls tricky at times.",
    "Three word review: Visually distinctive platforming",
    "This game looks a little different to everything else on Apple Arcade. Thick outlines provide a specific cartoonish style. Definitely one for fans of the side-scroller genre.",
    "Three word review: A Trekkie\u2019s delight",
    "A real treat for Star Trek fans, the basic premise behind Star Trek: Legends is that the Nexus \u2013 that big energy ribbon that deems time and space meaningless \u2013 has brought together all of your most beloved characters in a new ship designed to enter it. Ignore whether that makes sense and revel in the chance to discover new worlds and recruit from more than 40 characters spanning most of the major franchises, like The Next Generation, Voyager and Picard.",
    "Three word review: 2D cinema club",
    "We\u2019re not short of platform games on Apple Arcade. But Stela stands out, because it\u2019s dripping in atmosphere. You can see some of this in screenshots, with all that sepia charm and fog. You\u2019ll need to play to experience its wonderful music, which adds a sense of dread to its monster encounters.",
    "Three word review: One-on-one war games",
    "This is a sci-fi strategy game, a one-on-one battle against another AI player. Planets are split into Risk-like zones, which you need to conquer to win.",
    "Three word review: Survival build\u2019em up",
    "You are stranded on a deserted island. How do you survive? By building copious amounts of stuff, of course. This mostly boils down to farming for food. Combat is introduced later down the line, too.",
    "Three word review: Sudoku but fun",
    "Designed for players who love the idea of Sudoku but find it too complex or tedious. Colors are added to this game, which the creators believe will better train your brain to spot number patterns and inject more fun into the Sudoku. As you get used to the game, you can amp up the difficulty.",
    "Three word review: Hectic ball balancing",
    "Super Impossible Road is a racing game that puts you in control of a glowing ball rather than a car. The tracks snake around like a rollercoaster, but there\u2019s little gravity to keep you stuck to them, so more than half the challenge is not flying off into oblivion. Or at least using the physics to make a cheeky shortcut.",
    "Three word review: Fun retro platformer",
    "A sequel to the original Leap Day, Super Leap Day is a colorful and fun game with a retro vibe. It\u2019s a platform game, so you need to run, jump, blast through blocks, avoid traps, and collect prizes along the way. You can play as different characters to test their special powers, like floating with an inflatable head or sticking to walls. The aim is to complete each level and collect a gold cup at the end. A new level is added each day to keep the game fresh.",
    "Three word review: Fun with friends",
    "A mini-game collection with bright, colorful 3D graphics. Like almost every mini-game library, Super Mega Mini Party is much better played with friends.",
    "Three word review: Golf with friends",
    "This 2D golf puzzle game features a range of different crazy courses where you can discover power-ups, collectible cards and wild game modes. You can play on your own or with up to 8 friends in multiplayer mode to battle it out in real-time and be in with a chance of bagging the virtual cup.",
    "Three word review: Zombie blaster",
    "This one wasn\u2019t available at the time of writing, but Survival\u2019s zombie action is sure to rack-up a few downloads on day one.",
    "Three word review: Beat the drum",
    "Taiko no Tatsujin is a traditional Japanese drumming rhythm game that\u2019s been redesigned for Apple Arcade. Ideal for those who like simple music challenges, you have to tap the drum in sync with the notes. Each attempt will be ranked, and you fill the Soul Gauge the better you do. Although the premise might sound simple, there are many different modes, difficulty levels and costumes to collect to keep gameplay fresh and fun.",
    "Three word review: Tear-jerker",
    "Takeshi makes games for fun. His brother Hiroshi ends up in hospital and Takeshi decides to make him games to cheer him up. The story, told in claymation interludes, is the main draw here. But what a central conceit.",
    "Three word review: Chest infection",
    "Open up a chest. Then try to open up another chest with the same number inside to clear the pair. It\u2019s that old memory game conceit, back in Apple Arcade form.",
    "Three word review: A knotty mystery",
    "Put together clues and solve puzzles to untangle the knots in this murder mystery story. An adventure that truly feels made for the touchscreen.",
    "Three word review: Color matching adventure",
    "Super popular Temple Run returns with a new Apple Arcade game that\u2019s got hundreds upon hundreds of levels of colour and shape matching puzzles. Each puzzle helps the main character, adventurer, archaeologist and Temple Runner Scarlett Fox, overcome obstacles in her path and brings her closer to unlocking the secrets of ancient sites and temples.",
    "Three word review: Block stacking beats",
    "This is the Tetris you already know and love but with a thumping soundtrack of tunes from artists like Alison Wonderland, GARZA, Hannah Diamond and Octo Octa, which add a bassy rhythm to your block stacking and update every month. If you manage to stick to the beat, you can ramp up your score, but you can also select Marathon mode to pick your own music for a more classic Tetris experience.",
    "Three word review: Puzzling walking sim",
    "The Bradwell Conspiracy is a walking sim on the face of it. 3D first-person perspective. Check. Mystery to unwind. Check. But there are some more challenging puzzles here than in plenty of other walking sims.",
    "Three word review: Monochrome meditation",
    "Walk through a pretty monochrome world, collecting pieces of images and words floating in the air to complete cod-philosophical collages in each area. This one may not be for everyone, but it weaves a particular spell that may draw you into its enigmatic world.",
    "Three word review: Slide, slide, slide",
    "The Enchanted World is a slider puzzler with a pretty layer of fantasy gloss on top, giving you another reason to keep playing.",
    "Three word review: One for readers",
    "Visual novel chapters interspersed with logic puzzles.",
    "Three word review: Mournful but magical",
    "There\u2019s a soulful loneliness to The Last Campfire that gives its shadowed world a sense of magic. It\u2019s a lovely game, brought together by a rather wonderful voice over narration and affecting score. The gameplay is based around light puzzling, with either tap-to-navigate controls or a virtual joystick. But the emphasis on storytelling gives this game an unusual weight. Recommended.",
    "Three word review: Musical adventure",
    "A puzzler-adventure that looks like a goofy kid\u2019s game, but has hidden depths. Its aural soundscapes are much more like those of the navel-gazing games critics tend to love. Music also features in the puzzle-solving, as locks require different note combinations from the sounds you and companions you meet can make.",
    "Three word review: Loneliness of crowds",
    "A downbeat adventure about the loneliness of cities, peppered with surreal elements.",
    "Three word review: It\u2019s adventure time",
    "Based on a series of educational games, this version is designed for Apple Arcade. The idea is, you\u2019re making a trip from Missouri to Oregon in the late 1800s and learning all about the nature, trail and people you meet along the way. But you\u2019ll need to manage your inventory, take care of your wagon, see to the health and morale of the people you\u2019re travelling with, and much more \u2013 some events are procedurally selected, so each play feels fresh.",
    "Three word review: Fantasy board game",
    "A turn-based strategy game in which you battle creatures from another dimension and juggle action points to make sure you're not caught short. It\u2019s presented like a classic board game, which is nice.",
    "Three word review: Where am I?",
    "An open-world game from the creators of Abzu, a highly directed and kinda magical experience. Is this one as good? There\u2019s certainly more to explore, and a willingness to do so is key to enjoying this singular title. Go in with an open mind, but you can always look online if you end up with no idea as to what you\u2019re meant to do.",
    "Three word review: Pinball dungeon crawler",
    "What a mash-up. This is pinball, in which your ball becomes the weapon to take out rooms of fantasy-themed nasties. Strange, but kinda works.",
    "Three word review: Creepy pocket puzzler",
    "The Room was an award-winning game and now its sequel, The Room Two+, brings all the best bits back for a new and mysterious escape room puzzle in your pocket. This game weaves a compelling story with gorgeous visuals, challenging puzzles, eerie audio and a super creepy atmosphere to delight fans of spooky stories. Its pick up and play design means you can easily catch up where you left off, but it\u2019s one you\u2019ll want to stay up all night to finish \u2013 while hiding under the duvet, of course.",
    "Three word review: Retro Don\u2019t Starve",
    "You guessed it. The Survivalists is a survival game, in which you gather provisions and craft stuff to cobble together the makings of a miniature civilization.",
    "Three word review: Exorcist goes inanimate",
    "A rather strange game in which you possess inanimate objects, which then become your \u201ccharacter\u201d in an all-on-all fighting game set in a suburban house.",
    "Three word review: Simple sticky sums",
    "Slide number tiles around the screen to create three or numbers that are multiples of three. If this sounds achingly simple, wait until you\u2019re a few minutes in, Threes!+ is oddly addictive, and the more you slide the tiles around, the more you can\u2019t stop thinking in terms of three. It\u2019s a super sticky game for anyone with a soft spot for number puzzles who doesn\u2019t want anything too taxing on the brain.",
    "Three word review: Neon space racing",
    "High-energy, fast-paced and set to a booming soundtrack, Thumper: Pocket Edition is well worth downloading if you enjoy the thrill of racing games with a futuristic twist. There are no cars or cute go-karts here. Instead, you\u2019re a shiny space beetle hurtling along neon race tracks before facing big boss battles. The gorgeous graphics and sound create a Tron-like vibe that\u2019s both hypnotic and a massive adrenaline buzz.",
    "Three word review: Mindful coloring-in",
    "A relaxing painterly puzzler that may even teach you a little about color theory. You drag realistic-looking watercolour paint across the screen, blending colours to complete levels.",
    "Three word review: Upgrade your vocab",
    "If you often buy a newspaper just to crack the crossword in the back, this game is for you. Tiny Crossword+ brings you access to thousands of crosswords and a fresh one is introduced every day with a different theme. If you\u2019re sick of mindless games that only require you to tap the screen, this is a refreshing change that\u2019ll get you thinking and improve your vocab while you\u2019re at it.",
    "Three word review: Learn to fly",
    "You\u2019re a tiny bird with tiny wings and need all the help you can get from rolling hills to push you up into the air and fly. The game\u2019s goal is to keep moving, sliding and flying before the night rolls in behind you. One tap pushes you forward and up, which is why this game is mesmerising and oddly soothing. Especially because procedurally generated graphics mean each time you visit Tiny Wings+ land, you\u2019ll see a different, colorful world unfold around you.",
    "Three word review: Blast 'em up",
    "A shooter that vacillates between a single-stick and dual-stick style between levels. Has visuals inspired by anime series.",
    "Three word review: Eye of beholder",
    "Towers of Everland is a grid-based dungeon crawler, the kind popular in the early 90s and made popular again by titles like Legend of Grimrock.",
    "Three word review: Robots in di-cards",
    "Take part in real-time strategy battles against players worldwide using teams of your favorite characters from the Transformers series. Collect and level up different cards to build a squad that fits your playstyle to become the best player in the game.",
    "Three word review: X-Files lite",
    "This short adventure game sees you follow a tightly-scripted sequence in each level. Your control consists of operating your DSLR camera, to take pictures of UFOs and other phenomena to send to the \u201cfake news media\u201d. Hmm.",
    "Three word review: Super-speed ice hockey",
    "Fast paced ice hockey, played 3-on-3. Features, for some reason, players from the NBA, NFL and MLB, and others, as well as famous hockey stars.",
    "Three word review: Steven Universe RPG",
    "If you\u2019re a fan of the Steven Universe series, then Unleash the Light is the perfect Apple Arcade game for you. On your RPG adventure, you can play as eight different characters from the series, including Steven, Garnet and Lapis Lazuli as you face off against two mysterious new Prism-wielding Gems. The story is co-written by Steven Universe creator Rebecca Sugar and even uses the series\u2019 voice actors.",
    "Three word review: For JRPG fans",
    "This is one of the more specialist games on Apple Arcade at the time of writing. It\u2019s a JRPG, but not the kind you may have played before, as it\u2019s made for shorter play sessions.",
    "Three word review: Hover racing deluxe",
    "Warp Drive is a futuristic racer where the cars hover and the environments fly past at 1000mph when you hit a warp boost. Not the most exciting racer ever designed in terms of feel, but not bad.",
    "Three word review: Turtle vs Sonic",
    "An accessible platformer suitable for just about all ages.",
    "Three word review: Hilarious non-golf mania",
    "One of the few games those who have never used Apple Arcade may already know. What the Golf? is hugely inventive, throwing away all the conventions of a golf game. Much more than just a silly gag, What the Golf? even ends up having some of the sensibility of Valve's Portal games. Who\u2019d have thought it? The one bit that is golfy: you flick back on the screen to choose your swing strength. Don\u2019t miss it.",
    "Three word review: Arty-looking puzzler",
    "A puzzler with emotional story sections between its levels.",
    "Three word review: Short, charming puzzler",
    "Flicks up and sideways manipulate and turn the globes of Winding Worlds\u2019 levels. These are the keys to solving its puzzles. Light and cute.",
    "Three word review: Captain Toad maker",
    "If you\u2019ve enjoyed the diorama based gameplay of Captain Toad but hungered to make your own levels, that\u2019s what you get with Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker. The story campaigns are a little short, but there are thousands of player creations to explore, and thanks to various in-game tools, you\u2019ll be able to create a narrative through the levels you make.",
    "Three word review: Simple word matching",
    "Match up letters and pairs of letters to make words that match the pictures in each scene. It\u2019s simple, but may be just the light brain stimulation you\u2019re after.",
    "Three word review: Become the samurai",
    "Platinum Games is known for major PC and Console action games, like Nier Replicant and the Bayonetta series, and they\u2019ve brought all their expertise to World of Demons. This hack and slash adventure brings their flashy action to iOS devices as you take on the role of a samurai on a quest against evil.",
    "Three word review: Underwater battle royale",
    "With a plot similar to classic movie Battle Royale, it\u2019s no great surprise this game is mostly about the plot. You get to interact with 12 characters, our group of pre-teen survivors. Gameplay seems basic, but the Japanese voice acting sounds neat.",
    "Three word review: Infinite word puzzles This game is like Scrabble, but instead of letters, you\u2019re given whole words, and your goal is to place a certain number of them on the board without running out of words or space. It\u2019s simple but perfect for keeping your brain active on a lazy afternoon \u2013 and thanks to its intelligent algorithm, it boasts you\u2019ll never run out of puzzles to solve.",
    "Three word review: Unusual RPG",
    "A role-playing game set in a world of Slavic folk tales. This gives it quite a different vibe to other RPGs on Apple Arcade.",
    "Three word review: Virtual classic pinball Zen are experts at creating virtual pinball machines, and Pinball Party is no exception. The game features a massive range of tables \u2013 with a healthy mix of Zen\u2019s own creations, tables based on popular franchises and even classic Williams pinball tables. If you want to play pinball on the go, this is a great option.",
    "Three word review: Pinball castle defense",
    "This is a fun mix of pinball and castle defense. Zombies attack your stronghold. You bash them with the ball and flippers. There are even RPG elements, with a map screen to head between missions and loot-based upgrades.",
    "Three word review: Low-key zoo builder Zookeeper World blends match-three puzzles with a chill zoo simulator that is much less restrictive than the free-to-play game version. With a cute art style that looks like it\u2019s been lifted from the Nintendo DS era, you\u2019ll be playing for hours and hours as you work to clear its over 200 levels.",
    "Still not convinced Apple Arcade is worth the investment? Check out our comprehensive review for our verdict on the premium gaming service."
