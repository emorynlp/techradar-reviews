    "The holiday shopping season is a good time to pick up a mattress for less than normal, so if you have been waiting to find a good price on the best mattress for your sleep needs, now is the time to buy.",
    "That\u2019s because this year's Black Friday mattress deals have finally arrived (and we're tracking the Cyber Monday mattress sales too) and there are decent savings to choose from, with up to 50% off from leading sleep brands including Nectar, PlushBeds, Serta, Emma, DreamCloud, Saatva and more.",
    "But choosing between these Black Friday deals can seem overwhelming at first, so where do you start? Right here, with our stress-free beginner\u2019s guide to Black Friday mattress shopping. We\u2019ve created it to help you find your dream bed with ease - and with the biggest possible discount.",
    "So here\u2019s what to keep in mind when shopping for a mattress during the Black Friday, beginning with two of our favourite offers so far...",
    "Memory foam mattresses are designed to provide pressure relief and a cradling effect on your body, where you sink slightly into the bed. This makes them a great choice for side sleepers who need extra cushioning around their hips, shoulders and knees.",
    "Innerspring mattresses combine coils with soft padding and are great for stomach sleepers. Latex is naturally cooling and bouncy, so these mattresses are fast to respond to changes in movement, making them ideal for combi sleepers and couples.",
    "Hybrid mattresses combine springs with other materials such as memory foam, gel and latex. These suited all sleepers, especially back, stomach and combi sleepers. Memory foam tends to be the cheapest option, with latex at the priciest end.",
    "Below is a quick guide to mattresses and sleeping positions, and to learn more check out our feature on how to choose a mattress.",
    "Every manufacturer claims to make the best beds, but from our experience, a few brands stand apart from the rest. And for such an important health purchase you want to make sure that you\u2019re buying from a trusted sleep brand.",
    "What does that actually mean? We believe that a good mattress brand not only makes high quality beds that are built to last, but also asks a fair price for the build quality and sleep features.",
    "They should also offer a useful mattress trial period (100 nights is the average), a comprehensive warranty (10 years is the standard) and a clear returns policy that doesn\u2019t make you jump through hoops.",
    "You\u2019ll also want strong customer service and plenty of ways to contact them before, during and after purchase. For expert shopping advice on some of the biggest mattress sales around, check out our following guides:",
    "It can seem appealing to go for the cheapest option when you\u2019re on a very tight budget. However, this is often a false economy for your bank balance and health. A cheap mattress won\u2019t last long and it won\u2019t support your body and sleep to the level you need.",
    "Chances are you\u2019ll be looking for another mattress in a couple of Black Fridays\u2019 time, so it pays to spend a little extra now and get a bed that will help you sleep better for several years to come.",
    "Thankfully, the affordable mattress market is getting better each year, and that\u2019s because innovative materials and various cooling and comfort technologies are trickling down from the higher-end beds. You\u2019ll find a number of bed-in-a-box brands doing this, including Emma, Nectar, Zinus, Simba and DreamCloud.",
    "With so many purchases being made online, how do you know whether a particular mattress will suit your body and sleep needs? Fortunately, most mattress manufacturers offer a risk-free trial period so that you can test your new bed at home and then return it if it isn\u2019t right for you.",
    "You\u2019ll need to make sure that the mattress is kept in good condition (use a mattress protector at all times). Provided you do this, you can return the mattress for a refund if you change your mind during the trial period.",
    "Most manufacturers offer a trial of around 100 nights, although there are shorter and longer trials. Here\u2019s a quick rundown:",
    "The combination of money off and free gifts is the holy grail of mattress offers. Not only are you saving money, but you\u2019re getting free bedding that would normally cost a fair amount to purchase separately.",
    "What free gifts should you expect? We\u2019ve found that most brands offer a combination of products such as pillows, sheets sets and mattress protectors. Nectar, for example, even throws in a free Google Nest Hub 2nd Gen with sleep-sensing.",
    "The right mattress for the way you sleep makes all the difference to how quickly you drift off, how often you wake up in the night, and how refreshed you feel in the morning. Back sleepers need a medium firm mattress to help keep the spine in alignment \u2013 hybrid mattresses are ideal here.",
    "Side sleepers usually need softer mattresses to provide pressure relief and nothing does the job better than memory foam. Stomach sleepers should look for a firm mattress to keep the hips and shoulders aligned. Combination sleepers should choose latex or hybrid models that provide medium firm support.",
    "Not ready to buy yet or can\u2019t find anything you like on Black Friday? Don\u2019t worry \u2013 there are plenty of other opportunities to find cheap mattresses. Cyber Monday is just a few days after Black Friday, followed by Christmas and even the New Year sales.",
    "Beyond this, Memorial Day and Labor Day are great opportunities to buy a quality mattress at a cheaper price. Some of the top mattress brands also offer regular sales and bundle offers throughout the year, there are plenty of opportunities to save.",
    "That said, we\u2019re now seeing some of the biggest discounts we\u2019ve seen all year, so if you do need to buy now, we\u2019d recommend checking out the following:"
