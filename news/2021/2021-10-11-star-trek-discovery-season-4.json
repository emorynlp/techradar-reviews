    "Star Trek: Discovery season 4 will warp onto Paramount Plus on November 18, 2021, and a new trailer has dropped as the date gets closer.",
    "With Michael Burnham now installed as the captain of the ship \u2013 the show's fourth commanding officer in as many years \u2013 Star Trek: Discovery season 4 will see the crew continuing to explore the distant future of the 32nd century. Having solved the mystery of the so-called \u201cBurn\u201d that had rendered warp travel impossible, and defeated the criminal empire of the Emerald Chain, attentions should now be turning to restoring the Federation to its former glories. Unfortunately, it sounds like a new antagonist is about to get in the way, in the form of a dangerous gravitational anomaly five light years across.",
    "With Saru, Tilly, Stamets, Culber and all the principal bridge crew back in action, Star Trek: Discovery 4 is set to continue the franchise's ongoing adventures on the final frontier. Here's everything you need to know, but be warned \u2013 Spoilers lie ahead for anyone yet to watch the previous seasons.",
    "Release date: Star Trek Discovery season 4 will release on November 18 in the US. The show will roll out on Paramount Plus in the US, and is expected to stream on Netflix elsewhere.",
    "Story: With Burnham now installed as captain, as mentioned above, the USS Discovery will contend with a massive gravitational anomaly in the 32nd century \u2013 the idea is that the crew is dealing with a massive problem to solve this season rather than a specific villain.",
    "Is there a trailer? Yes. A first teaser for Discovery season 4 debuted in April 2021, and another full trailer dropped in October 2021.",
    "It was confirmed at the Star Trek Day event on September 8 that Star Trek: Discovery season 4 will debut on November 18 in the US.",
    "The show will release on Paramount Plus, the rebranded version of CBS All Access. Outside the US we expect that \u2013 like the previous seasons \u2013 the show will stream on Netflix, where it's usually available within hours of its American debut.",
    "The previous season had barely even started airing when Star Trek: Discovery season 4 got the official greenlight on October 16, 2020. Two weeks later, on November 2, production got underway at the show\u2019s Toronto base, and continued until August 2021 \u2013 the end of shooting was confirmed in a tweet from showrunner Michelle Paradise.",
    "Inevitably, Covid-19 restrictions were a major factor in the shoot. For starters, as dictated by Canadian rules, the cast had to isolate for two weeks before coming to set.",
    "Star Trek: Discovery season 4 also reportedly took advantage of a pipeline put in place for the previous season, after coronavirus restrictions kicked in. \u201cOur editors, miraculously and heroically, took their editing bays into their living rooms,\u201d Alex Kurtzman, executive producer and overseer of Star Trek\u2019s current raft of TV shows, told IndieWire. \u201cWe also scored the entire season [3], mixed the entire season, color-timed the entire season, all from [a] laptop.\u201d",
    "Reports suggest the process was further refined on Star Trek: Discovery season 4, with Space.com revealing that the show will make use of the groundbreaking augmented reality LED screens pioneered by The Mandalorian. Suddenly the fact that travel for location filming was off the table didn't seem quite so much of a problem...",
    "A first teaser trailer for Star Trek: Discovery season 4 was unveiled at the First Contact Day virtual event in April 2021 \u2013 watch it above. A second, fuller trailer dropped at New York Comic Con 2021, which you can check out below.",
    "This is the current roll call for Star Trek: Discovery season 4:",
    "It\u2019s a case of \u2018as you were\u2019, with most of the established cast returning for another tour of duty \u2013 presumably they\u2019re excited to be wearing new-look, Trek-appropriate primary-colored uniforms that don\u2019t look quite so much like tracksuits.",
    "It goes without saying that Sonequa Martin-Green is back as Captain Michael Burnham, and even though her predecessor in the big chair, Saru, has relocated to his home planet of Kaminar, Doug Jones still has a part to play. \u201cIt felt important for all of our characters to find new layers for them, to find new place for them to go, new things for our actors to play, and new ways for the characters to go,\u201d showrunner Michelle Paradise told TVInsider. \u201c[In season 3 we highlighted] that Saru hasn\u2019t had a huge connection to Kaminar since leaving, and in a season that is all about connection \u2013 family connection and cultural connection \u2013 it seemed like an organic place to explore that theme with him.\u201d",
    "Among the lead cast, Anthony Rapp and Wilson Cruz reprise their roles as Lt Cmdr Paul Stamets and Dr Hugh Culber, while season 3 standout David Ajala is back as the 32nd century\u2019s most famous feline owner, Cleveland \u2018Book\u2019 Booker. (Sadly, a Grudge the Cat spin-off is yet to be announced.) And surely Mary Wiseman\u2019s Sylvia Tilly will be looking to make the First Officer role her own.",
    "\u201c[Saru] sees strength in [Tilly] she doesn\u2019t quite see in herself necessarily,\u201d Paradise said in TVInsider. \u201cThen, [we watched] her over the course of the season become more confident in herself to the place where she\u2019s ultimately able to serve as Number One, and having to essentially be acting captain in this crisis situation, where she handles herself beautifully. What does that mean to come is, I\u2019m sure, a question she\u2019ll be asking herself and we\u2019ll be exploring in Season 4.\u201d",
    "The supporting bridge crew will surely be hoping to have a few more stories of their own, continuing their slow evolution from background players to actual characters \u2013 now we know that Lt Joann Owosekun (Oyin Oladejo) can hold her breath for 10 minutes, the sky\u2019s the limit. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what \u2013 if anything \u2013 is in store for Lt Keyla Detmer (Emily Coutts), Lt Gen Rhys (Patrick Kwok-Choon), Lt R.A. Bryce (Ronnie Rowe) and Lt Nilsson (Sara Mitich).",
    "Third season newcomer Blu del Barrio also returns as Adira, human host of the Trill symbiont Tal, along with their boyfriend, Gray (Ian Alexander). Dr Culber\u2019s efforts to give Gray \u2013 who can only be seen and heard by Adira \u2013 physical form will be a big part of the season, as Gray becomes more and more integrated with the crew. \u201cFor season 4 I\u2019ve had a lot more hands-on involvement, like my suggestions for the future of Gray,\u201d Alexander told Inverse. \u201cThey already have so much planned. Michelle [Paradise] and Alex [Kurtzman] already have this vision that I\u2019ve very, very excited for everyone to be able to see.\u201d",
    "\u201cCulber does make a promise in our season three finale to Gray that, \u2018You will be truly seen,\u2019\u201d Paradise said on a Discovery panel at Outfest (via TrekMovie). \u201cAnd we absolutely do pay that off in season four. That storyline and making sure we pay it off is hugely important.\u201d It was confirmed by Wilson Cruz (Dr Culber) at Star Trek Day (via Variety) that Gray will be gaining a corporeal form in Star Trek: Discovery season 4.",
    "Anthony Rapp, who plays Stamets, added that Stamets, Culber, Adira and Gray will become a family in Star Trek: Discovery season 4: \u201cParenting \u2013 they\u2019re not children but they are young people \u2013 the pressures of how to be available to be a mentor or guide or parent in the face of job responsibilities and sort of crises, that\u2019s an interesting sort of sub-thread through the through the season\u2026 There\u2019s more in the ways Paul and Hugh continue to evolve in their relationship. This is certainly explored also in this season.\u201d",
    "And there\u2019ll be at least two familiar faces at Federation headquarters, where Oded Fehr (Admiral Charles Vance) and legendary movie director David Cronenberg (the mysterious Kovich) will be pulling some strings behind the scenes.",
    "Michelle Paradise is keeping her cards closer to her chest than The Next Generation crew at one of their regular poker games, though she did admit to TVInsider in January 2021 that the Discovery crew are hanging around in the 32nd century, rather than looking for a way back to their original pre-Kirk-and-Spock timeline. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of [the crew] knew going into that at the end of season 2 that this is a one-way trip. Now that they are here, we\u2019re not looking to go back.\u201d",
    "What does that mean for plotlines? \u201cI don\u2019t want to speak specifically to themes, but we do have them!\u201d she joked to ComicBook.com. \u201cI think season 4 will absolutely continue the kinds of things we were doing in season 3, in that we do have very strong themes that we\u2019re exploring. Star Trek: The Original Series explored present-day things via sci-fi. And that\u2019s what we did in season 3, and I think that\u2019s just baked into what Star Trek does.",
    "\u201cUltimately the thing that really resonates, I think, with people is, what are our characters experiencing? What are they going through? How are they connecting with one another? What are the challenges they\u2019re facing and how do they overcome them individually and then as a family? All of that I think will continue.\u201d",
    "With the Emerald Chain out of the way, it looks like the threat in Star Trek: Discovery season 4 will be rather different this time out. The trailer reveals that the crew is dealing with a gravitational anomaly \u201cfive light years across\u201d, rather than a specific human or alien foe \u2013 a force that, as Tilly explains, \u201ccould go anywhere, and we may not have any kind of warning at all\u201d.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re actually exploring \u2013 we\u2019re diving deep into science \u2013 in the fourth season, in a kind of new and interesting way,\u201d said Kurtzman in a panel hosted by Deadline (via TrekMovie). \u201cThere have been many kinds of villains over the course of Star Trek. What happens when the villain is not actually any kind of living, breathing entity, but something else? How do you solve that problem?\u201d",
    "Could we be looking at something technological Discovery season 2's hostile AI, Control? Or a lethal inorganic structure like the Crystalline Entity from Star Trek: The Next Generation? ScreenRant has suggested the rather plausible theory that the anomaly could be V\u2019Ger, the rogue space probe from Star Trek: The Motion Picture. In the finale of that movie, V\u2019Ger merged with USS Enterprise first officer Will Decker to attain a new level of consciousness \u2013 who knows what it might be capable of nearly a thousand years later...",
    "We can expect Star Trek: Discovery season 4 to follow a similar structure to previous years, with each season based around a self-contained story arc, with just a few loose ends left untied.",
    "\u201cDiscovery has that sort of serialized, season-long story baked into its DNA,\u201d Paradise said in an interview with Inverse. \u201cWe also wanted to give the show a more episodic feel in season 3. We got to explore a story of the week or a villain of the week \u2013 it gives us time to explore some of our characters who we normally wouldn\u2019t have time to explore. That was definitely a choice on our part and will continue on our show.\u201d",
    "With the origins of the so-called \u2018Burn\u2019 revealed \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed it was caused by a grieving kid with a symbiotic relationship to a planet made of dilithium? \u2013 and Osyraa and her Emerald Chain defeated, Star Trek: Discovery season 4 flies into uncharted waters.",
    "Hopefully that means that Discovery and the crew can use the spore drive to truly explore the strange new worlds of the 32nd century \u2013 though, given this show\u2019s love of callbacks to earlier series, it\u2019s almost inevitable we\u2019ll meet some familiar faces and species. (The presence in the trailer of a Federation official \u2013 possibly the president \u2013 who has a mix of human and Cardassian facial features suggests that those long-standing Deep Space Nine foes may be up for a comeback, this time in the Starfleet camp.)",
    "Part of Starfleet's remit will be rebuilding a Federation that's a shadow of what it was 900 years earlier. The trailer suggests that many worlds will have to pull together to defeat a threat that affects Federation and non-Federation \u201cequally\u201d \u2013 as Burnham puts it, \u201cWe are not in this alone\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe Federation is coming back together but it\u2019s not fully back together,\u201d Kurtzman told the aforementioned Deadline panel. \u201cAnd so the continued mission of bringing other worlds in and meeting the criteria and standards of what it means to be a member of the Federation but also not to rob other cultures of their identity is something that we\u2019ll explore.\u201d",
    "The biggest ongoing question Star Trek: Discovery season 4 needs to address is the nature of the \u2018Sphere Data\u2019, the ancient alien intelligence now integrated with Discovery\u2019s databanks. Protecting it was the reason the ship made the one-way trip to the future in the first place, and it seems to be repaying the favor \u2013 first by helping the crew\u2019s mental wellbeing, then by helping Tilly to forcibly eject the Emerald Chain from the ship. It\u2019s a story that seems to be heading towards Short Trek episode \u2018Calypso\u2019, set in a distant future where Discovery is run by a sentient computer.",
    "\u201c\u2018Calypso\u2019 is incredible,\u201d Paradise told ComicBook.com. \u201cAnd it is now a part of Trek canon, but specifically our show\u2019s canon. It takes place many, many years beyond where our heroes are right now, and at some point, we will absolutely have to match up with that so that Discovery as a whole, including \u2018Calypso\u2019, all fits together as a piece.",
    "\u201cCertainly, bringing in that voice in episode four and having \u2013 we\u2019ll call her Zora, she doesn't have a name at this point \u2013 but having her hide in the DOTs [helper robots on board Discovery] and be part of the story is the beginning of driving toward that. And eventually \u2013 who knows when? \u2013 we will absolutely have to make sure that we sync up with that.\u201d",
    "And then there\u2019s the small matter of Stamets having issues with the way Burnham left his husband, Dr Culber, in a radiation-filled nebula in the season 3 finale. \u201cI think that\u2019s one they\u2019ll get past in time,\u201d Paradise said in TVLine."
