    "Rumors that there will be a PS5 and Xbox Series X restock this weekend at Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers in the US have taken over Twitter. But that's doubtful - our sources at key American retailers don't have good news for people waiting on a rare weekend restock.",
    "Nor should they \u2013 weekend restock news is very rare in 2021. Only Amazon has had a PS5 restock on the weekend in recent memory (it was just after 3am EDT). Instead, you have a much better chance of finding the Xbox Series X and PS5 in stock during weekday 'console drops', and we're confident that multiple retailers will have a restock during the new week, based on our intel.",
    "Everyone is obviously anxious to see the PS5 and Xbox Series X in stock, and given the fact that it's Father's Day in the US on June 20, there's extra emphasis on getting a brand new console. Of course, hype doesn't always generate actual restock news.",
    "The excitement has spilled over into Twitter, but the facts just don't back that up. There are also people claiming a Sony Direct PS5 restock and virtual queue for Sunday, June 6. Yet Sony has never restocked its console on weekends in 2021.",
    "These rumors aren't unexpected. This past week was a short week, and we saw one-and-a-half PS5 restock events \u2013 and just one Xbox Series X restock. Best Buy had both consoles, while Walmart threw out maybe a dozen PS5 consoles overnight on Thursday at 3:10am. Very few people were satisfied with either restock. Technically we did see a Newegg Shuffle on Friday, but that was a lottery for a bundle.",
    "Here's what we're expecting in the new week.",
    "The Walmart PS5 restock date could be June 10 at 2:30pm EDT or 3pm EDT and, by that point, the largest retailer in the US won't have had the consoles for three weeks. Well, it didn't have a restock this past week in a major way, at least. Walmart did a stealth PS5 Digital console restock on Thursday at 3:10am (don't worry if you missed it \u2013 barely anyone got them).",
    "Walmart usually PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks on Thursdays in 2021, though it doesn't have the PS5 and Xbox every Thursday.",
    "The last Best Buy PS5 and Xbox Series X restock was Thursday, June 3, as TechRadar had previously reported accurately. The electronics retailer also sold RTX 3080 Ti GPU stock in person at stores on the same date, but this Best Buy PS5 and Xbox restock today was online-only and happened in two short waves starting at 9:37am EDT.",
    "It's gotten harder to nail down when Best Buy will restock news simply because it went from consistently launching orders at midday on Fridays (for seven weeks in a row), to opening up orders on Thursdays afternoons (for two weeks in a row), to having a restock on a Monday morning (we think that was meant for the latter half of the prior week, but Best Buy didn't have shipments in yet). Now we're back to Thursdays (twice in a row).",
    "All the more reason to pay attention to our PS5 and Xbox restock Twitter tracker for Best Buy alerts like this one:",
    "The GameStop PS5 and Xbox Series X restock happened three Wednesdays in a row \u2013 until this week. It's a short week and the video game retailer is likely catching up on inventory (we were surprised it went 3-for-3 on Wednesdays without fail before). We know it's almost always at 2pm EDT (online-only not in stores). The good news is that, like Walmart, GameStop usually sends us the news in advance.",
    "GameStop has bundles, and recently, the US retailer has stuck to packing in MLB The Show for PS5 and Xbox, and Returnal for PS5. While many complain about being forced to buy games, accessories (like an extra controller) and a gift card, making the PS5 price on average $729, this tactic does deter resellers who scoop up the PS5 or Xbox console at other stores and resell it for much higher prices.",
    "Target has changed things up recently. Local Target stores can get the Xbox Series X restock at any time and make it available for an online purchase. The PS5 restock at Target, however, happens on specific drop dates. We usually have a good idea of when, and in 2021, it's always on a Wednesday or Thursday at around 7:40am EDT.",
    "The next Wednesday and Thursday on the calendar is June 9 and June 10, and since the last Target PS5 restock was on Thursday, May 27 at about 7:40am EDT, we're going to keep an eye out and send you an alert if it happens to be in the new week.",
    "The Sony Direct PS5 restock was two weeks ago today, and we've known that it was going to be the last one for some time simply because our Twitter replies indicated that many of the lucky PS5 buyers received 'delayed shipment' notices. This usually means that Sony Direct will halt PS5 sales for the foreseeable future. And here were are two weeks later without another PS5 drop from Sony Direct.",
    "It's nearly time for Sony's official store for the PlayStation brand to sell PS5 consoles again, judging from previous instances in which a shipment delay put the retailer on hiatus. The good news about Sony Direct PS5 restocks are they're usually fairer than other stores thanks to a virtual queue that randomizes who gets to buy the PS5.",
    "There's no indication of a Sony Direct PS5 restock this week (hence why it's at the bottom of the list).",
    "The next Amazon restock is the most controversial of them all simply because it nearly had two restocks in as many days last week. We saw thousands of people get a PS5 Disc from our restock alert on Wednesday, May 26, yet no one was able to get it the next day when there was a supposed second PS5 restock (the add-to-cart button was turned on for about 30 minutes).",
    "That means one of two things: Amazon does have PS5 and Xbox Series X inventory and it'll probably have another restock soon after Memorial Day, or it was a wider Amazon.com glitch and the add-to-cart button was never meant to go live (as in they didn't actually have consoles to begin with). We're tracking Amazon just in case it's the former. But we also know Amazon has waited between 15 and 54 days between restocks, so there's no telling when PS5 will be back in stock at Amazon.",
    "We'll continue to update our PS5 and Xbox Series X restock news this weekend in case anything changes, constantly applying the expertise we've learned from past restock dates. Soon, our alerts will have helped 40,000 people get a console in 2021."
