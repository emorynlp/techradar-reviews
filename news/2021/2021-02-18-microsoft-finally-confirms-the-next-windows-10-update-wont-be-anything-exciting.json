    "Windows 10\u2019s feature update for the first half of 2021 (known as 21H1) has finally been announced by Microsoft, with the software giant confirming that it will be a minor update, as has long been rumored.",
    "An official blog post by John Cable, VP of Windows Servicing and Delivery at Microsoft, noted that this was the first time an H1 update \u2013 one that arrives in the first half of the year \u2013 will be \u201cdelivered in an optimized way using servicing technology\u201d.",
    "That\u2019s fancy talk for the 21H1 update being an enablement package, or a minor update which is a tiny download and simply flicks a switch to turn on the small amount of changes and tweaks involved (content which has already been preloaded for recent Windows 10 versions). You\u2019ll likely recall that this was the case with the most recent October 2020 Update (20H2).",
    "As Cable observes, it\u2019s always been those H2 updates which have been minor ones, so it\u2019s unusual for an H1 upgrade to do this (and for that matter, it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever seen two minor feature updates in a row like this).",
    "Cable clarifies: \u201cVersion 21H1 will be delivered with servicing technology (like that used for the monthly update process and how 20H2 was delivered). Windows 10, version 21H1 will have a scoped set of features improving security, remote access and quality.\u201d",
    "Again, that reference to a \u201cscoped set of features\u201d is how we\u2019ve seen Microsoft previously refer to these minor updates (they\u2019re not \u2018small\u2019, they\u2019re \u2018scoped\u2019).",
    "Those running either of last year\u2019s updates \u2013 the May 2020 Update or October 2020 Update \u2013 will be able to upgrade using the fast and convenient enablement package, but users on previous versions of Windows 10 will have to go through the full download process (as they won\u2019t have the files for 21H1 preloaded).",
    "Cable also outlines some of the changes delivered by the 21H1 update, which include beefing up Windows Hello with multi-camera support and various security tweaks, as well as work on Windows Defender Application Guard. So yes \u2013 this underlines that there\u2019s stuff going on, but nothing hugely riveting.",
    "The 21H1 update is now rolling out to testers in the \u2018beta\u2019 channel, but no target release date was mentioned in the blog post, unsurprisingly; only that the upgrade will be rolling out in the first half of the year, which of course we already knew.",
    "Recent rumors have pointed to the arrival of the update later in H1, and indeed speculation was even pointing to a June debut, although we\u2019ve more recently heard that May is Microsoft\u2019s likely intended release timeframe."
