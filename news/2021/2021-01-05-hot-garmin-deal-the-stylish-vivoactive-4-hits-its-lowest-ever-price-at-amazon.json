    "The Garmin Vivoactive 4 is one of the most stylish GPS sports watches around, and it's now just $225.41 at Amazon \u2013 down from the usual price of $349.99. That's the cheapest this Garmin watch has ever been at Amazon, beating deals on both Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day.",
    "If you're looking for a running watch, but the likes of the Garmin Fenix 6 and Forerunner 945 are overkill (or just too expensive), the Vivoactive 4 is a great alternative. It boasts on-watch music streaming, all-day heart rate monitoring, pulse oximeter, and advanced sleep tracking, all in a smart stainless steel case with silicone band.",
    "It lacks some of the more advanced training features you'll find in Garmin's top-end fitness trackers (such as training load and a round-trip course creator for cycling and running), but it's surprisingly feature-packed for the price.",
    "It can calculate cadence in real time as you run, automatically count reps for weight lifting, track your golf score, provide alerts when you reach distance or heart rate goals, and detect swim stroke types.",
    "It's easy to use too, with a touchscreen and just two physical buttons compared to five on the Forerunner and Fenix series.",
    "If you're not in the US, we've rounded up all the best Garmin Vivoactive 4 deals where you are, right here:"
