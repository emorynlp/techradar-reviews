    "This Paralympic sport may have welders waiting on the sidelines for repairs - but it's not just the wheelchairs that clash! Team USA and Australia have taken home five of the six Paralympic gold medals ever awarded in the sport, so who will come out on top this time around? Or will home nation Japan - who beat the Aussies to the last world championship title - stir things up in Tokyo?",

    "Aussie viewers have a similar scenario, with Channel 7 and 7plus online showing free coverage of the Paralympics. Even viewers in the US can watch wheelchair rugby medal action for free without cable on NBC's streaming service PeacockTV.",

    "The Paralympics have grown in popularity from one Paralympics to the next, so it will come as no surprise to you that this year's coverage will be some of the best yet. Most countries will have some coverage of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, whether this is free or paid for.",
