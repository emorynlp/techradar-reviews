    "The 'God of Mischief' as we've never seen him before, returns this time to the small screen, in Disney Plus' latest Marvel TV series, following on from the success of WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Solider. Taking place after the events of Avengers: Endgame, Loki finds himself in hot water with the Time Variance Authority. Turning into something of a detective drama, make sure you know how to watch Loki online and stream the six-part Avengers spin-off where you are.",
    "Hauled to the Time Variance Authority after breaking reality and altering the proper flow of time by making off with the Tesseract in Avengers: Endgame, Loki's faced with a choice: help TVA agent Mobius \"Moby\" M. Mobius (portrayed by Owen Wilson no less) fix the timelines, or... you know, do a Loki.",
    "No prizes for guessing which road the God of Mischief takes.",
    "But all isn't quite what it seems in the cold, bureaucratic world of the timeline monitors. Loki, utterly convinced of his own intellectual supremacy and cunning, may just have underestimated his new adversary.",
    "But bean-counters, it appears, know how to have a little fun of their own too.",
    "Moby hasn't exactly given Loki the full story, and while the master of manipulation is out bending history to his will, having fun and slapping himself on the back, Judge Ravonna Renslayer is keeping tabs on his every move.",
    "With Loki first reactions already in, follow our guide as we explain how to watch Loki online and stream the new Marvel series today - as one of six limited Marvel TV series to come to the platform this year, there's no reason not to grab a great value Disney Plus subscription right now!",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck in to we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN+ to your subscription price. The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as The Great, Upload, Helstrom and Normal People. While ESPN+ brings tonnes of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "Loki is just the latest in a string of recent blockbuster releases exclusive to the platform, including Soul, The Mandalorian, Mulan, Hamilton, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "In addition, now that Disney has set the precedent of releasing movies like its live-action Mulan remake on the service instead of in theaters through its Disney Plus Premier Access program, expect the company to keep bringing more blockbuster films that were originally intended to be shown on the big screen to Disney Plus in 2021. Most recently, it's the way to watch Cruella online, with Black Widow on the way come July with Black Widow.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star on Disney Plus that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy.",
    "It's available in the UK, most of Europe, and other select markets like Australia and New Zealand - but not in the US, where the media giant's Hulu service already has very similar ground covered.",
