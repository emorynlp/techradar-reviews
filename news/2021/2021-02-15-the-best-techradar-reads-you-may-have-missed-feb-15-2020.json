    "How did you spend Valentine's Day this year? Curled up in front of Netflix with two bottles of white, we\u2019ll bet, unless you really pushed the boat out and went for the whole projector-in-the-garden gesture. In any case, with lockdowns keeping most of us inside and Covid-19 meaning the doors remain firmly shut on restaurants and cinemas alike, many couples around the world were forced to turn to technology to keep the romance alive (no, not like that).",
    "For the singletons among us, though, we at TechRadar saw fit to alleviate the sting of countless social media posts by bringing you plenty of exciting tech news and features (because what\u2019s love compared to an LG C1 OLED TV?).",
    "Here, we\u2019ve picked out the best TechRadar content of the week, from the latest rumours on the new Sonos speaker to what makes the Alice camera the snapper of the future. We\u2019ve even gone ahead and explained why Malcolm and Marie is the perfect anti-Valentine's Day Netflix movie \u2013 rest assured, it\u2019s no rom-com.",
    "There\u2019s also a host of review and opinion content for you to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re after something a little easier on the eyes (but maybe not the ears), we\u2019ve parked the latest episode of the TechRadar Noise Cancelling Podcast at the end of this article for your convenient listening pleasure.",
    "While video doorbells have proven a handy way to answer the door when you\u2019re not home, you still need to be on the alert for the phone notification telling you the Amazon driver is waiting outside in the rain.",
    "Now, though, Alexa is on hand to spare you both the inconvenience of a missed delivery. Alexa Greetings sees Amazon\u2019s voice assistant greet the person on your doorstep once the doorbell has been pressed \u2013 and she\u2019ll even take a message to pass on once you return. Alexa, thanks.",

    "Netflix reportedly paid around $30 million for a movie which essentially features nothing more than two attractive people (Zendaya and John David Washington) arguing about their lives in one location for 106 minutes.",
    "Still, if you\u2019re looking to feel better about your own relationship (or even lack thereof) during lockdown, Malcolm and Marie is worth a watch.",

    "Few would dispute that Sonos is king when it comes to home speakers, so it\u2019s big news whenever the company sows the seeds of an announcement for a new device. A recent FCC filing suggests Sonos is on the verge of launching a new wireless speaker, and it\u2019s got us excited to see what\u2019s next for the world of wireless audio.",
    "We\u2019ve rounded up everything we know about the rumored Sonos Move follow-up.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "It\u2019s no secret that phones are no longer Sony\u2019s forte \u2013 nowadays, it\u2019s much more interested in a little thing called the PS5. But with the Sony Xperia 1 III, the Japanese giant could do well to take a leaf out of the Samsung Galaxy S21's book.",
    "Samsung's success with selling lower-cost smartphones should send a message to Sony to keep its prices low and its focus firmly on making a competent mobile device, rather than a movie-watching, game-playing powerhouse. After all, that\u2019s what PlayStations are for.",

    "We were lucky enough to see LG\u2019s C1 OLED in person shortly after it was announced at CES 2021 \u2013 and boy, does it dazzle the eyes.",
    "With a sharper picture and greater audio processing than its predecessor, LG\u2019s latest OLED model (available in an enormous 83-inches) looks set to be a contender for the best TV of 2021 when it finally launches.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "For our Senior Computing Editor, Windows 10 laptops are dead. That\u2019s thanks to the surprising success of Apple\u2019s latest M1-powered Macs, which blow Microsoft\u2019s OS out of the water when it comes to speed, accessibility and aesthetic.",
    "But could Intel Evo change all that? Like the Ultrabooks that came before, Intel Evo is a list of specifications that Intel thinks represents the next evolutionary leap in laptops \u2013 and it really is some exciting stuff. Watch this space.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "From the Sony A1 to the Fujifilm GFX100S, this year has got off to a flying start for new mirrorless cameras \u2013 but none of them are arguably as innovative or intriguing as the Alice Camera.",
    "We chatted to its makers, who told us more about the AI camera, including why it could prove the snapper of the future.",
