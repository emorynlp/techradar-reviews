  "article": [
    "Please don\u2019t buy Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch. You\u2019d honestly be better tracking down a PlayStation 2 or original Xbox to play these games again because this pathetic port isn\u2019t worth your time or money.",
    "Nintendo fans have had to wait two decades to experience Grand Theft Auto 3 and its stellar sequels Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. But Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition can be best described as a sick joke.",
    "What you\u2019re greeted with after sitting through an initial load screen of around 19 seconds is a game that\u2019s undoubtedly running at a resolution that\u2019s so low someone might as well have smeared vaseline over your Switch\u2019s screen. The HUD icons, though, are jarringly crystal clear.",
    "I don\u2019t know the exact resolution that Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition is running at on Nintendo Switch, but it doesn\u2019t take the experts at Digital Foundry to determine that it isn\u2019t coming close to the console\u2019s native 720p output.",
    "That\u2019s not to say every game needs to hit this resolution target. But we\u2019re not talking about some impossible port here like The Witcher 3 or Doom Eternal \u2013 this is a remaster of three games that were released in 2001, 2002, and 2004. Yes, they\u2019re running on Unreal Engine 4, but it still shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near this bad.",
    "Dynamic resolution scaling is clearly in place in the GTA Trilogy, but it seems to aggressively bounce between various sub-HD resolutions and tops out at what appears to be 540p, without any sort of sharpening to compensate. The result is butt-ugly image quality in all three games.",
    "But what about when playing docked? Sadly, it\u2019s even worse. The resolution doesn\u2019t appear to increase in any meaningful way, and the game\u2019s unappealing softness is even more pronounced when blown up on a larger display. Handheld mode is definitely the lesser of two evils.",
    "The game\u2019s new cartoony art style \u2013 which has already proved polarizing \u2013 also takes a hit as a result. It looks completely flat and washed out, even on the Nintendo Switch OLED\u2019s vivid screen. The low resolution also detracts from the game\u2019s new lighting system, and ultimately makes you feel like you\u2019re playing a weird fan-made tribute of the original games as opposed to an official remaster.",
    "But it\u2019s not just a criminally low resolution that Switch players have to stomach in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition. The game\u2019s performance is \u2013 to put it lightly \u2013 unacceptable.",
    "There\u2019s no option of a 60fps performance mode here, so you\u2019re stuck at a maximum framerate of 30fps. That\u2019s admittedly a shame, but it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the Switch version ever came close to holding 30fps for more than a few seconds.",
    "Driving through the streets in all three games is a nightmarish and sluggish experience as the framerate fluctuates wildly, dropping into the low twenties. GTA: San Andreas seems to have the best performance of the bunch, but it still can\u2019t hold its target framerate for very long.",
    "Combine a janky framerate with a soupy resolution, and what you get is a one-way ticket to feeling like you want to throw up after five minutes of play, at least in my case. It also makes driving, a fundamental mechanic of GTA games, an unresponsive slog.",
    "Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition on Nintendo Switch is also plagued by laughable pop-in. If you\u2019ve never heard of pop-in before, it\u2019s a term used to describe when a game\u2019s assets magically appear and disappear in relation to how close a player is to them.",
    "When a game streams in assets properly, most players won\u2019t notice a game\u2019s world unfolding before them. But when it\u2019s done badly, it\u2019s impossible to ignore.",
    "In Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition, pop-in is absolutely horrendous, to the point where it makes the games unplayable at times. Cars will phase into existence at a moment\u2019s notice, giving you split seconds to veer out of the way. Streets are eerily quiet and then suddenly filled with people. Trees, shadows, and environmental details can be flicked on and off like a light switch, simply by moving forward or backward. It\u2019s a hideous sight to behold.",
    "Playing GTA on a dedicated handheld again has been a distant dream ever since the PSP releases of GTA: Liberty City Stories and GTA: Vice City Stories 2005. The Switch should have been the perfect platform to realize those halcyon days, with improved performance and graphics to boot. Instead, we\u2019ve been given shoddy ports that either shouldn\u2019t have been released on Nintendo\u2019s platform or delayed until performance could be significantly improved.",
    "For returning players, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition will likely provide a miserable experience, even with its updated control scheme. For newcomers? You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that anyone who ever raved about these games needs their head checked.",
    "Throw in the missing audio tracks, incredible low audio sample rates in the voice acting, some new bugs (I saw a number of cars\u2019 rear lights flickering uncontrollably), and it\u2019s impossible to recommend anyone buying Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 Definitive Edition for the asking price of $49.99 / \u00a349.99.",
    "As it stands, the Definitive Edition of Rockstar\u2019s three classics games deserves the most damning sentence a gamer can bestow on any title. Please, don\u2019t buy this game."
