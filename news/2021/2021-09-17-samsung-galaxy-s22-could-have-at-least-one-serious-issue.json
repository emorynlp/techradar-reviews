    "The Samsung Galaxy S22 is sure to be one of the most exciting and successful phones of early 2022, but it might not be one of the longest-lasting, as a leak suggests its battery could be disappointingly small.",
    "This comes from GalaxyClub, which claims to have acquired \u201cconcrete details\u201d about the battery, and says that it has a rated capacity of just 3,590mAh, down from 3,880mAh in the Samsung Galaxy S21.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that the rated capacity isn\u2019t what\u2019s generally marketed on phones, instead that\u2019s the typical capacity, which is slightly higher. In the case of the Galaxy S21 that\u2019s 4,000mAh, while for the Samsung Galaxy S22 it\u2019s likely to be around 3,700mAh if this leak is right. All of which would make the S22\u2019s battery about 7.5% smaller than the Galaxy S21\u2019s.",
    "That\u2019s not a huge drop, but the Samsung Galaxy S21 doesn\u2019t have a huge battery in the first place, and this would make the Samsung Galaxy S22\u2019s even smaller than a previous leak had suggested, as we\u2019d heard before that it would be 3,800mAh (so still smaller than the S21\u2019s).",
    "However, while we\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt it\u2019s a somewhat believable claim, since we\u2019ve also previously heard that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus will have a smaller battery than its predecessor, at either 4,500mAh or 4,600mAh, with only the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra retaining the same 5,000mAh battery size as this year\u2019s model.",
    "If the Samsung Galaxy S21 had excellent battery life then a slight reduction in size might not worry us too much, but it doesn\u2019t. In our review we found it reasonable \u2013 typically lasting a day unless you make heavy use of GPS and other power-hungry features, but that\u2019s average rather than impressive.",
    "So shrinking the battery in the Samsung Galaxy S22 could make its endurance below average. That won\u2019t necessarily happen as there could be optimizations elsewhere, such as in the chipset, but it might. And at the very least it probably means the Samsung Galaxy S22\u2019s life won\u2019t be any better.",
    "That\u2019s a real shame, because while most elements of expensive phones are now more than good enough, battery life continues to struggle.",
    "So it\u2019s really this that manufacturers should be focusing on, not shrinking batteries to make phones even thinner, or using the freed up battery space to marginally improve some already impressive feature.",
