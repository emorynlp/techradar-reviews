    "It\u2019s been six months since the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S went on sale, and even though there have been plenty of games optimized to take advantage of Microsoft\u2019s new hardware, we\u2019re still waiting for Xbox Game Studios first proper next-gen release.",
    "In fact, The Medium represents the only Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S game that can\u2019t be played on Xbox One consoles, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Microsoft from hyping up what awaits in the future.",
    "Speaking to our sister site Gamesradar+, Xbox\u2019s head of gaming services Ben Decker has said that a number of unannounced IP are set to blow players\u2019 minds, and that the reason Microsoft has invested so heavily in new studios is because research has shown Xbox Game Pass subscribers enjoy a variety of different content, and enjoy playing new games as soon as they\u2019re released on the service.",
    "\"That\u2019s why we made the investments that we have,\" Decker said. \u201cWe have 23 studios across Xbox and Bethesda, working on Halo, Forza, Fallout, and new IP that we haven\u2019t even talked about yet that\u2019s gonna blow your mind.\" Decker added that Microsoft will \"deliver all of that into Game Pass on day one.\"",
    "While Decker didn\u2019t divulge any further information as to what these new games will entail, Microsoft\u2019s large portfolio of studios means there\u2019s plenty of potential for spin-offs, new IP and long-awaited sequels to be made.",
    "Unlike PlayStation 5 owners, who have been treated to PS5 exclusives including Returnal, Demon\u2019s Souls, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Destruction AllStars and Astro\u2019s Playroom, Xbox gamers are having to be extremely patient when it comes to bonafide next-gen games. Yes, Halo Infinite is on the way, but it still doesn\u2019t have a firm release date, and games such as Gears 6, Hellblade 2: Senua\u2019s Saga, Fable and Perfect Dark seem a long way out.",
    "Still, we\u2019d rather Microsoft were bullish about what lies ahead instead of worryingly silent, but it remains to be seen when gamers will be able to reap the benefits of Microsoft\u2019s massive portfolio of studios, and how many of those games will be standout titles."
