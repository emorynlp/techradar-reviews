  "summary": "Annoying popups and unsaveable settings are ruining the Edge experience, users are reporting.",
  "article": [
    "The latest version of Microsoft's Edge internet browser comes with a few not-so-welcome and equally annoying bugs and annoyances, users have complained.",
    "As reported by BleepingComputer, many users reported Edge 91 serving a popup upon launch asking if they want to \u201cuse the recommended browser setting\u201d.",
    "However even if they close the popup or choose not to update the settings, the window would appear again upon restart.",
    "The publication managed to recreate the problem on its own device and suggests that the problem may be in the default search engine setting:",
    "\u201cIn BleepingComputer's test, this only happened to us when Bing was not configured as the default search engine,\u201d it says, before adding that it\u2019s not 100% certain this was the only reason.",
    "Edge users are also saying the browser doesn\u2019t accept the configurations for the startup page and often opens a New Tab page instead - which BleepingComputer also managed to recreate in order to confirm the issue.",
    "According to Windows Latest, it can be solved by manually switching the \u201cManage search engine\u201d Group Policy from \u201cEnabled\u201d to \u201cNot Configured\u201d or \u201cDisabled.\u201d",
    "Other bugs include missing the + symbol to open a new tab, or not being able to use the third mouse button (the wheel) to open items in the Favorites folder.",
    "Microsoft has not yet addressed these issues, so we don\u2019t know how long it'll be untl a fix is released.",
    "The software giant can\u2019t seem to catch a break with its browser(s) lately. It currently has two browsers - the Chromium-based Edge, and the legacy Internet Explorer. The latter, which is mostly used by organizations that need something to run their legacy apps on, is retiring on June 15, 2022.",
