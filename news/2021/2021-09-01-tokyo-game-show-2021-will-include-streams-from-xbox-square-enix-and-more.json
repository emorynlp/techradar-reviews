    "Now that we\u2019ve had a chance to digest the news from Gamescom 2021, it\u2019s time to start thinking about the next big show on the gaming calendar: Tokyo Game Show.",
    "The show\u2019s schedule is now beginning to take shape and, according to the official Tokyo Game Show website, we can expect presentations from some big names including Xbox, Square Enix, Capcom, Konami and Ubisoft.",
    "The show will run from September 30 through to October 3, with Xbox, Capcom and Konami getting in their presentations early on day one, while Square Enix will host its stream on October 1 and Ubisoft will take the stage on October 3.",
    "According to the schedule, each of these presentations is expected to last 50 minutes and you\u2019ll be able to watch them from the comfort of your own home as, like E3 and Gamescom, this year\u2019s Tokyo Game Show will be entirely online.",
    "You\u2019ll also apparently be able to watch through a virtual reality headset as the official site teases \u201can epic experiment\u201d which will give online attendees the ability to \u201cvisit various booths as if you were walking around the game world\u201d using HTC Vive and Oculus Quest and Rift headsets.",
    "At the moment, it\u2019s not entirely clear what specific announcements we can expect during Tokyo Game Show as the majority of publishers have kept the descriptions of their shows pretty minimal.",
    "Capcom, for instance, has said it will deliver \u201cthe latest game information\u201d and Ubisoft has only said its stream will be a part of Ubiday 2021. Xbox has told fans to \u201clook forward to various announcements that can only be heard here\u201d which doesn\u2019t really give much away either. Xbox\u2019s recent presentation at Gamescom wasn\u2019t especially mind blowing but Phil Spencer has previously said in an interview with Gamespot that he\u2019d like Xbox to be \u201cpart of the gaming consciousness in Japan\u201d and Xbox\u2019s presence at Tokyo Game Show again is surely part of that effort.",
    "When it comes to Square Enix, its event description states that it\u2019ll bring the \u201clatest news about our upcoming titles, along with the pre-announced information\u201d but no more than that. Final Fantasy 16 would certainly count as an upcoming title\u2014one that plenty of fans would love an update for, too\u2014but it's far from guaranteed that it\u2019ll make an appearance.",
    "As recently as July, producer Naoki Yoshida said during a Final Fantasy 14 livestream that while the development team would like to show Final Fantasy 16 during Tokyo Game Show they might not make the deadline and would prefer the next reveal to come shortly before release. Fortunately, there are plenty of other upcoming titles Square Enix could update us on. Final Fantasy 14\u2019s Endwalker expansion seems like a good candidate, given it\u2019s set to release in November, as does Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy which is scheduled for October.",
    "With so little to go on, though, it feels like a good idea to manage our expectations for what might be shown at Tokyo Game Show even if it is hard not to get excited by the prospect of potential updates on some highly-anticipated games. Fortunately, it's only a matter of weeks until the show begins."
