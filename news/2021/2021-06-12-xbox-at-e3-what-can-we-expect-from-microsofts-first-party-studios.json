  "article": [
    "After six months on sale, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X could be seen as a sleeping giant at the moment. We\u2019re yet to see what the new Xbox is truly capable of after all, with The Medium being the only true exclusive available for the console that isn\u2019t compatible with Xbox One.",
    "We also haven\u2019t seen a return on Microsoft\u2019s multi-billion dollar investments, which has seen the company amass 23 first-party studios, including Bethesda Softworks. Fans will be expecting to see some new games sooner rather than later, then, and E3 could serve as a rousing wake up call.",
    "We know that Microsoft\u2019s E3 2021 conference on June 13 is set to last 90 minutes, and it\u2019s the perfect opportunity for Microsoft to set out a compelling roadmap of what\u2019s to come for Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S owners.",
    "But what can we expect to see? Well, let\u2019s go through each of Microsoft\u2019s first-party studios and make some realistic predictions.",
    "Microsoft is likely to open its E3 presentation with a closer look at Halo Infinite. We should see how the game has evolved since its first gameplay reveal back in July 2020, and hear more details about Halo Infinite\u2019s story. We\u2019d also expect a deep dive into the game\u2019s new multiplayer mode, with a beta announcement taking place during the show or in the near future.",
    "Don\u2019t expect to see any announcements from The Coalition at this year\u2019s E3. The studio revealed it was moving on to Unreal Engine 5 for its next title, and that this would be a \u201cbig undertaking\u201d. We can safely presume The Coalition\u2019s next title will be Gears 6, and we might possibly see Gears Tactics 2 in the future, but we\u2019d be surprised if anything was shown this year.",
    "The developer behind We Happy Few has already promised its next title will be \u201cmuch better than the last game\u201d it made, particularly now that it\u2019s part of Xbox Game Studios. While we wouldn\u2019t rule out seeing a sequel to We Happy Few, a new IP announcement might also be a possibility. But we believe the studio won\u2019t be present this year.",
    "Double Fine Productions will surely reveal a release date for Psychonauts 2, which is tipped to release in August 2021. However, with development coming to a close on the psychedelic platformer, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Double Fine Productions had something else to show at this year\u2019s E3 conference. Fingers crossed it\u2019s Brutal Legends 2.",
    "Microsoft has invested heavily in The Initiative, a studio which has been built to rival the likes of Naughty Dog and Sony Santa Monica. We know that The Initiative is working on Perfect Dark, and we\u2019re hoping to find out more about Joanna\u2019s next adventure at Microsoft\u2019s E3 event. While we wouldn\u2019t expect to see any gameplay just yet, an in-engine trailer would certainly be welcome, and could steal the show.",
    "inXile Entertainment are masters of the strategy game genre, with recent releases like Wasteland 3 garnering critical acclaim. However, the studio is reportedly working on a \u201cnext-gen RPG\u201d powered by Unreal Engine 5. While it\u2019s unclear how far along the team is in development, we might at least get a title for inXile\u2019s next project.",
    "Minecraft probably won\u2019t take up too much of Microsoft\u2019s E3 conference, but we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw some more DLC for Minecraft Dungeons and the original game itself. Minecraft continues to be enjoyed by millions of players, so expect a short and snappy update to keep fans abreast of what\u2019s on the way. Perhaps the ray traced version of Minecraft will finally make its way to Xbox Series X?",
    "It\u2019s easy to forget that one of the first games announced for the Xbox Series X was Hellblade 2: Senua\u2019s Saga. The game has been in development for some time, then, and we\u2019re hopeful that a portion of gameplay will be shown. We could also get an update on Ninja Theory\u2019s Project Mara, which is an experimental game that focuses on recreating the terror of mental health issues. Either way, we hope Senua shows up at E3.",
    "Obsidian Entertainment could provide some more details on Avowed, its Elder Scrolls-esque RPG set in the Pillars of Eternity universe, which was revealed in July 2020. There\u2019s also rumblings that the studio could announce The Outer Worlds 2, but that\u2019s only a rumor for now. If we don't see Avowed, we\u2019d at least expect Obsidian to set a date for when Grounded will come out of Xbox Game Preview. We may even get a Fallout: New Vegas announcement, if we\u2019re lucky.",
    "We know that Playground Games is working on Fable, but we don\u2019t expect to see much, if anything, of the supposedly open-world RPG. Instead, we\u2019re placing our bets on a Forza Horizon 5 announcement that will see the game set in Mexico. Forza Horizon has grown into one of the best-selling franchises for Microsoft, so we\u2019d be genuinely disappointed if it didn\u2019t make an appearance as it\u2019s bound to be a big draw come the holiday season.",
    "Like Fable, we\u2019re not confident that Rare will show any Everwild gameplay or footage. We haven\u2019t heard any details since the game was revealed at X019, but the game still seems like it\u2019s early on in development. We think that Rare is more likely to use its E3 presence to hype up an upcoming Sea of Thieves event or new season instead.",
    "Forza Motorsport underwent its first playtest on May 8, which means the game is further along in development than some may have thought. We\u2019re expecting to see a glimpse of Microsoft\u2019s premier racing sim at E3 this year, and maybe a release date alongside it. We think it\u2019s likely to arrive after Forza Horizon 5, though, so expect 2022 for this one.",
    "We saw a CGI-trailer for State of Decay 3 during Microsoft\u2019s July games event last year, but we don\u2019t think Undead Labs\u2019 next project will appear at E3. Zombie fans will have to wait a little longer for the next evolution in the State of Decay franchise.",
    "With mouse and keyboard support available, there\u2019s no reason why World\u2019s Edge can\u2019t announce Age of Empires 4 for Xbox Series X at E3. Microsoft has been reluctant to bring the series over to console, but we hope that will change sooner rather than later.",
    "Alpha Dog Games is primarily a mobile developer, so we don\u2019t expect to see any Xbox specific announcements from the studio at E3.",
    "It\u2019s strange to think that Arkane Studios\u2019 next game is a timed PS5 exclusive, but that\u2019s the situation the developer finds itself in after Microsoft bought Bethesda. It remains to be seen whether we\u2019ll get a release date for Deathloop on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, or whether the studio will reveal a brand-new IP for Microsoft\u2019s consoles.",
    "We strongly believe that Starfield will be shown in gameplay form at E3, though it won\u2019t release until 2022. Bethesda may also touch on the development of The Elder Scrolls 6, and we wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if it had a classic, \u201cOh\u2026 and one more thing\u201d reveal to share.",
    "After the release of Doom Eternal, what is id Software working on next? And if it\u2019s another Doom game, will it be exclusive to Xbox consoles and PC? That\u2019s hard to answer, but we\u2019d love to see id Software give the same reboot treatment to its other classic FPS, Quake.",
    "We know that MachineGames is working on an Indiana Jones game, but it\u2019s unlikely to be shown during E3. The studio could reveal what\u2019s next for the Wolfenstein franchise, or could even announce a brand new IP.",
    "Little is known about Roundhouse Studios other than the fact that many of its employees come from Human Head Studios, the team responsible for Prey (2006). We think a new IP announcement would make sense for Roundhouse, though it\u2019s unclear whether its project will be revealed at E3.",
    "Tango Gameworks next project is a PS5 exclusive Ghostwire: Tokyo, and while it\u2019s unclear whether the game will come to Xbox consoles, we wouldn\u2019t be too surprised to see The Evil Within 3 get announced.",
    "We\u2019re not expecting much from ZeniMax Online Studios, and believe that any announcements regarding The Elder Scrolls Online will be made during a post-show event as opposed to the main stage.",
    "Microsoft's publishing arm has brought games like Ori and the Will of the Wisps to Xbox and PC, along with the punishingly difficult yet awesome Cuphead. We hope to finally get a release date for the Cuphead: Delicious Last Course DLC.",
    "It\u2019s clear that Microsoft has enough studios to dedicate an entire show to highlight what its teams are working on, but even if just half of these predictions come true, we should be in for a great show."
