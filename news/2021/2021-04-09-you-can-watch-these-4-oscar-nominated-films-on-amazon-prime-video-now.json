    "Netflix drama Mank may have garnered the most love with 10 Academy Award nominations, but Amazon Prime Video has some equally exceptional \u2013 and arguably superior \u2013 movies in the race for an Oscar.",
    "The streaming service received 12 nominations across four heart-breaking, hilarious, and never-more-relevant feature films: from Time, a moving documentary about one family\u2019s experience of the criminal justice system, to provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s incendiary Borat 2.",
    "As they roll out the red carpet in preparation for the 93rd Academy Awards, don\u2019t miss these four Oscar-nominated films on Amazon Prime Video. Plus, you can watch them for nothing if you\u2019re a new or returning subscriber, with the streamer\u2019s 30-day FREE trial.",
    "February 25, 1964. Four African American icons \u2013 Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, Muhammad Ali and Jim Brown \u2013 retire to a hotel room to celebrate Ali\u2019s World Boxing Championship win. But the mood quickly turns contemplative as \u2013 in a fictionalised account of their meeting \u2013 each share their convictions, individual hopes, and divergent opinions about achieving racial equality in the ongoing Civil Rights movement.",
    "Based on the stage play by Kemp Powers and directed by 2019 Academy Award winner Regina King (for acting that year in If Beale Street Could Talk), One Night in Miami... \u2013 a film set at the crossroads of great change \u2013 crackles with purpose, hope, and intensity. It\u2019s partly the result of a brilliant ensemble, formed of Kingsley Ben Adir, Eli Goree, Aldis Hodge, and Leslie Odom, Jr., the latter receiving a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his role as beloved soul singer Sam Cooke.",

    "Kazakh journalist Borat returned to \u201cyankee land\u201d in 2020, and just when we needed him most \u2013 in the middle of a global pandemic and right before a contentious US election. This time Borat travels to America to deliver his daughter Tutar to Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 and later Rudy Giuliani \u2013 as a gift that he hopes will repair Kazakhstan\u2019s tarnished reputation.",
    "What follows is an equally hilarious, yet more politically pointed movie than the first: ridiculing Republicans, Covid-19 deniers and QAnon conspiracy theorists. Just expect to cringe throughout the whole thing as Borat and the sweetly demented Tutar (Maria Bakalova) make everyone they meet feel very, very uncomfortable.",

    "Directed and produced by Garrett Bradley \u2013 who took home the US Documentary prize for directing at Sundance \u2013 Time is an intimate, visually poetic depiction of the criminal justice system in the US, and its devastating impact on one family.",
    "Shot throughout in black and white and combining 18 years of home video footage with original material, the film follows mother of six Sibil as she petitions for her husband's release from Louisiana State Penitentiary, who\u2019s currently serving a 60-year sentence for his part in an armed robbery. It charts the impact this loss has on all their lives, particularly how Rich\u2019s children cope growing up without a father.",
    "Time has been described as \u201ca monumental and enormously moving film\u201d and a \u201cprecise and impressionistic account of love and waiting\u201d. Don't let it pass you by.",
    "Nominated for:",
    "- Documentary (Feature)",

    "With a total of six nominations, all eyes are on Sound of Metal to bring the gold home for Amazon. At the heart of this tale about loss, resilience, and change is a knockout performance from Riz Ahmed (Four Lions, Nightcrawler), who became the first Muslim ever to be nominated for the Best Actor Oscar.",
    "Co-written and directed by Darius Marder, Ahmed stars as Ruben: a heavy metal drummer currently touring the US with his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Wilde) as part of the band Blackgammon. His world is on the brink of collapsing when he begins to lose his hearing, yet he continues to perform anyway. Worried about his wellbeing, Lou escorts him to a retreat for deaf ex- addicts, and, with the help of Joe (Paul Raci, nominated for Best Supporting Actor here), Ruben learns to reconcile himself to his new life.
