  "article": [
    "Why, for the love of Goombas, is there a Calculator app on the Nintendo Switch eShop that costs $10 / \u00a38? A calculator app that is no different to the free one you\u2019ll find on your phone or computer, but one that\u2019s now available on Nintendo\u2019s console for an inexplicable price. It just doesn\u2019t add up.",
    "The Nintendo Switch eShop has already become a frustrating experience for users. It may be a gateway to countless excellent indie games \u2013 as well as inventive Nintendo Switch Online titles like Tetris 99 \u2013 but it\u2019s become a hot mess over the years due to Nintendo\u2019s lax stewardship. The Calculator app (game?) is all the proof one could need that the bar is so low, that as long as a game works, it\u2019ll be allowed to slither onto the eShop, even if it stinks up the joint in the process.",
    "It\u2019s been hard to watch Nintendo\u2019s once pristine Switch eShop devolve into a disappointing storefront that\u2019s now filled with questionable titles and generally crappy games. Sifting through the new downloadable titles used to be an exciting affair as the Switch\u2019s fledgling library began to grow, and I was quietly optimistic that the Nintendo Switch eShop would grow into a portable paradise that was home to the best independent developers and retro titles. Perhaps it would finally bring back the Wii\u2019s amazing Virtual Console selection?",
    "Unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t been the case. Even though the Nintendo Switch eShop had a fairly curated feel at the beginning, with titles such as Blaster Master Zero, ACA Neo Geo games, Snake Pass and Snipperclips offering a promising sign of things to come, it soon became a hotbed for shovelware, free-to-play mobile games that suddenly were no longer free-to-play, and aging third-party ports that were only noticeable for the fact they had a hefty \u2018Switch Tax\u2019 slapped on to the price tag. So how has this happened?",
    "Well, the more popular the Nintendo Switch became, the more developers flocked to the store to try and flog their cash-grabbing titles like unwanted suitors to Princess Peach. And Nintendo, based on a cursory look at the store, didn\u2019t seem to care who wanted to peddle their wares \u2013 it seemingly welcomed the droves of dire titles with open arms.",
    "The knock-on effect of this has been twofold. Not only does it make the Switch eShop feel like some sort of wild west of console storefronts, but the once snappy experience of using the store has become a noticeably sluggish affair. It now takes longer to boot up, and isn\u2019t as responsive as it used to be, something which is at odds with the Nintendo Switch\u2019s silky-smooth OS.",
    "Navigation, which was never the eShop\u2019s strong suit in fairness, has become all the more troublesome too. The majority of games that hit the store are engulfed by the wave of weekly titles, and often make as much impact as a feather hitting the ground. Yes, the homepage can help guide you to the better games, such as the best sellers list, but there are so many games that go unseen.",
    "The \u2018Hot deals\u2019 section suffers even more. It\u2019s overloaded with games that either launch with an already heavily discounted price to suggest you\u2019re getting some sort of value or have had their prices slashed in the hope of shifting a few more units. The section might as well be renamed to \u201cThe pantheon of pants titles\u201d at this point.",
    "And if you were hoping for the eShop to recommend stuff based on your personal buying habits, forget it. It\u2019s probably got a lower IQ than a Thwomp, as I\u2019ve never seen anything that I\u2019d like based on my recent play history other than extremely generic recommendations or Nintendo\u2019s own first-party offering which doesn\u2019t really need any help when it comes to sales.",
    "Nintendo works hard to preserve its reputation as a trust-worthy and quality-first company \u2013 it even has an official seal that signifies as much \u2013 so why doesn\u2019t it apply the same stringent requirements to the Nintendo Switch eShop? With millions of younger gamers and those not as in the know playing on Switch, shouldn\u2019t it take extra care to ensure people don\u2019t spurn their cash on titles that are, objectively, garbage?",
    "While it might feel like the Nintendo Switch eShop is beyond saving at this point, we\u2019ve seen other storefronts undergo vigorous redesigns that have improved the user experience and helped spotlight quality games that are actually worth people\u2019s time. Yes, there\u2019s still plenty of questionable games on there, but they\u2019re rightfully out of sight and out of mind.",
    "The Microsoft Store on Xbox Series X is almost unrecognizable from its first iteration, and Sony\u2019s PlayStation Store on PS5, while still relatively new, addressed the poor performance of the PS4\u2019s store. It\u2019s also extremely rare that I\u2019m subjected to blatant shovelware when I\u2019m perusing either storefront, unless I specifically search for it.",
    "But hold on a second... isn\u2019t having a free market a good thing? If people want to buy the Calculator app for $10, why shouldn\u2019t they be allowed? The market will decide what succeeds and what fails, after all.",
    "There's definitely an argument to be made there, but this particular 'game' has probably got more coverage than some hard working developers\u2019 games will ever get, simply because it has no right being anywhere near the Switch eShop. It costs $10 for something that is available on your phone or computer right now. It also shows that, ultimately, Nintendo is happy to take its cut from anyone daft enough to pay for it, and that isn\u2019t a good look.",
    "The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic console, make no question. But much like Nintendo\u2019s lackluster online offering, which feels almost decades behind at this point, the Nintendo Switch eShop isn\u2019t in line with the company\u2019s values, and that\u2019s a real shame."
