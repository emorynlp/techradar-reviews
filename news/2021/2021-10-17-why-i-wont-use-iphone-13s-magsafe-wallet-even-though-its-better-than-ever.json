  "article": [
    "There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than misplacing an item; whether it\u2019s the TV remote, your house keys, or your wallet. Spending time searching for the item, or worse, forking out to replace the item isn\u2019t something any of us want to be doing.",
    "According to research by Pixie, a locator app for iPhones, 20% of Americans misplace their wallet every week, and it costs a collective $2.7 billion a year to replace the items that are never found. So, when Apple launched the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe for the iPhone 12 last year, I was, well, surprised.",
    "After all, it\u2019s one thing storing your debit or credit card digitally on an iPhone through Apple Pay so it can only be used to pay for goods and services when Touch ID or Face ID is activated, but attaching your physical card to the back of your phone case with just a magnet. If you\u2019re a serial loser like me, that\u2019s asking for trouble.",
    "However, this year Apple has taken a step towards fixing the issue by launching a new version of the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe, at the same time as the iPhone 13, which supports the Find My service. This means you can track its location if it becomes detached from the phone, in the same way as an Apple AirTag. Although, in my opinion it\u2019s still missing one vital feature.",
    "MagSafe is a small magnetic coil in the back of the iPhone that ensures the smartphone can be wireless charged without having to worry about positioning the handset on an exact spot on a wireless charger. It also provides scope for various accessories to be attached to the back of the smartphone too - one of which is this card holder.",
    "I\u2019ve never been a fan of phone cases that have slots so you can store your credit cards - for me it feels like I\u2019m bundling too many important items together, and if I misplaced them, it would result in a big headache. However, when Apple launched the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe last year, I tried to persevere with it.",
    "MagSafe creates a strong connection between the wallet and the phone, so there\u2019s no fear of it sliding off the phone for no reason, but when my phone was in the bottom of my bag and jangling around with other items such as make-up, keys, anti-bacterial hand gel and the like, I found there were occasions when it did detach from the phone accidentally.",
    "There\u2019s also no way to get your credit card or ID out of the wallet without removing it from the phone first, which, for me at least, increases the chances of placing it down in a shop or cafe, and forgetting to pick it back up again.",
    "However, a re-designed version of the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe, which was launched at the same time as the iPhone 13 and is available now from the Apple store supports the Find My app.",
    "This means you can see its last location on a map in the app and get a notification when the wallet has become detached from your smartphone for longer than one minute. However, unlike AirTags you can\u2019t make the wallet emit an electronic beep to help you find it easier if you\u2019ve misplaced the wallet in your home.",
    "Nor does it have the Precision Finding feature, which uses Ultra Wideband radio technology to identify the distance and direction your iPhone is from the item, and display the information on-screen alongside haptic feedback to help you locate the AirTag.",
    "However, these aren\u2019t my biggest concerns - instead it\u2019s that the Apple\u2019s Find My device network can\u2019t be harnessed to help reunite you with the wallet if it really is lost, rather than just temporarily misplaced.",
    "An AirTag that can\u2019t be found can be placed into Lost mode, and if another device in the Find my network - be it an iPhone, iPad or even your AirPods - passes by the AirTag, you\u2019ll get an anonymous update on its location. This would come in extremely handy, for example if I\u2019d left the wallet in a shop where I\u2019d removed it to pay for something, and then returned home. Instead, if this did happen, I\u2019d have to follow the tried and tested method of retracting my steps.",
    "However, there is something that AirTags offer that is also totted by the wallet - the ability to assign your phone number to the accessory. In the case of the wallet, this means if anyone finds it and attaches it to their phone, a notification with the phone number will be displayed on screen, asking them to call you. However, unlike with AirTags, when we tried tapping the wallet on the top of another iPhone, and an NFC-enabled Android smartphone, this message wasn\u2019t displayed.",
    "Find My for the MagSafe wallet is extremely easy to set-up. As soon as you place the wallet accessory directly on the phone or on a MagSafe compatible case, the phone will identify the wallet and ask if you want to add it to Find My. That\u2019s it, then you can leave it alone until the worst happens and you need to locate the wallet.",
    "To do this, open the Find My app and tap the devices tab. In the list you\u2019ll see the wallet, with the location and the time it was last connected to your iPhone. Tap the wallet from the list and you\u2019ll be able to see a map with the location pinpointed - giving you somewhere to start your search at least. From here you can get directions in Apple Maps and also adjust whether you get a notification if the wallet becomes detached from the phone, as well as if you want your phone number to be displayed when someone attached it to their iPhone.",
    "For some people the idea of the MagSafe wallet will make perfect sense. No more frayed slots on your phone case because you\u2019ve pushed a card in and out too many times, and for those that want to travel light it means you can leave your usual wallet at home - it can fit up to three cards comfortably.",
    "However, at $59 / \u00a359 / AU$95 - which is around the same price as a card holder from designer leather good brand Coach - the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe is certainly not something you\u2019d purchase on a whim.",
    "Right now, however, I would rather stick with Apple Pay, which allows me to keep digital copies of my credit and debit cards as well as loyalty cards and keep my traditional purse for ID, well at least until the iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe has all of the AirTag features baked in."
