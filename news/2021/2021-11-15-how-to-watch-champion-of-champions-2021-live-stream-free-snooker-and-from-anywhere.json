    "One table, 16 top players, seven days of drama. Snooker's biggest prize winners go head-to-head in one of the most thrilling tournaments of the season, and we're guaranteed a new winner. Read on as we explain how to watch a 2021 Champion of Champions snooker live stream online today from anywhere - including for free thanks to ITV and its easy-to-use ITV Hub streaming service.",
    "Mark Selby enters as the world No. 1, having recently switched places with Judd Trump, but neither of them has ever triumphed at this tournament.",
    "Mark Allen, the defending champion, has withdrawn, giving Ding Junhui an opportunity to take the crown as an outsider, the No. 10-ranked Chinese star having last won a tournament in December 2019.",
    "Neil Robertson has thundered up the rankings from Down Under, thanks to his English Open victory earlier this month, while The Rocket Ronnie O'Sullivan - always box office - may just be glad to not be in Milton Keynes.",
    "Whatever happens, the good news is that it's easy to get a FREE snooker live stream - just follow our guide to watch the 2021 Champion of Champions online from anywhere.",
    "We've set out below the ways you can watch a Champion of Champions live stream in a number of countries around the world. However, if you're away travelling for work or pleasure, you probably won't be able to watch the snooker like you normally would at home.",
    "That's the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world. A good streaming VPN can let you get around these digital borders, while also offering robust protection from cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream snooker from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to the ITV Hub site or app",
    "Until recently, Eurosport used to be the place for snooker fans in Australia to get the coverage of world tournaments. But that is no more, and we can't find it listed on any other broadcaster's schedule.",
    "That means that the only way we can think of to live stream snooker Down Under is to grab the best streaming VPN you can and head to a broadcaster's site abroad that is showing it."
