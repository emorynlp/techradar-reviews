    "At the TCL 20L reveal event, the company had one big surprise for the end: a new flexible-display concept phone that is both a foldable and a rollable. Aptly, it\u2019s called the TCL Fold N\u2019 Roll.",
    "We're in a new era of flexible-display mobile devices.",
    "Judging by the footage we saw, the Fold N\u2019 Roll looks like a tall-format foldable akin to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, which unfolds flat to show an interior phablet-size display. But one of the sides unrolls to lengthen that inner screen even further, which could reach the size of a typical tablet display \u2013 and almost surely be the largest phone screen ever made.",
    "The TCL Rollable is still coming either this year or in 2022, TCL has told TechRadar, so the Fold N\u2019 Roll is simply a new model in TCL\u2019s expanding catalogue of concept phones that stretch the boundaries of what phones can do. It\u2019s always possible that the company ends up turning this idea into a consumer product (like it\u2019s done with the TCL Rollable), but for now it\u2019s just a possibility.",
    "What\u2019s stopping TCL from producing the Fold N\u2019 Roll right away? In an extensive interview, TCL executives explained to TechRadar that the phones industry isn\u2019t quite there yet \u2013 but in the next couple years, developments in displays and components could make them mainstream consumer options.",
    "This makes sense \u2013 the only flexible-display devices that have reached the market have been foldables, and aside from the TCL Rollable, and Oppo's equivalent, the only other rollable we\u2019ve seen confirmed to be in development was the LG Rollable...which probably won\u2019t come out after LG\u2019s mobile division folded.",
    "How will the Fold N\u2019 Roll, and other flexible display phones, fit into TCL\u2019s lineup? Regular smartphones aren\u2019t going away, so expect successors to the TCL 20 to arrive in the years to come. But creating innovativeive new flexible displays remains a priority in the company \u2013 not just for mobile solutions, but to use in applications across the company in other products and appliances."
