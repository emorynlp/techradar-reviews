    "Our cheap headphone deals roundup will not only get you a great price on your next pair of cans but give you plenty of options no matter what type you're looking for. Not only are we expert deals hunters here at TechRadar, but we've also reviewed all the best headphones from Apple, Beats, Jabra, Sennheiser, Sony, and many more, so you can be sure you're getting top advice here.",
    "We cover all the best headphones released, including over-ear headphones, noise-canceling headphones, and wireless headphones, so there's plenty on offer. Even still, readers often ask us whether they should spend a little extra for a branded pair of headphones or go for a set of no-name buds you often find at department stores. The answer is - you tend to get what you pay for.",
    "Those $5 / \u00a35 buds can look pretty tempting, but there's often a false economy at play with cheap tech. With poor audio and chintzy build quality, you'll often find yourself going through multiple pairs in fairly short order. Subsequently, we always recommend going for one of the more known brands if your wallet will allow it.",
    "Luckily, you'll find some pretty low-cost headphone deals here, so you won't have to break the bank to find a pair that should last. Prices start at around $20 / \u00a320 on our list this week, and what's more, most of these headphones have been impartially reviewed by us, so you know what you're getting here.",
    "It\u2019s with that in mind that we've narrowed down a list of headphones that not only sound good and feel good but are priced appropriately for all you cost-conscious audiophiles out there.",
    "No longer is true-wireless tech a feature reserved for the most premium of buds, thanks to the JLab Go Air - a pair of totally wireless earbuds available for the almost unbelievable price of just $29 / \u00a329.",
    "Sure, these are definitely on the more \"budget\" end of things, and subsequently, you shouldn't expect world-beating audio, amazing build quality, or premium features like active noise cancellation, but for $30 - you're definitely getting a pair of functional buds here.",
    "Available in white, khaki green, black, and navy blue, the JLab Go Air True Wireless Earbuds feature an IPX5 sweatproof rating, 5 hours of battery life, and three different equalizer settings, which you can use to cater to your tracks of choice. Overall, that's not bad in our books and definitely worth considering if you want to get your hands on a pair of truly wireless buds without spending the $99 that the (admittedly much better) Lypertek Tevi go for these days.",
    "If you're looking for a cheap, no-nonsense set of wired headphones for your work desk or home use, check out the Tascam TH-02. These fully over-ear closed-back headphones aim to provide a detailed, studio-ready audio experience, but most importantly, retail for just $20 / \u00a320 at Amazon currently.",
    "Tascam is a trusted brand that has been around for many years, and the TH-02 is a good choice over the many nameless and unbranded headphones that tend to sit at this price point. You're getting some powerful drivers here, as well as a fairly robust (albeit slightly dated) plastic design that should last for a good time.",
    "Of course, you probably won't want to be seen out with these giant old-school headphones, but for home use and sitting at the office desk, these headphones will give you plenty of quality and isolation for the price.",
    "When it comes to headphones, the general consensus is that you very much get what you pay for. But with AKG's K92, what you're getting is so much more. These headphones offer a level of sound quality that far outstrips their budget price tag. That being said, these are some of the largest cans you might ever find, and therefore might not be the best choice for anyone out there who has a petite noggin. Specs-wise, however, it's all good. The K92's professional 40mm drivers offer an extended 16 - 20,000Hz frequency response with a 113 dB SPL/V sensitivity level. It has a cable length of about 9 feet (3 meters) and weighs around 200 grams.",
    "Want a pair of extremely solid, Bluetooth headphones that also pack in excellent active noise cancellation for under $100? Check out the JBL Tune 750BTNC.",
    "While the JBL Tune 750BTNC have an official listing price of $129 / \u00a3120, we often see them go for as little as $99 / \u00a389, which makes them one of the best headphone deals around right now. For that price, you're getting a ton of excellent features for the money, including active noise cancellation, great audio, and a pretty damn sturdy pair of headphones for the price. The only downside we've found with these headphones is the lack of the latest Bluetooth support. These are on a slightly older version so don't quite have the wireless range of the newest premium headphones. There's also no waterproofing on these JBL's either, but otherwise, they get a hearty recommendation for us.",
    "The Lypertek Tevi firmly get our nod for the best true wireless earbuds you can buy under $100, and even better news for headphone deals hunters is that they are often discounted to just $89 / \u00a389.",
    "For that price, what's on offer here is pretty unbeatable. Not only have they got a great, balanced sound, but the excellent battery life, USB-C charging, and waterproofing just make for an overall awesome value package here.",
    "While their asking price is firmly on the higher end, especially when compared to the cheaper options on our list, these headphones look, feel and sound like a much more premium set in themselves. Subsequently, if you're happy to spend that little extra that week, you definitely won't be disappointed with these great mid-range earbuds from Lypertek.",
    "One for the audiophiles among you, the 1MORE Triple Driver offers quite simply some of the best audio quality available for under $100, and even better news, they also happen to go on sale frequently for as little as $70 / \u00a380 right now.",
    "For that price, you're getting a pair of specially tuned, audio engineer-approved earbuds that have a pretty novel set of (as the name suggests) proprietary drivers to blast out all your favorite tunes in perfect clarity. Subsequently, you can expect great performance from these, and the built and fit isn't too shabby either.",
    "Remember though, these are fully wired earphones and therefore are subject to tangles, snagging, and general noises unless careful. If you'd prefer wireless, then definitely check out the other great recommendations on our list.",
    "The Amazon Echo Buds were released in 2019 with an affordable starting price of $129.99/\u00a3119.99. Thanks to sale events like Prime Day, we've seen the earbuds drop to as low as $99.99/\u00a389.99. The earbuds include Active Noise Reduction technology that was developed by Bose and feature an advanced microphone that allows you hands-free access to Amazon Alexa. The Alexa-enabled earbuds allow you to skip songs, adjust the volume, ask questions, and more completely hands-free. The sweat-resistant earbuds provide up to five hours of battery life and come in three different sizes for a secure and comfortable fit.",
    "Don't discount the Apple AirPods; while they may indeed be a pricier option, recent sales have driven prices down to an almost bargain price point, so much in fact, you can often pick them up for as low as $120 / \u00a3120.",
    "There\u2019s a lot about the AirPods that we like. They sound great, their battery life and charging speeds run laps around the competition, and it\u2019s hard to overstate just how seamless the pairing process is. If the prices go down even further, as we expect later this year, they could just be a great value pickup - especially for those with an iOS device."
