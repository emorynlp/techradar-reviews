    "Mark Cavendish (Deceuninck \u2013 Quick-Step), Wout van Aert (Team Jumbo \u2013 Visma) and Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck \u2013 Quick-Step) are some of the star names on show at the 17th Tour of Britain, which takes the peloton on a 1,310km journey from Penzance to Aberdeen via Wales and the north of England. Join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Tour of Britain live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online from anywhere. We also have info on this year's Tour of Britain stage times.",
    "The race has returned with fresh vigour after its cancellation last year, with the route providing plenty of firsts, including debuts for Cornwall, Hawick and Aberdeen, and Wales hosts two complete stages for the first time too.",
    "And the first of these is particularly exciting: a rare team time trial. We haven't been able to watch many of these lately, and the 18.2-kilometre route from Llandeilo to the National Botanic Garden of Wales is just the second TTT to feature in the modern Tour of Britain.",
    "The Queen stage follows, taking the riders up past Coed y Brenin Forest Park and Snowdonia National Park, all the way to the summit of the Great Orme in Llandudno, a brutal climb that rewards its conquerors with stunning views of the north coast of Wales.",
