    "IFA 2021 has been cancelled due to \u201cglobal health uncertainties\u201d brought about by the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "The world's leading trade show for consumer and home electronics was due to take place September 3 to September 7 as a full-scale live event in Berlin, but emerging virus variants and concerns over vaccine rollout in Germany have forced its cancellation.",
    "It\u2019s unclear whether IFA 2021 will be replaced by an online equivalent, though IFA organizers have confirmed they\u2019re now working with their partners from industry, trade and media to ensure next year\u2019s event \u2013 scheduled to begin on September 2, 2022 \u2013 can be hosted as a physical exhibition.",
    "The decision was made following detailed conversations with public health experts and multiple stakeholders, with a press statement citing \u201cthe rapid emergence of new COVID-19 variants\u201d and \u201ccontinued uncertainties about the speed of the rollout of vaccination programmes around the world\u201d as the reason for IFA 2021\u2019s cancellation.",
    "\u201cThe latest public health developments introduced too much risk into everybody's planning for the event,\" said Kai Hillebrandt, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of gfu Consumer & Home Electronics GmbH. \"Innovation needs a platform; it needs the focus of global attention. That's why brands and manufacturers across the tech industry were very keen to come to IFA Berlin 2021.\u201d",
    "\"There are simply now too many uncertainties. Therefore, it has become near impossible for anyone to responsibly plan their participation in any trade show,\u201d he added.",
    "As well as concerns over emerging Covid-19 variants, Messe Berlin \u2013 the show\u2019s intended host \u2013 hinted at issues posed by converting parts of its exhibition area into a vaccination centre and emergency hospital facility. Both are now likely to be required for longer than originally anticipated, with infection rates still high in Germany.",
    "\"We did not take this decision lightly,\u201d Martin Ecknig, CEO of Messe Berlin, said in a statement. \u201cIFA Berlin is arguably the most important event of the year for brands and retailers alike. [It] connects our industry with trade visitors, media and real consumers like no other event. However, the health and safety of everybody has to be absolutely paramount.\u201d",
    "Preparations for Berlin Photo Week at ARENA Berlin and SHIFT Mobility are continuing as planned.",
    "With other major exhibition events scheduled to take place in 2021, it will be interesting to see if the cancellation of IFA 2021 plays a part in influencing more organizers to follow suit.",
    "Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2021, for example \u2013 the world\u2019s largest mobile developer showcase \u2013 is set to go ahead as planned in Barcelona, at the time of writing, between June 28 and July 1.",
    "The event typically attracts around 100,000 attendees, but this year the GSMA (the show\u2019s organizers) are aiming for only around 50,000 attendees, with many companies and countries facing travel restrictions.",
    "Several major names have already pulled out, mind. On March 8, Ericsson, one of the largest companies set to attend the event, announced they would be withdrawing due to virus concerns. More recently, Samsung \u2013 biggest phone company in the world \u2013 also confirmed it won't have a physical presence at the big tech conference.",
    "Will the cancellation of IFA 2021 spell doom for events like MWC 2021, then? The pandemic situation varies from country to country, of course, but with large exhibition showcases like these reliant on the attendance of companies from across the globe, things aren\u2019t looking so promising.",
    "In any case, we\u2019ll keep you updated."
