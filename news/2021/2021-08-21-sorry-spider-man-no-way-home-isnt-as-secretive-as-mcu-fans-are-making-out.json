  "article": [
    "Has a Marvel movie generated as much hype or conjecture as Spider-Man: No Way Home? Based on the last few months, it doesn\u2019t initially appear so.",
    "As No Way Home\u2019s release date draws closer, fan fervour concerning the webslinger\u2019s third MCU outing has grown with each passing week. Some fans have resorted to pouring over the movie\u2019s licensed merchandise to garner clues about its plot, while others have become frustrated about when a teaser trailer will actually arrive.",
    "The clamor has been so great, in fact, that Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige recently weighed in on the supposed secrecy (per CinemaBlend) surrounding the film.",
    "Speaking during the press tour for Marvel\u2019s Shang-Chi, Feige said that it \u201chas not necessarily occurred to me that it [No Way Home] is any more or less secret than any of our other projects\u201d, before confirming that \u201cthere will be a trailer\u201d before the movie\u2019s December 17 release.",
    "Fans have welcomed and, in some cases, scoffed at the news that a trailer will eventually arrive, given that we\u2019ve waited a long time for one. But Feige is right: No Way Home isn\u2019t more secretive than previous MCU movies \u2013 not by a long shot \u2013 and there are a myriad of reasons why.",
    "Of the 24 MCU movies released so far, Avengers: Endgame has been the most secretive by far. Add in forthcoming movies like Shang-Chi, Eternals and No Way Home, and we\u2019d still consider Marvel\u2019s tight-lipped approach to Endgame to be greater than any previous or upcoming film project.",
    "Endgame\u2019s first trailer didn\u2019t arrive until four months before its April 2019 release. Even then, the trailer\u2019s footage primarily drew from the film\u2019s opening hour and was spliced together with scenes from previous Marvel flicks. The second trailer wasn\u2019t released until a month before Endgame\u2019s launch, too, and was even more nondescript than its predecessor.",
    "Combine this with the film\u2019s ensemble cast being reticent to discuss the movie during its press tour (for fear of letting secrets slip) and Endgame being the culmination of 11 years of MCU movies, and it\u2019s unsurprising that Marvel played its cards so close to its chest.",
    "Sure, some fans will point out that No Way Home still doesn\u2019t have a trailer. The longer that wait goes on, too, the less time there will be between the trailer\u2019s release and the launch of the movie. So there's still time for No Way Home to overtake Endgame as the Marvel movie with the shortest time span between its initial trailer arriving and the movie\u2019s actual release.",
    "There are reasons behind the trailer\u2019s supposed delay, though. Asad Ayaz, Disney\u2019s Head of Marketing, recently told The Hollywood Reporter that it\u2019s Sony Pictures \u2013 not Marvel \u2013 who dictates when No Way Home\u2019s trailer will arrive. While Marvel is closely partnered with Sony on the flick, it\u2019s the latter that owns the Spider-Man IP, so it\u2019ll decide when the first trailer drops.",
    "According to the latest rumors, Spider-Man: No Way Home\u2019s first footage could debut at CinemaCon between August 23 and 26. If that\u2019s true, we might not have much longer to wait for the trailer to be made public.",
    "Still, No Way Home\u2019s apparently secretive approach pales in comparison to Endgame. Or even Marvel Disney Plus shows like WandaVision and Loki, for that matter, with fans heavily speculating where each series would go in between their weekly episodic instalments.",
    "How so? No Way Home\u2019s merchandise and casting leaks hold the answers.",
    "Marvel Studios may have a tight handle on the information that it releases, but other companies and individuals aren\u2019t so hush-hush.",
    "Take No Way Home\u2019s official merchandise, for example. Various tie-in toys and collectibles, such as Lego sets, Funko Pops and other figurines, have revealed potentially spoiler-heavy elements of the movie. Alright, we don\u2019t know how these factor into the film\u2019s story, but some of these merchandise drops, coupled with Doctor Strange\u2019s role in the movie, have given us a glimpse at what the plot could entail.",
    "Members of the cast, though officially unconfirmed by Marvel as of yet, haven\u2019t been shy about confirming that they\u2019ll appear in No Way Home, either.",
    "Alfred Molina, who portrayed Doc Ock in 2004\u2019s Spider-Man 2, has already stated that he\u2019ll be reprising his role (per Variety) in the forthcoming threequel \u2013 something that Feige responded to during the Black Widow press tour (via ET Online). Jamie Foxx \u2013 Electro in 2014\u2019s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 \u2013 has also pre-emptively confirmed he will be part of No Way Home\u2019s cast.",
    "Add in the continuous speculation surrounding the return of former Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield \u2013 rumors that Garfield and current Spider-Man star Tom Holland have denied \u2013 and some of No Way Home\u2019s biggest secrets may have been revealed ahead of time.",
    "Spider-Man is historically one of Marvel\u2019s most popular superheroes. With such a big fanbase, any live-action property concerning the wallcrawler is bound to elicit numerous rumors.",
    "No Way Home is expected to be Holland\u2019s final outing as Spider-Man, as well as the movie to provide greater clarity on how the multiverse\u2019s arrival will affect the MCU moving forward. We\u2019ve received glimpses of its impact in Loki season 1 and Marvel\u2019s What If\u2026? series, but No Way Home will offer a much clearer indication of the chaos that\u2019s about to ensue.",
    "While Marvel is yet to officially confirm whether any of the above rumors are true, though, the secrecy surrounding Spider-Man: No Way Home isn\u2019t as grandiose as we\u2019re being led to believe.",
    "Yes, it\u2019s being driven by a simple desire for a trailer \u2013 one that will hopefully corroborate some of the speculation surrounding the film \u2013 but we haven\u2019t been left in the dark completely. There are things we know outside of what Marvel has officially revealed, so much so that Spider-Man: No Way Home\u2019s apparent secrecy is inferior to some of the studio\u2019s other recent productions.",
    "It\u2019s frustrating that we have to wait so long for an official look at No Way Home but, at this point, there\u2019s a big chance that the first trailer will just reveal what we already know about the movie.",
    "We know more about Spider-Man: No Way Home than we think \u2013 so let\u2019s stop blowing its supposed secrecy out of proportion."
