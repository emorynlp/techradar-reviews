    "The first film made such a splash that Aquaman 2 soon became inevitable.",
    "That\u2019s because the highest-grossing movie ever based on a DC Comics character doesn\u2019t belong to any of the famous trinity of Batman, Superman or Wonder Woman. Instead, the Jason Momoa-starring, James Wan-directed Aquaman beat them all \u2013 the new king of Atlantis was also crowned DC\u2019s king of the box office.",
    "It\u2019s something of a sea-change for a character who\u2019d traditionally been the butt of the joke in comic-book circles \u2013 in everything from Family Guy to the fake James Cameron movie in Entourage. But thanks to Momoa\u2019s wise-cracking performance, a makeover inspired by DC\u2019s New 52 reboot, and The Conjuring/Fast & Furious 7 director James Wan\u2019s instinct for underwater spectacle, he\u2019s now one of the DC Extended Universe\u2019s MVPs \u2013 this is one franchise that isn\u2019t going to be sleeping with the fishes any time soon.",
    "So as the hotly anticipated sequel gears up for production in summer 2021, we dive into the intel that\u2019s already washed ashore \u2013 everything from the Aquaman 2's release date and cast, to what it all means for the story. However it all turns out, Aquaman 2 is sure to make waves\u2026",
    "The first Aquaman hit cinemas in December 2018, and came out on top in a month that also included the releases of Mary Poppins Returns, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Bumblebee. It\u2019s not much of a surprise, then, that Warner Bros has targeted another December debut for its sequel, with the Aquaman 2 release date currently set for December 16, 2022 \u2013 almost exactly four years after the first movie\u2019s release.",
    "It looks like production on Aquaman 2 will get underway in the UK later this year \u2013 that\u2019s what Dolph Lundgren (who plays King Nereus) told the Wizard World Virtual Experience (via ScreenRant), anyway. \u201cI may be doing Aquaman 2 this summer, shooting in London,\u201d the Rocky IV, He-Man and Punisher star told his assembled fans.",
    "The first movie shot on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast, so the UK will be a major relocation \u2013 though seeing as all the underwater scenes were filmed \u2018dry-for-wet\u2018 in a studio, with actors supported by sophisticated harnesses, it shouldn\u2019t make much difference to the look of the film.",
    "Unlike Warner Bros\u2019 2021 releases, it looks like Aquaman 2 won\u2019t be released on streaming service HBO Max at the same time it hits theaters. According to Deadline, Warner has struck a deal with cinema distributors to launch its 2022 release slate exclusively on the big screen \u2013 though the window of theatrical exclusivity will be cut back to a mere 45 days, so you won\u2019t have to wait that much longer to watch the movie at home on your TV.",
    "With production yet to get under way, it\u2019s a little early for DC and Warner to be unveiling any footage from the movie. The first Aquaman teaser debuted at San Diego Comic-Con 2018, and \u2013 assuming the smaller Comic-Con Special Edition goes ahead as planned over Thanksgiving weekend \u2013 it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see some kind of Aquaman 2 trailer there, especially as Warner/DC have a history of big Hall H reveals.",
    "That said, DC has just announced that its digital FanDome event will return in 2021 on October 16. Last year, that's where The Batman's trailer was first revealed \u2013 so it's more likely we'll see Aquaman there this year, since the event is specifically geared for a global audience.",
    "Here are the confirmed cast members for Aquaman 2 based on what we know so far, though you can expect this list to grow as we learn more about the movie:",
    "It\u2019s no surprise that Jason Momoa is returning to play Arthur Curry/Aquaman for the fourth time (after Aquaman, Justice League and a very brief cameo in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). And despite (seemingly unfounded) rumors that Amber Heard wasn\u2019t going to be back as Xebelian princess (and daughter of Nereus) Mera, the actor posted an image of herself reading a book on her Instagram feed \u2013 along with a #gettingakindleforaquaman2 hashtag.",
    "With Arthur Curry having shown mercy to his scheming half-brother Orm (aka the self-styled Ocean Master) at the end of the first movie, James Wan regular Patrick Wilson has seemingly confirmed he\u2019s part of the Aquaman 2 cast in an Instagram post about his training routine.",
    "And it looks like there\u2019ll be someone on hand to keep the squabbling siblings in check, with Nicole Kidman rumored (via We Got This Covered) to be back as their mother, Atlantis\u2019s Queen Atlanna. While it\u2019s yet to be confirmed officially, we suspect this also means a return for Temuera Morrison (soon to be seen as the title character in The Book of Boba Fett) as Arthur\u2019s dad, Thomas Curry \u2013 after all, with Atlanna and Thomas reunited after decades apart, it would be cruel not to let them rekindle a romance that brought two worlds together.",
    "There\u2019s no word yet on whether Willem Dafoe will return as Arthur\u2019s Atlantean mentor, Vulko, but it seems a safe bet, if only to help keep the new king of Atlantis on the straight and narrow.",
    "Meanwhile, Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II confirmed to Uproxx that he\u2019ll be back to represent the surface dwellers as the owner of one of the most iconic helmets in comic books, the revenge-obsessed Black Manta. Chances are we\u2019ll also be seeing more from Randall Park (recently seen starring as Jimmy Woo in Marvel\u2019s WandaVision) as marine biologist-turned-Atlantis expert Dr Stephen Shin, seeing as the two joined forces during Aquaman\u2019s end credits sting.",
    "And given Pilou Asb\u00e6k\u2019s history as a bad guy in Game of Thrones, we think it\u2019s likely his role in the Aquaman 2 cast (reported by Deadline) will skew more to the dark side than the light.",
    "Now that DC is less hung up than it used to be about creating an interweaving, MCU-style shared universe for its superheroes, the most we know for certain about the Aquaman 2 plot is that the movie\u2019s being scripted by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick. The writer previously worked with director James Wan on two The Conjuring movies and the first Aquaman.",
    "\u201cI think the second one is a little bit more serious, a little bit more relevant in the world we are living in today,\u201d Wan teased at DC\u2019s virtual FanDome event in August 2020 (via Deadline). \u201cI think that\u2019s where it wants to go.\u201d",
    "He expanded slightly when Patrick Wilson suggested he\u2019d prefer to see Aquaman 2 exploring uncharted waters. \u201cI can definitely guarantee you new worlds in this next one,\u201d replied Wan, \u201cand I think you\u2019re going to be very excited as an actor.\u201d",
    "What does all this mean for Arthur Curry now that he\u2019s donned Aquaman\u2019s classic gold and green armor, got his hands on the Trident of Atlan, and taken his place on the throne of Atlantis? While he and the water-manipulating Mera were seemingly an item by the end of the first movie, Hollywood convention and the needs of storytelling dictate it probably won\u2019t be plain sailing this time out.",
    "Indeed, past form suggests Orm won\u2019t make life easy for his half-brother \u2013 though Wilson\u2019s aforementioned Instagram post may have muddied the waters slightly with a cryptic #brothersdontshakehandsbrothersgottahug. Could a familial reconciliation be on the cards?",
    "David Hyde, aka Black Manta, seems primed for a promotion to lead villain in Aquaman 2. Blaming Arthur Curry for the death of his father during a skirmish on a submarine in the first movie, Black Manta has become obsessed with having his revenge on the Aquaman. And having survived their previous encounter by the skin of his teeth \u2013 even when armed with superpowered Atlantean weapons \u2013 he\u2019s unlikely to give up until Arthur Curry is dead.",
    "Chances are that Black Manta will be assisted in his mission by Dr Shin, a character who\u2019s made the journey to the screen from DC Comics\u2019 New 52 Aquaman reboot. The Aquaman end credits sequence showed the duo making a deal \u2013 if Shin helps Black Manta find Aquaman, Black Manta will give him concrete evidence on the existence of Atlantis.",
    "Unfortunately, Black Manta\u2019s mission to dish out revenge may be bad news for Thomas Curry \u2013 if he decides that justices is best served by murdering the father of the man he believes killed his own dad.",
    "And don\u2019t be surprised if Aquaman 2 also makes a return trip to the Trench, the dark, scary region of the ocean whose monstrous inhabitants kept Atlanna prisoner in Aquaman \u2013 especially now that the proposed The Trench movie spin-off has been dropped by Warner Bros (as reported by Variety)."
