  "article": [
    "Late last year, a report suggested that 2021's expected iOS 15 update from Apple wouldn't be landing on some older iPhone models and a new source is claiming to have similar information backing up that claim.",
    "If both these reports are correct, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and original iPhone SE will be the handsets that don't receive the latest software. That suggests the iPhone 7 series and later will still get iOS 15.",
    "This new information comes from a new report in French website iPhoneSoft. While we haven't seen any leaks from this source in the past, the website is claiming it has its information from a source within Apple.",
    "The phones listed in this new report match the iPhone models we've previously heard would miss out on iOS 15, but it doesn't mention the iPad models that were in the 2020 report from a different source.",
    "That suggested the iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2 and iPad 5 (the model from 2017) would be set to miss out on the upgrade to iPadOS 15 - an offshoot of iOS 15 software - but it's possible iPads were just omitted from the new list.",
    "If you own one of these older devices, this doesn't mean you won't be able to continue using your smartphone or tablet but it does mean you'll miss out on new features and key security changes to Apple's software.",
    "Apple keeps its devices upgraded to newer software for quite a long time - the iPhone 6S will be nearly six years old by the time iOS 15 comes out - but that doesn't make it any less irritating for those who want to hold onto their older phones but experience new software upgrades.",
    "Apple often unveils its software updates at WWDC in June, and last year the company went for a virtual event to ensure it could still unveil its new software. What will happen for 2021's event is still unclear, but expect to hear about Apple's new mobile phone software around the middle of the year.",
