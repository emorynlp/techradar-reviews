  "article": [
    "LinkedIn has declared plans to keep operating in China, despite a planned shutdown of its main web offering.",
    "In an official statement, the Microsoft-owned site said that due to a \u201csignificantly more challenging operating environment\u201d and \u201cgreater compliance requirements in China\u201d, it is forced to turn off its global site in the country.",
    "In its place, it will instead run a site simply hosting job listing boards, and nothing else.",
    "However, more details have now come to light following after the company\u2019s president for China, Lu Jian, took to social media to play down the importance of the change.",
    "\u201cThe reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,\u201d The Financial Times cited Jian as saying. LinkedIn has made \u201cstrategic adjustments\u201d, he said, which were needed to create new products. It would \u201cfully use its international platform\u201d to help business owners and workers find each other, and will continue helping Chinese firms \u201cconnect with global business opportunities\u201d.",
    "\u201cLinkedIn won\u2019t cut its investment in China, it will increase it. We won\u2019t cut employees and we definitely won\u2019t leave the country,\u201d he added.",
    "Following drop-outs by other rivals, LinkedIn had been one of the last Western social media networks left standing on the Chinese market.",
    "Analysts have said that Microsoft was forced to weigh between remaining operational in China, and adhering to its core values, and, in order to keep its brand image intact, tilted towards the latter.",
    "The US government has also commented on the move, the FT reported, saying Microsoft did well to scale back, adding that China forces companies to be \u201ccomplicit in its repression and authoritarian practices\u201d.",
    "At the moment, LinkedIn claims to have 54 million Chinese users, up from 51 million a year ago. It employs a total of 260 people, 40 of which joined the Beijing and Shanghai offices in the past four years.",
