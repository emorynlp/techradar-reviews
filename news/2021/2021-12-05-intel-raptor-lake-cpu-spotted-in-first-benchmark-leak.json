    "Raptor Lake is Intel\u2019s range of next-gen processors expected to come out in 2022, and we\u2019ve just seen the first purported benchmark of these CPUs.",
    "As highlighted by regular hardware leaker Komachi_Ensaka on Twitter, what could be the 13th-gen flagship processor has been sighted in a BAPCo Crossmark benchmark as Tom\u2019s Hardware reports.",
    "Note that the benchmark has since been removed \u2013 of course, it shouldn\u2019t have been aired in the first place \u2013 but not before Tom\u2019s screen grabbed and shared the news.",
    "According to the details given here, the spec that the chip runs with is eight performance cores (new Raptor Cove cores), and 16 efficiency cores (Gracemont cores \u2013 the same as with Alder Lake). This is what was previously rumored, and gives the processor a theoretical 32-threads (as efficiency cores don\u2019t have hyper-threading).",
    "The benchmark itself shows the Raptor Lake CPU hitting an overall score of 1,591, which compares to a result of 2,376 for the Core i9-12900K, Intel\u2019s new Alder Lake flagship.",
    "It\u2019s no surprise \u2013 assuming this benchmark is genuine, which is always a bit of a leap of faith with very early leaks \u2013 to see that Raptor Lake is a good deal slower than Alder Lake at this point in its development (the 12900K is almost 50% faster here, in fact). Obviously, when the Raptor Lake flagship is finished, that won\u2019t be the case (if it wasn\u2019t measurably faster, Intel would go back to the drawing board until it was).",
    "What\u2019s happening here is because this is a very early testing sample, it\u2019s doubtless locked to slow clock speeds and doesn\u2019t remotely reflect the performance of the final product which should emerge later in 2022 (maybe in Q3). Right now, Raptor Lake will still have plenty of optimization to be done on both the hardware and software fronts.",
    "The theory is that Intel\u2019s 13th-gen CPUs will be a simple refresh of Alder Lake, but it\u2019s bound to make some decent architectural gains as Intel refines its new hybrid tech, and obviously the addition of more efficiency cores \u2013 a lot more if these early rumors are right \u2013 should make a considerable difference to performance too.",
    "There is also speculation about Raptor Lake taking some big strides forward in terms of power-efficiency as well, so we can still remain quietly optimistic about what the next-gen might bring."
