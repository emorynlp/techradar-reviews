    "This series of guides about Chinese phones covers a range of brands, from large established names, to new up-and-comers. ZTE sits somewhere in between \u2013 it\u2019s been around for years, yet remains fairly unknown in the West.",
    "That\u2019s a shame, because ZTE is arguably the company bringing the most interesting smartphones to market \u2013 and by \u2018interesting\u2019 we don\u2019t necessarily mean \u2018top-spec\u2019; we mean novel or quirky. Many of ZTE\u2019s devices come with unique features, design quirks or tools that make it a brand that\u2019s well worth keeping an eye on.",
    "For example, the company\u2019s Axon 20 was the first phone to feature an under-display selfie camera. Its Nubia Z20 had a screen on the rear of the device as well as on the front, and the Nubia Alpha smartwatch was in effect a phone for your wrist that came complete with a front-facing selfie camera.",
    "Whether you\u2019re interested in buying one of these novel smartphones, or simply curious about ZTE\u2019s future devices, below we cover everything you need to know about the company including the smartphones and other tech it releases.",
    "ZTE was founded in China in 1985, and its main business is telecommunications, not consumer hardware. Nevertheless, there\u2019s plenty of tech to explore. The company\u2019s most well-known sub-brand, Nubia, was founded in 2012.",
    "If you\u2019re skeptical about technology from China \u2013 as some people are \u2013 it\u2019s worth reading up on ZTE, even if it\u2019s simply skimming the Wikipedia page. The company has a few controversies under its belt \u2013 and it\u2019s partially owned by the Chinese state. That doesn\u2019t mean your personal information will be beamed straight to China, of course, but it\u2019s worth being aware of the company\u2019s background.",
    "ZTE has many handsets in its family of products, and they\u2019re loosely organized into series \u2013 \u2018loose\u2019 being the operative word here. We\u2019ll run you through all the phone lines worth knowing about.",
    "Nubia, as a sub-brand, is fairly large, encompassing a number of phones. There are devices such as the Z20 and X 5G, which feature screens on the rear as well as the front of the device, and others such as the Z, X and V line. In terms of specs, these are best described as mid-range, but sometimes they come with more premium features.",
    "The Nubia Red Magic line of smartphones is ZTE\u2019s gaming line, and these are often some of the best gaming phones of the year, including such features as built-in cooling systems and super-high screen refresh rates. These phones come in a numbered main line with the occasional Pro or budget model too.",
    "ZTE\u2019s Axon line is made up of more premium-feeling handsets, units that come with top specs and features, although they\u2019re relatively low in price. Of all ZTE\u2019s ranges, the Axon line could be considered the most high end.",
    "Then there\u2019s the Blade range, which is ZTE\u2019s budget phones, usually coming with physical fingerprint sensors and plastic shells \u2013 although there are exceptions to this rule.",
    "There seems to be little rhyme or reason to ZTE\u2019s release patterns, with new Axon, Blade and Nubia phones being launched all the time.",
    "The one exception is the Red Magic line of gaming phones \u2013 the new entry in this line is released roughly annually, in the first few months of the year, although belated budget and Pro versions can come out later in the calendar.",
    "ZTE makes smartwatches, usually under its Nubia line. The two most well-known products are the Nubia Alpha and Nubia Watch, both of which featured long, curved displays that wrapped around the wrist. The former also included a camera.",
    "The company has also launched affordable true wireless headphones, in the form of the LiveBuds and Nubia Buds, which were seemingly designed to be used with the company\u2019s smartphones."
