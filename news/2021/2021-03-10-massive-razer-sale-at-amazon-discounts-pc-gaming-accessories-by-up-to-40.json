    "Amazon is still offering some excellent prices in its current Razer sales, with discounts across a massive range of PC gaming accessories. Whether you're in need of a new mouse, keyboard, or a set of cheap headphones, then, there's plenty to browse here.",
    "If you're in the market for a Razer gaming mouse, you'll find the DeathAdder Essential sitting at an excellent $29.99. That's 40% off the already strong value of $50 MSRP, but there's plenty more power in some of the higher-tier models.",
    "The DeathAdder V2 Pro, for example, is also taking part in this week's Razer deals. You're getting a boost in your optical sensor here, with extra programmable buttons, a wireless design with low latency connection and excellent battery life, and a super lightweight 88g form factor as well. This gaming mouse is usually $129.99, but right now you can pick it up for just $89.99 at Amazon.",
    "If you need a new set of keys, however, we'd recommend checking out the Razer BlackWidow Elite. The mechanical gaming keyboard has been cheaper in the past, but with a $137 sales price (was $169.99) you're getting a tried and trusted deck with a strong discount.",
    "We're rounding up all of Amazon's latest Razer sales just below.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more cheap gaming headsets, gaming mouse deals, and gaming keyboard prices in your region.",
    "If you're kitting out your whole rig this week, check out the latest gaming laptop deals (or the best Razer Blade gaming laptop deals if you're looking to stay on brand) and cheap gaming monitors to sort out your whole setup. Then head over to our roundup of the best cheap game deals available now for something to play."
