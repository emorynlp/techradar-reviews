    "Apple could be set to release the AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds as early as 2022, according to veteran analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The wireless earbuds would be a follow-up to 2019\u2019s original AirPods Pro. As such, an updated model has been a long time coming.",
    "Reported by iMore, Kuo predicted in a research note that AirPods Pro sales will \u201cdecline in the short term,\u201d but will be boosted to over 100 million units sold in 2022, hinting that the AirPods Pro 2 could launch next year.",
    "It\u2019s also been rumored that the mid-range AirPods 3 will debut later this year, with reports suggesting that suppliers have begun shipping the necessary components to manufacture the rumored earbuds.",
    "Despite the potential three-year gap between the launch of the AirPods Pro and its rumored successor, you\u2019d hardly know it. 2019\u2019s AirPods Pro are still an impressive pair of wireless earbuds despite their age, with great sound and effective noise cancellation justifying the high price tag.",
    "The original AirPods Pro retailed at $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399 and, barring any substantial improvements to the AirPods Pro 2, we expect the succeeding wireless earbuds to fall within that price range. Apple\u2019s premium products are almost always aimed at enthusiasts and those already well invested in the Apple space, so a hefty price tag is usually a given.",
    "As always, it\u2019s best to take rumors of the AirPods Pro 2\u2019s release date with a pinch of salt. We\u2019ve had no concrete announcements from Apple as of yet, but with the company\u2019s upcoming iPhone event happening in September, it might not be too long before we see announcements on a wide range of new Apple products."
