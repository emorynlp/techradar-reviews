  "article": [
    "Ubisoft announced that it\u2019s currently working on a sequel to the Nintendo Switch launch title, Mario + Rabbids, that will be released in 2022.",
    "The new entry is called Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope and it follows the mish-mash crew of Nintendo and Ubisoft mascots as they journey to a new planet.",
    "According to the game\u2019s developer, the game will still offer tactical combat similar to the first game \u2013 but with some more action-based elements that will engage first-time players.",
    "\u201cIt's not just new story with new enemies and new heroes - Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope has big ambitions,\u201d says Xavier Manzanares, Lead Producer at Ubisoft.",
    "The plot revolves around Luma that have been infused with Rabbids genes that will grant you new powers as you rescue them and will star some new characters like Rabid Rosalina.",
    "Check out the full trailer down below:",
    "While the game is admittedly a bit niche, it\u2019s an important landmark for Ubisoft\u2019s and Nintendo\u2019s partnership \u2013 as it shows two notoriously defensive publishers sharing their work to create a new entry in their combined franchise.",
    "That said, it also fills in some of the gaps in the Nintendo Switch release calendar as next year was looking a bit sparse. Outside of Pokemon Legends: Arceus and Splatoon 3, Nintendo hasn\u2019t given any firm 2022 release dates to any of its upcoming releases, though that is something that could change Tuesday, June 15 after its next Nintendo Direct.",
    "We\u2019ll hear from the big N on Tuesday and hopefully we\u2019ll get a better idea of when we can expect heavy hitters like Metroid Prime 4, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 and Bayonetta 3."
