    "After a weighted blanket ahead of Cyber Monday? You're not the only one \u2013 countless people have found that a weighted blanket can reduce stress and help them get to sleep more easily, and the incoming Cyber Monday deals mean it's a very good time to buy.",
    "Right now Amazon is running discounts on its YnM Weighted Blanket \u2013 a 100% cotton blanket that uses glass beads to increase its density \u2013 that's now just $37.75 in the US (down from $69.90), and \u00a345.90 in the UK (down from \u00a391.90). In both cases, that's roughly a half-price discount, and well worth picking up.",
    "The deal is only available for Amazon Prime members, it seems, so you'll need to be a subscriber to get the discount \u2013 though if you're desperate for a weighted blanket it may be worth picking up at full price anyhow.",
    "You have a choice between 32 different colorways and patterns, and its seven layers can help reduce anxiety (or insomnia) and give you a better night's sleep. There are 14 different sizes and weights to choose between \u2013 it should be 8-10% of your body weight (if in doubt, go lighter rather than heavier).",
    "So now that you're tucked up in bed, why not get an Alexa speaker deal so you can bark commands to a smart speaker without having to lift a finger? You can see the latest deals on Amazon Echo hardware below:"
