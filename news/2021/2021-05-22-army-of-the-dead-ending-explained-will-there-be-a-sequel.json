    "Spoilers follow for Army of the Dead.",
    "Army of the Dead has landed on Netflix, and we imagine you\u2019ll have questions about Zack Snyder\u2019s zombie-heist movie if you\u2019ve watched it.",
    "While the director\u2019s latest film is a self-contained story, there are still some loose plot threads left hanging by the end of the movie.",
    "Our Army of the Dead ending explained article is here to answer any queries you may have. We dive into some of the movie\u2019s biggest talking points, including comments from Snyder and the cast on its finale, a potential sequel, and how Army of the Dead\u2019s prequel projects may be affected by it.",
    "One final warning before we begin: huge spoilers for Army of the Dead follow, including character deaths and whether discussions have even taken place about Army of the Dead 2 yet. So turn back now if you haven\u2019t watched or finished the movie.",
    "Before we dive into how Army of the Dead\u2019s ending might set up a sequel, let\u2019s recount the events that lead up to, and include, its finale.",
    "Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) isn\u2019t interested in reclaiming the $200 million he has squirreled away in his Las Vegas casino vault. Instead, he wants to help the US Government obtain a zombie sample so that they can control their own army of zombies \u2013 the \u201cultimate biological weapon\u201d as Tanaka\u2019s head of security Martin (Garret Dillahunt) tells Lily (Nora Arnezeder).",
    "Lily was supposed to help Martin obtain a zombie blood sample, and provided the pair were successful, the US Government would release the remaining refugees from the Las Vegas immigration camp at Lily\u2019s request.",
    "With this new blood sample, the US Government could experiment with its zombie army plans further. We say \u2018further\u2019 because it had previously conducted tests with zombie soldiers in the form of Zeus (Richard Cetrone). In the movie\u2019s opening scenes, Zeus was being transported from Area 51 to an undisclosed location by the US Army. However, following a road accident, he escapes from his prison, kills his army escorts, causes the Las Vegas zombie outbreak, and becomes king of the undead hordes.",
    "Instead of acquiring this sample, Martin decapitates Zeus\u2019 zombie queen (Athena Perample) after he and Lily capture it, and decides to bring its head back to Tanaka and the US Government instead. When Zeus finds out that his wife has been killed, he furiously leads his forces against Martin and company in search of revenge.",
    "Before Zeus does that, however, a surprise revelation is made: he was going to be a father.",
    "After Zeus carries the corpse of his bride into Olympus Tower (the zombies\u2019 headquarters), he lays her on the floor and rips her stomach open. He pulls something out of her, and it\u2019s revealed to be a stillborn zombie fetus.",
    "While this is part of Snyder\u2019s reinvention of zombies, in part to make audiences sympathize with them, the director also told us that the zombie baby was included as a plot device that, ultimately, would give Zeus a reason to lead to his full-scale assault on Scott Ward (Dave Baustista) and his fellow mercenaries.",
    "Speaking to TechRadar at the movie\u2019s pre-release press junket, Snyder explained: \u201cAs far as the zombie baby goes, I wanted audiences to feel like that was the last straw [for Zeus]. I wanted audiences to think \u2018you\u2019re in trouble now\u2019 regarding Scott and the others.\u201d",
    "In trouble they certainly are. Chambers (Samantha Win) and slimy security guard Burt (Theo Rossi) aside, almost everyone else dies as a result of Martin\u2019s actions in the explosive battle that follows.",
    "By the time the battle is over, only Scott, his daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) and helicopter pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro) remain. That is until Zeus tracks them down and, in the ensuing fight inside their getaway helicopter, Peters is accidentally shot and Scott gets bitten.",
    "Scott eventually kills Zeus by shooting him in the head. However, as a result of the nuclear strike\u2019s atomic explosion, the helicopter crashes, killing Peters and separating Kate and Scott.",
    "The duo reunite, but a severely injured Scott is at death\u2019s door. Remembering the money he scooped up before Zeus\u2019 attack, Scott gives it to Kate so she can start a new life. The pair tearfully say goodbye before Scott dies and becomes a zombie. A distraught Kate shoots him in the head before she boards a rescue helicopter, which was presumably sent by Tanaka or the US Army to locate any survivors.",
    "Kate, though, isn\u2019t the sole human survivor, with the next scene revealing that Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) survived the nuclear blast. Locked inside the casino vault by Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer) as Zeus attacked, Vanderohe emerges from the rubble, following the nuclear strike, with two bags full of cash.",
    "He travels to Utah, and bribes an air stewardess to let him rent a private jet bound for Mexico City. However, on the plane he starts to feel dizzy, and heads to the bathroom to clear his head.",
    "Vanderohe realizes that he was bitten by Zeus during the pair\u2019s confrontation. As the jet\u2019s pilot tells him to return to his seat before they depart, Vanderohe laughs at the irony of his situation: he\u2019s the new \u2018patient zero\u2019, and seems set to cause a new zombie outbreak in Mexico\u2019s capital city.",
    "This scene in particular, then, appears to set up a sequel. Netflix is yet to reveal any plans for Army of the Dead 2, but, talking to TechRadar, Hardwick refused to completely rule out that possibility.",
    "\u201cI can\u2019t disclose that [the possibilities for a sequel], but I think everyone would be excited as I would if there was an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it does happen, you could get to see my character get down in a new way. But I can\u2019t necessarily speak about the way it looks, or the form or fashion you\u2019ll see Vanderohe in the future.\u201d",
    "As for Dieter, it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s alive at the end of the film. During Zeus\u2019 punch-up with Vanderohe, the alpha zombie is clearly on top, and looks to be on the verge of killing the former zombie-stomping war hero.",
    "Dieter, though, attacks Zeus to save his newfound friend. He pushes Vanderohe into the vault and closes the door to sacrifice himself. The last we see of Dieter is when Zeus grabs him, which implies that Dieter is killed by the zombie king moments later.",
    "However, we don\u2019t actually see Dieter die. There are only two suggested character deaths \u2013 those of Dieter and Lily \u2013 that we don\u2019t witness, but given that Lily is impaled on a shipping container by Zeus\u2019 spear during the helicopter escape sequence, we can safely assume that Zeus kills her before tackling Scott, Kate and Peters.",
    "Dieter\u2019s case is different. We see Zeus pull him away from the vault door, but nothing after that. It\u2019s almost certain that Zeus kills Dieter, and that Snyder spared us having to watch our favorite German safecracker die on screen \u2013 and if Zeus didn\u2019t kill him, it\u2019s also very likely that Dieter died during the nuclear explosion later on.",
    "But what if he didn\u2019t? What if, somehow, he survived both Zeus\u2019 attack and the nuclear strike?",
    "We already know that Schweigh\u00f6fer will star in and direct Netflix\u2019s upcoming Army of the Dead prequel movie, Army of Thieves, which will explore Dieter\u2019s backstory. Apart from a brief movie synopsis, though, we don\u2019t know anything about the film, so it could have a flash-forward moment that reveals whether he lives or dies in Army of the Dead, too.",
    "We\u2019re sure that viewers will want to know if the movie\u2019s breakout star survived the ordeal. Schweigh\u00f6fer recently confirmed (per The Mary Sue) that Army of Thieves was only conceived once Army of the Dead was completed.",
    "With that being the case, Schweigh\u00f6fer and Snyder could have discussed Dieter\u2019s fate in Army of the Dead. If they agree that he escaped Zeus\u2019 grasp and survived the nuclear explosion, we could get a scene in Army of Thieves that confirms this.",
    "We\u2019re holding out hope, then, that there might be an Army of Thieves scene that shows whether Dieter survived or not. Schweigh\u00f6fer declined to comment on his character\u2019s sacrifice, or if Dieter\u2019s fate will be revealed in Army of Thieves, when we quizzed him on it, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see if he did.",
    "Army of the Dead is available to stream exclusively on Netflix now."
