  "article": [
    "In the latest update to its cloud storage service, Google has added full support for Apple M1 Macs to Google Drive for desktop.",
    "With the release of version 52.0 of Google Drive for desktop, Mac users with a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini or iMac running Apple silicon can now take full advantage of the search giant's new unified client.",
    "Google's new unified client also offers improved support for Apple's Photo Library including media that is synced with iCloud as part of Google Photos.",
    "After years of maintaining two separate clients in the form of Backup and Sync for consumers and Drive File Stream for businesses, Google decided to merge them into one offering back in July.",
    "While Backup and Sync gained \u201cimproved Apple M1 support\u201d at the beginning of this year, Drive File Stream only added \u201copen beta\u201d support for Apple Silicon in February. An update in May brought improvements in regard to Apple M1 support though it was still a beta.",
    "In addition to M1 Mac support, the latest Google Drive update also offers improved accessibility for folders and files created offline, support for some cameras to back up to Drive for desktop, the ability to manage and purchase additional cloud storage from within the client, improved sync performance when connecting to a network after working offline and other improvements.",
    "Now that Google no longer has to maintain two separate clients, expect updates to Google Drive for desktop to begin rolling out at a faster pace.",
