  "article": [
    "Intel has been talking more about its incoming high-end gaming graphics cards, and revealing more about the branding \u2013 and thinking \u2013 behind them, the first generation of which will be Intel Arc Alchemist, with the chip giant sharing some renderings showing off this character.",
    "As we\u2019ve already seen, the naming convention Intel is running with for its HPG (high-performance gaming) graphics cards is RPG character classes going alphabetically. The first one is Alchemist, with Hot Hardware sharing a high-res artist rendering of this character (and a couple of wallpapers courtesy of managing editor Marco Chiappetta).",
    "Check it out above, but in our opinion, it has to be said that the artwork for the Alchemist looks pretty cool. Following the Alchemist, which was codenamed DG2 previously, we\u2019ll have what\u2019ll effectively be DG3, DG4 and DG5, which will be Battlemage, Celestial and Druid respectively.",
    "That\u2019s as far as Intel has got with its initial discrete GPU roadmap thus far, but that should take us out to late in the 2020s (depending on exact release cadence), bearing in mind that Alchemist is set to debut in Q1 of 2022 (with CES seeming a good bet as the right place to make a splash, as the rumor mill has already theorized).",
    "What\u2019s also interesting here is that during an interview with a couple of Intel execs Hot Hardware just held, during a question about Intel\u2019s overall goal with these new GPUs, hints were dropped about value being an important point \u2013 perhaps suggesting what we\u2019ve hoped for all along. Namely that Intel will attempt to make serious inroads into the Nvidia and AMD dominated (but mostly the former) desktop graphics market by leveraging competitive pricing.",
    "We really like Intel\u2019s naming scheme for the Arc GPUs. It\u2019s clever to tie the cards in with role-playing character classes, as this makes the products feel more relevant to gamers as opposed to, say, references to heavyweight scientists.",
    "If we\u2019re being picky, Battlemage and Celestial (particularly the latter) are a little bit of a fudge, and B and C should strictly speaking have been Bard and Cleric, going by the more common class stereotypes: but that wouldn\u2019t have worked as they obviously don\u2019t sound nearly dynamic enough (Bard might\u2019ve worked for a sound card range, once upon a time). At least Intel can go for the old Enchanter to follow Druid.",
    "The fact that Intel is laying out four generations of GPUs right off the bat is a clear statement of intent that Team Blue is in this for the long haul \u2013 and ready to have a proper go at taking on the dominant GPU powers.",
    "That said, it is just a signal at this point, and of course, Intel is going to want to make serious noises to build hype and make folks sit up and take notice. What the company has to do is follow this up, and hopefully, if Intel attacks on the value proposition front as hinted at above, that could really grab the attention of gamers.",
    "In a world which has increasingly spiraling out of control GPU prices, assuming Intel does take a competitive approach with pricing, that\u2019ll be a huge benefit to the overall graphics card arena.",
    "Affordable and available \u2013 stock\u2019s another issue, of course \u2013 graphics cards, now that\u2019d be quite something, eh? Here\u2019s hoping Intel really can conjure up some GPU magic to make 2022 a much-improved year for gamers hunting out a new graphics card."
