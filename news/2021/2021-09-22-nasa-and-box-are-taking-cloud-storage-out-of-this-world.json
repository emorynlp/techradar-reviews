    "\u201cNASA is leading the way on how government agencies are leveraging modern technology to better engage with stakeholders and improve mission outcomes. NASA\u2019s incredibly important mission, powered by its cloud and modernization strategy, and in partnership with companies like Box, is poised to help the agency bring agility to mission delivery, while ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data. We are thrilled to support NASA advance space exploration missions.\u201d",
    "Since 2017, NASA's Johnson Space Center has been using Box to power secure collaboration and critical processes for its Flight Operations Division with the aim of advancing space exploration missions.",
    "More specifically, the government agency selected Box to provide a secure collaboration space for internal content classified up to SBU and ITAR levels and to allow it to reduce unauthorized file sharing systems while reducing threat exposure through greater network controls.",

The government agency even relies on Box to manage versions of documents that support International Space Station operations.",
