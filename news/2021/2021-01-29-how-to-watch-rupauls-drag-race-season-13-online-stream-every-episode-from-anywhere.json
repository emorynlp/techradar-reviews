    "And this year\u2019s 13-strong line-up is fiercer than ever. In addition to Gottmik, there\u2019s the award-winning comedy costume queen Tina Burner; Chicagoan ice queen Denali, whose drag incorporates figure skating and acrobatics; Utica Queen, the self-dubbed \u201cSwitzerland of Drag\u201d (because she lives \u201coutside Drama Land\u201d), and the \u201cbad and bougie\u201d Kandy Muse, who declared season 13 to be the \u201crenaissance\u201d of Drag Race (although she probably meant \u201cRu-naissance\u201d).",
