    "Should you buy a 55-inch Samsung TV? In this guide, we'll take a look at the likely cost of a 55-inch 4K TV from Samsung, as well as the exact dimensions you can expect from this flagship TV size.",
    "55 inches is the standard size for a new television these days, being big enough for a home cinema but small enough not to take up all the space in an average living room. While 65-inch TVs are making headways in specific categories (like OLED TVs), and the average TV size keeps increasing, 55 inches remains the flagship size for most new screens, so it should be your starting point when updating your display.",
    "But it\u2019s not just the size that\u2019s convenient; 55-inch Samsung TVs will also pack in most, if not all the important panel technologies of the day, such as 4K resolution, HDR (and HDR10+), and the like. In cheaper models you might have to make do with edge lighting (say, on the Samsung Q60A) or a low-spec processor, but in general a standard 55-inch size will largely mean you\u2019re getting a standard, if not premium experience. (Just don't expect Dolby Vision.)",
    "So if you\u2019re starting to weigh up what new TV will be right for you, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Samsung 55-inch TVs.",
    "This might seem like an obvious question, but the 55-inch measurement for 55-inch TVs only refers to the diagonal length of the screen, from the lower left to upper right corner. That means you still need to take into account the exact measurement for the screen's width, height and depth to make sure you're not in for a surprise when opening up your shiny new screen.",
    "This year\u2019s 4K flagship, the Samsung QN95A, measures 1,227.4 x 706.2 x 25.9 mm (W x H x D), when only taking into account the screen itself. So you should make sure you measure the spot at home you\u2019re planning on placing the new TV, to make sure you actually have space for it.",
    "That 25.9mm depth is pretty slim, and pretty standard for most Samsung TVs \u2013 even the affordable 55-inch AU8000 measures in at 25.7mm \u2013 though the kind of TV stand bundled with the screen can shake things up. The central stand used for the QN95A will up that depth to 235.2mm, while the more compact feet used for the AU8000 expand the depth to just 228.8mm.",
    "It's important to ensure there's room for the stand or feet if you're going to be placing your 55-inch Samsung TV on a counter; if you're mounting the screen on the wall, meanwhile, you'll want to make sure the screen can sit relatively flush against it.",
    "As we\u2019ve said, there are a lot of 55-inch Samsung TVs \u2013 as almost every Samsung screen will come in a model of that size. The bottom of the range starts with Crystal 4K UHD TVs, moving up into QLED 4K TVs (with quantum dot filters for improved contrast and color), then Neo QLED 4K TVs (with Mini LED backlights for improved brightness control), and then even Neo QLED 8K TVs (with 8K resolution instead of Ultra HD).",
    "There is, in fact, a 55-inch 8K TV put out each year (last year\u2019s Q700T, or this year\u2019s QN700A) though you\u2019ll only get them in the UK and Europe, rather than in the US. At a 55-inch size, too, you won\u2019t really be able to see the benefits of 8K resolution, as the pixel density is too high to discern the difference unless you\u2019re standing extremely close to the screen.",
    "Samsung also has a range of lifestyle TVs that carry QLED panels, such as Samsung The Frame (a sleek TV designed to look like a picture frame when not in use) and the Samsung Serif (an easel-shaped screen), both of which come in 55 inch sizes. The Samsung Sero, a rotating TV designed for viewing vertical videos and scrolling through social media feeds, only comes in a 43-inch size, though.",
    "Pricing varies hugely across new Samsung TVs, with a huge range of models, sizes, and panel technologies to choose from.",
    "Keeping the same examples as above, the affordable AU8000 costs $599 / \u00a3679 / AU$1,195 at a 55-inch size \u2013 though this is a 2021 model and therefore is a bit pricier than older models (last year\u2019s 55-inch TU8000 retails for $550 in the US, while the TU7000 costs $450 at the same size).",
    "It\u2019s possible to get 55-inch Samsung TVs for less than that, though for a truly budget model you\u2019ll likely have to look at a cheaper brand like Sceptre or Insignia \u2013 and at those prices it might be safer to opt for a small TV that doesn\u2019t need to work as many pixels.",
    "At the higher end, new Samsung screens can cost several thousands of dollars / pounds. You'll get the Samsung QN90A (the 4K flagship in the US) for $1,799 / \u00a31,799, for one, while the QN95A in the UK retails for \u00a31,899 at the same 55-inch size. For a 55-inch Samsung screen, that's essentially the most you're paying though.",
