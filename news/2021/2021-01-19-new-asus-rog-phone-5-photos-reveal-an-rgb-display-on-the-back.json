    "Asus continues to be one of the only major companies to make gaming smartphones that are available globally, and a new leak suggests that the upcoming Asus ROG Phone 5 will opt for an even crazier design.",
    "The Asus ROG Phone 3 launched in July 2020, in a time when most other companies toned down their offerings in the gaming smartphone space. A previous rumor suggested the company will be skipping the Asus ROG Phone 4 - that number is considered unlucky in China - and jumping to the ROG Phone 5 for its next release.",
    "With the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 platform now available it looks like Asus might be getting ready for an early launch of its successor, with the teasers already live in China.",
    "The latest leak comes courtesy of Mukul Sharma (originally spotted on Chinese social networking site Weibo), which shows the Asus ROG Phone 5\u2019s front and back in real life.",
    "While the overall design language doesn\u2019t seem to have changed, there is one significant addition \u2014 the RGB logo on the back looks to be on its way out, in favor of an LED display strip. The image has arrows on the display, but we expect it could be customizable in some capacity.",
    "The \u201c05\u201d etching on the back is likely to be an indication of the phone\u2019s name, as 5 doesn\u2019t seem to represent anything else that is meaningful. Strangely, the iconic accented cooling vent is also not seen in the leaked images, which used to be a standard on Asus ROG phones. If that is the case, the ROG Phone 5 might finally be water-resistant to some degree \u2013 a feat none of its predecessors could boast of.",
    "The front of the phone doesn\u2019t reveal much except a new page that reads \u201cROG Vision\u201d. It could be a new application or element of the interface, or just an incorrect translation on an early device.",
    "Asus ROG Phone 5 launch date is expected to be announced soon as the company has already posted a teased on Weibo. Looking at the number of upcoming phones, it seems that February is going to be a busy month."
