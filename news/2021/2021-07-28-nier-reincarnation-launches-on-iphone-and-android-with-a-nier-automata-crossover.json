    "Nier Reincarnation, the latest game in the same universe as Nier Replicant and Nier Automata, is now available on iOS and Android as a free-to-play RPG.",
    "While Reincarnation is available to download, it may not be playable for everyone until later on Wednesday, as the game\u2019s official Twitter account announced - but it should be live by the afternoon PDT.",
    "As is typical for the Nier games, Nier Reincarnation (styled NieR Re[in]carnation) has a story shrouded in mystery: \u2018A girl awakens on a cold stone floor,\u2019 the game\u2019s description reads, and she\u2019s guided by a creature called Mama to explore her surroundings in a place called The Cage.",
    "While series creator and notorious mystery himself Yoko Taro returns as Creative Director on Reincarnation, the game is a collaboration between Square Enix and studio Applibot. But veteran fans of the franchise will be excited by a crossover event paired with the game\u2019s launch, which features Nier Automata characters 2B, 9S, and A2 as optional allies who can battle alongside the player in Reincarnation.",
    "While it may be strange to see a Nier game launch on mobile, Square Enix has been releasing games on smartphones for years.",
    "Most of these are remasters of classic games, from the original Final Fantasy to Final Fantasy 9 to Final Fantasy Tactics, as well as non-FF fan favorites like Secret of Mana. But the studio has also released smartphone-first games like the Apple Arcade launch title Various DayLife, as well as the lauded turn-based GO strategy games (Hitman GO, Lara Croft GO, and Deus Ex GO).",
    "Nier Reincarnation belongs to the latter as a game built for phones, though it\u2019ll likely have its own unique storytelling spin. We wouldn\u2019t expect its controls or gameplay to be much different than its console counterparts, though it\u2019s always possible - Square Enix did release an Apple Watch game, Cosmos Rings, though it wasn\u2019t well-received, per Engadget.",
