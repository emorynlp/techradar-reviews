    "Popular short-form video sharing platform TikTok has changed its privacy policy, allowing the company to collect biometric data from its US-based customers.",
    "The new terms in the app\u2019s US Privacy Policy enables it to collect biometric identifiers such as \u201cfaceprints and voiceprints.\u201d",
    "The biometric data collection details were introduced in a newly-added section under \u201cInformation we collect automatically\u201d area, which lists all the types of data TikTok gathers from users.",
    "In its analysis, TechCrunch breaks down the new terms into two sections. While the first part notes changes that will probably help with TikTok\u2019s ad-targeting and augmented reality efforts, the second part that deals with the collection of biometric information raises eyebrows.",
    "\u201cWe may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information as defined under US laws, such as faceprints and voiceprints, from your User Content. Where required by law, we will seek any required permissions from you prior to any such collection,\u201d reads the troubling section of the new terms.",
    "The statement is concerning since it doesn\u2019t specify whether the platform will adhere to federal law, state law, or both. This is important because barring a handful, a majority of the US states don\u2019t have biometric privacy laws, according to reports.",
    "When quizzed by TechCrunch, TikTok failed to confirm what product developments required the insertion of the new clauses, though a spokesperson did reaffirm that the platform would ask for consent if and when it starts collecting biometric data.",
