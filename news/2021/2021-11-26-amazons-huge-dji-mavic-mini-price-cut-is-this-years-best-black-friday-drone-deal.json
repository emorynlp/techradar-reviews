    "The best Black Friday drone deal we've seen so far is due to expire within hours, with Amazon's DJI Mavic Mini Fly More Combo (now $299, was $399) running only until midnight (PT). The $100 price drop is the lowest price we've seen for the drone's bundle, which includes two extra batteries among other treats.",
    "DJI hasn't launched any of its own Black Friday deals this year, but fortunately Amazon has stepped in with this bargain for beginner fliers. It brings the Mavic Mini Fly More Combo's price down to the same level as the standalone DJI Mini SE \u2013 only in this Mavic Mini deal, you get three batteries (rather than one) and a host of other useful accessories, including a charging hub, a carrier bag and prop guards.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "The DJI Mavic Mini may have now been succeeded by the DJI Mini 2, but it's still one of the best beginner drones around \u2013 and this 25% price cut on its Fly More Combo is likely to be one of the finest Black Friday drone deals this year.",
    "Earlier this year, the DJI Mini SE arrived to offer a bargain alternative to the newer DJI Mini 2 \u2013 but this Mavic Mini deal offers even better value, because you get all of the Fly More Combo extras (which we usually recommend buying with new DJI drones) for the same price as a standalone Mini SE.",
    "One of the reasons why the DJI Mavic Mini remains such a compelling budget drone is DJI's automated flight modes, which include Quickshots like 'Helix' and 'Dronie' , and its reliable Return to Home smarts. You also get a 30-minute flight time and impressively stable footage from its 1/2.3-inch sensor, which can also shoot 12MP photos.",
    "Unlike the DJI Mini 2 and Mini Se, the Mavic Mini is also compatible with the useful Litchi app, which brings handy extras like subject-tracking. So overall, it's a great choice for beginner fliers at this new low price.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the DJI Mavic Mini from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
