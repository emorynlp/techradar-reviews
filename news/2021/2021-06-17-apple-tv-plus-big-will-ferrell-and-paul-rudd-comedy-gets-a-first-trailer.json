    "The Shrink Next Door, a much-hyped new dark comedy series fronted by Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd, is coming to Apple TV Plus in November \u2013 and we\u2019ve finally got our first trailer.",
    "Inspired by true events, the eight-episode show will follow the relationship between celebrated psychiatrist Dr. Isaac \u201cIke\u201d Herschkopf (Rudd) and his longtime patient, Martin \u201cMarty\u201d Markowitz (Ferrell).",
    "Both Ferrell and Rudd will serve as executive producers on the hotly-anticipated series, which has been penned by award-winning screenwriter Georgia Pritchett (Succession, Veep) and is inspired by the hit Bloomberg podcast of the same name.",
    "The teaser trailer offers a glimpse into the dysfunctional dealings of Rudd\u2019s exploitative psychiatrist, Ike, who charms his way into the life of Ferrell\u2019s Marty. There\u2019s humor, of course, but the show seems like it will maintain a serious tone by probing the ethics of psychiatry, therapy and manipulation.",
    "The Shrink Next Door also stars Kathryn Hahn \u2013 who starred alongside both Ferrell and Rudd in 2004\u2019s Anchorman \u2013 as Phyllis, Marty\u2019s younger sister, and Casey Wilson (Gone Girl) as Bonnie, Ike\u2019s wife.",
    "The new trailer arrives amid a period of real promise for Apple TV Plus, which has seen \u2013 and will continue to see \u2013 the addition of several high-profile movies and TV shows of late.",
    "In recent months, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Cherry, The Mosquito Coast and Lisey\u2019s Story arrive on the streamer, with several other projects \u2013 not least The Shrink Next Door \u2013 either in the works or on the way.",
    "The Sam Neill-led sci-fi thriller, Invasion, for instance, also got a new trailer last week, adding to the catalogue of big-budget projects headed for Apple TV Plus.",
    "Whether they\u2019ll be any good, of course, remains a mystery \u2013 but it\u2019s exciting to see Apple take the fight to Netflix, Disney Plus and HBO Max."
