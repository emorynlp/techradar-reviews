    "Legendary turntable brand Technics has announced it\u2019s adding a new entry-level deck to its product lineup, the SL-100C.",
    "Technics says the turntable will act as a more affordable successor to the excellent SL-1500C, maintaining its older sibling\u2019s winning combination of value, sound quality and compatibility.",
    "To keep costs down, the company has dropped the phono stage of its predecessor and fitted the SL-100C with a different cartridge, Audio-Technica's VM95C, while retaining the same iron-coreless direct-drive motor and S-shaped aluminum tonearm.",
    "The SL-100C will also come equipped with the same two-layer platter design, along with a high-rigidity cabinet and high-damping insulator which Technics claims will minimize vibrations and ensure a smooth vinyl-tracking process.",
    "What\u2019s more, the aforementioned aluminum tonearm (which looks just as great before, by the way) will come with an auto-lift function to lessen the risk of needle wear-out \u2013 though this is a feature we expect to see on most of the best turntables you can buy today.",
    "The SL-100C will be available in Europe from June 2021, and retail for \u00a3799 (around $1,100 / AU$1,450) at launch, with global availability still to be confirmed. That's not cheap by any means, but is still about $100 / \u00a3100 less than its predecessor.",
    "When it comes to mixing with the best decks out there, the SL-100C isn\u2019t likely to make a scratch on the competition, not least the best turntable of 2021, the Pro-Ject Carbon Debut Evo.",
    "That said, it\u2019s intended as a more budget-friendly alternative from a brand which boasts some of the most established heritage in the turntable industry.",
    "If the SL-100C is anything like its predecessor, sound-staging will be impressive, and individual instruments will be given the space to make their presence felt. It looks pretty damn good, too \u2013 like something you\u2019d be happy enough to sit and stare at, let alone listen to."
