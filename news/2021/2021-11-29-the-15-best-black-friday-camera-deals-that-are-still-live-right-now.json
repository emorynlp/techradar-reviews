    "Black Friday produced some real camera bargains this year, and some of them have transferred to the Cyber Monday camera deals \u2013 with a sprinkling of new deals arriving on top.",
    "The best phone cameras have landed a few blows on the traditional camera giants in recent years, but the big names have come back swinging \u2013 and the big beneficiaries have been photographers and video creators.",
    "There's now a huge variety of cameras to choose from at all price points, and this year's Cyber Monday deals are making them more affordable than ever. While some stock issues have seen some deals expire, there are still lots of great ones live \u2013 and we've rounded them up in our list of the top 15 below.",
    "Our favorite deal remains the Fujifilm X-T4, which has dropped to its lowest-ever price \u2013 the only problem is that it's such a good deal, stock has run out in most retailers. Still, Adorama has promised that new ones will arrive in days, so we've kept that deal in our top spot for now.",
    "Not that our list only contains mirrorless cameras. If your budget's a little more conservative, there are options like the Fujifilm Instax Mini 40 \u2013 an instant camera that shares a few of the X-T4's design traits, only in a package that currently costs only $89.95 (was $99.95).",
    "There's no doubt, though, that full-frame mirrorless cameras are offering the best value for more advanced photographers in this year's sales. Because they've now been around for a few years, there is some incredible value to be found \u2013 from the beginner-friendly Nikon Z5 (now $996, was $1,396) to the Sony A7R IV, currently available for a lowest-ever price of $2,889 (was $3,499).",
    "Looking for a 360-degree camera, drone or even a dash cam? We've included the best deals on those in our list below, too \u2013 so whatever kind of camera you need, there's likely to be a Cyber Monday discount for you in our rundown of the best deals that are still live. Happy camera shopping.",
    "(Not in US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the cameras from around the web right here, with offers available in your region.",
    "You might also want to check out the best cheap dash cam deals and sales."
