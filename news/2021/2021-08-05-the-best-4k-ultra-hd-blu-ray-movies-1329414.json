    "The best 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray movies can give you an experience that's the closest thing you can get to having a movie theater in your living room.",
    "In fact, we'd bet with the advent of HDR, Dolby Vision and readily available Dolby Atmos sound systems, it's arguably better \u2013 especially because you don't have to fight over the arm rest at home.",
    "That\u2019s not to mention that the best 4K Ultra-HD Blu-rays will absolutely demolish anything you can stream online. While it\u2019s true that some streaming services, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video do offer a good amount of content in 4K \u2013 Netflix Originals for instance \u2013 you\u2019ll be sorely out of luck if you\u2019re trying to other new movies in 4K resolution with HDR on those platforms.",
    "Best of all, every 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray disc is region free, so anyone with a 4K Blu-ray player can enjoy these films.",
    "With that in mind, we've compiled a list of the best 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray movies currently available to purchase today.",
    "On this page, you will find a listing of the top trending 'reference quality' titles currently on offer, mostly consisting of new releases and titles only just arriving on the format. And, on following pages, you will find our full collection of 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray recommendations separated by genre.",
    "If you're looking for a film that will test your home entertainment's system's might, you could do a lot worse than the new Mortal Kombat film, which has arrived on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray with a sharp transfer and punchy audio track.",
    "While a lot of Mortal Kombat takes place in dark and shadowy environments, the film's 4K presentation delivers impressive contrast, allowing viewers to see right into the darker areas of the screen.",
    "Highlights and colors, in particular look magnificent in this HDR10 presentation, particularly in scenes where the film's characters show off their energy-based skills \u2013 especially Raiden's signature lightning strikes, which burn with a white hot intensity.",
    "As expected, the film's 4K native resolution allows for extraordinary detail, making it easy to marvel at the craftsmanship of the film's costume and set design departments.",
    "In terms of audio, Mortal Kombat offers a room-shaking Dolby Atmos primary track which emphasizes every punch, kick and fireball attack with an incredible amount of oomph. That said, dialogue sounds a little low by comparison, so you may have to do some tweaking of your sound setup in order to hit that sweet spot.",
    "Nevertheless, Mortal Kombat looks and sounds great on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, allowing fans to relive every gory fatality in crystal-clear clarity.",
    "Technical specs: Codec: HEVC / H.265 (55 Mbps), HDR: HDR10, Resolution: 2160p (4K master), Audio: English Dolby Atmos, English Dolby TrueHD 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit), English Dolby Digital 5.1, French (Canada) Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1, Italian Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, Aspect ratio: 2.39:1, Runtime: 110 minutes",
    "Although the US is still waiting on a physical release of Zack Snyder's Justice League, the superhero epic has been released on (region-free) 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in a number of overseas markets, including the UK and Australia.",
    "Let us just say that the film looks and sounds fantastic on the format, with the disc version's immersive Dolby Atmos audio and high video bitrate absolutely demolishing the film's presentation on streaming services such as HBO Max, Sky and Binge.",
    "Split over two discs due to its epic 242-minute runtime, Zack Snyder's Justice League delivers sublime visuals right off the bat(man) \u2013 the film's stirring opening titles sequence immediately gives us inky blacks, bright highlights and vivid colors, and it only gets better from there.",
    "Those who have watched Joss Whedon's theatrical version of Justice League will instantly notice that Snyder's version is a drastically different-looking film. Color has been toned way down, with almost monochromatic appearance at times, leading to a film that's far more atmospheric and serious in tone. Of course, that isn't to say that the film is lacking in vibrance \u2013 in fact, it makes the film's deliberate uses of color pop with increased vividness.",
    "Perhaps the most visually-stunning update offered by Zack Snyder's Justice League is in its villain, Steppenwolf (pictured), who has been completely redesigned from the ground up with a far more jagged and menacing appearance.",
    "The amount of detail in Steppenwolf's armor is absolutely staggering, with the character covered head to toe in countless, razor-sharp metallic shards \u2013 each of which produces impressive specular highlights. Look closely and you'll see fine details on the shards themselves, such as scratches and scuffs which make the CGI creation all the more convincing.",
    "Although the disc curiously lacks the Dolby Vision support that's offered on HBO Max, it does provide a rather significant upgrade on the streaming version with the inclusion of a wonderfully immersive Dolby Atmos track.",
    "During action scenes, there's an incredible sense of dimensionality to the audio, with terrific use of overhead channels. Though the film can get loud and bombastic, dialogue is always clear and easy to understand.",
    "Destined to be one of the format's reference discs, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a must-have for fans of the film.",
    "Technical specs: Codec: HEVC / H.265 (55 Mbps), HDR: HDR10, Resolution: 2160p (4K master), Audio: English Dolby Atmos, English Dolby TrueHD 7.1 (48kHz, 24-bit), Aspect ratio: 1.33:1, Runtime: 242 minutes",
    "The most mind-bending film from director Christopher Nolan (Inception, Memento) to date, Tenet has made an absolutely stunning debut on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.",
    "Like the majority of Nolan's other films, Tenet is presented with expanded IMAX sequences for its physical home release (sorry, digital buyers), meaning its aspect ratio regularly opens up to fill your entire TV's display, offering a significant rise in picture quality and scope.",
    "The results are utterly astonishing. Shot entirely on 65mm film and boasting a native 4K digital intermediate, detail is off the charts here, with a pristine image that still retains its filmic quality.",
    "It would not be a stretch to say that 70% of Tenet is presented in this manner, leading to a near-constant bombardment of jaw-dropping moments. From its stunning Tallinn freeway chase, to its climactic 'temporal pincer movement' set piece, Tenet is a sight to behold.",
    "Color and contrast are both exceptional, with impressively natural skin tones, vibrant reds, warm yellows, cool blues and inky shadows throughout, along with terrific highlights during brighter moments.",
    "Admittedly, it's disappointing to note that Nolan continues to resist the allure of Dolby Atmos audio. That said, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track included here still delivers a surprising amount of bombast and directionality. If you're looking for a demo disc to show off your home entertainment system, Tenet is the one.",
    "Technical specs: Codec: HEVC / H.265 (57.45 Mbps), HDR: HDR10, Resolution: 2160p (4K master), Audio: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French (Canada) Dolby Digital 5.1, German DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Italian Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, Czech Dolby Digital 5.1, Hindi Dolby Digital 5.1, Polish Dolby Digital 5.1, Thai Dolby Digital 5.1, Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1, Aspect ratio: 1.78:1, 2.20:1, Runtime: 150 minutes"
