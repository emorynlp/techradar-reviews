    "Amazon will hold its annual hardware and services event on September 28 at 9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm BST, the company announced today.",
    "The annual event is Amazon\u2019s chance to show off its latest Echo devices ahead of the holiday season and is typically the place we hear about upgrades coming to Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Luna and Amazon Music.",
    "Like previous years, a livestream of the event will be by invitation-only which means you won\u2019t see it pop up on YouTube or Twitch \u2013 however, most mainstream technology outlets will be online covering the event, TechRadar included.",
    "Last year, Amazon announced the new Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon Echo (2020), new Amazon Echo Show devices, the Eero 6 Mesh Router and Amazon Luna.",
    "The first year Amazon held the event in its hometown of Seattle, the company made over 100 announcements of products and services. In the years since, the number of announcements has been slightly lower \u2013 and more manageable to cover \u2013 but it\u2019s still a substantial event on par with Apple\u2019s iPhone 13 event.",
    "This year we\u2019re expecting to hear about the next series of Echo devices including new smart speakers, smart screens and wearables, alongside announcements on smart home devices from Eero and Ring. These brands always have something new to show off every year, and we\u2019re expecting that trend to continue here in 2021.",
    "On the services side, it\u2019s a little more of a mystery. We\u2019ll probably hear some updates on Amazon\u2019s new game-streaming service, Luna, and catch a few trailers for some upcoming Amazon Prime TV shows and movies. Hopefully we\u2019ll get a trailer for Amazon\u2019s nearly billion-dollar Lord of the Rings TV show \u2013 but that\u2019s not a guarantee.",
    "Earlier this month, Amazon announced that it was making its own TVs and was expanding its range of partners, so we\u2019ll likely hear additional details about those at the event as well."
