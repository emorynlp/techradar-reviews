    "Spoilers for the first episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "Just two weeks after the WandaVision finale wrapped up a bizarre but compelling exploration of grief, Disney Plus returns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a very different proposition. With no sitcoms, no magic and no playing around with aspect ratios, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier takes us back to the more serious, techno-thriller end of the MCU spectrum. There are no winks to the camera and the superhuman activities are kept to a bare minimum.",
    "And while Captain America has left the Avengers behind, his presence looms large. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier opens with Falcon, aka Sam Wilson, staring at the famous shield Steve Rogers gave him during the final scenes of Endgame. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d asks Rogers in flashback. \u201cLike it\u2019s someone else\u2019s,\u201d Sam replies. It\u2019s a symbol that weighs heavily on its new owner throughout the episode.",
    "There\u2019s little time to dwell on its meaning, however, as we\u2019re immediately transported into 007 territory for the sort of action sequence you\u2019d expect to see before the credits of a Bond movie. Falcon\u2019s mission involves rescuing a military liaison named Captain Vasant from a terrorist organisation known as the LAF \u2013 the group\u2019s leader is Georges Batroc, a character with MCU history. The trouble is, they\u2019re in a plane over Tunisian airspace \u2013 an area where the US military can\u2019t be seen to operate \u2013 so Falcon has to spread his wings for an audacious aerial mission to recover Vasant before he reaches the Libyan border.",
    "It\u2019s an utterly exhilarating set-piece featuring breathtaking leaps from planes and helicopters, wing-suited bad guys, and daredevil chases through spectacular desert canyons so narrow that they clip Wilson\u2019s wings. The battle ends with an ingenious move from Falcon as he pilots himself through an open helicopter, grabs Vasant and leads a bunch of missiles into Batroc\u2019s helicopter \u2013 though the bad guy does manage to escape.",
    "It\u2019s debatable whether anything of this scale has ever been attempted on TV before, an eight-minute aerial battle that competes with Game of Thrones\u2019 most epic moments for scale, ambition and spectacle. When Marvel said this six-part season had movie-level production values, they weren\u2019t exaggerating.",
    "Back on the ground, Sam shares a drink with military intelligence officer Lt Torres, as he repairs his friendly, Redwing. Torres explains that LAF crews are taking advantage of post-Blip chaos to make money, but that he\u2019s more concerned about another organization known as the Flag Smashers.",
    "They use red hands painted on walls (which are only detectable with a smartphone) as a calling card, and think the world was a better place before the billions who disappeared from existence came back. Sam tells him to let him know if he needs any help dealing with the new group, but Torres seems more preoccupied with finding out what happened to Steve Rogers \u2013 various conspiracy theorists are even speculating Cap\u2019s taken up residence on the Moon.",
    "Sam returns to Washington, DC, to present Cap\u2019s shield to go on permanent display at the Smithsonian. Celebrating his friend, he explains that his strengths went way beyond the fact that he\u2019d \u201cmastered posing stoically\u201d \u2013 he was a true hero. He goes on to say that symbols are nothing without the men and women who give them meaning, and even though the shield is incredibly powerful totem, \u201cit\u2019s more about the man who propped it up.\u201d He thinks now is the time to look to the future and for new heroes for these post-Blip times.",
    "James 'War Machine' Rhodes is attending the meeting in his US military capacity, and grabs Sam for a chat. He asks why he didn\u2019t take on the mantle of Captain America when Rogers asked him. Sam still feels that shield belongs to someone else, but as Rhodey reminds him, the world is very different now.",
    "It\u2019s a quarter of an hour into the episode and we\u2019re yet to see or hear anything from the Winter Soldier half of the show\u2019s title. That\u2019s rapidly redressed in a fancy European hotel, as the Winter Soldier (still conspicuously employed by HYDRA) launches a vicious, clinical attack on numerous hotel guests. Like the earlier aerial battle, its hand-to-hand combat that would feel right at home in a movie \u2013 until the sequence is interrupted by Bucky Barnes waking up in his psychiatrist\u2019s office.",
    "She asks if he\u2019s still having nightmares, but he denies that he is. He\u2019s clearly reluctant to continue with therapy, but the sessions are a condition of the pardon for his crimes \u2013 this is convenient for future Marvel stories, seeing as Bucky was one of the most wanted men in the MCU. He tells her that he\u2019s just crossed a line off his \u201clist of amends\u201d, actions he\u2019s atoning for from his time as the Winter Soldier. This particular line was Senator Atwood, a HYDRA pawn he helped into office.",
    "The psychiatrist asks if Bucky broke any of his three rules to do it \u2013 he\u2019s not allowed to do anything illegal or to hurt anyone, and he must remember that he\u2019s no longer the Winter Soldier. However, he managed to get her apprehended by the law, without transgressing any of the guidelines.",
    "You get the sense, though, that ticking off these names is the only thing keeping Bucky going. A man out of time, he has no family, no history, and is struggling to make friends \u2013 there are only 10 numbers in his phone, and he\u2019s not returning Sam Wilson\u2019s texts. He says the only time he\u2019s felt peace is the short period he spent in Wakanda before Thanos paid a visit.",
    "Back on his home turf of Brooklyn, Bucky meets his elderly friend, Yori Nakajima, for lunch. Yori suggests he ask the waitress, Leah, out on a date, \u201cmaybe to bingo or a night of pinochle\u201d. She agrees to meet him the next evening \u2013 which concerns Bucky, seeing as he hasn\u2019t danced since 1943. And it\u2019s an intriguing idea that Bucky, a 106-year-old man in the body of a 30-something, should be drawn to spend time with an old man such as Yori. In terms of pop culture references and formative years, they should have a lot more in common.",
    "The scene also starts to tie into the Winter Soldier\u2019s hotel raid. Yori\u2019s son was killed on a business trip, and he\u2019s never been able to find out why \u2013 all he knows is that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It\u2019s only later on, when Bucky bails on his Battleship-themed date to pay a late-night visit on Yori, that we learn the true extent of their connection.",
    "He sees a photo of Yori\u2019s dead son \u2013 one of the victims he executed in the hotel that fateful night. He looks at his \u201clist of amends\u201d and sees Nakajima\u2019s name at the top. If Bucky didn\u2019t already know it\u2019s a hell of a coincidence \u2013 though it does show the extreme psychological impact of the years he spent under HYDRA\u2019s influence as the Winter Soldier.",
    "During some downtime, Sam heads back to his home in Louisiana to meet up with his sister, Sarah, and her two sons. She runs a seafood business, but fell on hard times during the five years half the world was dusted. To help make ends meet, she wants to sell the boat \u2013 the Paul & Darlene \u2013 that belonged to their parents, but Sam isn\u2019t so keen on parting with a vessel that was a huge part of their childhood. He suggests they pay a visit to the bank to get a loan \u2013 not that Sarah hasn\u2019t tried.",
    "Unfortunately, the bank manager is less keen on helping them out than getting selfies with an Avenger. It turns out that when you\u2019ve been away for five years, not even having helped save the world from Thanos counts towards your credit score. It\u2019s this \u2013 and other implications of the Blip \u2013 that are the standout character elements of an episode that\u2019s occasionally a bit too talky and slow.",
    "While WandaVision made several references to the sudden return of billions of people \u2013 not least the death of Monica Rambeau\u2019s mother in the interim \u2013 the fact that it was set in a town cut off from the rest of the world insulated us from the full impact of the Blip. It\u2019s already clear, however, that the MCU\u2019s \u2018New World Order\u2019 is going to be a key part of the fabric of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. As Rhodey put it eariier, the \u201cworld is broken\u201d, with no stability and allies turned into enemies.",
    "The implication is clear \u2013 saving the planet from a crazed alien warlord doesn\u2019t fix the world\u2019s problems overnight. Indeed, the parallels with the coronavirus crisis, as the world comes to terms with a new normal, are impossible to ignore \u2013 even if the show was written and shot long before the pandemic.",
    "Aside from that pre-credits sequence, antagonists are conspicuous by their absence until fairly late in the episode, but we do get to see the Flag Smashers Torres teased earlier \u2013 though unlike WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier doesn\u2019t introduce its villains with a catchy theme tune. Instead we see Torres investigating the group in Switzerland, and getting caught up in a cross between a flash mob, a heist and an Anonymous protest. He\u2019s incapacitated by a masked, seemingly superpowered assailant \u2013 though he walks away with minimal injuries.",
    "Torres calls Sam to show him what happened, but Sarah interrupts to show her brother a TV broadcast covering an announcement from the government official from the Smithsonian. The government has taken Sam\u2019s declaration that America needs another hero to heart, and unveils a brand-new Captain America.",
    "Shield or no shield, those are some big shoes to fill.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Despite a barnstorming opening sequence that would feel totally at home in the biggest of big-screen blockbusters, the first episode of Marvel\u2019s latest TV show never quite catches fire.",
    "It\u2019s not helped by the fact it feels like The Falcon or the Winter Soldier, with the two leads kept separate throughout, following stories that \u2013 for the moment, at least \u2013 feel totally separate from the Flag Smashers who are being positioned as the Big Bads. While important to character development, Sam and Bucky's personal stories aren't great for the show's momentum \u2013 particularly this early in the run.",
    "Even so, it feels like a worthy continuation of the more grounded, espionage-driven branch of the MCU established by Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The implications of a post-Blip world-building are also intriguing. All the pieces are in place \u2013 now we just need a brilliant second episode to explode the show into life.",
    "New episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available on Disney Plus every Friday."
