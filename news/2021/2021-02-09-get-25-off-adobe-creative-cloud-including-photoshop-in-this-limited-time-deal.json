    "Adobe has brought back its 25% off deal on the Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps bundle for individuals, but you'll need to be quick to snap it up. (Not in the US? Scroll down for the best Adobe Creative Cloud deals in your region).",
    "The deal is traditionally available in the run-up to Christmas, which is when we saw it appear last, but Adobe has brought back the 25% off deal from now until 14 February \u2013 making it a potentially fine Valentine's Day gift, or just a present for yourself.",
    "The discount means you get Adobe's entire suite of creative apps \u2013 which includes Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Premiere Pro and many more \u2013 for only $39.99 a month.",
    "This means that, over the course of the year, you'll save $156 on the usual Creative Cloud price, making it a fine time to sign up for this gold standard of creative software bundles.",
    "This deal applies to an annual subscription, when paid for in monthly installments, and the offer ends very soon on February 14.",
    "It's a particularly good time to sign up for Creative Cloud \u2013 a lot of the apps recently received major updates at the Adobe Max conference, which means there's a big range of new tools to play with.",
    "Many of the apps are also now available on more devices \u2013 for example, Adobe Illustrator is now available for iPad, while Photoshop for iPad received a big update that has pushed its power much closer to its desktop equivalent.",
    "You get both of these iPad apps in the Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps subscription, along with the full-fat versions, as part of the bundle that contains over 20 different desktop and mobile apps.",
    "This offer will likely be the best price we see on this bundle for a while \u2013 so if you're looking to revive your creative new year's resolution, it's a fine time to sign up."
