    "With today's announcement of Prime Day's official date (June 21-22), Amazon has launched a number of early Prime Day deals exclusively for its members. We're seeing TV deals for as little as $99 this morning, with prices on budget displays rivalling those in last year's event.",
    "What's more, we may not see these discounts beaten when Prime Day TV deals do roll around on June 21 / 22, and we may even see stock dwindle by then as these are particularly popular discounts.",
    "If you've been holding out for Amazon Prime Day deals for a cheap TV, then, we'd recommend casting your eye over these offers. You'll find both budget 720p and 4K Fire OS displays on sale right now with prices that match those of last year's offers.",
    "These TV deals start at just $99, a price reserved for the 24-inch, 720p Insignia model, but you're still saving $70 over the original $169.99 MSRP. Plus, you can upgrade to a 32-inch Toshiba screen for $129.99 (was $199.99).",
    "However, this $309.99 Toshiba 4K display is offering particularly strong value - you're getting a fantastic price on a 50-inch set here and saving $120 over the $429.99 MSRP as well. You'll also find a cheaper 43-inch Insignia model available for $219.99 (was $319.99) as well.",
    "You will need a Prime membership to take advantage of these offers, but you'll find a range of Prime trial options available right now.",
    "We're rounding up plenty more cheap TV deals every week, but you'll also find a range of OLED TV prices have fallen over the last few months if you're looking for a more premium set as well. If you're after something to watch, check out the latest Amazon Fire Stick deals and sales."
