    "Updated 16/08: We've since heard reports that some Spotify Plus test users are being charged $1.99 for the service, rather than $0.99, so it seems the company is trialling various price points during the preliminary stages of its new subscription tier.",
    "Spotify is currently testing a cheaper, ad-supported subscription tier with a limited number of users.",
    "Called Spotify Plus, the plan costs just $0.99 a month in the US and combines features of the music streamer\u2019s existing free and Premium tiers.",
    "As first reported by The Verge, Spotify Plus gives subscribers the freedom to play whichever tracks they wish, as many times as they wish, at the expense of intermittent ads.",
    "For comparison, Spotify\u2019s current free tier imposes limits on the number of songs users are able to skip per hour, and mostly restricts listeners to shuffling tracks within specially-created albums and playlists.",
    "Spotify\u2019s Premium plan, on the other hand \u2013 priced at $9.99 / \u00a39.99 / AU$11.95 per month \u2013 gives users unlimited access to the streamer\u2019s library of over 70 million tracks, ad-free.",
    "A potential cost of just $0.99 a month, then, means Spotify Plus comes in at a fraction of the price of the more expensive tier, though it\u2019s worth noting that the plan is only a pilot scheme at this stage.",
    "There\u2019s no word yet on how much the tier might cost for subscribers around the world, either \u2013 it seems to be being offered to users at random \u2013 and depending on interest, that price is subject to change.",
    "Spotify Plus seems, on the face of it, a good idea.",
    "Though it probably won\u2019t sway those already on the Premium plan, it may entice free-tier subscribers by being a relatively cheap way of dramatically improving their listening experience.",
    "However, not only might its price increase \u2013 and therefore the merit of the whole enterprise \u2013 but Spotify Plus may not come to fruition at all. \u201cSome tests end up paving the way for new offerings or enhancements while others may only provide learnings,\u201d the streamer told The Verge.",
    "It\u2019s possible, then, that Spotify\u2019s latest scheme \u201cmay only provide learnings\u201d on how to improve the offerings within its current subscription tiers.",
    "What\u2019s more, even if Spotify Plus is well-received and given the green light to roll out worldwide, there\u2019s no guarantee it will arrive any time soon.",
    "Take Spotify Hi-Fi, for instance. The streamer announced its high-quality, lossless streaming option back in February, which only recently became available to users in select regions. Its worldwide launch still hasn\u2019t happened yet, either.",
    "So, if Spotify Plus seems like a plan you\u2019re interested in, don\u2019t hold your breath for its imminent arrival.",
    "Still, the cheaper tier is a neat idea, and it\u2019s nice to see the company taking steps to widen access to its musical offering \u2013 in principle, at least."
