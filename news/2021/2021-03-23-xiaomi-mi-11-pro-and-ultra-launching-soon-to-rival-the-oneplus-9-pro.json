    "The Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro and Mi 11 Ultra might appear at the company\u2019s March 29 launch event, according to a big leak, suggesting we could see the super-premium Android phones very soon.",
    "The news comes after recent confirmation of a presumably-global 'mega launch' event, which lacked details as to which devices would be officially revealed.",
    "Now, though, it looks like Xiaomi plans to unveil at least two new flagship devices in its Mi 11 range, after a tweet shared by tech YouTuber Ben Geskin showed promotional material mentioning both the Mi 11 Pro and Mi 11 Ultra by name.",
    "It\u2019s a little unclear whether this means the devices are only launching in China. While Xiaomi\u2019s recent confirmation of a March 29 event was shared via the company\u2019s global Twitter account, the promotional material describing the launch of the Mi 11 Pro and Mi 11 Ultra seems China-specific.",
    "In a follow-up tweet, Geskin does suggest the devices \u201cmay launch globally too\u201d, despite the promotional material clearly targeting a Chinese audience, so it seems likely that similar material will be shared via Xiaomi\u2019s global Twitter account in the coming days, ahead of the March 29 launch event.",
    "With the OnePlus 9 Pro scheduled to launch globally on March 23, it would make sense for Xiaomi to debut its premium phones at a similar time in the year, as the two Pro devices will likely have similar specs.",
    "Interestingly, there\u2019s no mention of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite in this promotional material.",
    "We\u2019ve heard rumors of a third new entry in the Mi 11 range, which we expect to be an affordable variant dubbed the Mi 11 Lite, but there\u2019s been no official confirmation of the device\u2019s name, or indeed whether it\u2019s on the way soon.",
    "We\u2019re pretty certain it is, though, since a reliable leaker shared a comprehensive look at the Mi 11 Lite\u2019s specs and design on Twitter shortly after Xiaomi confirmed the date of its global launch event.",
    "These leaks detail things such as the device\u2019s width, weight, chipset, display, battery, camera and more \u2013 and if true, suggest the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite could be one of the slimmest phones in recent times.",
    "The device has also been certified in Singapore, which is something that would usually happen close to launch, so it\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019ll see it officially unveiled come the end of the month.",
    "We\u2019ve rounded up everything we know about the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite here, but given that its more premium siblings have been confirmed to launch \u2013 in China, at least \u2013 on March 29, we\u2019re fairly confident we\u2019ll have more information soon."
