    "After a prolonged period of radio silence, augmented reality (AR) startup Magic Leap has re-entered the fold with the announcement of an all-new workplace-focused headset, the Magic Leap 2.",
    "The move comes as the company\u2019s CEO Peggy Johnson revealed Magic Leap has raised $500 million in investor funding to allow for the development of the new AR device, which marks the first major hardware upgrade to its inaugural headset offering, the Magic Leap One.",
    "Designed to be the industry\u2019s \u201csmallest and lightest device built for enterprise adoption,\u201d the Magic Leap 2 will boast several design and feature improvements over its predecessor \u2013 with the most notable being its capacity for use \u201call day, every day.\u201d",
    "For starters, users of the Magic Leap 2 won\u2019t look like Vin Diesel\u2019s Riddick (an unfortunate consequence of wearing the Magic Leap One). Instead, the headset has been smartly redesigned to appear much more compact, which the company says will promote a more comfortable user experience.",
    "That\u2019s important, because no mixed reality headset on the market right now (AR or VR) has proven comfortable to wear all day, save for a few low-functionality products like Facebook\u2019s Ray-Ban Stories.",
    "Magic Leap hasn\u2019t yet shared details of the Magic Leap 2\u2019s battery life, but if its claims of \u201call day\u201d use prove accurate, the new headset marks a tremendous \u2013 and potentially game-changing \u2013 improvement over the measly three hours managed by the Magic Leap One.",
    "The hardware itself has improved, too. CEO Johnson has claimed the Magic Leap 2 will benefit from segmented dimming technology, a \u201cfirst-to-market innovation\u201d allowing the device to be used in brightly lit settings.",
    "The headset will also boast improved color fidelity, text legibility and image quality, as well as \u201cdouble the field-of-view\u201d of its predecessor \u2013 a welcome upgrade, given the extremely restrictive FOV of the Magic Leap One.",
    "Interestingly, much of this larger FOV seems to come upwards rather than outwards (see the company-provided illustration below), which suggests the device won\u2019t actually do much to improve a user\u2019s spatial awareness. Still, as similar products go, the Magic Leap 2 will sport the \u201clargest field of view in the industry.\u201d",
    "All in all, then, Magic Leap looks to have made welcome improvements to the Magic Leap 2 in all the right areas. If indeed the headset can live up to its promise of being \u201ca device that you can put on your head in the morning and wear all day long,\u201d it really could prove a game-changer for workers in a whole host of industries \u2013 from medicine to construction.",
    "The company says it plans to launch the Magic Leap 2 in 2022, though \u201cselect customers\u201d are already trialling the product through an early access program.",
