  "title": "AMD\u2019s still on target to release Zen 4 CPUs and RDNA 3 GPUs in 2022",

  "summary": "Next-gen Ryzen processors can\u2019t arrive quickly enough, given Alder Lake\u2019s potential",
  "article": [
    "AMD\u2019s CEO has confirmed that the company is on schedule to get both its next-gen Zen 4-based processors and RDNA 3 graphics cards out next year.",
    "Lisa Su provided the update in a conference call following AMD\u2019s latest financial results for Q2 2021, as Wccftech spotted.",
    "Su said: \u201cWe remain on-track to launch next-generation products in 2022, including our Zen 4 processors built with industry-leading 5nm process technology and our RDNA 3 GPUs.\u201d",
    "The chief executive didn\u2019t give any indication of when these new products might arrive next year, but the rumor mill seems fairly convinced that it will be late in 2022, during the final quarter (condiments handy). Both Ryzen and Radeon successors might even launch together, or very closely aligned; or at least that idea has been bandied about.",
    "It\u2019s expected that Zen 4-based chips (presumably Ryzen 6000) will give an impressive performance boost, but will stick with a 16-core flagship and not attempt to up core counts. And more excitement is now building around RDNA 3 GPUs with the possibility that the flagship could be seriously powerful (and run with multiple chips \u2013 but what effect that could have on pricing is another matter).",
    "Unfortunately, there was also further word on supply difficulties with AMD products, and it wasn\u2019t positive news. The company will apparently continue to be hit by stock issues over the course of 2021, but matters should improve at the beginning of 2022. Promises around ramping up stock levels of Big Navi graphics cards as 2021 rolls onward are looking a little shakier, then, perhaps.",
    "It\u2019s no real surprise to hear that AMD is still on target to get both next-gen Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs out next year. Indeed, if Team Red was to falter in terms of those aims, it\u2019d be a serious blow to the firm\u2019s ambitions \u2013 particularly on the CPU front.",
    "While in her statement above, Lisa Su couldn\u2019t resist reminding folks that AMD is \u2018industry-leading\u2019 on 5nm, with Intel stuck on 10nm with its next-gen chips, remember: there\u2019s a lot more to the performance of a CPU than just the process it\u2019s built on.",
    "Alder Lake may be 10nm but it\u2019s shaping up to be very promising given the whispers and leaks thus far, using a whole new \u2018big\u2019 and \u2018little\u2019 core approach which could prove to have serious dividends. Plus the chips are purportedly set to be tied in with Windows 11 and performance improvements due to Microsoft\u2019s tuning under the hood of the OS.",
    "While Ryzen has taken over the desktop CPU arena in recent history, there seems to be a clear danger from Alder Lake processors which could arrive in just a few months \u2013 with AMD\u2019s next-gen not coming until possibly a year after that. That\u2019s a potentially worrying situation, and while AMD looks like it will produce some kind of refresh in the meantime before Zen 4 \u2013 possibly Ryzen 5000 XT CPUs with 3D Chiplet tech \u2013 if Intel is making as big a stride forward as Alder Lake threatens, the concern is that a refresh may not be enough.",
    "In short, the sooner Zen 4 can arrive for AMD, the better, and late 2022 seems a long way out from this perspective \u2013 with Raptor Lake, a refreshed version of Alder Lake, also set to be here by then."
