    "A new feature called Xbox FPS Boost allows select backward compatible Xbox games to run at double or even quadruple the original framerate, all without any developer input. It means games that you remember running at 30fps can now hit the heady heights of 60fps or even 120fps.",
    "This feature is only available on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S since it requires the vastly increased CPU power of these newer platforms to run the games at a higher framerate. There are also a few discrepancies across the two consoles to be aware of.",
    "We've assembled the full list of titles so far, as well as details on what framerate the games used to run at, how they run now, and any other particulars worth noting.",
    "Xbox FPS Boost doesn't require any developer input but it is subject to certain restrictions. Some games might only be patched on one platform since a backward compatible Xbox One X version could already be running a game at 60fps. Other games might be very demanding and require the settings to drop down to the Xbox One S version of a game before increasing the framerate.",
    "If you've ever wanted to revisit a game but couldn't bear to play it at 30fps, then, check out the full list of FPS Boost-supported games below.",
    "In order to take advantage of this framerate-boosting feature, you'll just need to play the games on your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. It'll automatically be enabled as long as your console has the latest updates. To verify a game is running with FPS Boost, you can press the Xbox button on your controller to check for the FPS Boost and/or Auto HDR labels.",
    "Some games have FPS Boost turned off by default, but it can be easily turned on under the Compatibility Options in the Manage game and add-ons setting.",
    "Do note that in order to enjoy a game at 120 FPS on Xbox Series X or S, you'll want to make sure you have one of the best 120Hz TVs available. You'll also need to enable 120Hz on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S."
