    "It\u2019s been a bittersweet week for Guardians of the Galaxy fans, but director James Gunn has hinted that Marvel\u2019s band of intergalactic outlaws could return \u2013 in some form \u2013 following the 2023 release of the franchise\u2019s third instalment.",
    "We recently reported on a tweet posted by Gunn suggesting he expects Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to be \u201chis last\u201d movie in the series, following earlier comments in 2020 hinting at the same news.",
    "In a new tweet, though, The Suicide Squad director has stoked the fires of speculation as to the future of the franchise. In response to the question of whether the next instalment would be the last time we see the Guardians on the big screen, Gunn suggested that it \u201cdepends on how you define the Guardians.\u201d",
    "Could that mean a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 4 is on the cards? It sounds like it, albeit with the caveat that Guardians 3 is probably going to be the last of the series featuring the original lineup of Star-Lord, Gamora, Groot, Rocket, Drax and Mantis.",
    "There have been reports of another Guardians comic book fan favorite \u2013 Adam Warlock \u2013 appearing in Guardians 3, too. James Gunn denied that casting calls for the character were underway in March, but there\u2019s still a chance he could lead the team if the likes of Star-Lord don\u2019t return. Warlock\u2019s Guardians 3 appearance was teased at the end of Guardians 2, after all, so it\u2019s a possibility.",
    "We already know that the upcoming movie will likely be Dave Bautista\u2019s last outing as Drax, with the actor telling Digital Spy: \u201cas far as my obligations, I've got Guardians 3, and that's probably going to be the end of Drax.\"",
    "That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the end of Drax the character, mind. In a recent tweet, Bautista clarified that \u201cDrax isn\u2019t going anywhere\u201d, rather that he simply wouldn\u2019t continue to play the role of Arthur Douglas in future flicks. \u201cI\u2019m expecting everything to start sagging any second now,\u201d he added.",
    "For Marvel fans, then, the news is sweet and sour. Given Bautista\u2019s close relationship with James Gunn, it\u2019s almost certain that neither will be returning for future Guardians-related projects \u2013 especially with both hinting at their respective exits.",
    "But despite their departures, both Bautista and Gunn have offered a promising glimmer of hope that the Guardians would return after Vol. 3 \u2013 potentially for another \u201cbig screen\u201d outing, as per the aforementioned question put to the director.",
    "With the creative freedom afforded by Disney Plus, though, it\u2019s no surprise that these mega-popular characters are unlikely to be put to rest. But while we might have expected a spin-off series \u00e0 la The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, a fourth feature-length Guardians movie wasn\u2019t something many anticipated to be on the cards.",
    "Of course, we\u2019ll have a better idea of the direction the franchise might take when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 arrives on May 5, 2023 \u2013 it just might not be the big send-off many were expecting.",
    "In any case, don\u2019t hold out for an elderly Drax."
