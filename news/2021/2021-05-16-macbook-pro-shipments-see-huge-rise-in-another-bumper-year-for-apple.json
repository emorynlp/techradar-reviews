    "\u201cThe emerging hybrid work pattern as well as the continuing need for learn-from-home devices added to consumer upgrade sales, making Q1 2021 the strongest first quarter after many years. The favorable comparison to the dire situation last year also helped with the strong growth figures,\u201d said Strategy Analytics\u2019 Director of Connected Computing Devices, Eric Smith.",
