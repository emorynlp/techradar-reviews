    "You'll find plenty of Kindle Unlimited free trials right now, which means you're shopping at just the right time to grab unlimited access to the library without spending any cash. That's a welcome relief, especially seeing as the cost isn't included in the Amazon Prime price. Not only can you scope out the library of titles on offer to make sure your interests are served, but the free time gives you the chance to see if you will actually use the membership enough to be worth the monthly cost.",
    "The length of Amazon's offers varies, ranging from the standard 30 day free trial all the way up to three months in some cases. Those longer ones usually come as part of Amazon Prime Day or Black Friday. Outside of that, we're rounding up the Kindle Unlimited free trials currently available in the US, UK, and Australia so you always know the trial length on offer right now.",
    "Amazon Kindle Unlimited is an ebook subscription service that offers free Kindle titles and Audible narrations on a 'borrowing' basis. Because of this structure, you'll be able to store a maximum of ten books at a time on your account, but you can easily 'return' a book in order to download a new one. There are over one million books and plenty of magazine subscriptions to choose from, as well as thousands of Audible audiobook versions as well. This roster is regularly updated with new titles as well, so you'll never run out of titles.",
    "Below, you'll find all the Kindle Unlimited free trials currently available so you can get started with Amazon's subscription service for nothing.",
    "Amazon Prime Day is just around the corner, and we're already seeing Kindle Unlimited offers available. There's a three month free trial available in the UK, and US bookworms can pick up some tasty discounts on ebooks as well right now. That means you're shopping for Kindle Unlimited free trials at just the right time - so move fast before these offers expire.",
    "The Kindle Unlimited price is set at $9.99 / \u00a37.99 / AU$ 13.99 a month, which covers you for as much reading as you can manage. Though you're limited to ten downloads on your device, it's easy to swap out books for new ones so you're never paying for titles you don't want. That price also includes access to a number of magazine subscriptions and even Audible audiobooks on thousands of titles.",
    "Amazon Kindle Unlimited is not included with your Prime membership, and Prime members do not receive a discount on a Kindle Unlimited subscription at the moment. Prime Reading, however, is a similar service that is covered by a Prime membership and provides a more limited access to the Kindle library in much the same way as Kindle Unlimited.",
    "The Kindle Unlimited library is a selection of over a million books picked out from the main Kindle store. That means you don't have full access to any book for free, but there are so many genres and authors on offer here there's sure to be something for every mood on offer. Plus, Kindle Unlimited also includes Audible narrations on certain titles, and free digital magazine subscriptions as well.",
