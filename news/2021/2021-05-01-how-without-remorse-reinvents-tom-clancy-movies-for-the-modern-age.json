    "Spoilers follow for Without Remorse.",
    "The team charged with developing Without Remorse wants audiences to associate Tom Clancy with movies again. Recently, the acclaimed author\u2019s name has become synonymous with video games based on his works, but that wasn\u2019t always the case.",
    "Throughout the 1990s, Clancy\u2019s hugely successful novels were adapted into blockbuster films, including Patriot Games and The Hunt for Red October. Interest in such action thrillers, though, seemingly cooled around the turn of the century, with only two middling Clancy-based movies \u2013 and a Jack Ryan TV series \u2013 being produced since.",
    "The makers of Without Remorse, then, hope to reinvent Clancy\u2019s Cold War-set novels for today\u2019s film fans. Ahead of its April 30 launch on Amazon Prime Video, TechRadar spoke to the movie\u2019s cast and crew to find out how it updates Clancy\u2019s novel of the same name for modern audiences. We also hear how the actors prepared for the movie\u2019s demanding action sequences, and discuss plans for the already-confirmed sequel.",
    "Without Remorse tells the tale of John Clark (Michael B. Jordan), a former US Navy SEAL out for revenge after his wife Pam (Lauren London) is murdered. Following a hostage rescue mission in war-torn Syria, during which Clark and his team kill a number of ex-Russian special forces personnel, Clark \u2013 who\u2019s since left the military \u2013 and his wife are attacked in their home by Russian mercenaries.",
    "The group kill Pam and leave John for dead, and after recovering from his injuries, a rage-filled Clark seeks retribution against those responsible. Teaming up with Navy SEAL Karen Greer (Jodie Turner-Smith) and shady CIA agent Robert Ritter (Jamie Bell), and aided by US Secretary of Defense Thomas Clay (Guy Pearce), Clark hunts down his wife\u2019s killers. As he does so, however, Clark becomes embroiled in a wider conspiracy that threatens the fragile peace between the US and Russia.",
    "While Clancy\u2019s book is set during the height of the Cold War - Clark\u2019s rescue mission taking place in Vietnam - and the events of the movie take place in the present day, there are parallels between the two. Relations between the US and Russia remain as frosty now as they did before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, which aided the process of translating the novel\u2019s plot from page to screen. The carrying over of specific characters, namely Clark, Ritter and Greer, also maintains some links between the two mediums.",
    "That, though, is where the similarities end. Despite wanting to retain the \u201csoul and spirit\u201d of the source material, director Stefano Sollima was eager to bring Clark\u2019s story into the present day, which meant swapping out one US-Russia proxy conflict for another.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a period movie,\u201d Sollima explains. \u201cThe book was written in 1993, but was set during the Vietnam War. We wanted to tell that story, which gels politics with the technicality of warfare, but we changed the geopolitical setup from Vietnam to Syria. The political idea is still the same, but we wanted to reflect the current society that we live in.\u201d",
    "The modernization process also extends to character ethnicities and genders. In contrast to their white male book counterparts, Clark and Greer are Black, and Greer is female. These changes, Sollima says, were necessary to distinguish the movie from the source material and other John Clark cinematic portrayals, and to better represent the diversity of our society.",
    "It\u2019s a move that both Jordan and Turner-Smith, who play Clark and Greer respectively, agree with. The duo, though, are keen to stress that changing Greer\u2019s gender was about illustrating male and female camaraderie in the armed forces, rather than anything romantic.",
    "\u201cWe had to make sure that the audience understood that,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anybody to be misunderstood by the relationship. It\u2019s more like \u2018I\u2019ve got your back through thick and thin, and I won\u2019t leave you behind\u2019. It was about defining that dynamic while also being respectful of John\u2019s relationship with Pam, and honoring John\u2019s motivation throughout the movie.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s really about platonic love,\u201d Turner-Smith adds. \u201cWe tried to infuse that in our scenes even when we\u2019re butting heads. Even if my character doesn\u2019t understand what Michael\u2019s is going through, it\u2019s about being there for him and taking action to help him.\u201d",
    "The action that Turner-Smith alludes to required plenty of heavy lifting, from a physical standpoint, for the movie\u2019s key players. Under the supervision of ex-Marines, the cast trained for months to ensure they could portray Navy SEALs \u2013 the US Navy\u2019s primary special forces outfit \u2013 authentically, particularly during the movie\u2019s opening rescue mission sequence.",
    "\"They made sure we had integrity with the way we moved in combat, used our weapons and commanded each other in groups,\u201d Turner-Smith reveals. \u201cThese men work together all of the time to the point where they become a unit, so we needed to emulate this idea that we\u2019d been working together for years.\u201d",
    "Without Remorse\u2019s biggest set-pieces, though, are reserved for Jordan\u2019s Clark. The film\u2019s protagonist endures plenty of physical pain, alongside the emotional turmoil of losing his wife, as he heads from one encounter to the next.",
    "Jordan\u2019s training, though, didn\u2019t just require him to learn some lengthy and brutal close-quarters combat sequences. Clark also battles the elements in his pursuit of his wife\u2019s killers, and two particular set-pieces required Jordan to master holding his breath underwater \u2013 something the actor was capable of doing for three minutes by the time filming began.",
    "\u201cWe had military divers who put me through some stressful situations in water tanks,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cI had to work through gear malfunctions and rebreathers, which suppress any bubbles so soldiers can breathe underwater without leaving any physical trace. The training was very detailed but, if you\u2019re calm and sitting still, you can hold your breath for longer. We created an environment for us to relax and be at peace underwater, which was necessary for one of those scenes.\u201d",
    "While most film studios wait to greenlight sequels to potentially popular movies, that isn\u2019t the case here. Paramount Pictures has already signed off on a follow-up film and, as Without Remorse\u2019s post-credits scene teases, it\u2019ll follow Clark \u2013 now known as John Kelly \u2013 as he sets up the multinational counter-terrorism unit known as Rainbow Six.",
    "Little is known about the Without Remorse sequel outside of Jordan reprising his role as Clark/Kelly. Sollima, though, is keen to be reunited with the Black Panther and Creed actor for the next instalment. It\u2019s a film that could even lead into a full-blown live-action adaptation of Clancy\u2019s MCU-esque Ryanverse, although Sollima didn\u2019t elaborate on which other Clancy-created characters may appear.",
    "\u201cOf course,\u201d Sollima says when asked if he\u2019d like to direct the sequel. \u201cRainbow Six is the next [novel] that primarily follows John, so he\u2019ll be the main character. It was challenging and bizarre to complete post-production on Without Remorse due to the pandemic, but it was also a beautiful experience. I would love to return.\u201d",
    "Without Remorse is available to stream now on Amazon Prime Video."
