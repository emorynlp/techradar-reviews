    "For those looking to install HBO Max on Apple TV, you'll be happy to hear the streaming service was available on the media streamer at launch. Bringing all your favorite VOD platforms into one place on a clean, sharp interface, Apple TV allows you to stream HBO's ground-breaking TV series and exceptional movies straight from the WarnerMedia's library to your TV screen, all at the touch of a button.",
    "Stuck? Below we'll explain how to install HBO Max on Apple TV, as well as what you can watch on the streaming platform, and other streaming services available to download onto your Apple TV device.",
    "Now, if you've come to this article, we suspect you're fully in the know, but just to clear any confusion, Apple TV is not to be confused with Apple TV Plus. Apple TV isn\u2019t a \u201cTV\u201d at all, but a set-top-box that unites heaps of free and paid-for streaming apps and cable channels in one place. However, you do need to connect it to a TV \u2013 ideally a HD model \u2013 with a HDMI cable. It\u2019s currently around $179 for the latest Apple TV 4K, or $149 for an Apple TV HD.",
    "The below instructions will help you download HBO Max on Apple TV:",
    "There\u2019s over 10,000 hours of premium content here, not forgetting the HBO programming you know and love \u2013 Game of Thrones, The Sopranos \u2013 and equally excellent shows you might be less familiar with, like The Flight Attendant, The Undoing, Treme and Euphoria.",
    "It\u2019s also the exclusive home of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, every season of 90s sitcom Friends, surreal comedy Rick and Morty, and the award-winning anime of Studio Ghibli \u2013 21 breath-taking movies. There\u2019s a growing slate of Max Originals, for example, the Seth Rogen-starring An American Pickle, and it\u2019s the only place where you\u2019ll get to watch all Warner Brothers 2021 movies online for a month following their theatrical release \u2013 meaning you can beam The Matrix 4 straight into your living room.",

    "In addition to getting HBO Max, you can source content on Apple TV from major streaming services by downloading apps for Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, in addition to Peacock \u2013 which has a free, ad-supported tier \u2013 and of course Apple TV Plus (which, with an Apple TV purchase, is totally free for 12 months).",
    "There\u2019s a great selection of a la carte Channels too. Dozens of them are free to stream, like PBS, Sky News, Crackle and CBS Sports, while others \u2013 premium networks like Showtime and AMC Plus \u2013 cost a monthly fee. Apple TV brings together all your favorite on-demand services and cable channels, plus kid\u2019s entertainment, sports, music, and the ability to rent or download blockbuster movies through iTunes. Add to that all the exceptional HBO Max originals and exclusives from $9.99 a month With Ads of $14.99 a month Ad-Free and with access to WarnerBros new releases.",
    "While there were some glaring omissions initially, in November we got HBO Max on Fire Stick, and shortly after, HBO Max on Roku. That means HBO Max is now available on pretty much every major device. That includes \u2013 but isn\u2019t limited to \u2013 Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Chromebooks, Chromecast, PlayStation 4 & 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X & S, PC and Mac computers, and Android phones. Check here for a full list of compatible devices."
