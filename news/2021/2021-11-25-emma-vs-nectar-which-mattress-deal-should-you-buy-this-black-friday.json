The starting price is reduced to $389.40 for a twin size. In the UK, you can save 45% on the Original, with a double size coming in at just \u00a3384.55.",
    "Let\u2019s break these savings down further...",
    "The Emma Original is a comfortable choice for all sleep positions, with three zones across the mattress. There\u2019s firmer support for the middle of the body, and a softer feel at the head and feet to keep the spine aligned and offer pressure relief. The mattress has minimal motion transfer and features Emma\u2019s soft and breathable Airgocell foam at the core for climate- and moisture-regulation.",
    "The cover is made with polyester (blended with 1% elastane on the top and 13% polypropylene at the bottom). And the top half of the cover can be removed and washed \u2013 simply unzip it and wash it at 104\u00b0F. Alternatively you can spot-clean small stains with warm water and a gentle detergent.",
    "The Nectar Memory Foam Mattress has a quilted cover that's made with a soft, breathable poly-blend cover that wicks heat with cooling technology. It cannot be washed, only spot cleaned, and Nectar states on its website that removing the cover will void the warranty, and advises to use a mattress protector with the mattress.",
    "Under the cover of the Nectar are three inches of gel memory foam for comfort and plushness, as well as contouring and pressure relief. The layer below has dynamically adjusting foam that offers plenty of support for the body, on top of a sturdy base layer.",
    "With a medium firmness of 5-6 (out of 10), the Emma Original suits most sleepers and sleeping positions.It's made of breathable foam, with a focus on comfort, spinal alignment and minimal motion transfer. It claims to be \u2018ergonomically efficient\u2019, with over 100 supporting points to hold your body in the best position for sleep, while the adaptable foam contours to your posture no matter your sleep position.",
    "The Nectar Memory Foam is rated a 6 (out of 10), and offers just the right amount of support to relieve pressure points and align the spine for more comfortable sleep. If you sleep hot, then Nectar's cooling tech offers welcome relief, with the toxin-free CertiPUR-US Certified foams guaranteeing healthier sleep.",
    "Both mattresses offer exceptional comfort, but if you sleep hot or need something just a touch firmer, then the Nectar is a great choice. The Emma offers plenty of pressure point relief and a slightly more plush surface and body-hugging comfort.",
    "Both the Emma Original and the Nectar Memory Foam are excellent value for money and are affordable choices if you want to snap up a top-quality memory foam mattress for less. We haven't seen bigger discounts this year on either mattress, so now is the best time to buy.",
    "With a 45% discount, the Emma is the most affordable choice but only by a small margin. The majority of Nectar\u2019s savings come in the form of free bedding, with only $100 off the mattress itself, so it depends how useful that free gift is to you or whether you are simply looking for the biggest money off discount.",
    "If that's the case and you want the cheapest top-rated mattress possible, choose the Emma original. However, if you are in need of new sheets, pillows and a mattress protector, choose the Nectar. Either are superb choices for not much money at all, and with generous mattress trial periods from both brands, you'll have ample time to put your new mattress to the test."
