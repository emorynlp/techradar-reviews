    "Mild spoilers for Invasion episodes 1-3 follow.",
    "Alien invasion movies and TV shows are a key cornerstone of the sci-fi genre. From Independence Day and District 9, to The X-Files and Falling Skies, audiences have grown accustomed to the film and TV industries churning out stories about aliens invading Earth.",
    "With so many comparable productions already available to viewers, how do studios and showrunners go about making an original alien invasion tale that audiences haven\u2019t seen before?",
    "For the creators of Invasion, Apple TV Plus\u2019 latest sci-fi show, the answer to this challenging question was two-fold: tell a story with a distinctly global appeal and ground it in the theme of human alienation.",
    "\u201cWe don\u2019t often see an alien invasion with a global cast; it\u2019s not canon in this genre,\u201d co-creator David Weil tells TechRadar. \u201cBut I think the series\u2019 message is that there\u2019s more that unites us than divides us, and I hope Invasion acts as a reflection on our global interconnectivity rather than people isolating themselves from one another.\u201d",
    "Ahead of Invasion\u2019s October 22 release, TechRadar sat down with Weil and the series\u2019 cast to discuss its exploration of human isolation. We also dig into the show\u2019s chief influences and the design process behind its unusual and spooky aliens.",
    "Set in the present day, Invasion tells the story of six individuals, spread across four continents, when a seemingly invisible alien species threatens the existence of humanity itself.",
    "Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) stars as US Sheriff Jim Bell Tyson, the first individual to realize that extraterrestrials have invaded Earth. Meanwhile, Golfshifteh Farahani (Extraction) and Firas Nassar (Fauda) play married couple Aneesha and Ahmed Malik, who embark on a roadtrip to cross the US-Canadian border to try and keep their children safe.",
    "Shamier Anderson (Awake) portrays US Navy Seal Trevante Ward, who encounters the aliens during a tour of Afghanistan, while Japanese Space Agency technician Misuki Yamato, played by Deadpool 2\u2019s Shioli Kutsuna, attempts to unravel the aliens\u2019 origins. Finally, Billy Barratt (A Christmas Carol) features as Caspar Morrow, a British national whose school trip is interrupted by the martians\u2019 attack.",
    "From the outset, Weil and co-creator Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Sherlock Holmes) wanted to develop a unique alien invasion tale. Even so, Weil admits that it was inevitable that Invasion would be influenced by similar stories \u2013 with one particularly iconic tale acting as a major reference point.",
    "\u201cI always wanted to adapt War of the Worlds,\u201d Weil says. \u201cAs a kid, I was so inspired by H.G. Wells\u2019 novel, and then by Orson Welles\u2019 1938 radio play. So I wanted to create a story that skirted reality and fiction, and that gave the same kind of experience to audiences that both individuals did for their time.\u201d",
    "Surprisingly, Weil and Kinberg both worked on CBS\u2019 2019 revival of The Twilight Zone, but it wasn't here that their paths crossed ahead of collaborating on Invasion. Instead, the duo were simultaneously working on separate alien invasion TV series \u2013 until Weil\u2019s agent suggested that they should join forces and work on a combined project.",
    "\u201cIt [our original meeting] was supposed to be an hour-long meeting,\u201d Weil explains. \u201cBut it turned into a seven-hour one! We pitched ideas back and forth, and talked about characters that we had in mind. It was this incredible dance of collating ideas, which led to us spending two years building and refining Invasion\u2019s story.\u201d",
    "No good alien invasion story is complete without its intimidating antagonists. Coming up with a unique alien design for Invasion, though, proved more problematic than initially predicted.",
    "\u201c[The main inspiration was] our nightmares,\u201d Weil reveals. \u201cSimon and I thought \u2018What are the nightmares that we had as kids? What scares us now?\u2019 That was our starting point, but it took a year before we decided how we wanted these creatures to look and sound. It\u2019s really tough to find a new alien \u2013 you never want to do what someone else has done. In the end, our creature designers came up with something amazing.\u201d",
    "With the aid of a SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Life Institute) consultant, VFX supervisor Erik Henry (Watchmen, Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan) and his team produced a design that Weil believes will generate \u201cterror and excitement\u201d in audiences. The monsters\u2019 final look, described as part-machine and part-organic, is one that Invasion\u2019s showrunners think is completely original, even if viewers don\u2019t get a good glimpse of them in the show\u2019s first few episodes.",
    "The alien\u2019s CGI creations also posed difficulties to the show\u2019s cast. With no physical models to look at or act around, Invasion\u2019s actors had to get imaginative when filming scenes where the aliens were present.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a scene where I fight one of them,\u201d Farahani, who plays Aneesha, reveals. \u201cAnd the only prop I had was a green cushion. When I had to go back in and re-record my lines for that scene at a later date, I found it very funny watching it back.\u201d",
    "\u201cUsually, you hear about green screens being used or tennis balls on a stick,\u201d Anderson, who portrays Trevante, adds. \u201cBut you still have to emote and pretend you\u2019re looking at something you\u2019re fearful of. I used what I refer to as my \u2018Godzilla face\u2019, where you pretend that you\u2019re seeing something that\u2019s terrifying and awe inspiring.\u201d",
    "Amid its alien invasion backdrop, Apple\u2019s latest sci-fi offering hits close to home from a thematic perspective: for one, the ongoing pandemic has left people feeling isolated from their families, friends and communities. Meanwhile, growing divisions between nations, and even within a country\u2019s own population, have led to increasing human alienation and societal segregation.",
    "It\u2019s these real-world issues, set in Invasion\u2019s fictional world, that should resonate deeply with viewers. Aneesha and Ahmed are immigrants who feel like second-class citizens in their adopted homeland. Trevante and Mitsuki feel lost and alone after the deaths of people that they cared for. Caspar, who suffers from seizures, is bullied at school and often feels alienated due to his illness.",
    "For Nassar, who portrays Ahmed, Invasion isn\u2019t just a story about extraterrestrials attempting to take over the world \u2013 it\u2019s a show that subjectively leaves a mark because of what humankind is currently going through.",
    "\u201cInvasion is the closest thing to helping me understand what we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d Nassar says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s loneliness, isolation or even just survival. The story we\u2019re telling feels familiar to what humanity\u2019s gone through over the last two years. So while it\u2019s a well written drama with deep characters, it\u2019s also very nuanced.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s what attracted me to this story,\u201d Farahani adds. \u201cWe\u2019re really talking about peoples\u2019 lives and psychology. Aneesha realizes that Ahmed has been cheating on her [in episode 1] so, while these aliens are invading Earth, this other woman has also invaded her home. There\u2019s a parallel between what\u2019s happening in her home and the wider world, which acts as a metaphor for our own lives. We\u2019re vulnerable and we need to care for each other.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s hard to predict what kind of impact that Invasion will have \u2013 not only from viewership and ratings perspectives, but how it may emotionally affect those who watch it.",
    "True, the global nature of its story is significant in a subgenre that normally focuses on events in the US. Its themes, too, are topical for today\u2019s climate. But with another Apple sci-fi series in Foundation, as well as other recently popular shows, competing for audiences\u2019 attention, Invasion may struggle to attract viewers. That would be a shame, too, as it\u2019s largely an intriguing watch.",
    "Still, Weil hopes that the unexpected triumph of certain newly released series, as well as the core themes in Invasion, show that humanity isn\u2019t as divided as we might think.",
    "\u201cLook at the success of Squid Game,\u201d Weil says. \u201cIt\u2019s crossed so many different language barriers, societies and cultures, and resonated with people globally. I also think the capacity for our crews, based around the world, to come together and create this show and beautiful art is a testament to shared artistry. I think it shows how incredible our shared humanity is.\u201d",
    "Invasion episodes 1-3 are available to stream exclusively on Apple TV Plus now. New episodes will be released weekly."
