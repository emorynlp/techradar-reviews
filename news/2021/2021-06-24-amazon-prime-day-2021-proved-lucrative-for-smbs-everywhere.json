    "In the two-week lead-up to 2021\u2019s Amazon Prime Day, customers spent $1.9 billion on products offered by small business outlets during its Spend \u00a310, Get \u00a310 promotion period worldwide - a 100% year-on-year increase compared to the Prime Day promotion run a year earlier.",
    "Amazon Prime numbers are continuing to grow with many consumers opting to sign up for the service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic in order to get the benefit of Prime Day online discounts. Members in 20 countries purchased more than 250 million items during the 48-hour sale period, resulting in the highest ever amount spent since Prime Day began back in 2015.",
    "\u201cFor the first time this Prime Day, we offered a double donation promotion through our charity initiative AmazonSmile, which saw more UK customers shopping through AmazonSmile than ever before,\u201d said John Boumphrey, Amazon UK Country Manager. \"This year, Prime Day has also been good news for small businesses, with even more customers than last year taking advantage of our \u2018Spend \u00a310, Get \u00a310\u2019 promotion, providing a much-needed boost to small business sellers across the country.\"",
    "The latest figures from Amazon also offer up a unique snapshot of big-selling products and categories around the globe. Best-selling categories included Tools, Beauty, Nutrition, Baby Care, Electronics including Amazon Devices, Apparel and Household Products.",
    "Meanwhile, Prime Day favourite products worldwide included iRobot Roomba 692 Robot Vacuum, Keurig K-Slim Coffee Maker, Apple Cider Vinegar Gummy Vitamins by Goli Nutrition and Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips.",
    "\u201cAmazon Prime Day exceeds our expectations every year,\u201d commented Oliver Bristowe, Founder of Pets Purest. \u201cThis year we saw a 20% uplift in sales. And by using Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA), it means we can fulfil thousands of orders without worrying about having more resources. As a small business, Amazon allows us to maximise our potential.\u201d"
