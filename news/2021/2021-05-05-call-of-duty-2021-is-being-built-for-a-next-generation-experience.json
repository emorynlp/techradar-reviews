    "Call of Duty 2021 will be developed by Sledgehammer Games, Activision has confirmed, and it seems like this year\u2019s release will focus on getting the most out of PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles.",
    "Activision announced the news during its Q1 earnings call (thanks, GamesRadar), and finally put the rumors to rest that \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 a new Call of Duty game will release this year. The publisher also confirmed that Sledgehammer Games will take the reins this year, who were responsible for Call of Duty: WW2.",
    "\u201cWe are excited for this year\u2019s premium Call of Duty release,\u201d Activision president Dan Alegre said. \u201cDevelopment is being led by Sledgehammer Games. The game is looking great and on track for its Fall [2021] release.\u201d (That\u2019s between September and December).",
    "PS5 and Xbox Series X owners will be delighted to hear that Call of Duty 2021 is \u201cbuilt for [a] next-generation experience\u201d, according to Alegre, and that it will \u201cintegrate with and enhance the existing COD ecosystem.\u201d Expect Call of Duty: Warzone, the series\u2019 free-to-play battle royale mode, to be updated as a result.",
    "Now that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, Sledgehammer Games has since shared the news that the team is working on the next Call of Duty, and that the studio can\u2019t wait to share more.",
    "Call of Duty 2021 is likely to build upon some of the next-gen features that were included in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. The game supported 120fps for those with 120Hz displays, ray-tracing and extra functionality for the PS5 DualSense controller, so we\u2019d at least expect to see these return.",
    "Call of Duty 2021 is tipped to return to a more \u201ctraditional\u201d World War 2 setting, but other rumors have suggested the next CoD will be set in an \u201calternative timeline\u201d. The game will apparently be developed on the same \u2018IW8\u2019 engine which powers Warzone and Modern Warfare (2019).",
    "We expect to find out more about the next Call of Duty in the coming months, as the marketing campaign for Activision\u2019s blockbuster title begins in earnest."
