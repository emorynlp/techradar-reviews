    "You might think that a cost-free antivirus app won\u2019t offer robust enough levels of protection to keep you truly safe online. After all, something you get for absolutely nothing can\u2019t be as good as an antivirus application you pay for \u2013 right?",
    "Well, that\u2019s not necessarily true. Some of the paid-for antivirus apps out there can be rather shaky in quality, particularly more obscure offerings, which may well be worse than a free piece of software from a reputable, highly thought of provider.",
    "And even comparing like-for-like, meaning free and premium products from the same brand, crucially you are still getting the same fundamental protection with a free app. In fact, that\u2019s the first way free antivirus keeps you safe, and we\u2019ll expand on that momentarily \u2013 followed by another four ways in which a freebie security app can accomplish the task of ably defending your device. Because if you thought extras like, say, bundled VPN functionality were the province of premium offerings, then think again\u2026",
    "The fundamental reason for the existence of internet security software is to stop malware from infecting your system. It does this with an antivirus engine, which is regularly updated with definitions of emerging malware, and also incorporates heuristics that can spot malware simply by its behavior - stopping something that's so fresh, it\u2019s not covered by the aforementioned definitions.",
    "That engine in the free product will be the same as the one employed in the paid app \u2013 or at least it will be with any antivirus maker worth its salt, which is why you should stick to well-known and reputable security firms. So, given that, even though you\u2019re using the free version of the antivirus, you\u2019re still getting the same fundamental protection from malware as paid users \u2013 which is enough to defend your PC while you\u2019re online.",
    "Where premium products differentiate themselves, generally speaking, is in the extras they provide \u2013 often valuable ones. But freebie antivirus apps sometimes boast extras too, as we\u2019re about to see.",
    "In a similar vein, some free apps come with an integrated password manager, although admittedly this functionality is reserved for the premium product in many cases. Not always, though, and Avira Free Antivirus is an example of a freebie program that carries useful extra functionality in the form of a built-in manager that will create strong passwords for you, and automatically enter them.",
    "This saves you using (or indeed re-using) overly simple passwords, or having to jot down complex passwords to remember them \u2013 or similarly insecure methods. Passwords can often be a weak point in many user\u2019s security habits, but there\u2019s no need to take risks if you pick the right free antivirus application.",
    "Phishing is the practice of baiting someone to click a link \u2013 generally in an email, or on social media \u2013 in order to propagate malware or for some other nefarious purpose.",
    "Often free virus apps will contain dedicated anti-phishing layers to specifically defend against this troublesome threat, and also quite often web protection (sometimes in the form of a browser plug-in) to keep you safer when surfing the web. All of this keeps you more secure in general when going about your daily online life.",
    "Some antivirus programs might save a bundled Virtual Private Network for their premium apps, but equally there are some freebie antivirus offerings which carry this functionality. That said, the feature is invariably limited compared to the paid app \u2013 but still, you\u2019re getting something for nothing.",
    "For example, Avira Free Antivirus has an integrated VPN, although the caveat is you\u2019re restricted to 500MB a month as a data allowance. True, that\u2019s very little, but it may still come in handy in a pinch, and it\u2019s certainly a useful perk to have for occasional usage, further bolstering your online security and privacy when needed. We have seen some other providers that will give you a bit more data.",
    "This sort of limited integrated software will only be for very occasional use (so don't expect your perfect streaming VPN partner here) but as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s definitely handy to have on tap now and then if you don\u2019t run a separate program.",
    "Often an anti-ransomware layer will be territory only covered by a premium app, but again, if you hunt carefully among freebie antivirus offerings, you can find protection from this particularly nasty family of malware. If your freebie antivirus includes some kind of ransomware shield, it will help prevent certain key folders from being pillaged by ransomware.",
    "Ransomware can really ruin your day, so an additional layer of protection is a very welcome addition to your gratis security armory."
