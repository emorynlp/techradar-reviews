    "If you've been lucky enough to find the console since its launch, you'll be pleased to know we're seeing some PS5 accessories discounted for Amazon Prime Day 2021. In particular, officially licensed mass storage drives and third-party chargers have been heavily discounted, so if you've been holding off on grabbing one of these, you should strike now before Prime Day is over.",
    "Once you're done grabbing accessories, we're also seeing the Demon's Souls remake discounted, which stands as one of the best first-party titles for the console.",
    "These are worth thinking about if you're a few months into owning a PS5, and you want to kit the console out. For anyone who has a deep library of digital PS4 games, the option to offload them onto a separate drive is most welcome \u2013 even if it means your combined setup of a giant PS5 and block of storage isn't necessarily that elegant.",
    "Again, don't expect these to be around for long \u2013 and any Prime Day-specific gaming deals you find today will require Prime membership."
