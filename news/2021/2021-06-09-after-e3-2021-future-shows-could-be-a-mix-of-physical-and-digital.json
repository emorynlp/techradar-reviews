    "This year, E3 is going all-digital for the very first time but the ESA has said that while physical shows will return in the future, they could embrace more digital elements.",
    "In a recent interview with GamesIndustry.biz, ESA president Stanley Pierre-Louis said that this year's show being entirely online will provide the organization with opportunities to learn what works and what could potentially be carried over to future events.",
    "\u201cThis will provide us with an opportunity to present to members of the industry, media, and fans an opportunity to participate fully,\u201d Pierre-Louis said, \u201cand I think that provides a real unique opportunity to learn this year what we can apply to future events that will probably be a mix of physical and digital.\u201d",
    "Of course, nothing is set in stone just yet and Pierre-Louis wasn\u2019t able to give any solid details on how the ESA might attempt to balance physical and digital elements, saying that the exact shape of E3\u2019s future is \u201cyet to be determined\u201d. He added, \u201cwe hope to learn from this year\u2019s event what transfers well. I can\u2019t speak to future E3s because we really want to focus on E3 2021 and ensure this is a great experience for exhibitors, the media, and fans alike.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising, given the uncertainty of the last year, that the ESA is considering making digital aspects a more permanent part of E3 going forward. It\u2019s only recently that Blizzard Entertainment, for instance, announced BlizzCon 2021 will not be going ahead in its usual form and that instead another Blizzconline style event will be held in early 2022, with \u201csmaller in-person gatherings\u201d expected to be a part of that.",
    "We're now gearing up for the start of E3 2021, which is set to run from June 12 to June 15. Across the four-day broadcast, gaming fans will be able to watch a mix of press conferences, panels and interviews. The ESA has also created an app and online portal, with elements designed to encourage viewers to interact with the show beyond simply watching the livestreams.",
    "A full schedule for E3 2021 has now been released and we have presentations and announcements from a wide range of publishers to look forward to, from Ubisoft and Nintendo to Square Enix and Microsoft. The notable absence this year is Sony, which has confirmed it isn\u2019t planning to present at the show.",
    "E3 isn\u2019t the only online gaming event that\u2019s taking place over the next few weeks and months, though. Geoff Keighley\u2019s Summer Game Fest kicks off on June 10 with Steam Next Fest hot on its heels later in the month. EA has confirmed it\u2019ll be holding its traditional EA Play event, this year on the slightly later date of July 22 and, shortly after that, an all-digital Gamescom 2021 will be taking place in August."
