  "article": [
    "After hiding 'like' counts back in 2019, Instagram is now putting the choice back in the hands of users. In its latest global test, Instagram will give a small amount of users the choice of whether or not they want to see like counts on other people\u2019s posts.",
    "The test will also allow participating users the choice of turning off like counts on their own posts. Similar to what\u2019s already available for comments, the trial will let accounts turn off likes entirely, or control it on a post-by-post basis.",
    "Facebook, which owns Instagram, will also start similar testing soon.",
    "The trial seems to be a middle-of-the-road solution to one of Instagram\u2019s challenges. Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, said when the tech giant first tested hiding like counts, it hoped to lessen the social pressure of having a well-liked photo.",
    "After receiving feedback, it seems not everyone agreed. \u201cSome found this helpful and some still wanted to see like counts,\u201d Mosseri wrote on Twitter, \u201cin particular to track what\u2019s popular.\u201d",
    "When like counts were first hidden, there was also fear among influencers on Instagram who worried the lack of the metric data \u2018like\u2019 would affect their ability to show their value to brands and make money on the platform.",
    "Users were still able to privately view and share their likes, and it\u2019s unclear whether hiding likes affected user engagement.",
    "Rather than removing likes entirely or keeping Instagram how it is, Mosseri now says \u201cwe\u2019re testing a new option that lets you decide the experience that\u2019s best for you.\u201d",
    "With tools to combat cyberbullying already available on Instagram, putting control back in the hands of users feels like the most logical solution."
