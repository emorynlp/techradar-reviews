  "article": [
    "The Sonos Arc is a formidable Dolby Atmos soundbar, but the Bose Smart Soundbar 900 is going even bigger on spatial audio \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s going in every direction.",
    "Announced on Tuesday, the Bose Smart Soundbar 900 lives up to its smart moniker by offering Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity as well as support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa for voice control. On top of that, it offers Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, and interoperability with all other Bose smart speakers and the upcoming Bose QuietComfort 45.",
    "But what makes it really special, however, is the way it supports spatial audio.",
    "Not only does the Soundbar 900 support traditional Dolby Atmos via upfiring speakers, but it uses Bose\u2019s PhaseGuide technology to better position that audio in your living room. According to Bose, the Soundbar 900 works by \u201cprecisely, placing and \u2018pinning\u2019 distinct sound to the right and left\u201d offering a large soundstage full of audio cues. When there\u2019s no Dolby Atmos input, Bose says its use of its TrueSpace technology will allow it to retain its horizontal soundstage while remixing signals to add in a virtual height channel.",
    "At their core, both the Bose Smart Soundbar 900 and Sonos Arc attempt to recreate the sound of larger systems in a compact form factor \u2013 something that soundbars really struggled with a few years ago when they were first making waves.",
    "Thanks to built-in Dolby Atmos support and wave-form technologies like Bose's, the gap between the technologies is starting to blur and we\u2019re reaching a point where some soundbars can match discrete systems \u2013 especially at lower price points.",
    "That said, a lower price tag in the audio world doesn\u2019t exactly mean they\u2019re cheap: the Bose Smart Soundbar 900 will be $899 (around \u00a3650, AU$1,200) when it drops on September 23. That\u2019s a heck of a lot cheaper than a full 7.1.2 system would be with an Atmos-capable AVR and support for HDMI 2.1, but it\u2019s not exactly pocket change, either.",
    "We\u2019ll have to test it for ourselves to see how it stands up to the Sonos Arc \u2013 currently what we consider the best soundbar available right now \u2013 but, on paper at least, it\u2019s looking like it will be quite the showdown."
