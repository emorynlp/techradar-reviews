    "When it comes to phones, ZTE has always been a name associated with experimentation.",
    "The Chinese company has often brought something new and interesting to the table, even if its devices are not particularly high-spec. The ZTE Axon 20, for example, marked the first phone to feature an under-display selfie camera, while the Nubia Z20 had a novel screen on the rear of the device as well as on the front.",
    "Now, it looks like ZTE is taking its philosophy for innovation to the world of mobile photography by teasing an upcoming Android phone set to have three 64MP cameras.",
    "The news comes after ZTE mobile president Ni Fei posted on Weibo, a Chinese social media site, that a future Axon flagship device will offer \u201c3 x 64 million, high-energy full focal length\u201d lenses, suggesting a main, ultra-wide and telephoto camera combination, with each lens set to boast 64MP resolutions.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve come across multiple high-resolution cameras on a phone \u2013 the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, OnePlus 8 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Pro all packed two top-spec snappers alongside lower resolution telephoto lenses \u2013 but an Axon device boasting three cameras of equally high resolutions would mark a first for the market.",
    "While ZTE\u2019s claims are impressive, it remains to be seen whether a device boasting three 64MP sensors would definitively outperform devices with a smaller number of much higher resolution cameras.",
    "Some devices have been known to deliver mediocre image quality despite having main sensors in a similar resolution ballpark to those expected of the upcoming ZTE device. The Realme 7, for example, boasts a seemingly-impressive 48MP main sensor that doesn\u2019t deliver the same quality as its pricier competitors. It\u2019s designed to be a cheaper phone, so this is expected, but it nonetheless proves that high megapixel counts don\u2019t always equal great camera performance.",
    "That being said, we\u2019ve seen devices like the Oppo Find X3 Pro benefit from two identical main and ultra-wide sensors which allow for more consistent colors and image detail \u2013 so a ZTE Axon flagship packing three identical sensors could offer exciting results.",
    "Of course, we don\u2019t yet know how much the upcoming device will cost \u2013 it hasn\u2019t even got an official name yet \u2013 but ZTE phones have been known to cater to the cheaper end of the market. Whether that means its novel camera setup can compete with the likes of the Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro remains to be seen.",
