    "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has shared the first official look at Wonka, the upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel headed to theaters in 2023.",
    "The Dune actor tweeted an image of himself in costume as the eponymous chocolatier, and also posted a further image to Instagram which presumably shows his character opening up a secret compartment hidden within his famous cane.",
    "The images serve as the first official glimpse of the movie, which is being helmed by Paddington director Paul King. Like the Mel Stuart and Tim Burton adaptations of Roald Dahl\u2019s 1964 novel before it, the story of Wonka will be told as a musical.",
    "Chalamet accompanied his Instagram post (below) with the caption, \"The suspense is terrible, I hope it will last,\" in reference to Gene Wilder\u2019s interpretation of Wonka in the 1971 movie, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.",
    "Unlike its predecessors, though, King\u2019s movie will follow the titular character and his adventures prior to opening the world's most famous chocolate factory \u2013 narrative ground not covered in Dahl\u2019s novel beyond occasional allusions to Wonka\u2019s troubled childhood.",
    "Principal photography on the film, which is also set to star Keegan-Michael Key, Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, Olivia Colman and Jim Carter, reportedly began in September 2021, and a release date has been scheduled for March 17, 2023.",
    "Given the Hollywood adaptations that have followed Dahl\u2019s novel, the author\u2019s original story is now a decidedly well-trodden tale, and it\u2019s no wonder that audiences aren\u2019t exactly chomping at the bit for another Wonka adaptation.",
    "Still, Paul King\u2019s movie, being a prequel story that we can only assume hasn\u2019t been told before, looks to have a caliber of talent involved that could breathe new life into the iconic character.",
    "King himself has a history of successfully adapting famous children's stories into incredibly watchable movies \u2013 his Paddington adventures were two of the most well-received films of the last decade \u2013 while Chalamet, who saw off competition from the likes of Donald Glover, Ezra Miller and Tom Holland for the lead role, is arguably Hollywood\u2019s most in-demand leading man.",
    "Still, you can\u2019t help but feel as though Wonka\u2019s talented cast and crew will have to try something dramatically different with this hallowed IP if the movie is to be a success.",
    "Chalamet, in particular, would do well to depart from the overly-eccentric (but nonetheless brilliant) interpretations offered by both Wilder and Johnny Depp before him, if only to deliver audiences a thoroughly unique \u2013 and therefore more compelling \u2013 take on the character.",
    "It has to be said, though, that this first look at Chalamet as the \"scrumdiddlyumptious Mozart of chocolate\" doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018different\u2019. The character\u2019s costume appears near-identical to those worn by the Wonkas of yesteryear, and its musical-based story suggests we won\u2019t be treated to a dark origin tale in the vein of Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker (which seems, in fairness, a good move).",
    "That being said, King and co. could surprise us with a theatrical interpretation akin to Tim Burton\u2019s Sweeney Todd, or a more subtle sing-along-adventure \u00e0 la Damien Chazelle's La La Land.",
    "Whatever happens, let\u2019s just hope Wonka isn\u2019t another Cats."
