    "Hardware modders on YouTube have created what\u2019s believed to be the world\u2019s first water-cooled PS5.",
    "A 13-minute video from Vietnamese channel Modding Cafe details the full construction process involved in building a complete water-cooling system for Sony\u2019s latest console, including a step-by-step walkthrough of how to deconstruct the next-gen hardware.",
    "Of course, it's worth bearing in mind that if you attempt to do this, you'll most certainly void your PS5's warranty.",
    "At the end of the video (around the 12-minute mark), the presenters put their innovative system to the test, with surprisingly-effective results. The water-cooler is able to successfully stabilize the heat emitted from the PS5, limiting the hot air around the backplate of the console.",
    "The channel also hints at constructing a variant of the cooling system for the mass market. The description to the video reads: \u201cWe are continuing to prepare for a commercial version [of the system] and also ready to integrate the water-cooled PS5 into one of our next PC builds.\u201d",
    "Judging by the way it looks \u2013 like a weapon belonging to Mr. Freeze \u2013 we\u2019ll bet plenty of people would line up to have their PS5 cooled by Modding Cafe\u2019s quirky water-based system.",
    "It goes without saying that this isn\u2019t the first PS5 console to receive a makeover.",
    "Although Sony\u2019s flagship hardware currently only ships in a basic white color variant, you\u2019re still able to purchase custom faceplates which jazz up the aesthetic of your next-gen system. A company called dbrand offers PS5 \"darkplates\", which are available for $49.99 (around \u00a340 / AU$60).",
    "Given that we\u2019ve seen how easy it is to dissect a PS5 system \u2013 there\u2019s an official Sony teardown video, if trusting internet modders isn\u2019t your thing \u2013 switching up the color of your console isn\u2019t the daunting task it might initially seem.",
    "Naturally, if you\u2019d rather skip the DIY, you could always just opt for a 24K gold PS5. It costs a cool $10,000 (around \u00a37,700 / AU$14,000), but who doesn't have that sort of cash lying around?",
