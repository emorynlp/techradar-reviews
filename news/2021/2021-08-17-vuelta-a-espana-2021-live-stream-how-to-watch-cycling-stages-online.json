We also have info on this year's Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage times.",
    "Following a slow start to the season and a disappointing Tour de France, the Slovenian roared back into life with success at the Tokyo Olympics. He now has his eyes firmly set on a three-peat having dominated the past two editions of the La Vuelta.",
    "Rather ominously for Roglic's rivals, the race both began and ends with an individual time trial, where the defending champion so often does his best work.",
    "Ineos Grenadiers came with a stacked team featuring Egan Bernal - who makes his Vuelta debut knowing that victory will immortalize him as the first Colombia to win all three grand tours - as well as Richard Carapaz, who also took gold at the Olympics and came so close to glory at last year's Vuelta and this year's Tour de France.",
    "The entirety of the route is contained within Spain's borders this year but it's as cruel as ever, containing nine summit finishes as well as an excruciating double-header of Lagos de Covadonga and Gamoniteiro.",
