    "We've reviewed the contenders for best AT&T phone, and compared the value to the price. Ignoring any personal preferences and/or biases towards specific operating systems, be it Android or iOS, we've picked AT&T's best phones in a number of categories.",
    "All of these phones are available through an AT&T installment plan, which spreads the cost of the phone over a set amount of time. For this article, we've looked at the AT&T plans that spread the cost of the phone over 30 months, with an option for upgrade after 80-percent of the device's sales price is paid off.",

    "For the maximum value, we always recommend trading in your older device. While trade-in rebates can vary drastically depending on the age and also price of the older phone, it's a great way to shave some cost off. If you're not looking to trade in then there are also a ton of discounts available on certain devices when you pick them up with a fresh plan. These devices don't tend to be the latest or most feature-laden devices on the market, but there are a number of good flagships still available via this method.",
