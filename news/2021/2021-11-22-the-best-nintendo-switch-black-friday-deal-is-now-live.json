    "You don\u2019t have to wait until November 28 for the best Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals, especially if you\u2019re looking to snag a bargain on the console itself.",
    "Even though Black Friday 2021 is still a few days away, you can get a Nintendo Switch Neon Blue/Red Console, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and a three-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online for just $299.99 / \u00a3259.99. That\u2019s a terrific saving considering the Nintendo Switch console usually costs $299.99 / \u00a3259.99 on its own. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "This Switch bundle is bound to appeal to new customers as you\u2019re getting one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling Nintendo Switch games available, as well as online access so you can prove you\u2019re the best Mario Kart 8 Deluxe player on the planet.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that a Nintendo Switch Online membership also grants users access to a massive library of NES and SNES games, along with exclusive discounts, game trials, and free access to certain Switch games like Tetris 99.",
    "Nintendo has already warned that it won\u2019t be able to meet demand this holiday season, so if you\u2019re still on the fence about waiting until Black Friday or Cyber Monday before picking up a Switch, we\u2019d advise buying this bundle today.",
    "The Nintendo Switch's popularity shows no sign of waning anytime soon, as a number of notable releases continue to drive hardware sales. Games like Breath of the Wild 2, Splatoon 3, and Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus will undoubtedly attract more players to Nintendo's hybrid console. The recent release of the Nintendo Switch OLED has also helped inject fresh interest in Nintendo's hardware.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Nintendo Switch from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
