    "Idris Elba has reportedly confirmed that he won\u2019t be taking over from Daniel Craig as the next James Bond.",
    "Asked by several outlets whether he would be inheriting the 007 mantle at the world premiere of his new Netflix movie The Harder They Fall, the Luther actor responded with the blunt reply: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to be James Bond.\u201d",
    "Elba did, however, add that he\u2019d be open to taking on the role later in his career \u2013 \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t? How amazing would it be to have a Black James Bond?\" \u2013 but it\u2019s safe to assume that the 49-year-old has little interest in becoming the next iteration of the iconic character.",
    "Among all the actors in the running to replace Craig over the last decade, Elba has proven the most frequently touted candidate \u2013 a favorite of both fans and industry insiders.",
    "In 2014, for instance, a Sony email hack revealed a message from its then-Chair, Amy Pascal, reading \u201cIdris [Elba] should be the next Bond.\u201d Since then, the actor has regularly sat atop the odds charts to inherit the role, with Elba himself often encouraging the rumors with suggestive tweets (see below) and cryptic comments.",
    "But Elba\u2019s latest comments \u2013 which also mark a rare outright denial of his interest in the role \u2013 come as he gears up to star in a feature-length Luther movie on Netflix, perhaps explaining why he\u2019s no longer keen to add fuel to the Bond fire.",
    "In a recent interview with Esquire, the actor contextualized this newfound indifference by explaining that Luther already satisfies his cravings for a heroic acting role. \u201cI say this in jest, but [Luther] is my answer to Bond,\u201d said Elba. \u201c[He] is my big character that lives in the same space as the Bournes, as the Bonds in the world. Not in terms of spy works or spying, but this is a character that fights evil and then will stop at nothing to do it.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s clear, then, that Elba has his hands full with his long-running BBC character, and despite his aforementioned addendum on how great it would be to see a Black James Bond, we can\u2019t help but feel as though the actor\u2019s time aboard the 007 merry-go-round has run its course.",
    "The franchise could pivot towards exploring the life of an older Bond in the future, though we\u2019d argue that this ground has already been covered in Craig\u2019s final few films. In all likelihood, Barbara Broccoli and co. will look to reinvigorate the franchise with a younger Bond \u2013 which, unfortunately, would put Elba firmly out of the picture.",
    "With Idris Elba almost definitely not in line to play the next James Bond, then, who is?",
    "Ahead of No Time to Die\u2019s release last month, we put together our our own list of potential Bond candidates, which includes more recent suspects like Robert Pattinson, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, James Norton, Sam Heughan and Richard Madden alongside long-touted names including Michael Fassbender, Damien Lewis and Tom Hardy.",
    "For our money, it\u2019ll be one of the former \u2013 Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and Richard Madden seem the safest picks \u2013 though the Bond producers may decide to throw a curve-ball into the mix by opting for a lesser-known name, as they did with Craig\u2019s appointment in 2005.",
    "Whoever plays the next James Bond, though, they\u2019re not likely to do so for some time. Broccoli recently told Total Film that \u201cit\u2019s tough to think about the future until [No Time to Die] has its moment,\" adding that \"I think we just really want to celebrate this and celebrate Daniel, and then when the dust settles, then look at the landscape and figure out what the future is.\u201d",
    "Plenty of time to speculate, then."
