    "Could a new HTC Vive headset be on the way? Something fresh is certainly being teased over at the official HTC Vive Twitter account, after a few quiet months for the virtual reality brand.",
    "The company has sent at a single image of a black plastic surface in close up, along with the HTC Vive logo, along with the words \"It's your move\":",
    "There's little to go on, but the hidden nature of the complete picture suggests some sort of fresh hardware is on the way.",
    "HTC has been keeping a low profile since the launch of its HTC Vive Cosmos and Vive Cosmos Elite early last year. The Vive team showed off an entry-level Cosmos build called the Cosmos Play, but it never saw a consumer release.",
    "More likely for this tease, given the \"move\" mention, is a new tracking extension peripheral, improving movement tracking beyond the wand-style controllers that come with the headset.",
    "What we'd love to see though is more from HTC's 'Project Proton' idea. It was looking like HTC's rival to the Oculus Quest 2 \u2013 two headsets, one a battery powered standalone, and the other a device powered by a phone or even a 5G stream. We're hoping to see some more from that concept in 2021, too."
