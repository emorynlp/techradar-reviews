    "Canoe slalom is no different\u2014 European athletes have been dominating the competitions for the last 30 years. Non-European athletes won only in the 2008 and 2016 Olympics (and they were bronze medals \u2013 disparity much?).",
    "Europe has numerous artificial whitewater courses, and this gives their athletes ample opportunity to hone their skills. However, as more artificial courses are set up around the globe, this colossal gap in proficiency is closing, albeit a little slowly.",

    "Many broadcasters globally are covering the Tokyo Olympics and, fortunately, some of them are free-to-air. The official Olympics Channel is offering limited coverage and some catch-up of many of the sporting events, especially the major ones. However, if you\u2019re looking for comprehensive live action, you\u2019ll need to go for domestic broadcasters.",
    "In the UK, the BBC is broadcasting A-list sports and matches on free-to-air TV and on the BBC iPlayer website, while ARD and ZDF are doing the same in Germany, Channel 7 in Australia is offering quite possibly the most comprehensive coverage we've encountered, with live streams of most sports as it happens, and TVNZ has access in New Zealand. Continue reading to learn how you can live stream canoeing at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.",
    "While most countries will have decent free coverage, there are a couple of instances in which you'll want to access something different. The most likely scenarios for this are if you're out of your home country and can't access your regular streaming sites, or if watching online has been blocked on your work or college Internet.",
    "The simplest way to remedy this is by using a VPN. A VPN is software that can virtually change your location, avoid network restrictions and keep you more private online as well. All you need to do is install it, select a server in your country of choice, and catch all the Olympic goodness without resorting to an illegal stream.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Getting started with your VPN is super simple:",
    "1. Download and install your VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app and select the appropriate location, and connect",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're after a UK stream, just head to BBC iPlayer",
    "It won't come as a surprise that the Olympics is being shown in most corners of the globe - although with varying levels of coverage and without free broadcasters in some countries.",
    "If you're not in any of the countries mentioned above, then we'd suggest taking a look at the dedicated Wikipedia page of all of the world's Olympic Games channels."
