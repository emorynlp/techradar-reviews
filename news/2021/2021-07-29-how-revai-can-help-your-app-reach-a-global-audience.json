    "In today\u2019s business world, being able to communicate with customers no matter what language they use is more important than ever. After all, only 20% of the world speaks English as a first language, so being able to communicate in other tongues could be a game-changer for your company.",
    "Thanks to the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) service Rev.ai, developers can build applications that take advantage of the most accurate API-driven speech recognition engine in the market today. Thanks to Rev.ai\u2019s collection of SDKs, the time it takes for you to integrate its speech-to-text features in your app takes a matter of hours, rather than days or weeks, which means you can get your app to market - and in the hands of users - much faster.",
