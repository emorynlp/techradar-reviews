  "article": [
    "It\u2019s a well known fact in phones that only budget buyers want colorful handsets. This of course isn\u2019t true, but you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it was based on the state of the smartphone scene, a state that I can\u2019t help thinking about \u2013 and puzzling over \u2013 now that there\u2019s talk of a pink iPhone 13 Pro Max.",
    "A Twitter account (and phone shop) called Peng Store tweeted that a rose pink iPhone 13 Pro Max will land in December. It\u2019s a claim that\u2019s deeply suspect \u2013 not least because the attached render is a fan-made one from Instagrammer Ali Sayed Ali, and it predates this leak.",
    "December also seems late for an iPhone 13 model to launch, but perhaps the biggest reason I\u2019m skeptical of this is simply that Apple doesn\u2019t typically use bright colors for its premium phones. The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max for example are available in black, silver, gold and pacific blue shades \u2013 with those latter two being understated.",
    "Yet Apple isn\u2019t afraid of using bright or unusual colors on its other phones. Beyond the boring colors, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are available in bright purple and red shades, along with a snazzy green. The iPhone SE (2020) too can be purchased in a bright red.",
    "So while I\u2019m not sold on this rumor, I also wouldn\u2019t be totally surprised if the iPhone 13 came in pink \u2013 but I would be surprised if the iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max did.",
    "And this isn\u2019t exclusively an Apple issue. Want a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra? Your color choices are black or silver (or a small selection of similarly smart additional shades if you buy it direct from Samsung). Yet the standard Samsung Galaxy S21 comes in pink and violet options, and if you move further down into, say, the Samsung Galaxy A range, you have a similarly vibrant selection of colors for many models.",
    "The same can be seen to a lesser extent with OnePlus \u2013 while for the most part the brand focuses on subtle shades, the mid-range OnePlus Nord can alternatively be had in a bright \u2018Blue Marble\u2019. And it\u2019s a similar story with other brands \u2013 not all of them all the time, but enough for there to be a definite pattern.",
    "What I don\u2019t understand though, is why. Having lots of money doesn\u2019t make someone less interested in garish gadgets \u2013 you only have to look at how Donald Trump decorates for evidence of that.",
    "Appreciating or desiring high-end tech doesn\u2019t make you allergic to color either \u2013 I definitely fall into that category, and a couple of phones back I had an Honor 10 in large part because of the flashy blue color scheme I could get it with.",
    "So I\u2019m stumped as to why this isn\u2019t more often an option at the high end. Sure, not everyone will want a phone that shines like the sun, but options are always appreciated, especially when you\u2019re paying that much money.",
    "So I \u2013 like apparently many, many other people \u2013 hope Apple does make a pink iPhone 13, but what I really hope is that the color is available across the whole range."
