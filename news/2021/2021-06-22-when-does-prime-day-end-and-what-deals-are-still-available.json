  "article": [
    "Day two of Amazon Prime Day is more than halfway over in the US, and the clock is ticking if you want to snag the best deals. How much time is left? That depends on where you live, so we'll give you an answer for as many time zones as possible.",
    "Amazon Prime Day isn't like Black Friday, where deals will frequently extend beyond Friday into the weekend. When Prime Day 2021 ends, most of the best spotlight and lightning deals on everything from laptops to robot vacuums will abruptly stop, particularly for Amazon devices. Some companies will extend their deals into Wednesday, but since that isn't a certainty, why wait?",
    "For the UK, it's pretty simple - it was midnight BST for the end of deals days, and while some deals remain, many are dead and gone now. Sorry.",
    "For US shoppers, Amazon is operating off PDT, as their offices are based in Seattle. Amazon Prime Day officially ends at midnight PDT (west coast time) on Wednesday morning, giving you less than 12 hours as of publication.",
    "Here's when Prime Day 2021 will end in your time zone:",
    "As for folks shopping in Europe, Amazon has made the end of Prime Day relative to your time zone. Amazon UK's Prime Day ended at 12:00am BST on Wednesday morning, meaning you have eight hours fewer than US customers to snag any last deals. French and German shoppers had until 12:00am CEST, and so on.",
    "As for Australian shoppers, you appear to be a special case. It's already Wednesday morning there, but you have until 5pm AEST to snag deals from the Amazon Global Store as Amazon Australia benches itself against the US, as some deals can still be shipped to Oz.",
    "Good question. As we've mentioned, this year's Prime Day deals officially end at midnight tonight. The good news is that Amazon will be continually releasing new deals between now and midnight, so there's plenty of time to bag a bargain (if it's not already midnight).",
    "Just bear in mind that these deals will run for differing amounts of time - firstly, depending on what type of Prime Day deal each one is; and secondly, on how long stock actually lasts. There are two main types of Prime Day deal:",
    "Deals of the day These promotions run for a set amount of time, or until the product sells out. New ones are released throughout the day, and you\u2019ll see a timer on the product page, showing you have long you have left to claim each deal - and in reality, the good ones have been on sale for quite some time and are already selling out, so be quick.",
    "Lightning deals These are fast promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period. These deals don\u2019t last long, but if you have Prime, you get 30-minute early access.",
    "You\u2019ll need a Prime membership to get access to most of these deals, but if you\u2019re not signed up, you can still take part with a free 30-day trial of Prime. Amazon says it\u2019ll be releasing lots of new deals throughout the entire 48-hour sale, so there\u2019s still plenty of time left to grab a bargain. However, many deals have already sold out too so if you see something you like, it\u2019s a good idea to grab it while you can.",
    "You came here to find out when Prime Day ends, so clearly you're hoping to get some last-minute shopping in before Amazon metaphorically puts up the 'Closed' sign and shoos everyone off of the site.",
    "Below, you'll find several of our favorite deals that should still be available right up until midnight. You could also check out our round-ups of the best Apple Prime Day deals, best PS5 game deals, best Prime Day Kindle deals, or our list of 50 cheap Prime Day deals under $50."
