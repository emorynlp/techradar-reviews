    "Huge spoilers follow for Foundation episodes 1 to 6. Watch them all before reading on.",
    "Foundation hasn\u2019t been shy about examining the subject of death. Through the murder of key character Hari Seldon in episode 2, and its Emperor clone storyline, Apple\u2019s sci-fi epic is willing to explore the ramifications of life and death in detail.",
    "So it should come as no surprise that episode 6, aka Death and the Maiden, continues that trend. But, while the demise of Hari (and adopted son Raych) have only impacted one of the show\u2019s multiple narratives so far, episode 6\u2019s character deaths may prove to have greater, far-reaching consequences.",
    "The first of episode 6\u2019s deaths concerns the Empire\u2019s rulers. Picking up a plot thread that was last visited in episode 4, Brother Day arrives on Maiden, a habitable moon that\u2019s home to the conclave of recently deceased leader Proximal Opal.",
    "It\u2019s here where Death and the Maiden\u2019s first power struggle plays out. The passing of Proxima Opal means that Maiden\u2019s population must decide on its next matriarch, with Zephyr Gilat and Zephyr Halima in the running.",
    "Gilat is the Empire\u2019s favored candidate as she\u2019ll continue to support Day\u2019s dictatorial rule, but Halima has the backing of large swathes of the conclave. Given that Halima has been a Zephyr for less than a year, and that her beliefs are considered to be heretical to the Empire\u2019s tyrannical leaders, such a following is indicative of the sway that she already holds.",
    "Unsurprisingly, then, Day\u2019s initial meetings with each candidate are polar opposite in nature. His conversation with Halima is one built on suspicion, with both parties exuding a wariness that\u2019s evident by their distant in-person stand-off. Conversely, Day\u2019s rendezvous with Gilat is more hospitable and harmonious, with the duo charming each other in nauseating fashion.",
    "The contrast between the meetings is obvious, but the former offers a proper insight into how the Emperors are largely perceived outside of Trantor. Halima and Day\u2019s chat reveals the distrust that some have for the Empire\u2019s rulers \u2013 the duo\u2019s verbal sparring, centered around sociopolitical issues, proving that Halima is a match for Day\u2019s charismatic-yet-egotistical attitude.",
    "If Day wasn\u2019t unsettled by Halima\u2019s self-assured nature during their first meeting, his worry is plain to see during Opal\u2019s funeral.",
    "Interrupting an underwhelming address from Gilat, Halima delivers a rousing speech about reincarnation and transformation. Clearly, it\u2019s an allegorical attack on Day and his fellow clones, but it\u2019s the level of support that Halima\u2019s speech gets from the funeral\u2019s attendees that\u2019ll be of most concern to Day.",
    "Surprisingly, his right-hand assistant Eto Demerzel is among those swayed by Halima\u2019s address, with the humanoid going as far as to bow to Halima alongside the majority of the conclave. It\u2019s an unusually isolated position for Day to be in: seeing him stripped of his authoritarian power in this scene is symbolic as, until now, we\u2019ve become used to him commanding any scenario that he\u2019s a part of. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how he recovers from this rare setback in future episodes.",
    "Speaking of recovering from a major blow, it\u2019ll be a while before Terminus City\u2019s residents, particularly Salvor Hardin, get over the loss of one of their own.",
    "The death of Abbas, Salvor\u2019s father, is episode 6\u2019s most emotional moment by some distance. Sure, it\u2019s foreshadowed when we learn more about Abbas\u2019 backstory during a poignant conversation with Salvor, but it doesn\u2019t make his demise any less impactful. It\u2019s a hard watch, with Clarke Peters and Leah Harvey delivering moving performances as the former sacrifices himself to destroy the Anacreons\u2019 corvette warships.",
    "Abbas\u2019 death isn\u2019t the only noteworthy event that occurs as part of episode 6\u2019s Terminus storyline. Moments before his demise, Salvor suffers from an incident called a \u2018mind seizure\u2019, and it seems that she\u2019s intrinsically linked to events earlier in season 1. How? Well, Salvor ends up reliving the moments before Hari\u2019s death, albeit she witnesses the scene play out in Gaal\u2019s body.",
    "As it happens, Raych has to murder Hari or the Foundation will fail before it makes it to Terminus. Hari claims that Raych has no choice but to do what\u2019s asked of him as it\u2019s all part of Hari\u2019s plan. In truth, Hari\u2019s reasoning is explained away a bit too easily but, given the apparent complex nature of psychohistory, it\u2019s hard to criticize the series\u2019 showrunners for keeping things simple.",
    "Interestingly, it was Raych, not Gaal, who was supposed to use one of the ship\u2019s escape pods (after he murders Hari) and be picked up by the space vessel in episode 5. Of course, Gaal throws a spanner in the works when she sees Raych murdering Hari. Will this impact Hari\u2019s plan for the Foundation, seeing as it's a plan that's set in stone before Hari's death? That\u2019s unclear, but hopefully we\u2019ll find out more if we\u2019re reunited with her in episode 7.",
    "While episode 6\u2019s Trantor-based events are devoid of any physical deaths, there are the beginnings of a figurative one surrounding the relationship between Brothers Dawn and Dusk.",
    "Mirroring Day\u2019s scepticism of Halima, Dusk is similarly suspicious of Dawn\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior. He picked up on Dawn\u2019s delayed response to Ambassador Thanwall in episode 5 \u2013 the three Emperors usually act in unison in public settings \u2013 and notices more inconsistencies in this week\u2019s episode.",
    "Dawn\u2019s late arrival to an exotic bird hunt, as well as hiding three of his kills so that he doesn\u2019t upstage Dusk, are two such incidents. It\u2019s Dawn\u2019s refusal to sleep with one of Trantor\u2019s escorts once the hunt is over, however, that convinces Dusk that something isn\u2019t right about his fellow clone. While he\u2019s left in the dark for now, we find out that Dawn does have some differences from clones who have come before him. We learn that he\u2019s color blind and has genuine feelings for palace gardener Azura, who he kisses later in episode 6.",
    "As viewers, then, we end up knowing more about Dawn than Dusk. It\u2019s a welcome change of pace for the show: in revealing more to its audience than its fictional characters, Foundation creates an underlying tension that\u2019s sure to rise to the surface when Dusk eventually confronts Dawn. A suspenseful new dynamic has been formed between the duo and it\u2019ll be intriguing to see how it plays out, especially as Azura will be a person that Brothers Day and Dusk consider as a threat to the clones' pure bloodline.",
    "After a stellar fifth episode, Foundation continues to gain traction with its latest entry.",
    "Death and the Maiden builds on last week\u2019s much needed breakout episode, helping to correct the course of a show that was in danger of losing its direction. It ramps up the action, delivers significantly emotional moments and adds some spicy political intrigue into the mix. Death and the Maiden also benefits from jumping between three storylines instead of the usual two \u2013 a decision that certainly helps with its plot pacing.",
    "With successive solid entries under its belt for the first time in season 1, Foundation seems like it\u2019s finally found its rhythm. If it can maintain this upward trajectory and balanced pacing in its final four episodes, those slow moving early entries will be a distant memory.",
    "New episodes of Foundation debut exclusively on Apple TV Plus every Friday."
