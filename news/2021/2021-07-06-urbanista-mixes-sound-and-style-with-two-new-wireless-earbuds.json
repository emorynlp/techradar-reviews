    "Swedish audio brand Urbanista is known for its range of true wireless earbuds, headphones and Bluetooth speakers designed for fashion-conscious music lovers on a budget, and its latest arrivals are no different.",
    "Both the Urbanista Seoul and Urbanista Lisbon aim to combine the company\u2019s trademark emphasis on bright colors and smart design with good quality sound, offering casual listeners an accessible alternative to more expensive earbuds like the Apple AirPods Pro or Beats Studio Buds.",
    "This time around, mobile gamers should take notice, too. The Seoul earbuds have been designed with on-the-go play in mind, offering users the option to switch between dedicated gaming and music modes with just a tap. They also arrive with impressively low latency, and eight hours playtime on a single charge, according to Urbanista.",
    "They\u2019ll also boast wireless charging with a certified Qi pad, as well as IPX4 water resistance and compatibility with Siri and Google Voice Assistant. What\u2019s more, at only $89.90 / \u00a389.90, they could represent some of the best value true wireless earbuds on the market right now.",
    "The Urbanista Seoul won\u2019t match their pricier competitors for sound quality or functionality (there\u2019s no noise cancellation or transparency options here), but for such a low price, the brand\u2019s focus is clearly on the earbuds\u2019 eye-catching design. They\u2019re available to buy in bright blue and purple colorways, as well as some not-so-bold black and white options.",
    "As for the Urbanista Lisbon, that emphasis on style over substance is even more apparent. Priced at just $49.90 / \u00a349.90, they\u2019re cheaper than most of the earbuds on our best budget wireless earbuds list, and what they won't offer in terms of sound quality, they make up for in portability.",
    "For starters, the Urbanista Lisbon earbuds weigh just 4g each. For our British readers, that\u2019s about the same as a two pence coin. They pack the same touch controls as their Seoul counterparts, too, as well as a superior single charge capacity of nine hours.",
    "The Urbanista Lisbon don\u2019t boast any additional listening modes, though, and their charging case also lacks the battery life of their more expensive sibling (27 hours vs 32 hours).",
    "Still, with a single, universal earbud tip emphasising the Lisbon\u2019s focus on ultra-casual, ultra-portable use, they could be a great option for listeners looking for an easy-to-use pair of wireless earbuds that don\u2019t break the bank.",
    "They also come in red, beige, black, pink or green, too, so they\u2019re certain to catch the eye \u2013 even if they don\u2019t light up the ears."
