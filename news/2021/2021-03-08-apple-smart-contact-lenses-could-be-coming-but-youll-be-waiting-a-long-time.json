    "We\u2019re still waiting for the long-rumored Apple Glasses to arrive, but Apple might have far more ambitious plans beyond those, with a new report suggesting that augmented reality contact lenses could be in the company\u2019s future.",
    "This comes from Ming-Chi Kuo (an analyst with a great track record for Apple information), in a research note seen by MacRumors. However, he says we probably won\u2019t see them until the 2030s.",
    "Kuo claims that these contact lenses probably won\u2019t have independent computing power and storage, which suggests they\u2019d likely be connected to an iPhone or other device.",
    "He describes them as bringing electronics from the era of \"visible computing\" to \"invisible computing,\" \u2013 which is to say, the smart devices that we use wouldn\u2019t be things that we hold or visibly wear.",
    "Kuo didn\u2019t go into any further details about Apple\u2019s smart contact lenses, but if they\u2019re augmented reality then that means they\u2019d display a virtual layer over the real world. That layer could potentially serve any number of purposes \u2013 arrows overlaid on a road for navigation, messages popping directly into your eyeline, and all sorts of other things.",
    "The smart contact lenses would probably be a bit like the smart glasses that we\u2019re starting to see now, and that Apple is rumored to be working on, just without all the bulk.",
    "All that said, the 2030s are a long way off yet, and Kuo claims that there\u2019s \u201cno visibility\u201d on these contact lenses currently, which suggests this might just be an educated guess rather than anything he\u2019s actually heard that Apple\u2019s working on.",
    "So we\u2019d take both the possibility of these lenses and the timing of their launch with a serious helping of salt. But they would be a logical next step after smart glasses.",
    "First up though there\u2019s the Apple VR headset, which is rumored to be landing in 2022 and to offer both virtual and augmented reality features. Then there\u2019s the Apple Glasses, which might land in 2023 or later. Then, maybe, we can start talking more seriously about Apple contact lenses."
