  "article": [
    "We didn't see the new Apple Watch SE 2 at the September Apple event \u2013 apparently our crossed fingers weren't enough to will it onto the stage alongside all the new products \u2013 which means we might not see it until 2022 or even later.",
    "At the event we saw the iPhone 13, iPad 10.2 (2021), iPad Mini 6 and Apple Watch 7, so we can't exactly complain about a lack of tech, but some people were hoping the Watch SE's successor would debut at as an affordable counterpart to the Watch 7. Clearly, it didn't.",
    "We first saw the Apple Watch SE in 2020, and it was something of a surprise, as an affordable counterpart to the Apple Watch 6 in the spirit (and naming convention) of the iPhone SE (2020). It's something of an updated version of the Apple Watch 3 with the same health tracking capabilities but a newer chipset that should make it compatible with new watchOS versions for years to come.",
    "Likewise, we expect the Apple Watch SE 2 to be a more affordable wearable with enough of the recent bells and whistles (like, hopefully, the always-on display) from recent flagship watches, but we haven't heard specifics on what it will include.",
    "As the Apple Watch SE hasn't been around long enough to get a new version, and we haven't heard about the Watch SE 2, it's no wonder we didn't see it at the September event. Assuming an Apple Watch SE 2 is in the works, we'll likely see it 2022 at the earliest, and below we\u2019ve included some predictions as to when it might launch and what it might cost, along with a list of the improvements we want from it.",
    "And as rumors start to roll in we\u2019ll be including all of those in this article too, so check back often to stay up to date on the Apple Watch SE 2.",
    "So far there\u2019s little news on when the Apple Watch SE 2 might launch, though reputable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims it will arrive sometime in 2022.",
    "The original Apple Watch SE was announced on September 15, 2020, so we thought there was a fair chance the Apple Watch SE 2 will land in September of this year \u2013 clearly that didn't pan out.",
    "Instead, we'll likely see the watch come out in 2022, as has now been rumored, possibly at the beginning of the year but more likely alongside the iPhone 14 and Apple Watch 8.",
    "Then again, since Apple has only launched one Apple Watch SE model so far, there\u2019s not much to go on, so there\u2019s a chance the Apple Watch SE 2 won\u2019t even land ever.",
    "There aren\u2019t any price rumors yet either, but the original Apple Watch SE starts at $279 / \u00a3260 / AU$429, with prices rising for LTE, a larger size, or different strap types. There\u2019s a fair chance that the Apple Watch SE 2 will have a similar starting price, but we can\u2019t be sure for now.",
    "We haven\u2019t heard anything specifically about the Apple Watch SE 2 yet, but Tim Cook has spoken about the future of the Apple Watch on the Outside podcast, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s a ton of innovation left to go in there\u201d and \"We are in the early innings\u2026 think about the amount of sensors in your car. And arguably, your body is much more important than your car.\u201d",
    "That suggests a continued focus on health and fitness for future Apple Watch models, and we\u2019d expect the Apple Watch SE 2 would be included in that.",
    "There are some key improvements that we want from the Apple Watch SE 2, including the following.",
    "The Apple Watch SE doesn\u2019t have an always-on display, which is one of the main things it lacks in comparison to the Apple Watch 6.",
    "That\u2019s fair enough, as Apple would have wanted to save some features for its more premium wearable, but by late 2021 when the Apple Watch SE 2 will hopefully land, we\u2019d like the always-on display to be a standard feature across the range.",
    "The Apple Watch SE actually has better battery life than most Apple Watch models, but at around a day and a half it still doesn\u2019t match a lot of other wearables, and also doesn\u2019t really cut it for sleep tracking, since you\u2019ll likely find you want to charge it at night.",
    "So for the Apple Watch SE 2 we\u2019d like to see life extended to at least two days, and ideally three or more.",
    "While the Apple Watch SE is positioned as a relatively budget option in the Apple Watch range, it\u2019s actually not the cheapest wearable that Apple sells. That\u2019s the Apple Watch 3, which is still on sale.",
    "To simplify things, we\u2019d like to see the Apple Watch SE 2 have the lowest price of any currently available Apple Watch, so it\u2019s clear what the wearable\u2019s position is in the range.",
    "The Apple Watch SE is only available in gold, silver, and space gray shades, and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with those colors, we\u2019d like to see a wider selection available for the Apple Watch SE 2, including perhaps something flashier, like the red color that you can get the Apple Watch 6 in.",
    "You can of course get a lot more color from the strap, as we\u2019re only talking about the body here, but we\u2019d still like more options.",
    "Beyond the always-on display, one other feature the Apple Watch SE lacks that the Apple Watch 6 has is blood oxygen monitoring.",
    "This is a useful health monitoring feature, but probably not a big selling point for most people, so while we\u2019d like to see it, we wouldn\u2019t mind too much if Apple keeps this for premium models."
