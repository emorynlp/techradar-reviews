    "We\u2019ve seen some concerning reports that AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen 5000 Zen 3 processors, along with the X570 motherboards they use, could be suffering from a high failure rate.",
    "PowerGPU posted a tweet \u2013 which has since been deleted \u2013 that claimed the PC builder ordered a large number of Ryzen 5000 processors, and a surprising number of them were DOA (Dead on Arrival).",
    "According to PowerGPU, of the 50 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X CPUs it received, eight were DOA. Out of 50 AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPUs, four were DOA.",
    "PowerGPU\u2019s AMD 7 Ryzen 5800X and AMD Ryzen 5 5600X stock also reportedly had high failure rates as well.",
    "While a certain amount of defective units is to be expected when bulk buying, PowerGPU\u2019s numbers are worryingly high.",
    "However, before we go any further, it\u2019s important to note that this is an unsubstantiated claim from a single source. It should also be noted that the original tweet was deleted, which could mean PowerGPU has backtracked on its claims.",
    "But, while PowerGPU has deleted its original tweet, it is still replying to other users \u2013 many of whom are taking issue with PowerGPU\u2019s claims.",
    "The company is also posting screenshots of the r/AMD Subreddit, where users are posting about their issues.",
    "While PowerGPU\u2019s claimed numbers are high, other PC parts retailers and builders are claiming that the failure rates seem to be normal.",
    "Hardware Unboxed asked some \u2018major\u2019 PC parts retailers in Australia, and were told the AMD Ryzen 5000 failure rate was below 2% \u2013 which is around normal.",
    "So, what\u2019s going on here? As PowerGPU been unlucky with its high failure rate? Hardware Unboxed suggests that it could be the fault of PowerGPU \u2013 either the CPUs were wrongly installed or they were combined with incorrect hardware.",
    "Many other users are suggesting that it is PowerGPU\u2019s fault. However, it would have been pretty embarrassing for a PC building company to publicly call out AMD for something that was its own fault \u2013 and by incorrectly building the PCs, no less.",
    "Perhaps that\u2019s why PowerGPU took down its initial tweet. However, it is still replying to users, so it doesn\u2019t appear to be a complete climbdown.",
    "It\u2019s also noticeable that both PowerGPU and Hardware Unboxed tweets on the subjects have people replying that claim their have faulty CPUs, while other users say they have not.",
    "When it comes to consumers, this shouldn\u2019t make too much of a difference, as PC builders will test out their products before sending them out. PowerGPU claims that systems it built that were found to have a DOA Ryzen 5000 chip had the faulty chip removed and replaced with a working one, so none of their customers will receive a faulty product.",
    "However, if the failure rates of this chips does end up being high, it means stock of these processors \u2013 which is already very low \u2013 could become even more scarce.",
    "It\u2019s a complex picture at the moment, and we\u2019ve contacted AMD to find out what\u2019s going on. A spokesperson told us:",
    "\"AMD is looking into a claim by a custom PC builder regarding higher-than-expected failure rates they are experiencing with Ryzen 5000 series desktop processors. We are unaware of any similar issues at this time.\"",
    "So, AMD is certainly taking these claims seriously, though it doesn't seem to be widespread for the moment. We'll be keeping an eye on this.",
