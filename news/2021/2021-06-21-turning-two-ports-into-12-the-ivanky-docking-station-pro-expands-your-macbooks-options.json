    "Apple\u2019s MacBooks are impressive, portable workstations, but when it comes time to hunker down and get some serious work in, their lack of ports can be a serious roadblock. The iVANKY Docking Station Pro is built specifically to work with Apple\u2019s MacBooks from the Air models up to the Pro models, turning their two USB-C ports into a full array of ports that can cater to a demanding workstation.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a programmer, a photographer, a video editor, or just working from home, the iVANKY Docking Station Pro provides a robust hub to dramatically expand your workstation. It\u2019s a 12-in-2 hub, as it plugs into both of your MacBook\u2019s USB-C ports with a single connector and turns around to deliver 12 varied connections in their place.",
    "To make your work easier to see, the iVANKY Docking Station Pro provides two HDMI 2.0 ports that will allow you to pair your MacBook with two 4K monitors running at 60Hz. This can give you a ton of extra screen space and a much finer resolution to see the detail in your work.",
    "The dock also provides support for many extra peripherals like keyboards, mice, and external storage. It does that with four USB 3.0 Type-A ports and two Type-C ports. If you\u2019re often working with photographic or video media, you\u2019ll also benefit from the full-size SD card reader and the microSD card reader. You can also keep a pair of wired headphones plugged into the dock through its 3.5mm headphone jack.",
    "The iVANKY Docking Station Pro can even upgrade your networking by providing a Gigabit Ethernet port, so you don\u2019t have to rely on Wi-Fi.",
    "With the dock, you don\u2019t have to worry about power either. It runs off an external 180W power supply, which provides it with plenty of juice to power your MacBook and other attached devices.",
    "In fact, it can provide up to 96W charging to keep even a beefy 16-inch MacBook Pro charged up, and it offers 18W PD fast charging through one of the USB-C ports to let you charge an extra device, like an iPhone or iPad. And, with over-voltage protection, over-current protection, and short-circuit protection, it\u2019ll keep your devices protected all the while.",
    "The iVANKY Docking Station Pro is a premium partner for your MacBook work setup, but Amazon Prime Day is making it easier to get your hands on. From 6/21 to 6/22, you\u2019ll be able to pick up the iVANKY Docking Station Pro for 20% off."
