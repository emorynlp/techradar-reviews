    "If you want to find the right employees for your business then you can upload a job advert, breeze through some interviews, and tell them to be on time for their first day, but that\u2019s not necessarily the best method.",
    "Instead, it pays to take some extra time and pay as much attention as possible to your recruitment process. After all, if you get the procedures right from start to end then you\u2019re more likely to attract the best people to your business \u2013 and that\u2019s a win for everyone involved.",
    "If you want to hire the right employee for your open position, then it\u2019s got to start way before you publish your job advert and it\u2019s got to end after you\u2019ve extended the job offer. There are many stages to the process and plenty of complicated topics to think about, though, so we can understand if it\u2019s a little daunting.",
    "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve picked out ten top tips that can improve your recruitment process, from job descriptions to onboarding and everything in between.",
    "If you\u2019d like some more guidance, head here to see our pick of the best recruitment platforms, read our verdict on the best HR software, and delve into our choice of the best US job sites.",
    "You\u2019ll have an easier journey through the recruitment process if you define the new position before writing job descriptions and searching for candidates.",
    "It\u2019s vital to make a list of the tasks and responsibilities that will be needed in the new position, and at the same time you should define who the new employee will be working with and reporting to in the new role. Get those people\u2019s input here, too \u2013 they\u2019ll have a great idea of what will really be required in the new job, and they can help you make your list and eventual job description more realistic.",
    "Once you\u2019ve defined the new job\u2019s duties, you can make a list of the skills and abilities that you need from your candidate \u2013 and it\u2019s worth specifying what are essential and which are just a welcome bonus. Note down the time commitments, too.",
    "List the benefits you can offer and the salary range available for this role, too, and make sure that you\u2019ve beaten the competition in both of those departments.",
    "It\u2019s always useful to define what you need, and what you can offer, but be aware that you may have to compromise on many of these aspects if you want to land the right candidate \u2013 flexibility is important.",
    "Once you\u2019ve defined the role and what you can bring for the table, you\u2019ll be in a far stronger position when you need to write the job description.",
    "Your job description must be detailed and accurate \u2013 and if you\u2019ve listed the duties and responsibilities of the role, you\u2019ll be able to tick those boxes easily. Make sure you include how you\u2019ll measure success, and give plenty of information about your company culture, the job\u2019s salary, and benefits.",
    "The job description needs to have a good balance of information: you\u2019ve got to give people enough information but make sure it\u2019s still tempting to potential candidates who don\u2019t meet all your requirements.",
    "Consider the language you use, too. Your job posting must be compelling and attractive, so it\u2019s worth using active, straightforward, and friendly language that avoids buzzwords and meaningless jargon.",
    "If you want to attract the best candidates, then you\u2019ve got to post your job advert in the best places. That doesn\u2019t just mean the big, traditional job sites.",
    "Obviously, you do need to post your vacancy on sites like Indeed, Monster and LinkedIn. Sites like that do form the backbone of the employment market, so you need to use them, but they\u2019re not the only avenue.",
    "You should post to niche job boards and websites that are specific to your industry \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to find switched-on candidates. List the job on your company\u2019s careers page, too, and share your job vacancy across your firm\u2019s social media profiles.",
    "Ultimately, you want to cast your net as widely as possible if you want the best chance of finding good employees \u2013 and that means using different methods rather than the same old sites.",
    "Your current staff are a brilliant resource when it comes to finding the right employee for your vacancy.",
    "If you have a referral program, then your staff can point you towards likely candidates so you can make contact and see if they\u2019d be interested. It\u2019s important to make sure your staff are rewarded for this, too, so they\u2019re incentivized to go the extra mile and recommend potential applicants.",
    "Also list open vacancies on your company\u2019s intranet. The right employee for the new job might be just under your nose and you may not even realize it.",
    "Once you\u2019ve listed your vacancy then you\u2019re bound to get loads of applications and resumes. If you take time to examine those documents at this stage of the process, then you\u2019ll get a better shortlist of candidates and save time later.",
    "It\u2019s a given that you need to explore a candidate\u2019s past experience in order to see if they\u2019re suitable for the job, but that\u2019s not all you need to evaluate.",
    "If you give resumes a closer read then you can find out more about a candidate\u2019s hard and soft skills, their personality and their strengths and weakness. That means you\u2019ll be in a better position too judge which candidates you should invite for an interview.",
    "This is a simple tip: don\u2019t just get one reference for applicants. If you can get two or three references then you\u2019ll be able to get different perspectives on the candidate, which means you can develop a more rounded and balanced picture about their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Crucially, if you get several references then you\u2019ve also got a better chance of verifying the truth of what they\u2019ve put on their resume.",
    "It\u2019s not just about references. Virtually every applicant for an open position will have a LinkedIn profile that you can use to authenticate the work history, education, and skills that they\u2019ve included on their resume.",
    "Don\u2019t stop there. See if they\u2019ve got public Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram profiles, because a person\u2019s social media can reveal plenty about their personality and values. When you want to hire people who will fit with your company culture and your current employees, that\u2019s critical.",
    "The interview is one of the most important aspects of the recruitment process, so it pays to pay plenty of attention here.",
    "Make sure you ask questions about a candidate\u2019s experience and skills, and you\u2019ve got to test them on their knowledge of your company. Remember that open-ended and hypothetical questions are useful because you can analyze answers, glean insights on people\u2019s personalities and evaluate many of their soft skills.",
    "You can ask creative and unexpected questions to get similar results, and ultimately you\u2019ll get a better insight into a person\u2019s adaptability, curiosity and willingness to work, learn, and develop.",
    "Ask all of your interviewees the same questions so you can compare their answers, and pay attention to the questions that they ask you, too.",
    "Consider giving interviewees a tour of your workplace so you can see how they behave around people and away from the interview room, and get second and third opinions on the candidates when the interview is over \u2013 more input is always useful.",
    "When you\u2019ve been through all of these stages then you should be ready to make an offer to the best candidate.",
    "You need to ensure that your offer letter is professional, clear, and concise \u2013 you want this part of the process to be straightforward. Make it friendly and personable, too, so candidates know that you\u2019re excited for them to join the business.",
    "Making a job offer may not be that simple, though. There\u2019s no guarantee that the candidate will accept, or that they\u2019ll be happy with the compensation and benefits you\u2019ve offered. Be prepared for some negotiation and accept that you\u2019ll have to be flexible if you want to hire the right employee.",
    "The recruitment process is not static, and it\u2019s never perfect \u2013 and the best recruitment and HR staff recognize those facts.",
    "You should set time aside to analyze your recruitment process after every new hire so you can see what went well and what needs improvement. Ask everyone who\u2019s been involved in the process for their feedback so you can gather a wider range of opinions.",
    "It\u2019s worth performing some competitive analysis to make sure that your salary and benefits packages are still impressive when compared to your rivals, and ensure that you\u2019ve got a slick onboarding process so that new hires always feel welcome.",
    "The recruitment process is undoubtedly complicated and time-consuming, but there are plenty of smart ways to ensure that you hire the right employees for your business. Start here, consider these tips, and you\u2019ll never look back.",
