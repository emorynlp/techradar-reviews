    "In the slew of games announced during the Square Enix Presents Spring 2021 showcase, a few new mobile games in development were teased, including new Hitman and Just Cause titles.",
    "Sadly, we didn\u2019t get any release date information, but the trailers did give us a look at what\u2019s coming for the mobile entries in the major game franchises, which will be available on iOS and Android.",
    "Hitman Sniper Assassins is a follow-up to the Hitman: Sniper mobile game released in 2015, though it\u2019s unclear how much the new game will follow the latter\u2019s shooting gallery-like gameplay. Sniper Assassins will have a \u2018wholly original Hitman story, with new playable assassins and brand-new gameplay features,\u2019 according to the trailer\u2019s description.",
    "Just Cause: Mobile will be a free-to-play third-person shooter with single-player and multiplayer components. While the cinematic trailer didn\u2019t show off gameplay, the description did suggest you\u2019ll run into series regulars Rico Rodriguez and Annika Svensson, who will provide missions and intel.",
    "Lastly, Square Enix brought an old favorite out with a new twist: a Space Invaders AR mobile game is coming to smartphones. While there\u2019s no release date yet, anyone interested can sign up on the website to partake in playtests.",
    "As the trailer and \u2018AR\u2019 description suggest, this looks like a game you\u2019ll head into the streets to play, though we haven\u2019t the foggiest idea how it will work. Hopefully things will go smoother than the last time 8-bit Space Invader-esque art appeared in public and panicked the city of Boston.",
    "These look to be fun new titles in Square Enix\u2019s forecast of mobile games. While the publisher has released plenty of smartphone games in the past, including the lauded Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go, among a legion of Final Fantasy games, its upcoming releases seem to have more advanced and new console-like graphics.",
    "Also coming this year is Final Fantasy VII First Soldier, a battle royale game set before the events of the classic game that pit player vs. player vs. iconic FF enemies (bombs and Ifrits and Shivas, oh my), all on mobile:",
    "And coming in 2022 is Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, a mobile \u2018just the highlights\u2019 version of the game much like the mobile version of Final Fantasy XV. Even though it\u2019s abridged, it will still feature moments from the entire Final Fantasy VII gaming timeline, including Crisis Core, Dirge of Cerberus, and other spinoff media."
