    "Dell XPS deals can save you up to $700 right now, with some hefty discounts sitting across a range of premium configurations. That's not all, though. We're seeing prices on some powerful machines dropping as low as $899.99 right now. That's a $450 saving on the touchscreen Dell XPS 13, and things get even better once you take a look at the full spec sheet.",
    "With a 10th generation i7 processor at the helm you're not getting Intel's latest chip here, but there's plenty of power in the hexacore CPU. Combine that with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and the InfinityEdge touchscreen panel and the fantastic value of this Dell XPS deal shines through.",
    "However, if you're going for the big bucks savings, this 2-in-1 Dell XPS 13 is the way to go. A $700 discount brings the final price of this convertible laptop down to $1,399.99 from a $2,099.99 MSRP. That's a lot of cash staying in the bank, and while you're keeping the 10th gen i7 processor and 16GB RAM here, you're upgrading your storage to 1TB. We usually see these 2-in-1 configurations carrying a hefty premium, so getting additional flexibility features in here really pays off as well.",
