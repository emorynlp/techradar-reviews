    "If you\u2019re in the market for a Sony Xperia 5 II then so far outside Asia your color options have been limited to black, blue, or grey \u2013 and not everywhere even has the grey version, but soon you might be able to buy it in pink too.",
    "That\u2019s because a pink shade which previously was exclusive to Asia is now being sold in Sony\u2019s German, Italian, and Spanish online stores.",
    "So far it\u2019s not available in other regions like the US or the UK, but the fact that the pink shade has made it out of Asia suggests it might only be a matter of time.",
    "There\u2019s also an extra bonus for buyers of the Sony Xperia 5 II in pink, as currently it comes bundled with the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds at no extra cost. Usually these retail for $230 / \u00a3220 / AU$399, so that\u2019s quite a saving, and we awarded them five stars in our review.",
    "Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee that these earbuds will be included with the pink Xperia 5 II in other regions if and when it lands in them, but there\u2019s a good chance they will.",
    "Still, with or without the earbuds the Sony Xperia 5 II is worth buying \u2013 we awarded it four and a half stars in our review, praising its great cameras, easy-to-use design, and 120Hz screen.",
    "And once the pink model goes global (if it does) we\u2019ll just be waiting for the purple version of the Sony Xperia 5 II, which is currently exclusive to Japan.",
