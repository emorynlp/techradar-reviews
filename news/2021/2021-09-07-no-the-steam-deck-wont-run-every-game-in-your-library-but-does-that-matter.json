    "Many of us are getting very excited about the Steam Deck, the upcoming handheld game console from Valve that will allow us to play PC games while on the go, but we\u2019ve been getting conflicting information about how many games the Steam Deck will be able to run.",
    "As RockPaperShotGun reports, a recent interview with Valve\u2019s Pierre-Loup Griffais for IGN appears to have been misinterpreted by some over-eager corners of the internet, with the line \u201cAll the games we wanted to be playable is, really, the entire Steam library. We haven't really found something we could throw at this device that it couldn't handle,\u201d making people think that this means the Steam Deck would be able to play any game in Steam\u2019s vast library.",
    "However, according to James B. Ramey, CodeWeaver\u2019s president, that quote doesn\u2019t mean that every game on Steam will actually be playable on the Steam Deck \u2013 at least, initially.",
    "First of all, while James B. Ramey might not be a name you\u2019re familiar with, he should have a pretty good idea of what can and can\u2019t be run on the Steam Deck, as CodeWeaver worked with Vale to co-develop Proton, the software compatibility layer that means the Linux-based Steam Deck can run Windows 10 games \u2013 which the vast majority of Steam games are.",
    "In a chat on the Boiling Steam podcast, Ramey explains that \u201cwhen Pierre-Loup made his announcement and stated that the Steam Deck can support any and all games\u2026 I think he was trying to state that the device itself, the hardware specs on this device, can support any game.\u201d",
    "So, while the Steam Deck\u2019s hardware should be powerful enough to run any game on Steam \u2013 an impressive feat in itself \u2013 when the device launches there may still be titles that won\u2019t run on it, as the Proton compatibility may not be there.",
    "This clarification makes a lot of sense. There are a huge amount of games on Steam, so not every title will be tested to run via Proton. If there are issues, then that could mean the game won\u2019t be playable on the Steam Deck when it launches.",
    "This news isn\u2019t that bad, however. Because it\u2019s a software issue, not a hardware one, it means it could be relatively easy to fix with patches along the way. As Ramey explains, \u201cthere is a lot of effort being poured into Proton to support a broader range of games even that is available then currently today. So you\u2019re going to see that when the Steam Deck is released and Proton is put on the Steam Deck that there is going to be a greater number of titles that are supported.\u201d",
    "This means that while there may be some games that won\u2019t run at first, they could be patched to run later on. If this had been an issue with the hardware, then that would have been a lot harder to fix.",
    "So, there\u2019s a good chance that the Steam Deck will run your favorite games when it launches. The list of games playable on Linux via Proton is steadily growing, and the Steam Deck\u2019s launch will likely spur this on. If there\u2019s a game that can\u2019t be run, then hopefully Proton compatibility will be added at some point.",
    "We\u2019ve also heard from Valve that the Steam Deck will run like a PC, and that means allowing users to install other operating systems. So, if a game won\u2019t run on the Steam Deck\u2019s Steam OS Linux distribution, you could always install Windows 10 on it, which in theory would fix any compatibility issues.",
    "So, this news may not be as bad as it first seems. It certainly hasn\u2019t dimmed our excitement for the Steam Deck."
