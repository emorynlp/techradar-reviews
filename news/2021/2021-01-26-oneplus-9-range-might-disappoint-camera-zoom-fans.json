    "One of the major camera upgrades we\u2019ve started seeing on phones is a move to periscope lenses, which can typically zoom a lot further than conventional telephoto ones. But it looks like the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro probably won\u2019t include a periscope camera.",
    "That\u2019s according to Max Jambor (a leaker with a reasonable track record) who said as much in a Tweet.",
    "While we\u2019d always take leaks with a pinch of salt, this isn\u2019t the first time the lack of a periscope camera has been rumored. Plus, we\u2019ve seen unofficial renders of both the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro, and in neither case did they look to include a periscope camera (which typically has a square-looking lens).",
    "This doesn\u2019t mean the OnePlus 9 range won\u2019t offer optical zoom \u2013 it\u2019s likely that the OnePlus 9 Pro at the very least will probably have a telephoto camera, given that previous Pro models do (though the standard OnePlus 9 might not). But it does mean the optical zoom range will probably be less than if it had a periscope.",
    "For example, while the telephoto camera on the OnePlus 8 Pro sports 3x optical zoom, the periscope camera on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra allows for 10x optical zoom. So if you want to zoom in to distant objects the OnePlus 9 range might not be for you \u2013 though these phones will also almost certainly undercut Samsung\u2019s top flagship in terms of price.",
    "But we won\u2019t be certain of anything about the OnePlus 9 range until OnePlus itself confirms the details, which handily it probably will do before too long, as based on past form we\u2019d expect the new models to land in April or May \u2013 and probably be extensively teased ahead of that.",
