  "article": [
    "The end of 2021 is nearly upon us and we've been treated to a wide range of Samsung TVs this year \u2013 from its premium 4K and 8K QLEDs to its more budget-friendly smaller QLEDs.",
    "We\u2019ve also received refreshes of its Samsung The Frame TV that looks like a painting (now significantly slimmer) and its outdoor TVs with Samsung The Terrace. If you\u2019re on a budget, there\u2019s a new Samsung TV for you too with the 32-inch Q50A QLED screen. It might only have an FHD picture (1920 x 1080 pixels) but it\u2019s packed with HDR10+ and Samsung\u2019s QLED tech to keep you happy.",
    "There's not much time left this year, but there's still a chance we could see a sneak launch before 2022 arrives.",
    "Either way, 2022 should mean we finally see Samsung\u2019s quantum OLED panels, rumored to be launching next year. Multiple industry insiders have confirmed that they\u2019re set to release in 2022, boasting all the benefits of OLED panels (deep blacks, infinite contrast, flexible panels) and Samsung\u2019s quantum dot filters (used to enhance color and contrast).",
    "While we can\u2019t say for certain, it could mean that Samsung\u2019s 2022 displays will be a significant step up from what\u2019s come before - along with a significant price increase too most likely. If you\u2019re in the market for a new TV, it might be worth waiting a while longer to see what quantum OLED panels could add to your home cinema experience.",
    "Just don\u2019t expect any of its TVs to launch with Dolby Vision support on Samsung TVs; it looks like the brand is sticking to its own HDR10+ format for now.",
    "Generally, Samsung\u2019s 2021 prices have been fairly reasonable too. Sure you\u2019ll be paying a fair amount for the QN900 and QN800 8K QLEDs that are now shipping in the US, but their price tags match last year's sets, and so far nothing this year will be as astronomical in price as 2020's 85-inch Q950TS.",
    "We still don\u2019t have any public info on the pricing of Samsung\u2019s latest Micro LED display, The Wall, despite it being for sale. The version that was released in 2020 sold for an exceptionally steep price of $156,000 (around \u00a3113,000 or AU$210,000) so expect something similar if your business is trying to budget for one of these screens.",
    "For now, you can read more information on the new sets released in 2021, including pricing details for the 4K and 8K ranges below. We'll update this page as we find out more about the pricing and release information for the rest of the sets in Samsung\u2019s range too.",
    "The rest of this list highlights the latest and greatest TVs Samsung has released in 2021, though with some options costing several $1000s we know they won't suit every budget. While we haven't been able to review this offering, it is new in 2021 and could be just what your home cinema needs without having to break the bank.",
    "Samsung Q50A QLED HD TV 2021 (32-inch): If you're in the UK and want to experience Samsung's splendid HDR10+ format (powered by its bright QLED technology) this is an exceptionally affordable option priced at just \u00a3499.",
    "There are some downsides though, a big one being that you can only achieve an FHD image (1080p) rather than 4K. On a smaller 32-inch display like this that might not be the most noticeable issue, but it is one to be aware of.",
    "We would argue that you might be better off with Samsung's The Frame at this price, but if you're after a plain and simple TV without any gimmicks, take a look at the Q50A on Samsung's website.",
    "Samsung QN900A Neo 8K QLED TV (65, 75, 85-inch): The Samsung QN900A is the top-of-the-line Samsung 8K display in 2021. It features the Infinity Display that offers an edge-to-edge image with no bezel and a metal chassis. It uses Samsung\u2019s OTS Pro sound for built-in 6.2.2-channel surround sound, and of course the 8K Quantum Processor. It starts at $4,999 for a 65-inch model (around \u00a33,600 / $AU6,500), which is exactly what last year's Q900TS started at when it launched \u2013 and it started shipping to US shoppers in March 13.",
    "Read our full Samsung QN900 8K QLED TV review",
    "Samsung QN800A Neo 8K QLED TV (65, 75, 85-inch): The QN800A has incredibly thin bezels, though Samsung's matrixing technology that reduces the gap between where the pixels end and bezel begins is exclusive to the company's top-of-the-line Samsung Neo QN900A TV QLED 8K TV. Still, the QN800A does have ultra-wide viewing angle support that you don\u2019t get on the QN700A, and that\u2019s relatively crucial if you\u2019re thinking about going any larger than 65-inches.",
    "It's starting at $3,499 (around \u00a32,500 / AU$4,500) for its smallest size, a small increase over the $3,199 starting price of last year's Q800TS.",
    "Read our hands on Samsung QN800 8K QLED TV review",
    "Samsung QN700A Neo 8K QLED TV (55, 65, 75-inch): The Samsung QN700A Series will return in 2021 with a new version of the Q700T that made its debut last year. It\u2019s still the entry-level 8K model this year, but it will see the benefit of the Mini LED backlights and the 8K Quantum Processor. You\u2019ll still get the ultra-widescreen game mode, and VRR support, but it is missing a few step-up features that you\u2019ll find in the QN800A.",
    "Read more: Is Samsung's cheapest 8K QLED TV worth buying?",
    "Samsung QN90A / QN95A Neo QLED TV (55, 65, 75, 85-inch): Turning to 4K TVs, the head honcho is the new Samsung QN90A Neo QLED. The variation of Mini LED technology that it uses means that this year\u2019s model will suffer from even less blooming than in prior years, and it should reach a slightly higher peak brightness level thanks to the greater density of LEDs. On top of that, the new Quantum Processor redirects power to where it\u2019s needed on the screen for brighter HDR highlights and better local dimming, plus Samsung says that there\u2019s also black level data boost to bring out more details in dark areas. An ultra-bright QLED that handles black levels like an OLED? We can\u2019t wait to see it in person.",
    "It'll start at $1,799 (around \u00a31,300 / AU$2,300) for a 55-inch model, and go up to $4,999 (around \u00a33,500 / AU$6,300) for an 85-inch model. There is a QN95A iteration in the UK that adds the new Slim One Connect box, but likely won't be available in the US.",
    "Read all about it in our Samsung QN95A Neo QLED TV review",
    "Samsung QN85A Neo QLED TV (55, 65, 75, 85-inch): This step-down model is still a Neo QLED 8K TV with a Mini LED backlight \u2013 but differentiates from the QN80A QLED below in featuring the Slim One Connect box being introduced in this year's new Samsung TV range, as well as packing a Neo QLED processor. It'll start at $1,599 (around \u00a31,100 / AU$2,000) for a 55-inch size, and go up to $4,499 (around $3,200 / AU$5,700) for an 85-inch size.",
    "Samsung Q80A QLED TV (55, 65, 75, 85-inch): If the QN90A is a bit too far out of reach, Samsung will be making a successor to the moderately affordable Samsung Q80T that we saw in 2020 with the Samsung Q80A. It's a bit cheaper than the Neo QLED above at $1,299 (around \u00a3900 / AU$1,650) for a 55-inch size, thanks to a lower-spec processor and the lack of any One Connect box \u2013 but you get a booming 60W audio output.",
    "Samsung Q70A QLED TV (55, 65, 75, 85-inch): The Q70A QLED offers a 120Hz panel and 4K resolution, and comes with Samsung's existing Quantum 4K processor. You are seeing a big drop in audio, though, with only 20W output, and two-channel audio rather than 2.2. It starts at $949 (around \u00a3700 / AU$1,200) for a 55-inch size and tops out at $2,999 (around \u00a32,100 / AU$3,800) for an 85-inch size.",
    "Samsung Q60A Neo QLED TV (55, 65, 75, 85-inch): As the cheapest QLED in this year's range, and the successor to last year's Q60T, the Q60A is sure to get attention from savvy buyers \u2013 especially because of how many sizing options are available, with everything from a 43-inch ($549, or around \u00a3400 / AU$700) to an 85-inch ($2,599, around \u00a31,850 / AU$3,300) size. It makes use of a Quantum Processor Lite, 20W audio, and a pared-down OTS Lite audio technology.",

    "Samsung AU9000 (screen sizes TBD): Samsung\u2019s Crystal UHD TV lineup will return in 2021 with two new models, the AU9000 and AU8000. Both models will feature a slimmer chassis than last year\u2019s models from around 59mm to 25mm in depth, and a dynamic refresh technology to make a native 60Hz refresh rate seem like a 120Hz panel thanks to Motion XCelerator Turbo. You\u2019ll also get AMD FreeSync on 60Hz TVs.",
    "Samsung AU8000 (screen sizes TBD): The Samsung AU8000 Series is the cheapest Samsung TV we know about in 2021. It\u2019s definitely going to be a native 60Hz TV with 4K support and it will probably use a basic quad-core processor. That said, if you\u2019re after the cheapest new Samsung TV, the AU8000 will be the one to keep an eye out for.",
    "Samsung The Wall 2021 (88-inch, 99-inch, 110-inch): Samsung says that this is the year its MicroLED TV tech \u201ccomes home\u201d. We\u2019ve seen various iterations of The Wall over the years, all of them carrying huge price tags and at sizes almost no-one can fit in their home \u2013 but that looks set to change this year. The cost is unconfirmed, but at a smallest 88-inch size, it\u2019s certainly more realistic a proposition than ever before. The set will even be able to split its picture into four distinct screens for multi-channel viewing, and we\u2019re excited to see exactly what this feature can do.",
    "Samsung The Frame 2021 (43, 50, 55, 65, 75-inch): There\u2019s a new iteration of Samsung\u2019s fashion-forward Frame TV, which apes the style of a picture frame and offers up to 14,000 artworks in a dedicated Art Store (for paid subscribers) to make sure your TV\u2019s looking good even when you\u2019re not watching Netflix.",
    "This year\u2019s model is a lot slimmer, at just 24.9mm thick, with a host of new customization / bezel options and a tripod TV stand option. The 43-inch model is said to work in a portrait orientation too, but we\u2019re not expecting the mechanical rotations of the Samsung Sero here.",
    "The pricing is pretty much the same as last year's model. You're paying an identical $999 for a 43-inch size for both the 2020 and 2021 iterations, while the $1,299 50-inch model, $1,499 55-inch model, and $1,999 65-inch model are only an additional $100 over their predecessors. The largest 75-inch size, too, is $2,999, a small step up from the $2,799 price tag of the 2020 model.",
    "There's no 32-inch size confirmed just yet, though you do have the option of the 2020 iteration for a more compact size.",
    "Samsung The Terrace 2021 (55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch): Samsung The Terrace is the first outdoor TV to come from the world\u2019s biggest TV maker, and it isn\u2019t just a tick-box weatherproof screen that won\u2019t get wrecked if you\u2019re watching a film in the rain. The Terrace is Samsung acknowledging that people like to use their devices outside of traditional living room arrangements.",
    "The outdoor TV experience won't come cheap though, as it starts off at $3,499 / \u00a33,999 / AU$5,199 for the 55-inch size, and stretches up to $6,499 / \u00a36,499 / AU$9,499 for the 75-inch model. AT this price you'd expect a lot and we're not entirely convinced it's worth the cost of admission.",
    "We don't feel we've spent enough time with it to give The Terrace a TechRadar full review, but our hands-on impressions so far have been mixed. The QLED display (with its 2,000 nits of brightness and anti-glare layer) offers decent viewing even in the midday morning sun. However, the audio of the standard speaker is quite disappointing, especially at this price.",
    "While most years offer a boost in contrast here and a new upscaling algorithm there, Samsung\u2019s 2021 Neo QLED lineup is actually the biggest step forward for the South Korean electronics maker in the last five years. What Neo QLED promises is smaller LED backlights \u2013 similar but not quite identical to \u2013 the MiniLED technology Samsung uses in The Wall.",
    "Because the LEDs are clustered closer together, Neo QLED TVs promise radically increased brightness, reduced blooming and wider viewing angles. In tandem with a built-in light sensor and upgraded Quantum Processor, a Neo QLED TV can redirect power at the drop of a hat, boosting bright HDR highlights in one part of the screen, while dropping other parts to near-black.",
    "Although the resulting image will never quite have the same contrast OLED TVs have (with their self-emissive pixels), Neo QLED TVs will hit 100% color volume for DCI-P3, and have a higher peak brightness overall \u2013 so expect them to be super bright and colorful.",
    "On the software side of things, Samsung is upgrading Tizen to better meld with our new work-from-home lifestyles. For starters, it\u2019s adding remote access will allow you to browse your office PC from your home Samsung TV, and when it\u2019s time to relax with family and friends, you\u2019ll be able to do Google Duo calling straight on your smart TV by attaching an HD webcam.",
    "What gamers will appreciate is that all the new Neo QLED TVs shown so far support 4K/120 gameplay with VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync) as well as ALLM. Samsung says the TVs average 9.8ms input lag and HGiG if you connect your PC. Two final neat features for gamers are the 32:9 aspect ratio mode which, on a 65-inch TV, is about 59-inches across and wider than the largest ultra widescreen gaming monitor, plus a new Game Bar that displays real-time FPS and input lag.",
    "We have yet to hear much in the way of new chassis design, but Samsung is touting a few of the improvements it\u2019s made to Object-Tracking Sound technology that adds two additional tweeters for enhanced dialogue and an active voice amplifier that measures ambient noise in the environment and raises the mids to audible levels. These are small features and will only be available in the highest-end models, but they\u2019re worth noting all the same.",
    "In terms of aesthetics, there\u2019s a new 2021 model of the OneConnect box, called the Slim One Connect Box. This outsources all of your HDMI, power inputs and the like into a piece of hardware separate from the TV, preventing a mess of cables hanging down from your new display. This newest model is a slimmer, more compact version of the One Connect Box we\u2019ve seen over the past few years, with updated connections and a new form factor \u2013 along with the ability to attach it to the back of a TV stand.",
    "Looking further ahead, rumors suggest that Samsung OLED TVs could be on the way. A new report from Korea IT News (via CNET) is saying that the world's largest TV maker could make the move to OLED \u2013 or at least a kind of OLED \u2013 as soon as next year.",
