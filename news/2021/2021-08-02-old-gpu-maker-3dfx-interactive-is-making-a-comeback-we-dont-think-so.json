    "3dfx Interactive, a long-gone GPU manufacturer that was big in the 1990s, is poised to return to the world of graphics cards later this week, going by a tweet that has just been spotted. However, this is one we aren\u2019t buying (though, that said, it\u2019s not that we wouldn\u2019t love to see such a comeback).",
    "This comes from a brand new Twitter account for 3dfx Interactive which purports to be the \u2018official Twitter handle for 3dfx\u2019, but it\u2019s not verified, and, of course, could be pretty much anyone making this all up. The central claim being that on August 5, in just a few days\u2019 time, 3dfx is \u201ccoming back\u201d with what should be a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d.",
    "So, where to start with all the shakiness around this particular rumor? If this really is an official revelation from the resurrected 3dfx, you\u2019d think it\u2019d be able to manage the fanfare \u2018returning to the GPU game\u2019 tweet without making a glaring error (namely \u2018an\u2019 major announcement, instead of \u2018a\u2019 major announcement).",
    "You\u2019d also expect the firm to use an image to accompany this announcement which isn\u2019t simply a piece of fanart (taken from DeviantArt, and it\u2019s seriously old too). Apparently the budget can\u2019t stretch to a freshly commissioned pic and a proof-reader, which seems unlikely.",
    "If there really is a new graphics card coming from 3dfx later this week, we\u2019ll hold our hands up and admit to being fully wrong, but little-to-nothing about this stands up to any scrutiny.",
    "Naturally, we have to be cautious around any rumor, but offerings from the mill such as this one very much underline that. It\u2019s not even clear that there\u2019s anything left for 3dfx to come back with, certainly not in terms of the IP which Nvidia bought up two decades ago. There is some discussion on Twitter about Team Green letting ownership of the trademark of the name lapse, mind.",
    "Another possibility floated is that the 3dfx brand is somehow coming back, just maybe not with a graphics card, but some other product. Although even that doesn\u2019t seem like a realistic possibility, given that a follow-up tweet asks gamers out there: \u201cYou all wanna see a new 3dfx Voodoo card?\u201d So clearly, this is supposedly about GPUs.",
    "Of course, even if we allow the theoretical possibility that 3dfx is re-joining the graphics card arena, the timing really couldn\u2019t be worse. Remember that AMD and Nvidia (mostly the latter) have a stranglehold on the market, are apparently pushing ahead with seriously impressive next-gen products, and Intel is soon enough to join the fight to make it even trickier for another party to get in on the act.",
    "Everything about this seems like a stretch, and it very much feels like somebody out there saw the fake Interplay revival tweet last week, which caused quite a stir and a lot of excitement, and had a brainwave to jump on the bandwagon and grab their 15 minutes \u2013 or, er, 5 days rather \u2013 of Twitter infamy.",
