    "Looking for a new tablet but can\u2019t find a decent deal? We have some good news. Apple\u2019s 2020 iPad Air 4 is now on sale for just $499.99 at Amazon. This 4th generation model has a usual retail price of $599.99, and this new iPad deal is one of the best we\u2019ve seen yet.",
    "This current offer on the iPad Air 4 is the cheapest we\u2019ve seen the device drop to. The iPad Air 4 comes in five different colors but due to popular demand, only the Green and Space Gray are currently on sale. This deal is proving popular as it is out of immediate stock right now, however, you are able to order for early August delivery at Amazon.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a newer, more powerful device with greater storage and a slightly larger display, we are also seeing some great iPad Pro deals. For just $749 (was $799) at Amazon, you can save $50 on the 2021 Apple iPad Pro 11-inch in both Silver and Space Gray. This is also a new record-low price for this newly released iPad Pro, so it's worth checking out if you don't mind the extra cost.",

    "Apple\u2019s iPad Air is often compared to the more expensive iPad Pro range, but the iPad Air 4 is a great contender if you\u2019re after a new tablet. For a cheaper price and a slightly smaller screen, Apple\u2019s iPad Air 4 features both a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display and the powerful in-built A14 chipset which allows for running multiple apps and streaming high-quality video.
