    "While the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is sure to be an upgrade on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 in lots of ways, it might be a downgrade in two, with a smaller screen and battery rumored.",
    "This comes from The Elec, which claims that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will have a 7.5-inch main screen and a 6.2-inch cover display. That\u2019s ever so slightly down from 7.6 inches and 6.23 inches respectively on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.",
    "Not a massive difference then, but one which will apparently also lead to a smaller 4,380mAh battery in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, down from 4,500mAh in the Z Fold 2.",
    "With both elements shrinking it\u2019s unlikely that the battery life will be much worse in this model, and it\u2019s a change that Samsung is apparently making to increase the portability of the phone. Though you\u2019d think buyers who want a more portable handset would opt for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, or a non-foldable phone.",
    "In any case, this is just a rumor for now, so it may not turn out to be true. We might not find out for a while either, as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is also rumored to not be landing until July.",
    "But if the screen does end up being smaller than the Galaxy Z Fold 2\u2019s, or you just want an even bigger display, there\u2019s always \u2013 depending on where you live, as it's not available everywhere \u2013 the Huawei Mate X2, which sports a similar design to the Z Fold range, but with a larger 8-inch screen.",
