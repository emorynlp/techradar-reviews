    "MacBook deals have been offering up some excellent prices across the board over the last few weeks, but if you don't need the power of the latest M1 MacBook Air or Pro, you'll find even lower prices available on the lower generation. B&H Photo has just launched a range of MacBook Air deals, with up to $300 off last 2020's Intel release up for grabs.",
    "The biggest saving sits on this 512GB model. Perfect for storing and using larger media files, or simply keeping all your documents and apps loaded on one machine, the i5 processor and 8GB RAM will keep everything feeling smooth and fast. Previously sitting at $1,349, it's now available for $1,049 at B&H Photo. That's $200 less than the M1 version, which currently sits at $1,249.",
    "However, the MacBook Air deal that will get most people excited is this 256GB, i5 model. It's just $30 more than the entry level i3 version right now, and that $929 price tag marks an excellent departure from the $1,000+ costs we're used to seeing.",
    "Sure, the M1 MacBook Air is considerably more powerful, with that new processor blowing critics and users away with its speed. However, if you don't need a blitzingly fast processor, you'll find the exact same luxury design here on the previous generation. Plus, with MacBook Air deals slashing these prices you'll find more storage options open to you at a lower cost as well.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more MacBook deals in your region.",
    "If you're looking for something with a more powerful baseline, you might want to take a look at the latest MacBook Pro deals. Or, if you're looking for more flexibility, iPad Pro deals can offer plenty of power in a tablet device that will easily replace a laptop as well. Of course, you'll find plenty more cheap laptop deals on the web this week as well."
