    "Cricket's new 100-ball format has been utterly enthralling, elevating players into household names and introducing the sport to a much wider audience. And today the first winners of the inaugural The Hundred will be crowned at the Home of Cricket, Lord's. Will it be a clean sweep for the Southern Brave? Read on to discover how to get a 2021 The Hundred final live stream and watch the cricket online no matter where in the world you are - including ways to see it absolutely FREE.",
    "The Brave are the team to beat in the women's final and, though they've had to let Smriti Mandhana go, they've got two more of the tournament's outstanding batters in Sophia Dunkley and Maia Bouchier, while Amanda-Jade Wellington and Anya Shrubsole top some of the bowling charts.",
    "They face Dane van Niekerk's Oval Invincibles, who opened the tournament a month ago and pulled off a remarkable backs-to-the-wall win over the Birmingham Phoenix in yesterday's Eliminator.",
    "The Birmingham Phoenix are favourites in the men's final, and will be led out by Moeen Ali who's been released from England duty to captain his team. Liam Livingstone's provided highlights aplenty both on and off the pitch, and he'll hope to catch fire once more against the hotly tipped Southern Brave, who crushed the Trent Rockets last night.",
    "It's an enormously exciting moment, so watch all the drama unfold as it happens by following our 2021 The Hundred live stream guide to watch the men's and women's cricket finals online today.",
    "If you're abroad when The Hundred final is on, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic cricket coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred The Hundred live stream. It's a very affordable workaround and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a cricket live stream from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to BBC iPlayer or Sky Go"
