    "Niantic has updated the iOS app of Pok\u00e9mon Go to make better use of native frame rates on iPhone \u2013 and the results are gorgeous.",
    "The latest update (version 1.191.0) allow players to move past the 30fps frame rate that the iOS app was previously limited to \u2013 unlocking the potential of 60Hz or even 120Hz screens on the latest iPhones.",
    "If you're playing Pok\u00e9mon Go on iOS, you'll want to head to the advanced settings in the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, and select \u201cUnlock your device\u2019s native refresh rate for higher FPS.\u201d",
    "While a frame rate boost for Pok\u00e9mon Go doesn't sound like a game-changing move, early responses from players seem overwhelmingly positive.",
    "Players are reporting on social media that \"the game now runs buttery smooth on my iPhone 11\", with some praising the improvements while admitting \"it will probably make it the battery deplete faster\" \u2013 so it's worth weighing up whether the frame rate enhancement is worth it for you.",
    "If you're playing Pok\u00e9mon Go out and about, you may want to conserve that battery, after all, though some experimentation here is likely a good idea \u2013 some iPhones will fare better for battery life than others.",
    "Basically, the frame rate is the number of frames inserted in a single second. Relatively few frames would look a bit like a slide presentation, jumping from one image to the other; a lot of frames gives a fluid feel to motion, and moving between frames too fast to focus on them individually. The more frames there are, the smoother the image feels.",
    "There's a reason gamers so often decry 30fps performance in PC or console games, compared to the improved 60fps standard \u2013 having twice the amount of frames makes for a very different, higher-quality experience. And while Pok\u00e9mon Go isn't a fast-paced shooter, the upgrade should still make the game feel nicer to play.",
    "You'll get the most benefit on the latest iPhones \u2013 only the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, which launched in 2021, have a 120Hz refresh rate (which equates to 120fps, or frames per second). Even then, not all apps were able to take advantage of the higher frame rate right away \u2013 because of a software bug, and because many apps need to be individually primed to work with that capability consistently.",
    "However, 60Hz displays are much more common in handsets, so many players should still benefit from a move from 30fps to 60fps by unlocking the feature."
