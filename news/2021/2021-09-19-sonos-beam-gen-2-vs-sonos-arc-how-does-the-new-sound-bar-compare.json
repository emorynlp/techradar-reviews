    "Sonos has announced a new version of its pint-sized soundbar the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) This more budget-friendly option promises a few upgrades over the original, but how does it compare to Sonos\u2019 top-of-the-line soundbar the Sonos Arc?",
    "We\u2019re here to break down the most important factors so you know how the speakers stack up against each other. If you\u2019re in the mood for a new soundbar this is a must-read guide to help you weigh up the soundbars from one of the best speaker makers out there.",
    "Before we dive in we should mention that the new Sonos Beam isn\u2019t out yet (it will be released in October), so we\u2019re basing our assessment on its specs and the performance of similar speakers. Once we\u2019ve had a chance to test the soundbar for ourselves we\u2019ll be sure to let you know if it performs better or worse than we expected.",
    "The Sonos Arc launched at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 but very recently received a price hike to $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,499 for no apparent reason.",
    "The increase in price now means that the Sonos Arc costs roughly double what the new Sonos Beam (Gen 2) will when it launches in October at $449 / \u00a3449 / $699.",
    "We\u2019ve speculated that the price increase on Sonos\u2019 devices could be down to chip shortages that have plagued the tech industry from smartphones to game consoles to computers and now speakers.",
    "Either Sonos is passing the increased cost of components onto consumers or - with more people enjoying their home entertainment than ever and driving sales - the forces of supply and demand are at work and Sonos has raised prices to account for less availability.",
    "We\u2019ve not seen Sonos speakers be as difficult to snag as the PS5 or the best PC graphics cards for now, but stock shortages could possibly be on the way. Until stock shortages do arrive (if they ever do), the availability of both devices should be good, but if you\u2019re desperate for a new soundbar now, the Sonos Arc will serve you well as it has already been released.",
    "The Sonos Beam (Gen 2) and the Sonos Arc are fairly different when it comes to design, with the Beam being a much better option if you\u2019re short on space.",
    "The Sonos Beam upholds the compact nature of its predecessor being just 2.72 x 25.63 x 3.94 inches (H x W x D). This means you shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble finding space for it no matter what your home cinema setup is like.",
    "For the Sonos Arc, you\u2019re going to want a bit more space as it sits at 3.4 x 45 x 4.5 inches (H x W x D). While it is well over a foot longer than the Sonos Beam you should find that it's just shorter than most 55-inch TVs. If you\u2019re rocking a larger display you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems squeezing the Sonos Arc in front of it - but it will be worth double-checking with a tape measure.",
    "Otherwise, you\u2019ll find that both soundbars are made of plastic, with the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) dropping the cloth grille from the original Sonos Beam. This makes both speakers easy to clean and keep free from dust. As for colors, both are only available in either white or black.",
    "The Sonos Arc offers superb audio performance thanks to its eight elliptical woofers and three tweeters that deliver solid bass and crisp highs. The hardware allows the speaker to make the most of its Dolby Atmos codec - which separates sounds into object-based audio tracks - so that once it has been tuned to the room you\u2019ll get a surround sound experience from just a single source.",
    "Right now we can\u2019t speak for the Sonos Beam (Gen2)\u2019s performance as we haven\u2019t tested it, but by taking a look at its specs we can make some predictions.",
    "While the new Beam will also have Dolby Atmos sound, it might not be put to as good use. For one it loses out on some of the hardware in the Sonos Arc (having only one tweeter and four midwoofers), but importantly it isn\u2019t an upfiring speaker. For \u2018true\u2019 Dolby Atmos, you need upfiring speakers that can bounce sound off of the ceiling and back down to your ears (or, even better, ceiling-mounted speakers).",
    "According to Sonos, the new Beam uses \u201cpsychoacoustic techniques\u201d to mimic the effect of upfiring speakers \u2013 something you might hear referred to as virtual Dolby Atmos \u2013 though we\u2019d have to try it out for ourselves to get a feel for how well it works with the Sonos Beam (Gen 2).",
    "Like the original Sonos Beam, the Beam (Gen 2) comes with support for Alexa and Google Assistant, AirPlay 2, and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as an Ethernet port for hardwiring the soundbar to your router. This is all the same for the Sonos Arc too.",
    "However, the Sonos Beam includes a new connectivity feature with its HDMI eARC compatibility. Sonos say this new compatibility will bring a \u201cricher, more immersive, and higher definition sound experience\u201d to the Sonos Beam (Gen 2).",
    "Compared to the HDMI ARC connectivity found on the original Beam and Sonos Arc soundbars, eARC can handle more advanced audio formats and deliver superior audio quality.",
    "As we\u2019ve said with other comparisons we\u2019ll have to try the soundbar out for ourselves to know anything for sure, but we imagine HDMI eARC support won\u2019t give the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) too much of an advantage over the Sonos Arc.",
    "While we don\u2019t yet know for certain how well the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) will perform, it's likely that the Sonos Arc will provide a far better audio experience overall - even without HDMI eARC compatibility.",
    "Really your decision will come down to what your budget is. If you\u2019re wanting a great experience that won\u2019t break the bank, go with the new Sonos Beam that looks set to deliver a powerful performance at half the cost. If the price tag doesn\u2019t put you off though, the Sonos Arc will almost certainly serve your home cinema much better.",
    "And if you\u2019re concerned a new Sonos Beam means a new Arc is coming soon too, you might not have to worry. The original Beam is just over three years old while the Sonos Arc has just hit one. While we don't do anything for certain we reckon you have another year or so before a new version hits shelves.",
    "Not sold on either Sonos device? There are plenty of other brilliant soundbars out there. If you want Dolby Atmos compatibility, check out models such as the Samsung HW-Q950A and the Sony HT-X8500. On a strict budget? The Vizio SB362An-F6 is well worth a look, as is the Sony HT-MT300."
