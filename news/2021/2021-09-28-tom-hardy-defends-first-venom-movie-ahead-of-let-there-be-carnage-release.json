    "Actor Tom Hardy has responded to criticism of the first Venom movie ahead of the release of its sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, on October 15.",
    "In a recent interview with CinemaBlend, Hardy said of 2018\u2019s Venom: \u201cObviously, it didn\u2019t meet\u2026 it didn\u2019t carry any water with critics [...] they literally panned us. But the audiences turned out in droves, which was what was so lovely about it.\u201d",
    "While the actor admitted that Sony\u2019s first Venom instalment \u201cwasn\u2019t [his] vision of the movie\u201d \u2013 \u201cthere were other powers at play in that aspect,\u201d he said \u2013 Hardy described its unexpected box office success as \u201clike watching an underdog be lifted up and enjoyed for what it was.\u201d",
    "Sony\u2019s antihero movie was, as Hardy mentions, near-universally dismissed by critics, but it would go on to rake in an eye-watering $856 million worldwide from a reported budget of around $116 million.",
    "It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the studio commissioned a sequel only a few months after Venom\u2019s release. Venom: Let There Be Carnage will see Hardy reprise his role as the titular symbiote, this time doing battle with Woody Harrelson\u2019s Cletus Kasady (AKA Carnage). Andy Serkis is directing the sequel, while Zombieland's Ruben Fleischer handled the original.",
    "Having wrapped filming on the first Venom movie, Hardy told CinemaBlend he \u201cgot straight on the phone\u201d with Sony to pitch a second, adding that he was \u201creally keen to take what we learned from [the first movie] and get on with writing that second one, to see if we could push it further.\u201d",
    "As for the future of the franchise \u2013 if indeed two films can be considered as such \u2013 it\u2019s no secret that fans, and Hardy himself, are excited by the potential for a crossover movie with Tom Holland's Spider-Man.",
    "Speaking as part of a recent Esquire profile, the actor said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be doing the job if [he] wasn\u2019t awake and open to any opportunity or eventuality or be excited by [the idea of a crossover].\u201d",
    "\"Should both sides be willing, and it be beneficial to both sides, I don\u2019t see why it couldn\u2019t be,\u201d Hardy added. \u201cI hope and strongly, with both hands, push, eagerly, towards that potential, and would do anything to make that happen.\"",
    "In order to make that hope a reality, though, it\u2019s likely that Venom: Let There Be Carnage will need to reach a similar level of box office success as its predecessor.",
    "Interestingly, we also know the upcoming sequel will be one of the shortest comic book movies ever made at just 97 minutes long, which could have consequences \u2013 either positive or negative \u2013 for its critical and commercial reception.",
    "Perhaps, after years of drawn out and overly-long superhero adventures, a movie that places fast-paced action front and center will prove a welcome change."
