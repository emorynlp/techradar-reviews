  "article": [
    "The compromised VPN password that allowed DarkSide operators to get into Colonial Pipeline\u2019s network had been used on multiple websites, according to new insights into the attack.",
    "The revelation was made by Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and CTO at Mandiant, which is the incident response division of cybersecurity firm FireEye that has been roped in to assist with the investigation into Colonial\u2019s ransomware attack.",
    "Carmakar further shared that the password was \u201crelatively complex\u2026.in terms of length, special characters and case set\u201d as he addressed a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on the cyberattack, together with Colonial Pipeline\u2019s CEO, Joseph Blount.",
    "Mandiant had earlier shared that equipped with the password the Colonial attackers wouldn\u2019t have faced much resistance logging into the network, as the VPN account didn\u2019t use multi-factor authentication (MFA).",
    "Security experts have reiterated that using single passwords no longer counts as an effective strategy to prevent break-ins, and are pretty much useless without additional layers of security implemented by the use of MFA.",
    "\u201cEven the strongest, most complex passwords can be found living on the dark web, and without MFA these attacks will continue to occur,\u201d Patrick Tiquet, VP of Security at Keeper Security tells TechRadar Pro.",
    "He further adds that liability, either in the form of a duplicated password or a former employee maintaining account access after departing the company, is around every corner, and that \u201cproper password hygiene is paramount in eliminating occurrences of attacks\u201d like Colonial\u2019s.",
    "From a wider perspective, Tiquet believes that while the new ransomware guidance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) helps businesses respond to a ransomware attack, their focus should still be on proactive protection.",
    "\u201cAdditional effective preventative measures include disabling unnecessary access, isolating networks, keeping current on patches, enforcing least-privileges, and maintaining offline backups of important data,\u201d says Tiquet listing some of the best practices that business should adopt to shield themselves from such attacks."
