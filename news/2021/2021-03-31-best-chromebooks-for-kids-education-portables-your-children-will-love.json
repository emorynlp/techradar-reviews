    "Whether or not the best Chromebooks for kids is better for the budding young minds in your family than the best laptops for kids is you and your children\u2019s decision. The important factors to consider when whittling down your choice to one device, however, stay mostly the same. Chromebooks are essentially laptops, after all; they simply run on a different \u2013 if more lightweight \u2013 operating system, the ChromeOS.",
    "Much like when deciding on the best laptop for your mini-me, the most important factors to consider when picking the best Chromebooks for kids are price, ruggedness, reliability, and longevity. So, don\u2019t just go for the cheapest one you can find. Instead, do your research and choose the most affordable one you can find that boasts a solid build, enough power to see the kids through their schoolwork, and battery life to last a whole school day, if not longer.",
    "If that sounds like too many metrics for you \u2013 whether it\u2019s because you don\u2019t know much about laptops or because you are simply too busy as a parent juggling an endless list of responsibilities \u2013 don\u2019t fret. You can count on us to share our computing wisdom, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. For your perusing pleasure, here are the best Chromebooks for kids in 2021.

    "There aren\u2019t a lot of Chromebooks out there that can surpass the Acer Chromebook Spin 311\u2019s price to performance ratio, let alone add a great feature set to the mix. This is not just among the best Chromebooks out there; it\u2019s one of the best value ones as well, offering that coveted 2-in-1 design, excellent touchscreen functionality, a 720p HDR webcam, and a USB-C port for a price of entry that\u2019s less than those of its rivals. That design is great too, as are its keyboard and touchpad, which are surprisingly satisfying to use and more than what you\u2019d usually find in a laptop this cheap.",
    "Parents will appreciate the built-in malware protection of ChromeOS and this Chromebook\u2019s 15-hour battery life while the kids will appreciate its light 2.31-pound weight because no child enjoys carrying a heavy backpack around. Finally, while Acer hasn\u2019t shared any rugged ratings, this is a robust piece of kit, which everyone will appreciate.",

    "One of the best looking Chromebooks is also among the most premium ones. The Google Pixelbook Go may be Google\u2019s most affordably-priced offering, but as far as student Chromebooks go, it still costs a fortune. It\u2019s perhaps not the best option for the younger kids. Middle and high school kids, however, will love that stylish chassis that they can show off to their friends and peers.",
    "There\u2019s more to it than its good looks, however. For a premium offering, there are some missing premium features here: a biometric login, perhaps. Yet there\u2019s still plenty to love here.",
    "You\u2019re getting a premium Chromebook experience as well, its excellent performance only matched by its amazing keyboard that delivers a hushed operation and satisfying feedback. Since tweens and teens can\u2019t help but stay in touch with friends, they\u2019ll love that 1080p webcam \u2013 a feature that you\u2019ll rarely find in most laptops these days.",

    "The Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook comes with many advantages for kids. It\u2019s small and incredibly lightweight, making it an ideal addition to heavy backpacks full of books. It has a removable keyboard so that they can seamlessly switch to tablet mode when their homework is done. And, it has a breathtakingly long battery life, yielding a whopping 21-hour result during our testing. Since most laptops and Chromebooks top around 12 hours, this is pretty impressive.",
    "Best of all, it\u2019s cheap, which means you\u2019re getting all that versatility for practically nothing. Some compromises have been made here and there, of course. Its trackpad and keyboard could be better. However, you\u2019re already getting a lot for less \u2013 or at least, your kids are. That\u2019s especially because they\u2019re essentially getting two devices in one. In fact, we\u2019d go as far as to say that this is among the best value 2-in-1 laptops out there.",

    "The HP Chromebook x360 maxes out at more than $700, but that\u2019s only if you want the works, internal-wise. While high school students might benefit from such higher configurations, they\u2019re probably more than what the younger kids need. But, that\u2019s exactly what makes this Chromebook from HP great \u2013 it comes in several configurations that tout various levels of power and three different screen sizes. That means that there are several options to choose from. Whatever grade your kid is in, there\u2019s something in this line you\u2019ll deem worthy.",
    "As for the fun stuff, it has a great screen with touch and stylus support... if you want to give your creative child a little extra, that is. The stylus may not be included in the price of the Chromebook, but it\u2019s an excellent addition if someone in your family dabbles in art or design (or really if they just want to be cool and take notes in class sans wasteful paper).",

    "Young matriculating minds may be mostly focused on classroom duties when utilizing their Chromebook, but that doesn\u2019t mean that accidents won\u2019t happen. Drops, spills, and bumps are a kids\u2019 laptop\u2019s worst nightmare, and if you\u2019re dealing with a particularly rowdy or accident-prone child, the Asus Chromebook Flip C214 is among the best Chromebooks for kids. This clamshell is designed to take a beating, with an all-round rubber bumper, a chassis that\u2019s scratch-resistant, a keyboard that\u2019s spill-resistant, and hinges that will probably outlive your kid\u2019s childhood days.",
    "The two USB-C ports, stylus support and touchscreen, 2-in-1 design, and long battery life are mere \u2013 though still much appreciated \u2013 icing on the cake. Need more? It even has two cameras \u2013 on above the screen and one below the keyboard that\u2019s meant to be world-facing when it\u2019s in tablet mode. That\u2019s quite a feature set from a laptop that\u2019s way under $500."
