  "article": [
    "I don\u2019t really believe in love at first sight \u2013 especially when it comes to inanimate objects. But when the Nintendo Switch was revealed, my attraction can only be described as instantaneous.",
    "\u201cFrom the moment we met you could see that I was filled with desire.\u201d Those were the opening lyrics from White Denim\u2019s catchy track that accompanied the Switch\u2019s incredibly slick announcement trailer, and they couldn\u2019t have been more fitting.",
    "Nintendo\u2019s trailer for its eight-generation console successfully hammered home the hybrid console concept with aplomb \u2013 unrealistic impromptu rooftop parties aside \u2013 and seemed to erase all the Wii U\u2019s many mistakes.",
    "Unlike the unwieldy Wii U, which to this day would probably still bamboozle the average consumer as to what it\u2019s actually supposed to be, the Switch\u2019s appeal was immediately obvious. This was a console that you could play on the TV, but one that could also be taken on the move, completely untethered by any restrictions. Amazing.",
    "Better still, the console was also designed for local multiplayer from the outset. Detach the ingenious Switch Joy-Con controllers, and suddenly you\u2019re battling it out on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe while waiting for a plane to France that has been inexplicably been delayed. One of you yells an expletive, the other responds in kind, and then you both look up to see a disapproving priest glaring at you with all the \u2018holier than thou\u2019 energy they can muster. Amazing.",
    "Sadly, though, despite enjoying a glorious honeymoon period with the Switch that saw me sink an exorbitant amount of time into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 2, Super Mario Odyssey, Overcooked!, ARMS, and indie gems like Hollow Knight, my love for the system has waned considerably in recent years.",
    "It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the exact moment my feelings changed, but I\u2019ve certainly become numb to the Switch\u2019s initial appeal, most of which has been due to Nintendo\u2019s own making. The Switch also now has to compete for my time and attention with the PS5 and Xbox Series X, both of which have a habit of exposing its flaws.",
    "So, what\u2019s stopping me from embracing my Switch again with open arms?",
    "When you\u2019re afraid to actually play a console in fear of breaking it, you know something\u2019s gone wrong. I now see the Switch\u2019s fragile Joy-Con as a ticking time bomb, ready to implode at any moment. The Joy-Con controllers\u2019 frustrating reliability issues are well-known by now, and it means that every gaming session could result in my controllers developing the dreaded Joy-Con drift.",
    "It\u2019s shocking that Nintendo hasn\u2019t addressed Joy-Con drift by now, and it means that the Switch\u2019s little gamepads that brought me so much... well, joy, have never felt more fragile in my hands.",
    "The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller isn\u2019t much better, either. While it isn\u2019t likely to break anytime soon, it comes with the worst D-Pad in Nintendo\u2019s illustrious history, which makes games of Tetris Puyo Puyo a painful experience. Compare Nintendo\u2019s pads to the delightful PS5 DualSense and ergonomic Xbox Series X controller, then, and it already feels like a big step down.",
    "I love playing with my friends, but sadly the Nintendo Switch is a lonely experience online. It\u2019s as though Nintendo\u2019s online system is somehow frozen in time, despite the fact the company has all the resources it needs to fix it.",
    "It's hard to believe, but even though the Switch launched in 2017, you\u2019re still unable to message your friends, start party chats or do anything remotely social on Nintendo\u2019s console other than share screenshots to the internet. It still uses friend codes for heaven\u2019s sake.",
    "Yes, Nintendo released an online companion app, but support for it has been non-existent. In fact, it\u2019s recently lost some functionality, and whenever I\u2019ve used it with friends, it\u2019s been a noticeably poor alternative to services like Discord or even Skype.",
    "I\u2019m tired of having to jump through hoops just to play the odd game with friends on Switch, and now that it\u2019s a paid service \u2013 cheap as it may be \u2013 consumers deserve more. To make matters worse, the Wii U had a more comprehensive online feature set with online video calls and Miiverse.",
    "Nintendo\u2019s first-party lineup has also started to leave me feeling rather uninspired. And that\u2019s a big concern when you consider I only tend to buy Nintendo consoles for its exclusive IP.",
    "I love Mario as much as the next person (probably more), but seeing the usual wave of sports games, half-baked compilations, and retro rehashes come back around for the umpteenth time with a full-fat price tag has started to irritate me.",
    "The fact that I\u2019ve played the majority of Switch\u2019s biggest games years earlier before on Wii U hasn\u2019t helped matters, which I regard as a bit of a slap in the face. But when Nintendo announced that Super Mario 3D All-Stars would be a timed-release? Well, it\u2019s hard not to feel like the company isn't just being greedy and capitalizing on fans\u2019 nostalgia.",
    "I\u2019m still incredibly excited for Breath of the Wild 2, of course, but Nintendo needs to start taking more risks and create new IP as it did with Splatoon, ARMS, and Ring Fit Adventure. I\u2019m not going to buy another remaster, remake, or re-release. (Drop some Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC, though, and we have a deal.)",
    "One of the biggest problems with Nintendo\u2019s console release cycle, and its decision not to go toe-to-toe with Sony and Microsoft anymore, is that its hardware tends to enjoy a couple of years where things feel \u201cgood enough\u201d from a performance and visual perspective.",
    "Compared to the PS4 and Xbox One, the Switch held up pretty favorably, offering something new and exciting that led to thousands of people begging for 'Switch ports'. Now, though, compared to the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and a half-decent PC build, the Switch feels sluggish, underpowered, and its games can look \u2013 to put it kindly \u2013 downright ugly.",
    "While I would never expect Nintendo to put out a machine that\u2019s capable of 4K/120Hz, returning to face resolutions that can drop as low as 540p and framerates that tend to hover precariously under the 30fps target, is jarring, to say the least. The Nintendo Switch OLED, as beautiful as its new seven-inch screen might be, won\u2019t change that either.",
    "With no Switch Pro on the horizon, it\u2019s a situation that many players will have to stomach until the Nintendo Switch 2 arrives, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to ignore every time I return to play on Nintendo's system.",
    "The final wedge that\u2019s been driven between me and my Switch is also partly down to the competition, specifically Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. I used to love playing indies on the Switch, but it\u2019s hard to pay the full asking price for the latest and greatest indie title when Microsoft\u2019s subscription service has consistently delivered many of them for free, and often at launch.",
    "There\u2019s also the obvious benefit of indie games running and generally looking better on Xbox, especially when played on the TV. Throw in Xbox Cloud Gaming support and remote play, and Switch\u2019s biggest appeal \u2013 portability \u2013 goes out the window.",
    "Case in point: Octopath Traveler. While it\u2019s not an indie game per se, thanks to a combination of TV play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Xbox remote play I managed to finish a game that took no less than 70 hours to do so. And thanks to Xbox Game Pass, it was free on day one, runs at 4K/60fps on Microsoft\u2019s machine. Octopath Traveler is still $59.99 / \u00a349.99 on the Nintendo Switch eShop.",
    "Thankfully, there\u2019s one thing that ensures I won't turn my back on the Nintendo Switch for good, and that\u2019s the possibility of Nintendo delivering another cracking title. I may be experiencing some serious Nintendo fatigue right now \u2013 and feeling pretty disillusioned with some of the company\u2019s archaic decisions (please can we add an achievement system one day?) \u2013 but all of that could change if Metroid Dread, Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus, or Breath of the Wild 2 deliver the types of unforgettable experiences that Nintendo is renowned for. (And yes, I'm aware that these aren't new IP.)",
    "I\u2019ll still have to look past the hardware\u2019s technical limitations and quality control issues with gritted teeth, then, but at least there\u2019s still hope for me and my Switch yet."
