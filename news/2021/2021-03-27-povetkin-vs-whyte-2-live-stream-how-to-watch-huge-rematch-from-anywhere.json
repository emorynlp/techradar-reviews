  "article": [
    "It may only be seven months since Alexander Povetkin and Dillian Whyte last met in the ring, but to the Body Snatcher it will have felt like a decade. Finally he gets the opportunity to extract his revenge and you're in the right place to find out all the details of how to watch a Povetkin vs Whyte live stream online to catch all the boxing action tonight from anywhere in the world - with FREE options available in some regions.",
    "Povetkin stunned Whyte last August, laying the Brixton boy out with a monstrous uppercut in the fifth round. The Londoner had been cruising through the fight and had dropped his opponent to the canvas twice before Povetkin delivered his brutal bolt from the blue.",
    "Whyte wasted no time in triggering the rematch clause, but the Rumble on the Rock has had to be rescheduled three times.",
    "It was originally set for November but had to be pushed back to January when Povetkin contracted Covid-19, only to be postponed again because the Russian hadn't fully recovered from his illness, before finally being pushed back from its early March slot to this weekend, because of travel restrictions.",
    "It's been a long wait for both fighters, but particular Whyte, who looked like he had Povetkin on toast last time out. A potential title showdown against Tyson Fury or Anthony Joshua beckons for the winner, so there's a lot more than just bragging rights for the winner - here's how to watch a Povetkin vs Whyte 2 live stream from anywhere.",
    "Yes, in a way - but only in certain countries where a DAZN free trial is on offer.",
    "Boxing fans in Canada are among those in luck, as while it costs 20 bucks in the Great White North for the service monthly, you can get a FREE trial of DAZN in Canada. It's one of the only countries, along with Switzerland, we're aware of where the service offers a trial on the house.",
    "If that isn't you, don't worry, as DAZN is dirt cheap all over the world!",
    "It's also really cheap to watch Whyte vs Povetkin in Australia or New Zealand, where DAZN is currently being offered for the introductory discount price of just $2.99 a month, compared to the steeper DAZN US price of $19.99 a month.",
    "If you're abroad and discover that your usual coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that does is showing the fight.",
    "The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Whyte vs Povetkin anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "Out of the country? DAZN subscribers who find themselves abroad for the fight will find they can access their account just like they would at home - wherever you are in the world, all you need is the help of a good VPN.",
    "However, those looking to subscribe to DAZN for the first time may find the service manages to effectively block certain VPNs at the point of creating an account. VPNs most notably encounter obstacles starting from scratch with DAZN Canada, though in other places like the US our general sports VPN recommendation was working fine in 2021.",
    "And if you've already got an account, a VPN should work wherever you are to help you regain access to pre-existing subscriptions.",
    "Pronounced 'Da Zone', DAZN is a sports-centric streaming service that launched in 2016 and is now available in over 200 countries all around the world including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "Its offering varies by region, but as an idea, it owns the rights to the Premier League, Champions League, NFL, cricket, snooker, rugby union and more in Canada - one of its original and biggest markets.",
    "It's also seeking to challenge the pay-per-view boxing hierarchy, and is landing an increasing number of coups.",
    "The price of DAZN also varies depending on where you are in the world but is generally competitive - in newer markets like Australia, an introductory offer is still running that has it available for just $2.99 a month, while in more established markets like Canada it costs CAD$20 a month. It also offers a FREE trial in some areas and works with pretty much any modern device imaginable.",
    "It's a great all-round offering, with the only real drawback being that it doesn't play overly nice with VPNs in all territories. As we've said, Canadians abroad will find they can't sign up for DAZN even with the help of a Virtual Private Network - though existing account holders (with or without a subscription) will find they can access the service fine.",
    "It's not universally the case, either, as our latest testing reveals DAZN US is accessible using a VPN across the board.",
    "The Dillian Whyte vs Alexander Povetkin fight takes place on Saturday, March 27 at Europa Point Sports Complex in Gibraltar.",
    "The night's main card is set to get underway at 3pm ET / 12pm PT in the US and 7pm GMT / 6am AEDT / 8am NZDT in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "Ring walks for the main event are roughly expected to be as follows.",
    "Povetkin vs Whyte ring walk times",
    "Dillian Whyte had recorded 11 consecutive victories before his stunning loss at the left fist of Povetkin last August, only the second of his career (27-2 with 18 KOs).",
    "The 32-year-old, a former kickboxing champion, defeated Anthony Joshua in his first amateur bout in 2009, and would face AJ again six years later, with Joshua coming out on top this time after a close-fought contest.",
    "That followed a two-year drug ban, which was imposed after Whyte tested positive for the banned stimulant Methylhexaneamine (MHA).",
    "He has since notched notable wins over Dereck Chisora (twice), Joseph Parker, Oscar Rivas and Lucas Browne.",
    "Like Whyte, Alexander Povetkin is a former kickboxer who has also lost just two fights in his professional career, which started back in 2005 (36-2-1 with 25 KOs). Those defeats came at the hands of Wladimir Klitschko in 2013, and Anthony Joshua in 2018.",
    "The 41-year-old Russian has held the WBC world heavyweight champion and won Olympic gold, though his career has been marked by failed drugs tests. He was handed an indefinite ban by the World Boxing Council in 2017, but returned to the ring just four months later.",
    "He may be classed as a veteran, but Povetkin has shown in recent fights that he can still go the distance and will come into this rematch with plenty of belief."
