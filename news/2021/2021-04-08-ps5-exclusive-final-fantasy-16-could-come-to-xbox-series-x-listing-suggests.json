    "Final Fantasy 16 was announced as a PS5 console exclusive back in September 2020. However, a new listing on PlayStation Australia\u2019s PS5 games page hints that it will only be a timed console exclusive, which could be good news for Xbox fans.",
    "Previously, the game was tipped to come to PC after a trailer included small print at that indicated a PC release. This was later scrubbed, however, and Square Enix even went as far to tell IGN, \u201cWe have no further information on if Final Fantasy 16 will be released on platforms other than PS5.\u201d",
    "But it seems that Final Fantasy 16 could be coming to other platforms, and more specifically consoles, according to a small disclaimer on PlayStation Australia\u2019s website.",
    "As discovered by a Twitter user, underneath Final Fantasy 16\u2019s release date \u2013 which is still TBC \u2013 it says the game is, \u201cNot available on other consoles for a limited time.\u201d What\u2019s interesting here is that if the listing said \u201cother platforms\u201d, we\u2019d assume the game was coming to PC as suggested before. However, \u201cother consoles\u201d indicates that Final Fantasy 16 could make its way to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S at a later date.",
    "While exclusivity deals are part and parcel of the video games industry, and can often encourage a potential shopper to choose one console over another, it\u2019s frustrating when messaging over timed exclusivity deals isn't clearer. We've seen it countless times before, as platform holders try to retain the illusion of exclusivity for as long as possible with the hope that consumers will purchase a console to play that one specific game.",
    "As it stands, it seems like even Sony and Square Enix can\u2019t agree on the correct messaging, as this isn\u2019t the first time Final Fantasy 16\u2019s PS5 exclusivity has been called into question. Nevertheless, we\u2019ll eventually find out whether the game is coming to PC or Xbox Series X/S consoles in the future, but for now we\u2019ll just have to continue to speculate until we receive official confirmation.",
    "We\u2019ve reached out to Square Enix for comment to see if it can shed any light on the situation and will update this article should we hear more."
