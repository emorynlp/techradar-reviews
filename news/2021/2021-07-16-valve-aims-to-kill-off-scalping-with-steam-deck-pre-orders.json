  "article": [
    "The Steam Deck portable PC comes out in December, but you\u2019ll be able to reserve a device later today, June 16, and ahead of that pre-order scramble, Valve has put in place countermeasures to stop scalpers or bots from making multiple purchases with a view to reselling units and fleecing gamers.",
    "Thanks to supply issues and component shortages, this kind of nefarious price gouging has been happening far too regularly in recent times with all kinds of hardware \u2013 from graphics cards to consoles \u2013 so it\u2019s unsurprising that Valve is thinking ahead here. As the firm says, it wants to put a roadblock in the path of \u201cpotential unauthorized resellers\u201d.",
    "As you might expect, only one Steam Deck reservation will be allowed per Steam account, but Valve has also implemented a restriction to stop freshly created Steam accounts from making a purchase at all \u2013 at least initially over the opening weekend.",
    "To make a pre-order later on today, or tomorrow, any given Steam account must be in \u201cgood standing\u201d and have made a purchase on Steam before June 2021. That means scalpers won\u2019t be able to simply create multiple Steam accounts and reserve a device on them all, seeing as those new accounts won\u2019t be eligible to make a pre-order. At least not until 48 hours after pre-orders open, when the restriction will be lifted.",
    "In other words, this allows genuine buyers to get their pre-order in during the first two days to be sure of the best chance of grabbing a unit, after which it\u2019s open season \u2013 but that should be plenty of time for anyone serious about grabbing a Steam Deck.",
    "Note that reserving a Steam Deck will also incur an initial fee of $5. Valve states that this system is in place to \u201cgive us a clearer signal of intent to purchase, which gives us better data to balance supply chain, inventory, and regional distribution leading up to launch\u201d.",
    "Valve further explains: \u201cWhen you submit a reservation, you will be put in a queue. Once inventory is available, you will be emailed in the order the reservations were made.\u201d",
    "So your best bet for potentially getting yourself a Steam Deck when launch day rolls around is to get your reservation in as quickly as possible, obviously enough.",
    "Order invites should start going out by December 2021, and Valve says it\u2019ll make \u201cevery effort to convert all reservations to orders\u201d, but adds that it can\u2019t make any guarantee of availability.",
    "Availability is also restricted by region, and to begin with only the US and Canada, UK, and EU countries will be able to order a Steam Deck. The entry-level Steam Deck with 64GB of (eMMC) storage costs $399 / \u00a3349, and we have to say, this piece of hardware looks pretty nifty indeed \u2013 and might worry not just Nintendo, but could pose some kind of a threat to Windows 11 indirectly.",
    "Pre-orders for the Steam Deck open in just under a few hours at 10am PT which is 6pm UK time. You\u2019ll obviously still do well to be quick on the trigger, but at least the competition should consist of far more genuine buyers than scalpers, fingers crossed.",
