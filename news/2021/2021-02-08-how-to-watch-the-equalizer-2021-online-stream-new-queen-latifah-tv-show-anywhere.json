    "As far as TV vigilantes go, few can hold a candle to the iconic Rob McCall, who's got a new lease of life in this latest reboot of The Equalizer. Queen Latifah stars as our titular hero, Robyn McCall - by day a single mother, by night a covert enforcer of justice for those who have nobody else to turn to. Read on as we explain how to watch The Equalizer online and stream the series wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "Modern reboot though it may be, Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim - who sadly passed away in January - co-created the classic 80s series and executive produced this one, so rest assured their fingerprints are all over it.",
    "It's an action-packed, borderline ridiculous throwback to the original, with largely self-contained episodes loaded with some gloriously cheesy one-liners, the likes of which are in shamefully short supply these days.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m the one you call when you can\u2019t call 911,\u201d growls Robyn, whose daughter Delilah (Laya DeLeon Hayes) thinks she works for a charity.",
    "The love-hate relationship shared by Robyn and Chris Noth's William Bishop is reminiscent of the McCall and Control dynamic of old, Bishop summoning Robyn to clandestine meetings on rooftops to try to persuade her to return to her former line of work as a CIA operative, one that she's determined to bury by using her extensive butt-kicking powers for good.",
    "That CBS is premiering it right after its Super Bowl live stream and TV coverage finishes is an indication of the network's high hopes for the show, so follow our guide below as we explain how to watch The Equalizer online - stream every new episode of the CBS series wherever you are today.",
    "For those of you abroad on business or getting some winter sun when The Equalizer lands, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the series due to annoying regional restrictions.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream The Equalizer online no matter where you are. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home.",
