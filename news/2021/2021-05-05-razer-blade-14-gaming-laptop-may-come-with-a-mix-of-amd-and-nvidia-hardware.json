    "Thanks to a recent online leak, the new Razer Blade 14 may possibly come equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU.",
    "While any leak should be taken with a grain of salt, this one that was shared by @_rogame seems to line up with what we would anticipate from a new Razer Blade 14. To begin with, the smaller siblings of Razer\u2019s laptop line usually come with somewhat lower-end specs compared to the larger ones.",
    "For instance, the RTX 3060 and Ryzen 5900HX that\u2019s rumored to power the new Razer Blade 14 can\u2019t hold up to the RTX 3080 and 10th gen Intel Core i7 of the bigger and mightier powerful Razer Blade 17 that we tested near the beginning of this year.",
    "In addition, it\u2019s supposed to have a Time Spy score of 7,305, on par for a gaming laptop with the internals that supposedly power the Razer Blade 14.",
    "While it won\u2019t be as powerful, the Razer Blade 14 will probably be a hard laptop to buy. It won\u2019t be cheap since Razer\u2019s laptops never are. But, it might be slightly more affordable thanks to its specs. And, since it comes with a highly desired RTX 3000 series GPU, it\u2019s possible that cryptominers and resellers will buy up supply as soon as the laptop is launched.",
    "These specs would make the Razer Blade 14 a gaming laptop worth keeping an eye on, but we\u2019d like to see a little more from the iconic manufacturer\u2019s next device.",
    "At the top of our list is portability, as this is a laptop after all. The Razer Blade 14\u2019s smaller screen size gives it an immediate advantage over the Razer Blade 17, but trimming down the laptop\u2019s size and weight, even more, would make it feel like a gaming device you can take on the go.",
    "Another big area in need of improvement is battery life. Gaming laptops by their nature suck up battery thanks to their hardware, but if we could get a little more than the four hours we got out of the Razer Blade 17 in our tests, this would make it feel like you don\u2019t always have to be next to a power source to enjoy your games.",
    "We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Razer Blade laptop actually shapes up, and as we learn more we\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated.",
