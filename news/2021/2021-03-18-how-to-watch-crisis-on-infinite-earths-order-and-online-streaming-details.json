    "The greatest DC Comics superheroes unite every year for an annual Arrowverse crossover event \u2013 now one of the biggest TV events on the calendar whether you're a comic book fan or not. With that in mind, we're here to tell you how to watch Crisis on Infinite Earths in order this year and stream every episode in the correct order.",
    "Running across a number of the best superhero shows, Crisis on Infinite Earths is comprised of five episodes \u2013 one each of Supergirl, Batwoman, The Flash, Arrow, and DC's Legends of Tomorrow.",
    "We don't want to spoil anything for you, but it's safe to say the superheroes are really up against it in this instalment as the Anti-Monitor seeks to destroy the entire multiverse.",
    "Whether you're a hardened DC Comics fan or simply looking for your next fantastical fix after watching the Justice League Snyder Cut, here's how to watch Crisis on Infinite Earths online and stream the crossover in the correct order \u2013 including all the free viewing options around.",
    "If you're trying to access streaming content from sites like Netflix abroad, it's likely your favorite shows will be blocked thanks to geo-restrictions. But there's an easy and perfectly legal workaround. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch Crisis on Infinite Earths in order no matter where you are.",
    "This simple bit of software changes your IP address so that you can access episodes live or on demand just like you would at home, making streaming Crisis on Infinite Earths a viable option from anywhere in the world.",
    "It's worth noting that in the UK, all the Arrowverse shows (except Batwoman) are available on Now TV. However, not all the Crisis on Infinite Earths episodes are available, and as such, aren't available to stream on-demand. That means the only realistic way of watching them is on US Netflix with a VPN.",
    "Crisis on Infinite Earths kicks off with Supergirl season 5, episode 9 as the Monitor and Harbinger assemble the world's greatest superheroes to take on the Anti-Monitor.",
    "Crisis on Infinite Earths: part 2 is Batwoman season 1, episode 9. However, this episode is a bit of an outlier, as it's the only one out of the five that's not on Netflix.",
    "Unfortunately it's no longer available for free on The CW, so your best option is to buy the episode on Amazon Prime Video \u2013 and thankfully it's the only episode of Crisis on Infinite Earths that you'll have to pay for.",
    "Next you want to watch The Flash season 6, episode 9, and the process is just the same as with Supergirl. All you need to do is sign up to ExpressVPN and change your location to the US. Then head to Netflix, and get watching.",
    "Keep watching Crisis on Infinite Earths in order by making for Arrow season 8, episode 8, which can again be streamed on Netflix anywhere in the world by changing your location to the US with a VPN.",
    "Getting things underway in style, DC's Legends of Tomorrow season 5 kicks-off with the final instalment of Crisis on Infinite Earths \u2013 so you want Legends of Tomorrow season 5, episode 1 to finish watching this year's Arrowverse crossover in the correct order.",
    "And, just like before, all US viewers need to do is head over to Netflix and get watching. For those outside the States, just switch your VPN over to a US server and you can also watch on Netflix."
