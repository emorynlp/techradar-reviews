    "Motorola could have its next entry-level smartphone the Moto G20 ready for release soon according to the latest reports. The same leak also gave us a full breakdown of the handset\u2019s supposed specs and what it might look like.",
    "According to leaker Nils Ahrensmeier on Twitter, the Moto G20 will come with a 6.5-inch HD+ display, a 5000mAh battery, and a Unisoc T700 processor (which based on current reports is nothing to write home about).",
    "The Moto G20 could be packed with five cameras too, with four on the back (48MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro, and 2MP depth) and a 13MP front shooter.",
    "We also get some new renders for the device, showing off a noticeable bezel around the screen, the camera placements, and the back panel\u2019s fingerprint scanner. And if you thought Apple\u2019s purple iPhone wasn\u2019t bold enough, the Rosa Flamingo Moto G20 could be the option for you.",
    "We won\u2019t know how good the Moto G20 really is until we hold it in our hands, but based on this leaked information we already have a decent idea of what we should expect from Motorola\u2019s next budget handset. Unless we\u2019re blown away in some unexpected way, it doesn\u2019t look like the Moto G20 is a smartphone you\u2019ll need.",
    "We say that because Motorola already has a fine budget phone with the Moto G30. The Moto G20 has specs that sandwich it between the Moto G30 and Moto G10, so we also expect the price to fall between these phones too. But, given that there was only \u00a330 ($40 / AU$55) between the G30 and G10 to begin with, we expect the cost between the G20 and G30 to be far outweighed by the performance improvements.",
    "It\u2019s just a matter of time before the Moto G20 is officially unveiled, but it\u2019s probably not going to be one worth holding out for if you\u2019re looking for a new budget handset."
