  "summary": "According to a respected analyst",
  "article": [
    "We had thought the iPad Mini 6 might be announced alongside the new iPad Pro 2021 in April, but when that didn\u2019t happen we were left unsure of when it will launch. Now though, we\u2019re hearing that it might emerge in the second half of the year.",
    "That\u2019s according to Ming-Chi Kuo (an analyst with a good track record for Apple information) in a research note seen by 9to5Mac.",
    "The note actually focuses on the first foldable iPhone, which will reportedly land in 2023, but it includes the claim that a touch-panel supplier will benefit from the launch of the iPad Mini 6 in the second half of this year.",
    "9to5Mac says to expect the slate in \u201cthe fall\u201d (which officially runs from September 22 to December 21), but we\u2019re not sure from the wording whether this comes from Kuo or is just a guess on the site\u2019s part.",
    "Either way, there\u2019s a good chance that\u2019s accurate, as that would leave Apple\u2019s latest tablets with some breathing room before another slate arrives.",
    "Whenever it arrives, you can expect the iPad Mini 6 to have a bigger screen than the iPad Mini (2019), with leaks suggesting it will be between 8.5 and 9 inches, and the upcoming slate is also said to have smaller bezels.",
    "We don\u2019t yet know a huge amount else about the iPad Mini 6, but we\u2019d expect plenty more leaks and rumors will roll in ahead of launch."
