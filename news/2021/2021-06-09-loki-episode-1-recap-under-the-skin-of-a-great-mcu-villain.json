    "Spoilers for the first episode of Loki follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "Numerous factors have propelled the Marvel Cinematic Universe to its lofty position as the biggest screen franchise in history \u2013 such as storytelling prowess, an uncanny instinct for casting, and an expanding stable of memorable characters. But arguably the biggest reason for the MCU\u2019s phenomenal success is a unique mix of familiarity and versatility, where characters you know and love \u2013 or, indeed, hate \u2013 can leap between genres without ever leaving the safety net of a vast shared universe.",
    "The new Loki TV show is precision-engineered to exploit this unique strength. Tom Hiddleston\u2019s god of mischief has been a mainstay of the franchise since upstaging his brother in the original Thor back in 2011 \u2013 and was arguably the MCU\u2019s first great villain. Here, however, he\u2019s in entirely new territory, plucked out of reality by a bureaucratic organization charged with keeping the space-time continuum playing out how it should.",
    "It\u2019s a match made in (an antagonistic version of) heaven, as Loki\u2019s inherent instinct for chaos collides head-on with the Time Variance Authority \u2013 although Loki\u2019s never run into the TVA in the comics, it\u2019s hard to think of a more suitable adversary for a self-confessed \u201cmischievous scamp\u201d.",
    "Just as Guardians of the Galaxy brought space into the Marvel mix and Doctor Strange peeled back the magical corners of the MCU, the Loki TV show dives deep into the time travel mechanics introduced in Avengers: Endgame. But more importantly it\u2019s the perfect showcase for a character who\u2019s always got a memorable one-liner up his sleeve \u2013 and whose allegiances are constantly, intriguingly shifting.",
    "The show kicks off during the events of Avengers: Endgame, as Loki \u2013 the unreconstructed 2012 version from the first Avengers movie \u2013 uses the Tesseract to escape captivity. Within seconds of crash-landing in the Gobi desert, portals are opening up around him, with TVA operatives (led by the efficiently named Hunter B-15) arriving to take him into custody.",
    "Loki suddenly finds himself in the beigest environment seen on screen since the \u201970s-set Gary Oldman adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a Brazil-inspired office space powered by paperwork and analogue tape. With his Asgardian leather robes unceremoniously replaced with standard-issue prison overalls, and the prospect of queuing for (probably) the first time in his life, Loki hasn\u2019t looked so out of his depth since his first meeting with the Hulk.",
    "If the inner workings of the TVA are new to Loki, they\u2019re similarly strange to us. Luckily, this excellent first episode gets the potentially troublesome exposition out of the way in an extremely efficient manner, by borrowing a plot device from Jurassic Park.",
    "Animated explainer Miss Minutes is effectively Mr DNA rebranded, her retro cartoon stylings the perfect medium for explaining how a trio of all-knowing beings known as the Time-Keepers established the \u201cSacred Timeline\u201d in the wake of a multiversal war. The TVA was set up to do their bidding, intercepting miscreants who veer off the path the Time-Keepers created. This all explains why Loki \u2013 who created an alternative timeline when he escaped from the Avengers \u2013 is on the TVA\u2019s most wanted list.",
    "Loki narrowly avoids being \u201creset\u201d \u2013 not quite as bad as \u201cpruning\u201d, we suspect \u2013 when Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) escorts the Asgardian from court, to ask him some questions of his own\u2026",
    "Loki\u2019s bickering relationship with his adoptive brother has always been one of the best things about the Thor movies, but he may have found an even more entertaining foil in Mobius. The TVA agent knows exactly how to hit the Asgardian\u2019s buttons, goading Loki about his multiple failures \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s funny, for someone born to rule, you sure do lose a lot\u201d \u2013 and telling him he doesn\u2019t rank among the most dangerous \u201cVariants\u201d the Authority are pursuing: \u201cYou\u2019re just a little pussycat.\u201d Aside from a few clever uses of a device known as a \u201cTime-Twister\u201d \u2013 \u201cTime moves differently in the TVA,\u201d Mobius frequently reminds us \u2013 it\u2019s just two guys talking in a room, and it\u2019s the best stuff in the episode. By turns funny and surprisingly emotional, you know that the next killer line is never far away.",
    "Mobius also does a brilliant job of getting inside Loki\u2019s head, as he repeatedly asks whether the trickster god enjoys hurting people. Loki\u2019s admission that it\u2019s \u201cpart of the illusion, the cruel elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear\u201d is an unexpected display of vulnerability and self-awareness, and Tom Hiddleston plays it perfectly.",
    "The way he shifts from pompous, mock-Shakespearean bravado to genuine emotion (particularly when Mobius\u2019s \u201cgreatest hits\u201d reel reveals the life he should have led in the other timeline) shows why Marvel Studios has chosen to build a TV show around him.",
    "So is Loki going to be the hero or the villain in the series that bears his name? This first episode suggests he\u2019ll be a little bit of both, though even more tantalizing is the reveal that the dangerous Variant Mobius is tracking is actually another version of Loki. Perhaps the god of mischief really is about to meet his match\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "After the radically different WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, the third Disney Plus/Marvel series shifts gears again \u2013 yet still feels 100 per cent part of the MCU.",
    "From his over-the-top threats to the character\u2019s rarely seen tender side, Hiddleston entirely justifies Marvel Studios\u2019 decision to bring the god of mischief back from the dead \u2013 especially when he\u2019s sparring with Owen Wilson\u2019s brilliantly laconic Agent Mobius. The Loki TV show is Marvel at its most quotable.",
    "And in an episode that plays out like a textbook for world-building, the introduction of the out-of-time TVA opens the door to an intriguing new branch of the MCU, where the blandest office environment in history is a front for some complex temporal mechanics \u2013 not to mention an organization so powerful they use the Infinity Stones as paperweights. We\u2019re still learning the rules of this brave new world, but if the fun tricks of the Time-Twisters are anything to go by, finding out more is going to be a blast.",
    "New episodes of Loki debut on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
