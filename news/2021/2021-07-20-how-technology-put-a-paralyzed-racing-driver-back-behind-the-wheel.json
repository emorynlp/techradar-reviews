    "Race car drivers are a peculiar bunch. It\u2019s fair to say that aggressively cornering at three-figure speeds isn\u2019t most people\u2019s idea of a good time, especially when the stakes involved can so quickly shift from winning and losing to a toss-up between life and death.",
    "It\u2019s a testament to the passion associated with motorsport, though, that even those who fall victim to the immense risks involved are often reluctant to walk away from the track \u2013 and no one better illustrates that sentiment than Sam Schmidt.",
    "A former driver in America's IndyCar motor racing series, Schmidt suffered a severe spinal cord injury during a practice lap at Florida\u2019s Walt Disney World Speedway in 2000. He was diagnosed as a quadriplegic, and given just a few years to live. No longer able to drive a race car, Schmidt founded Schmidt Peterson Motorsport \u2013 now known as Arrow McLaren SP \u2013 which has since become the most successful team in the history of the Indy Lights series, the highest tier of IndyCar other than the premier IndyCar Series itself.",
    "But as you might expect from a man accustomed to the driving seat, watching from the paddock wasn\u2019t enough. In 2013, Schmidt partnered with a team of engineers to get back behind the wheel. Together, he and American tech company Arrow Electronics developed the SAM Car, a semi-autonomous Chevrolet Corvette Stingray that's controlled, incredibly, using only head movements, voice commands and breath. In the years since, Schmidt has driven the car in amateur races, broken speed records, and cruised down public streets in several US cities \u2013 all despite being paralyzed from the chest down.",
    "TechRadar had the opportunity to speak with Schmidt at the UK's Goodwood Festival of Speed, where we discussed his incredible journey, the future of assistive technologies and how he hopes his story inspires disabled individuals all around the world.",
    "\u201cFor me, it wasn\u2019t baseball, basketball or football; it was racing every weekend,\u201d Schmidt says, as he reflects on his decision to pursue a career in motorsports. \u201cMy dad raced, and you're poured into it when your parents are into it, so my [racing] life started when I was five.\u201d",
    "He wasn\u2019t half bad, either. Schmidt made 27 career starts as an IndyCar driver, racing three consecutive years at the Indianapolis 500 and winning at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 1999. \u201cMy career got really good,\u201d he admits. \u201cIn \u201999 we were competing for a lot of wins, everything was pretty rosy.\u201d",
    "Then, in January 2000, Schmidt careered into the wall of the then-famous Walt Disney World Speedway at 200mph. \u201cI blew apart my C3 and C4 vertebrae. They told my wife, \u2018if he makes it this week, he has two to five years to live\u2019 \u2013 that was 21 years ago.\u201d",
    "The journey that followed \u2013 from life-saving ventilator to 500-horsepower race car \u2013 was a predictably long road of rehabilitation, adaptation and mental fortitude, but it was Arrow Electronics that would provide Schmidt with a decidedly unexpected route back into racing.",
    "\u201cThere's a lot of serendipitous events throughout this whole story,\u201d he says. \u201cHere's this 80-year-old tech company nobody's ever heard of that wants to build a car for someone who can't use their arms or legs. So, they did it, and nicknamed it the Semi-Autonomous Mobility project \u2013 or SAM car \u2013 before they ever knew about me.\u201d Schmidt quietly chuckles at this.",
    "\u201cI\u2019d done some work with a hospital in Denver, and Arrow happened to call them and ask if they had any patients who might want to drive again \u2013 and they said, \u2018yeah, we know a former race car driver.\u2019 So, we were introduced, and I agreed on one condition: we have to go 100mph. And the rest is history.\u201d",
    "At the most basic level \u2013 if a system of this complexity might ever be described as \u2018basic\u2019 \u2013 the SAM Car works via three main inputs: steering, throttle and brake. To steer, Schmidt wears sunglasses or a safety helmet studded with reflective sensors which interact with four infrared cameras mounted to the windshield. These cameras direct infrared beams toward his head, which reflect off the sensors and return to the camera, allowing the car\u2019s computer to calculate the angle of reflection \u2013 directional information which is then sent to the wheels. Essentially, then, Schmidt steers the car by turning his head. The system is so responsive that he can drive on almost any street or race track configuration, including 180-degree hairpin turns.",
    "Throttle and brake functions are a little simpler. Sam keeps a tube in his mouth connected to a pressure sensor. He blows air into the tube to accelerate, and sucks on the tube to brake. To maintain a steady speed, Sam blows a desired amount of air into the tube and bites down to seal that pressure inside. So far, Arrow says, he\u2019s maxxed out at 201mph \u2013 faster than the take-off speed of most commercial airliners.",
    "At present, Sam needs a co-driver both for race track driving and street driving (because he\u2019s steering with his head, he must look where he\u2019s aiming the car). The co-driver therefore helps by looking ahead and calling out the next turn, advising him when to brake and when to accelerate. But as for the driving, it\u2019s all Sam.",
    "The car itself is also relatively inconspicuous. Save for the company-branded decal plastered across the doors and bonnet, you\u2019d never know this was a Corvette Stingray modified to accommodate a quadriplegic driver. And that, ultimately, encapsulates the essence of this project. Yes, Sam is a racing driver hell bent on burning rubber, but he and his car represent just one way in which technology can help disabled individuals pursue their passions and regain independence.",
    "\u201cAt first,\u201d Sam says, \u201cI did this selfishly because I wanted to drive again. But as it's evolved, and there\u2019s been so many people motivated to do more things with their life, for me the main goal now is to send a message. I wouldn't wish a disability on anybody, but you can still do things in your life, you can still be productive, you can still have kids, you can still have a family \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to put your mind to it.\u201d",
    "The conversation then shifts away from the race track to the practical applications of this sort of technology. \u201cI'd like to see it used in industry to put people back to work,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, why not? Why not a harvester? Why not a train? There's so many people with disabilities out there that want to go back to work. They\u2019ve still got their brains. Wi-Fi can enable somebody to use this technology from their business office or living room. I could drive this car completely remotely, so others could do the same in a domestic setting, for different applications.\u201d",
    "On the subject of Wi-Fi, Sam is keen to emphasize that even simple technologies like smart home devices have proven immeasurably beneficial to individuals in his position. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s amazing to see what the likes of Siri and Alexa can do for disabled people in an everyday environment. For somebody like me, who can\u2019t do anything for himself, just the ability to command things can be life changing.\u201d",
    "Sam has also been the beneficiary of another mobility-extending Arrow project, the SAM Suit 1.0 \u2013 a semi-autonomous exoskeleton allowing him to stand and walk again for short periods. Although in its early stages, the suit represents a further avenue through which assistive technologies can change the lives of those without control of their limbs. Sam\u2019s gratitude for the momentary mobility it granted him is clear to see. \u201cThey designed a custom exoskeleton for me to dance with my daughter at her wedding \u2013 which was by far the best day I\u2019ve had in 21 years.\u201d",
    "Of course, the widespread development, domestication and distribution of products like the SAM Car and exo-suit remains, unsurprisingly, some years away. Like most forward-facing innovations, cost lies at the heart of their life and death. But that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that these projects give immense promise to the future of assistive technologies.",
    "On that front, Sam and Arrow Electronics are optimistic. The latter continues to develop practical solutions for improving mobility and accessibility, with several other projects already under its belt (and more under wraps) that prove technology\u2019s capacity to change lives.",
    "For Sam, a dream he once thought impossible to realise is now his reality \u2013 and he only wants to go faster. \u201cObviously, I want to add some performance things to the car so we can be more competitive,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the sky's the limit. Maybe we\u2019ll go to the moon?\u201d",
    "Sam Schmidt: racing driver, activist... astronaut? Talk about ambition."
