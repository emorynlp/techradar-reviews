    "Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has said that the Xbox controller could get an update sometime in the future, while complimenting what Sony has done with the PS5\u2019s DualSense.",
    "Spencer discussed peripherals and the possibility of an updated Xbox Series X/S controller in the latest episode of Kinda Funny Gamescast (via VGC), saying that the team is \u201cdefinitely thinking about different kinds of devices that can bring more games to more places.\u201d",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s probably some work we\u2019ll do on [the] controller,\u201d Spencer said, adding, \u201cI think Sony\u2019s done a nice job with their controller, we kind of look at some of that [and think] \u2018are there things that we should go do?\u201d",
    "While the new Xbox Wireless controller takes a more iterative approach, improving on its predecessor in subtle but important ways, the DualSense is more of an overhaul, introducing new features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.",
    "Of course, Xbox has already shown that it\u2019s paying attention to what its competitors are doing before now\u2014as recently as January 2021, a survey asked Xbox Series X/S owners if they were \u201caware of features on PlayStation controllers\u201d that they wish were on Xbox controllers.",
    "Adding to that, this isn\u2019t the first time Phil Spencer has offered praise for the DualSense; shortly after the launch of the new consoles, Spencer told The Verge, \u201cI applaud what they did with the controller...I think for all of us in the industry, we should learn from each other and the innovation that we all push on, whether it\u2019s distribution of business model like Game Pass, or controller tech\u2026\u201d.",
    "Spencer then went on to explain to The Verge that people have a \u201ccommon expectation\u201d for the Xbox controller and that while \u201cit doesn\u2019t keep us from innovating...we do have to think about all of the use cases that are out there. We can\u2019t turn the controller inside out because there\u2019s so much expectation about the way it should work now. We can innovate on top of that, and we\u2019re going to look at what any other company does and learn from it, and see if it\u2019s something that we want to apply to what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
    "An updated controller is certainly more likely than any big bespoke accessories, such as an answer to Sony\u2019s PSVR 2, as VR and AR peripherals are \u201cnot really\u201d something Xbox is looking at. Spencer told Kinda Funny Gamescast that the team is \u201cprobably not in the more bespoke accessories place right now. We just look at what happens on Windows and other places and see if there\u2019s a unique opportunity for us. Right now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s obvious to me.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what happens on PC,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it relates to VR specifically, the best experience that I\u2019ve seen is Quest 2 and I just think its untethered [and] ease of use in its capability just doesn\u2019t, to me, require it being connected to an Xbox in any way.",
    "\u201cSo when I look at a scenario like that, I think about XCloud, I think about the Xbox Live community, I think about other things, of how could we bring content to a screen like that. Whether we do something like that through first-party or third-party partnerships I think is kind of a second step to \u2018do we think the games that we currently have that we\u2019re able to run on our platform would work there?\u2019\u201d",
    "This stance on VR lines up with what Spencer has previously said about VR support on Xbox. Back in 2020, prior to the Xbox Series X launch, Spencer said that Microsoft is waiting until VR on Xbox becomes a \u201cno brainer\u201d before it considers stepping into that field. This followed on from a previous interview in which he said that the new console wasn\u2019t created with VR in mind, adding \u201cWe\u2019re responding to what our customers are asking for and\u2026 nobody\u2019s asking for VR.\u201d",
    "Spencer didn\u2019t give a timeline on when we might expect to see any kind of updated Xbox controller but, hey, at least we know it\u2019s a possibility. As for any hints that might have been lurking behind Spencer in his shelves during the interview, he was pretty clear that this time he's \"not trying to signal anything\"."
