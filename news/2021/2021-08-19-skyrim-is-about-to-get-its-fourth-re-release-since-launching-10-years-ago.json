    "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will soon hit its 10-year anniversary, and to celebrate Bethesda plans on releasing an extra special edition of the game that includes\u2026 fishing. Yep. Fishing.",
    "The 10th Anniversary Edition will drop on November 11, 2021 on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, though you\u2019ll be able to get free next-gen updates on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S if you own the Special Edition of the game.",
    "Included in the fourth re-release of the game \u2013 yes, unbelievably Skyrim is on its fourth re-release \u2013 will be a new fishing mini-game and 500+ Creation Club elements that offer \u201cpre-existing and new quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, spells and more\".",
    "The obvious advantage to buying the game for the FIFTH time is that it will take advantage of the Xbox Series X and PS5\u2019s upgraded hardware, but Bethesda has yet to say which exact features the game will take advantage of. Frame rate? Faster loading times? Spatial audio? Who knows \u2013 all we know is that there\u2019s going to be fishing.",
    "So how did we come up with the number of remasters? Well, you\u2019ve got the Legendary Edition of the game that came out two years after launch that combined all the expansions plus the main game into one box, then came the Special Edition that ported the game to Xbox One and PS4 in 2016. We got a VR version of the game in 2017/2018 and finally we come to the Anniversary Edition that\u2019s dropping on November 11.",
    "Each of the remasters brought something new to the table and two of them \u2013 the VR version and Special Edition \u2013 helped adapt the game for current hardware at the time.",
    "The latest version of the game will do the same thing but it feels a bit like a cash-in of a cash-in \u2013 a port of a port that we\u2019ve already played through. That said, because it\u2019s a free upgrade for Special Edition owners it doesn\u2019t feel all that egregious, even though it\u2019d be great had Bethesda added something a little more than a fishing mini-game.",
    "Regardless, Skyrim remains one of the better-known, widely regarded entries in the open-world RPG genre, and is a personal favorite of mine. So, yeah, I\u2019ll probably buy it. But I swear I won\u2019t buy it a sixth time."
