    "We\u2019re due a new iPad mini, given that the latest one was the iPad mini (2019) and that\u2019s around two years old at this point. But rather than just a new slate, Apple could have a whole new range on the way, as there\u2019s talk of an iPad mini Pro.",
    "This claim comes from a post on Naver (a South Korean blogging platform), which claims that an iPad mini Pro is in development and likely to be released in the second half of the year.",
    "Apparently it will have an 8.7-inch screen (up from 7.9 inches on the 2019 model), and will be wider but not quite as tall. They don\u2019t say anything else about the design, but to make it shorter while packing in a bigger screen there would presumably need to be smaller bezels, likely meaning a design in line with other recent iPad Pros, which don\u2019t have a physical home button.",
    "We would, however, take all of this with a pinch of salt. The source doesn\u2019t have much of a track record, and no other sources have talked about an iPad mini Pro.",
    "It\u2019s not out of the question that Apple would launch one though. We have previously heard that the next iPad mini could have a bigger screen of around 8.5 inches, and that move (coupled with the new design that might come with it) could be seen as a bit of a \u2018Pro\u2019 upgrade.",
    "That said, we\u2019ve also heard that the next iPad mini would land in early 2021, while this report points to the second half of the year. Of course, that might simply mean that Apple has two different iPad mini models on the way. Perhaps we\u2019ll see the iPad mini 6 soon, then an iPad mini Pro later in the year.",
    "But the iPad mini range is relatively niche, so could Apple really justify launching a Pro version? And launching two mini models in a single year? We\u2019re not so sure. For now, we\u2019d file this rumor under unlikely, but it\u2019s certainly possible.",
