    "In a world where there are already 1.2 billion websites, getting online should be a no-brainer. Having an original idea is great for starters, but there are some steps to go through and things to consider - web hosting, domain name, and a website builder being the most essential.",
    "Looking around for a hosting provider, you will quickly notice there are a plethora of plans to choose from. Shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated servers, application-based hosting - if you're not familiar with the industry, all this can make your head spin.",
    "So, before you make a pick, let's first understand the service.",
    "Web hosting providers basically rent you some server space and system resources so you can build and run a website. But there is actually so much more to it. A good host gives you:",
    "And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Your host can be a trusted advisor, a loyal supplier, it can even allow you to resell its services as your own.",
    "Through the years, numerous types of web hosting solutions have emerged, but one of them has evolved quite impressively - VPS hosting.",
    "VPS hosting is the middle step between shared and dedicated services, often combining the best of both worlds. The provider utilizes a process called virtualization to split a physical server into separate virtual instances. Each of the accounts gets its own set of system resources (CPU, RAM, disk space, etc.) and is completely isolated from all other clients on the same machine.",
    "It's basically a dedicated server put in a shared environment but you can find out more in our VPS hosting guide for businesses.",
    "Today, you can find a well-equipped VPS machine for just a bit more than the standard shared hosting rates.",
    "Looking at the service itself, you can easily split VPS services into two main categories - managed and unmanaged hosting solutions.",
    "Picking your first virtual server, you'd have to consider how much control and extra assistance you would need. That's the main distinction between managed and unmanaged VPS hosting.",
    "Self-managed services give you a bare-metal machine with basic OS setup and initial configuration. The key here is freedom for customization as the provider allows you to install and run whatever you wish on the server...as long as you can do it yourself, of course. Unmanaged services come with no additional support, so the success of your project depends entirely on your own skills. Often preferred by developers and enterprises with more specific needs.",
    "Managed VPS hosting offers a more hands-on approach from the provider. Your host takes on the responsibilities of hardware maintenance, software installation, updates, technical help. Sure, this takes a bit from the full control you have on a self-managed server but compensates with professional help from industry experts. Well-suited for startups and SMBs.",
    "Many beginners resort to shared hosting as it seems like the easiest solution for beginners. While that may be true to some extent, the benefits that managed VPS solutions bring to the table are undeniable:",
    "You can easily see how a VPS platform can make your online life easier. Don't worry, even if you are a complete beginner - a managed VPS plan might have just what you need for a smooth online experience. From the lightning-fast performance to the enhanced security - virtual servers are surely worth considering."
