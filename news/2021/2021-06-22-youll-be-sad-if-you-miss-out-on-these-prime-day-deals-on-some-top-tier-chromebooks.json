    "Potential Chromebook buyers should always dive into the Prime Day deals pile because it's a stone-cold guarantee that Amazon will throw out some winners. As we enter day two there are some hot deals on offer right now on some of the best Chromebooks you can get. But they aren't going to be here for long.",
    "A Chromebook is a smart investment when shopping for a new laptop for a lot of people. Unless you know you're going to need some powerful dedicated graphics, or you simply can't live without some legacy Windows programs, a Chromebook is a lightweight, speedy alternative.",
    "It's also more than 'just the Chrome browser' as some may still believe. Chrome OS has matured over the years and now boasts support for not just Chrome extensions and web apps, but Android apps from the Google Play Store and Linux applications as well.",
    "Whether it's for you or for your kids to use for schoolwork, Prime Day has served up some great deals on Chromebooks and you really need to see them before the day is over.",
    "(Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region.)",
    "Lenovo knows how to make a good laptop and that applies to its Chromebooks, too. The Flex 5 has two stand out features which make it an outstanding buy at its Prime Day price. The first is the processor, where you'll find an Intel Core i3 where many would go for a lesser-powered ARM CPU or an Intel Celeron.",
    "The second is the display. This is a great display by any laptop standards, with 1080p resolution, full touch and USI stylus support. A 13-inch tablet isn't necessarily what you're looking for, but you can use the Chromebook Flex 5 like that if you wish. It's well made, well equipped and extremely versatile.",
    "When the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet first hit the market it was almost impossible to get hold of for a time. Everyone wanted one. Not only is it a good tablet, but it comes with a kickstand case and a detachable keyboard to turn it into a super-compact laptop.",
    "Chrome OS on a tablet might not be your first thought choosing a new laptop, but with Android app support built right in, what you end up with is an Android tablet that's much more useful than a traditional Android tablet.",
    "Its regular price is already attractive, but discounts like these really aren't to be ignored.",
    "If you're outside the US or the UK, no worries, there are still plenty of great Chromebook deals for you. Here you'll find the best on offer right now that are available in your region."
