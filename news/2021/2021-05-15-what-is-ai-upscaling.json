    "What is AI upscaling? This handy development in TV picture processing is able to take content of a lower resolution than your TV\u2019s own panel and optimize it to look better, sharper, and more detailed.",
    "It may sound a lot like regular old upscaling, and you\u2019d be right \u2013 the \u2018AI\u2019 part just means the upscaling happens with a greater awareness of context.",
    "That\u2019s because Al upscaling involves creating new pixels of image information to add detail where there wasn\u2019t any before, filling in the gaps to recreate a higher-resolution image, all the while using machine learning to improve the result.",
    "Handle this badly and it can look like overcooked picture sharpening, a feature seen in the menus of most TVs, and which we usually advise turning all the way down. But top TV brands \u2013 as well as Nvidia, maker of PC graphics hardware \u2013 now have compelling 4K and 8K AI upscaling techniques that elevate \u2018AI upscaling\u2019 beyond the meaningless marketing buzzword it might have been.",
    "AI upscaling tries to work out what additional, \u2018spare\u2019 TV pixels should display using machine learning. Sony offers the best single-sentence summary, saying that \u201cPatterns in images are compared with patterns stored in a unique database to find the best hue, saturation and brightness for each pixel.\u201d",
    "The most pleasing explanation of AI upscaling to the human brain is that these TV processors can recognise objects such as grass, fur or eyelashes and fill in the detail missing in the source image. But it would be more accurate to say upscaling is powered by algorithms that can recognise contrast patterns common in real-world scenes.",
    "An upscaled engine takes cues from the source material to estimate what the footage would look like if it were shot in native 4K or 8K.",
    "For example, grass seen in a 1080p scene will likely lose much of the clarity it would have at 4K. The smooth edges of each blade, and some green tonal contrasts, are lost but the \u201cpatterns\u201d Sony and others use to develop their upscaler algorithms try to restore some of this information.",
    "It is particularly useful for areas of high contrast, such as the outline of the iris in someone\u2019s eye. A good AI upscaler will not just sharpen this border, but will thin out the transition between the darker iris and the white of the eye, while avoiding the halo effect that comes with over-sharpening.",
    "Balance is key, as in all kinds of picture processing. Engineers at Samsung, Sony and their rivals will have tested more aggressive AI upscaler settings than we have today, before deciding on the final profiles in current TVs as the best balance of sharpness and detail versus a natural-looking image.",
    "The best upscalers also look at the state of pixels across frames, to avoid upscaler-generated detail fizzing in and out of existence in a moving image.",
    "AI upscaling is, at its core, simply a better way to sell upscaling that has improved in quite a predictable fashion, given several of the core techniques are also used in smartphone photography image processing. But that does not mean it is not important.",
    "TVs have processors designed to make these calculations on the fly, which is why screens with older TVs can\u2019t get over-the-air firmware updates to add \u2018next-gen\u2019 upscaling.",
    "The real time aspect is also a limiting factor. TV processors are designed for a narrow set of jobs, but they are not all that powerful compared to, say, a high-end smartphone or a PC graphics card. Upscaling has to happen near-instantaneously, too, and every millisecond it takes adds to input lag.",
    "What we said earlier about AI upscaling can make it sound like a kind of magic, but the limitations of time and processor power mean it is relatively cursory in reality. Still, it\u2019s an effective technique that \u2013 when done right \u2013 only improves image quality and helps low-res sources look their best on high-res displays.",
    "Software packages for Mac and PC also offer standalone AI upscaling. These are not normally intended for real-time upscaling, but are great if you want to clean up some of your own videos.",
    "Topaz Labs Video Enhance AI is one of the best around. You drag and drop your files onto its interface, choose an upscaling profile, and let it do its thing. Different profiles use different AI styles, resulting in a different image character and upscaling intensity in the video below.",
    "Topaz says upscaling from HD to 8K takes around two-to-three seconds a frame with an Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card. Even with a powerful PC we\u2019re not close to real-time processing. But this lets the software use more complicated AI processing, to push resolution-limited video that bit further."
