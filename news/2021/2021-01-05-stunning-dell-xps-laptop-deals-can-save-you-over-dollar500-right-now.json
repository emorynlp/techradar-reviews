    "Premium laptop deals can sometimes shave hundreds of dollars off the prices of some of the best machines on the market, but these Dell XPS deals are taking that to a whole new level this week. You'll find discounts exceeding $500 on some of these ultrabooks, and with top line specs and eye wateringly impressive displays, you're certainly getting strong value for money.",
    "The cheapest machine on offer this week is an i7 XPS 13. You won't find a touchscreen display on here, but an $879.99 price tag down from $1,108.99 makes for one of the best Dell XPS laptop deals we've seen for a while.",
    "Push a little higher up the price scale, though, and you'll find a $559 discount on this impressive 2-in-1 XPS 13, now available for $1,449.99. With a UHD+ WLED display panel, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD that's a super functional and incredibly powerful machine perfect for media editing on the fly and multi-tasking between more demanding programs for less.",
    "In fact, all of these laptops will be up to even the most power-intensive of jobs. With 10th (and even 11th) generation processors hiding away under the hood, bags of RAM and plenty of storage you're all set for high performance computing.",
    "We're rounding up all these Dell XPS laptop deals in full just below.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Dell XPS 13 and 15 sales in your region.",
    "The XPS is nice, but it's not the be all and end all. You'll find lower prices on the Inspiron range, also up for grabs in this week's Dell laptop deals. However, if you're not too convinced by Dell's ultrabook lineup, you might want to take a look at Apple's offerings with the latest MacBook deals. Plus, there's always plenty of cheap Chromebook deals if you're browsing the $200 - $400 price range."
