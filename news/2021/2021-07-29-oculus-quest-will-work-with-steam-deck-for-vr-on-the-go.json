    "Valve CEO Gabe Newell has confirmed that the Steam Deck will be compatible with external gaming devices and software \u2013 meaning it\u2019ll work with systems like the Oculus Quest.",
    "The Nintendo Switch-like portable PC, which is set to arrive in December, will allow players to pair hardware and download software from rival companies in an effort to preserve the \u201copenness\u201d of the PC ecosystem, Newell confirmed in an interview with IGN.",
    "That means that, as well as VR headsets like the Quest and Quest 2, Steam Deck owners will be at liberty to install software such as the Epic Games Store, too. \u201cIf there\u2019s hardware I want to attach or software I want to install, I can just go and do it,\u201d Newell reiterated.",
    "That doesn\u2019t suggest mixing up the Steam Deck software is explicitly encouraged, mind, but it does mean the option is open to players wishing to experiment with different hardware and operating systems, as they might otherwise do with a conventional PC.",
    "For instance, connecting a Quest headset to the Steam Deck probably won\u2019t yield great performance \u2013 high-end titles like Half-Life: Alyx may not be able to run at all \u2013 but Valve won\u2019t stop you from trying out a portable PC VR experience via USB or AirLink.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that senior Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais already confirmed that the Steam Deck is an \u201copen PC\u201d that can \u201cconnect with any hardware\u201d at the device's recent announcement, but this marks the first time explicit reference has been made to devices like the Oculus Quest.",
    "The Steam Deck\u2019s flexibility is perhaps its biggest advantage over its most obvious competitors, the Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED.",
    "Not only is the Steam Store itself a larger and notoriously better-value marketplace for gaming discounts and deals than the Nintendo Switch eShop, but the ability to attach any number of peripherals to the Steam Deck gives far greater versatility to Valve\u2019s handheld offering.",
    "Owners will be able to install a brand-new OS, browse the web, pair external devices and dock their Steam Deck to allow for TV or monitor gaming. The Switch only allows for the latter, and so while the Steam Deck might be the pricier console at the point of purchase (the entry-level model costs $100 / \u00a370 more than the Switch), owners will have far greater options at their disposal \u2013 both now and in the future.",
    "We\u2019ll have to wait until we get our hands on the Steam Deck to confirm just how much flexibility Valve\u2019s portable PC boasts at launch, but we\u2019re excited to see what owners are able to do with a device that looks set to shake up the PC gaming space for good.",
