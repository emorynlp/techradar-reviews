    "Huawei has unveiled the P50 and P50 Pro, two premium smartphones running the company\u2019s proprietary HarmonyOS platform \u2013 rather than the standard Android UI \u2013 but without 5G connectivity (via Financial Times).",
    "We\u2019d heard as much in specs leaks for the P50 earlier in the year. It\u2019s something of a step back for Huawei, as an early adopter and cheerleader of 5G technology, but restrictions on trading with US companies has seemingly prevented it from accessing 5G version of Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 888 processors (as Chinese competitor Xiaomi has done without issue in the Mi 11 handset).",
    "In an online event, Huawei exec Richard Yu specifically called out \u201cUS sanctions\u201d as the reason why \u201cour new smartphones cannot run on 5G wireless connections even though we are surely the global leader in 5G technology.\u201d",
    "Yu paints a positive picture still, saying that \u201cwith 4G, Wi-Fi 6 connectivity and our AI computing algorithms, we still can provide as powerful a performance as all the 5G phones\u201d \u2013 though there is certainly a sense of Huawei\u2019s wings having been clipped, and the capabilities of the P50 and P50 Pro being less than desired by the Huawei and its customers alike.",
    "Huawei\u2019s 5G ambitions have been somewhat dampened over the past few years, as tensions between the US and China have risen, and countries around the world have grown more wary of Huawei as a trustworthy telecommunications partner.",
    "In the UK, Huawei was initially positioned as a low-cost provider of 5G services \u2013 although the UK government followed suit with the US in 2020, banning the sale of new Huawei phones and ordering the removal of Huawei technology from national communication networks by 2027.",
    "Huawei\u2019s issues on the global stage have prevented it from accessing the parts and processors other companies are currently enjoying in their products, and even restricted its ability to offer services to existing customers \u2013 with the US banning it from offering Google-run services such as Gmail and YouTube.",
    "5G is, while a relatively technology, becoming increasingly standardised on premium smartphones, and the loss of 5G connectivity for the P50 series will no doubt be a blow to the company \u2013 as well as any Huawei fans who will be making do with 4G on these devices.",
    "However, with no announcement yet of these phones shipping outside of China, it\u2019s an uncertain future for the company\u2019s handsets worldwide, especially if it can\u2019t access the 5G chipsets needed to compete with Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi\u2019s flagship phones."
