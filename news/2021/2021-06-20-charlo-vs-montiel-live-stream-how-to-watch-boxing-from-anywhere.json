    "Undefeated WBC middleweight belt holder Jermall Charlo is putting his strap on the line tonight on home turf against an opponent that fits the bill as a dangerous dark horse. Make sure you follow our guide below if you're wondering how to live stream Jermall Charlo vs Juan Macias Montiel, no matter where you happen to be in the world.",
    "Jarmell, not to be confused with his identical twin brother Jermell who currently holds the light middleweight world belt, comes into the fight off the back of a sparkling points victory over Ukrainian star Sergiy Derevyanchenko back in September.",
    "The IBF light middleweight title will be hoping a win here tonight in Houston will help bring about a long awaited super fight against either Gennadiy Golovkin or Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez.",
    "With an unblemished 31 fight win record, that includes 22 KO's, standing in his way tonight is the largely unheralded Mexican fighter Juan Macias Montiel. Ranked fourth in the WBC rankings, Montiel comes into the fight with a 22-4-2 record with 22 knockouts, with his most recent fight a December knockout win over James Kirkland.",
    "Here's all you need to know about how to watch a Jermall Charlo vs Juan Macias Montiel live stream.",
    "If you're abroad and discover that your coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that is showing the fight.",
    "The software is generally ideal for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream boxing from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "Sadly there is no confirmed broadcaster at the time of writing in any of these three regions for this big fight.",
    "The only alternative is to use one of our best VPN services as described above, set your location to a country on this page that is broadcasting and go from there. But do bear in mind that most paid streaming services do require a credit card based in the country the service is from."
