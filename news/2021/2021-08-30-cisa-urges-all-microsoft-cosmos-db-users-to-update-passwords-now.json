    "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging all users of Microsoft\u2019s Azure Cosmos DB database service to regenerate their certificate keys, following the discovery of a serious security flaw that could hand over control of the databases to unauthorized individuals.",
    "The Cosmos DB flaw was discovered by cloud infrastructure security company Wiz, who were able to exploit a vulnerability in the service\u2019s Jupyter Notebook implementation, which gave attackers access to the database\u2019 primary keys and other highly sensitive secrets such as its blob storage access token.",
    "Upon being notified, Microsoft quickly disabled Jupyter, and emailed a section of its users to rotate their keys. The CISA however suggests all Cosmos DB to follow this precautionary step.",
    "\u201cAlthough the misconfiguration appears to have been fixed within the Azure cloud, CISA strongly encourages Azure Cosmos DB customers to roll and regenerate their certificate keys and to review Microsoft\u2019s guidance on how to Secure access to data in Azure Cosmos DB,\u201d notes CISA in its advisory.",
    "According to the Wiz researchers, the flaw would equip threat actors with everything they need to access and exercise full read/write/delete control over the database from across the internet.",
    "In a blog post, Microsoft said that its investigation indicated that \u201cno customer data was accessed because of this vulnerability,\u201d adding that they\u2019ve notified the customers whose keys may have been affected by the researchers.",
    "However, the Wiz researchers sided with CISA\u2019s directive that extended the advisory to all Cosmos DB users, since it\u2019s difficult to gauge the true impact of the vulnerability.",
    "\"In my estimation, it's really hard for them, if not impossible, to completely rule out that someone used this before,\" Wiz Chief Technology Officer Ami Luttwak told Reuters.",
