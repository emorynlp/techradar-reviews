    "With Amazon Prime Day now in full swing, we're seeing some brilliant Prime Day deals on ultrawide monitors, so now is a great time to grab one.",
    "Ultrawide monitors offer aspect ratios of 21:9, and even 32:9, which is much wider than standard widescreen 16:9 monitor and TV aspect ratios. While these wider screens are great for working on, as you can have more apps and windows open at once, they really come into their own when gaming.",
    "These ridiculously wide monitors offer more immersion, as they will more of your vision, leading to much more enjoyable gaming experiences. They can also give you a tactical advantage, as you'll be able to see enemies and targets that a standard monitor wouldn't show you.",
    "These monitors also confirm that PC is the best place to play games \u2013 as neither the PS5 nor the Xbox Series X support ultrawide monitors.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for monitors from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
