    "Rebooting a TV show or movie series can be a sore subject for some fans. As the reaction to Netflix\u2019s He-Man revival or recent Star Wars films can attest to, significant changes to a series\u2019 source material can cause fans to revolt against the properties they revere.",
    "As relative newcomers to the movie franchise business, Marvel Studios doesn\u2019t need to concern itself with such problems, even if the studio\u2019s latest TV offering \u2013 a byproduct of the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse\u2019s (MCM) recent arrival \u2013 can be viewed as a semi-revitalization of sorts.",
    "What If\u2026?, the first canonical MCU animated anthology series, recreates infamous events from the franchise\u2019s 13-year history in unusual, funny and at-times shocking ways.",
    "Revising iconic moments \u2013 particularly in a movie series that\u2019s still in its infancy \u2013 might be seen as something of a gamble. However, with an established, supportive fanbase behind it, Marvel can afford to take such risks \u2013 and likely succeed with them.",
    "Ahead of What If\u2026?\u2019s Disney Plus premiere on August 11, TechRadar sat down with star Jeffrey Wright, head writer A.C. Bradley, director Bryan Andrews and executive producer Brad Winderbaum to find out how the show builds new futures from the MCU\u2019s past. We also discuss the late Chadwick Boseman\u2019s final appearance as T\u2019Challa, and the prospects of the show running for multiple seasons.",
    "Based on the 1977 comic series of the same name, What If\u2026? takes key events from Marvel movies, such as Steve Rogers becoming Captain America or the Avengers\u2019 formation, and reimagines them in unpredictable ways. These moments, though, don\u2019t occur on the MCU\u2019s timeline \u2013 they play out in alternate realities, which were introduced alongside the multiverse in Loki\u2019s season 1 finale.",
    "Announced in April 2019, What If\u2026? is a project that Marvel has wanted to bring to life for a while but, until recently, the necessary pieces hadn\u2019t fallen into place. Sure, the MCU was firmly established as a leading 21st century movie franchise long before What If\u2026? was officially revealed, but the idea of making a TV show based on this particular comic series, and the multiverse\u2019s introduction, had been a pipedream for some time.",
    "\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve tried to figure out what to do,\u201d Winderbaum explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve been excited to explore animation at Marvel Studios, and now we\u2019ve got such a rich cinematic history of over 10 years to draw from. People know these stories, so we have lots of opportunities to spin What If\u2026? concepts out of projects that fans know very well.\u201d",
    "What If\u2026? won\u2019t just tell tales that fans are accustomed to. As its official trailers and TV spots showcase, the series will also bring fan-favorite comic stories \u2013 such as Marvel Zombies \u2013 to life, as well as create brand-new narratives that MCU or comic fans haven\u2019t seen before.",
    "Marvel\u2019s existing and wholly original content, then, presents the studio with unlimited storytelling possibilities for its latest show \u2013 although as Bradley reveals, there was one directive that its creative team had to stick to during its development.",
    "\u201cThe only rule was it had to start with the MCU,\u201d Bradley says. \u201cSo we had to pull from those characters. It\u2019s easy to think \u2018what would happen if this occurred?\u2019, but the real challenge was \u2018how do we tell something different?\u2019 or \u2018who are these characters without the suits?\u2019 or \u2018where\u2019s the heart behind the hero?\u2019. Once we answered those questions, we had so many different avenues to explore.\u201d",
    "What If\u2026? represents Marvel Studios\u2019 first foray into animation, so finding the right aesthetic to depict its well-known characters and locations (albeit existing in different dimensions to the MCU) was vital.",
    "Choosing a specific art style was even more pertinent when Marvel outsourced the show\u2019s animation to three other studios, with Canadian company Squeeze, Australian outfit Flying Bark Productions and French studio Blue Spirit working on five, three and one of What If\u2026?\u2019s episodes respectively.",
    "After much deliberation, including over whether to pursue 2D animation or a style inspired by legendary Marvel artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel settled on a design influenced by classic US illustrators including J.C. Leyendecker and Tom Lovell.",
    "\u201cAs we\u2019re riffing on the MCU, we didn\u2019t want to go with something \u2018super\u2019 out there,\u201d Andrews explains. \u201cWe looked back at art from the 20s and 30s because it has an idealised, almost heroic human form that\u2019s chiselled, and lends itself as a subtle sidestep from our live-action projects. Ryan Meinerding [Marvel Studios\u2019 Head of Visual Development] really sunk his teeth into that style and helped us achieve this signature look.\u201d",
    "Leading viewers through What If...?\u2019s various tales is Uatu the Watcher, an omnipotent celestial being who oversees the Marvel multiverse. However, while Uatu is an individual of immense power, he\u2019s a passive observer who can\u2019t intervene in events as they occur \u2013 much like the show\u2019s audience.",
    "For Wright (Westworld, James Bond), who voices Uatu in What If\u2026?, the all-powerful character acts as a stand-in for Marvel fans who, like him, are fascinated by this fictional universe and the superheroes (and supervillains) that inhabit it.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s the biggest fan out there,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHe wants to get involved and maybe manipulate things in a different way, but there are limitations [to what he can do]. I think he\u2019s drawn to these characters, their stories and the mythology in the same way that we\u2019re drawn to water [to survive]; it defines him and gives him life. There\u2019s a certain part of our humanness that we connect to through these characters and, while he isn\u2019t human, I think Uatu does, too.\u201d",
    "Wright isn\u2019t the only big name attached to the series. Many of the MCU\u2019s stars, including Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Bettany, Tom Hiddleston, Hayley Atwell, Karen Gillan and Sebastien Stan have reprised their roles for What If\u2026?, although some Marvel actors \u2013 Drax star Dave Bautista included \u2013 weren\u2019t asked to voice their characters.",
    "Of all those who did return, Chadwick Boseman\u2019s performances will prove to be the most emotional. The actor, who passed away in August 2020 after a four-year battle with colon cancer, reprises his iconic role as Wakanda\u2019s T\u2019Challa in four episodes.",
    "What If\u2026?, then, represents Boseman\u2019s final acting role \u2013 and in Bradley\u2019s view, it\u2019s fitting that one of the show\u2019s earlier episodes, which explores what would have happened if Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s Ravagers had accidentally kidnapped T\u2019Challa, is befitting of Boseman as much as the character that he embodied.",
    "\u201cIn the MCU and the comics, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t go through changes; he changes the world,\u201d Bradley says. \u201cWhen it came to creating this particular episode, the question wasn\u2019t \u2018how do we do Black Panther in space?\u2019, it was \u2018how does T\u2019Challa, and Boseman by extension, change the galaxy and fix it for the better?\u2019 Chadwick was a god among men who changed the people around him, so we wanted to play off that and honor him through it.\u201d",
    "What If\u2026?\u2019s nine-episode run feels like it\u2019s just the beginning for Marvel Studios\u2019 inaugural animated show.",
    "Audiences may be pleased to hear, then, that production is already underway on a second season that also comprises nine episodes \u2013 but what about seasons after that? With the MCM\u2019s arrival providing the opportunity to tell an infinite number of stories, there are bound to be multiple entries in Marvel\u2019s latest TV series, right?",
    "Winderbaum declined to comment on such a possibility, but did tease the prospect that future instalments were something that the show\u2019s chief creative team were keen to pursue.",
    "\u201cWe will never run out of ideas because there\u2019s so many ways to spin out the universe and the stories that we love,\u201d he says. \u201cThis season allows us to dig into each story and make them as rich as possible. Hopefully, we can go even wider [in the future] and tell as many as possible.\u201d",
    "Much will depend on fans\u2019 reactions to the series\u2019 first season. What If\u2026? represents a bold, new step for Marvel Studios, but it can afford to take this risk now that it\u2019s established as one of the biggest entertainment companies around \u2013 and we suspect fans won\u2019t need a second invitation to check it out."
