    "After this weekend\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077 1.1 patch helped fix a number of stability issues, players have now begun to report that it\u2019s broken the main plot line \u2013 specifically around the quest Down on the Street.",
    "According to those players on Reddit and later confirmed by the game\u2019s developer, CD Projekt Red, the quest breaks when V receives a holocall from Takemura\u2026 who just stares at you and doesn\u2019t say anything.",
    "If that\u2019s happening to you, it might feel like you\u2019re stuck, but according to CD Projekt Red there are a few quick fixes you can use to get around the bug while you wait for a proper hotfix.",
    "Here\u2019s how to unbreak the game:",
    "Cyberpunk 2077's launch has been a mess. It was so bad, in fact, that it's led to a class-action lawsuit against the publisher and caused a slew of gamers to ask for a refund on every platform the game's available on.",
    "Today's new glitch is certainly annoying, but it's also pretty innocuous \u2013 and with the above fix, hopefully harmless.",
    "You can't fault the studio much for deploying a patch that it believed would improve stability only to find a new flaw in the game \u2013 ask any coder and they'll tell you that fixing one error usually causes two more to pop up in their place.",
    "The developer says it will be working on another patch, version 1.2, and says it will be squashing more bugs in the near future as they arise.",
