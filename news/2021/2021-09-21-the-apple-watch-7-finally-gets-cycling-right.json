    "In the weeks leading up to the launch of the Apple Watch 7 reveal, the internet rumor mill was hard at work churning out theories about its new health and fitness features. It would have a radically different design, theorists suggested, and be capable of measuring blood pressure, blood glucose, blood alcohol \u2013 all non-invasively.",
    "Looking back, it\u2019s no surprise that these turned out to be overly ambitious. Apple has registered patents for blood pressure tracking using actuators embedded in a watch\u2019s wristband, but there\u2019s nothing more concrete so far. Some smartwatches and fitness trackers (such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2) can estimate changes in blood pressure using the same optical sensor that tracks your heart rate, but it\u2019s only a rough guide and can\u2019t replace a conventional monitor and cuff.",
    "There\u2019s promising research that suggests blood glucose monitoring could come to smartwatches eventually using either spectroscopy (which uses lasers to identify different chemicals), or a method pioneered by UK company Nemuara Medical that uses a mild electric current to draw molecules through the skin, but again it\u2019s not yet ready to be implemented in a commercial device.",
    "In fact, the Apple Watch 7\u2019s new health features are very modest \u2013 but nonetheless very interesting, particularly to casual cyclists.",
    "One of these new tools is fall detection during cycling activities. The Apple Watch 4 and later can already detect hard falls and alert the emergency services if you don\u2019t tap the face to indicate that you\u2019re OK.",
    "With the Apple Watch 7, the same thing will happen if you fall off your bike. If the watch detects that you\u2019re moving after you take a tumble, it will wait for you to respond to the alert on-screen. If you\u2019re immobile for a minute, it will call the emergency services automatically, then send a message to your emergency contact.",
    "It\u2019s a feature you\u2019ll already find on sports watches from the likes of Garmin and Coros, but it\u2019s good to see it being extended to more general-purpose smartwatches for the safety of more casual riders. This feature also goes well with the watch\u2019s new face, which is topped with more crack-resistant crystal, and is rated for resistance to dust as well as water.",
    "The Apple Watch 7 also offers improved calorie calculation for e-bikes. We\u2019re not yet sure exactly how this will work, but we expect it will use a combination of your historic heart rate during workouts, resting heart rate, current heart rate, and pace to work out how much effort you\u2019re putting into your battery-assisted ride.",
    "E-bikes are increasingly popular, particularly for city riding, but most smartwatches and fitness trackers assume that all cycling happens on a conventional bicycle. The Apple Watch 7 acknowledges that e-bikes are a valid form of exercise, and more accurate calorie counts may help encourage owners to saddle up rather than hopping in their cars for short journeys.",
    "There are lots more tools Apple could add to help cyclists, such as more workout tracking options and fitness tests, but for commuters and weekend riders, the Apple Watch 7 could be the perfect choice."
