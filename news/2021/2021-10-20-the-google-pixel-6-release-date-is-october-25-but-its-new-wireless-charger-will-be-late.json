    "If you\u2019ve been eager to pair your pre-ordered Google Pixel 6 or Google Pixel 6 Pro with the rumored revised Google Pixel Stand, rejoice: a listing for the 2nd Generation Pixel Stand is up on the Google online store \u2013 but it won\u2019t launch on October 28 alongside the Pixel 6.",
    "To be clear, the listing for the Google Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) says it is \u2018coming soon.\u2019 We reached out to Google, which confirmed to TechRadar that the wireless charger wouldn\u2019t arrive on October 28, but didn\u2019t give a release date.",
    "The Google Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) improves on its predecessor with faster charging up to 23W \u2013 but only for the new Pixel phones. Other devices charge at up to 15W, which is about standard for wireless charging in most handsets anyway.",
    "Interestingly, the new Pixels don\u2019t charge at the same rate: peeking at the fine print of the specs sheet, the Google Pixel 6 wirelessly charges up to 21W, while the Pixel 6 Pro goes up to the stated 23W. It\u2019s a minuscule difference, but more sleight of hand to obscure the actual recharge rates of these phones.",
    "If you\u2019re using a Qi-certified EPP charger (aka a non-Pixel Stand), expect the new Pixels to wirelessly recharge up to 12W.",
    "Most phones, especially at the flagship level, can wirelessly charge \u2013 and some can even act as chargers themselves (the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro included), sapping their own battery life to recharge other Qi-certified devices.",
    "There are a few flagships that don\u2019t, like the Asus ROG 5, a gaming-focused phone that saves space and avoids the heating issues that come with wireless recharging in order to preserve thermal capacity and space for its huge 6,000mAh battery and gaming-intensive features.",
    "Whether or not Pixel 6 owners use wireless charging, they\u2019ll still benefit from the large 4,612mAh battery, while the Pixel 6 Pro has a larger 5,000mAh battery. Both have a maximum charging speed of 30W, though neither includes an actual charging block in the box \u2013 you\u2019ll have to buy that separately, but as far as we know, you won\u2019t have to buy a Google-specific charger to get that top recharging rate.",
