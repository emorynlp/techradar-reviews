    "If you have a pacemaker then you might want to think twice about buying an iPhone 12 (or any other model in the iPhone 12 range), as one of the star features of the phone also makes it a risk.",
    "We\u2019re talking of course about MagSafe, which uses magnets and radios to let you attach accessories to the back of the phone. If you have a pacemaker then you\u2019re probably already aware that magnets don\u2019t mix well with it, but Apple has now confirmed that the iPhone 12\u2019s are no exception.",
    "In an update to a support document spotted by MacRumors, Apple states that you should keep your iPhone 12 and MagSafe accessories (including the MagSafe Charger and MagSafe Duo Charger) \u201ca safe distance away\u201d from your implanted pacemaker or defibrillator. Apple defines a safe distance as more than 6 inches / 15cm, or \u2013 if wirelessly charging \u2013 more than 12 inches / 30cm.",
    "The company also notes that you should \u201cconsult with your physician and your device manufacturer for specific guidelines.\u201d",
    "Despite this new warning, Apple oddly also states that the iPhone 12 range is \u201cnot expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices than prior iPhone models.\u201d",
    "So the risk may not be high, but it\u2019s probably not worth taking, especially since \u2013 as MacRumors notes \u2013 an article in the Heart Rhythm Journal previously suggested that an iPhone 12 could cause an implantable cardioverter defibrillator to enter a suspended state.",
    "None of this necessarily means that an iPhone 12 isn\u2019t suitable for you if you have a pacemaker or defibrillator, just that you should be wary of the safe distances, and probably therefore not keep it in a chest pocket. But if in doubt, follow Apple\u2019s advice to consult your physician.",
