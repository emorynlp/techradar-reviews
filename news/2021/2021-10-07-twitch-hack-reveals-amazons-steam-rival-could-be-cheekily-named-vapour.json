  "summary": "Vapour could be a games store integrated directly within Twitch",
  "article": [
    "The big Twitch hack that just happened also came with an interesting revelation in the form of leaked details that seem to indicate that Amazon (which owns Twitch) is building a Steam rival.",
    "The would-be online games store is codenamed Vapour (or Vapor) \u2013 presumably a cheeky dig at Steam rather than a serious candidate for a final name \u2013 and according to the info spilled in the hack, it\u2019ll integrate Twitch features as you might expect. This was uncovered by data miner Sinoc on Twitter.",
    "Think of Twitch but with a built-in games platform where you can buy the latest titles, and have your games library in the same place that you do all your stream viewing.",
    "Sinoc also discovered code for what\u2019s apparently an app by the name of \u2018Vapeworld\u2019, which would appear to be some kind of VR chat app complete with various assets including 3D emotes. Presumably this could be integrated with Vapor within Twitch, given the reference in the name.",
    "The (claimed) presence of this stuff in the leaked material does not necessarily mean it\u2019s anything beyond concepts and potential ideas for the future, of course.",
    "Vapour \u2013 or whatever it may end up being called, if anything ever comes of it \u2013 makes sense from Amazon\u2019s point of view, given that Twitch represents an instant community as a purchasing audience on tap. With some clever strategy \u2013 and exclusive games or content, maybe \u2013 it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how this could be a way of very quickly building a compelling rival to Steam.",
    "Such a platform would, of course, add to Amazon\u2019s gaming strengths, with Prime Gaming (previously Twitch Prime) already offering free in-game goodies (and freebie games for that matter).",
    "Whether Vapour will end up on the pile as a missed (or perhaps that should be \u2018mist\u2019) opportunity, or if it\u2019ll actually ever come to anything, obviously remains to be seen. Although PC Gamer, which spotted the above tweet, points out a piece of evidence which seemingly reinforces the likeliness \u2013 namely an Amazon patent filing from 2017 describing an interface for \u2018joining games from a spectating system\u2019, with the ability to \u2018order, purchase, or otherwise obtain demo or full versions of games\u2019.",
    "There are a few digital dots here, as it were, but we\u2019d be foolish to be too hasty to join them. Epic has, of course, already gone toe-to-toe with Steam for years now, backed with a ton of cash for exclusives, and Valve has managed to weather that storm thus far\u2026"
