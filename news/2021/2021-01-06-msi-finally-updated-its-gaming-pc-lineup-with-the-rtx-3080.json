  "article": [
    "Ahead of CES 2021, MSI has announced that its Trident, Infinite, Aegis and Codex gaming desktops are now available with Nvidia Ampere GPUs.",
    "If you\u2019re after a machine with a top-end GPU, both the MSI Infinite RS and Aegis RS 10th are now being offered with Nvidia\u2019s top-end RTX 3090 graphics card \u2013 which many have been struggling to get hold off. Both desktops pair the Ampere GPU with up to an Intel Core i9-10900K CPU and up to 32GB DDR4 RAM.",
    "Unsurprisingly, these gaming desktops don\u2019t come cheap. The Infinite RS with RTX 3090 is available for $3,599 (\u00a32,640, AU$4,615), while the Aegis RS 10th with RTX 3090 is available from $3,999 (\u00a32,935, AU$5,130).",
    "The equally hard-to-get-hold-of Nvidia RTX 3080 is also being offered in the MSI Meg Trident X 10th. This model, which also packs up to an Intel Core i9-10900K processor, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD + 1TB HDD storage is available from $2,799 (\u00a32,055, AU$3,590), while an RTX 3070 variant is also on sale for $2,499 (\u00a31,835, AU$3,205).",
    "MSI is also offering a number of gaming desktops with up to an Nvidia RTX 3070, for those looking for a less expensive machine.",
    "The MSI Trident AS, Codex R 10th, Aegis R 10th and Ryzen-powered Aegis ZS are all being offered with Nvidia\u2019s mid-range Ampere GPU, with each model available from $1,899 (\u00a31,400, AU$2,435), $1,299 (\u00a3955, AU$1,660), $1,549 (\u00a31,340, AU$2,000) and $1,999 (\u00a31,470, AU$2,560), respectively.",
    "The arrival of MSI\u2019s upgraded gaming laptops comes just days ahead of CES, where Nvidia is expected to add more mid-range options to its RTX 30-series lineup in the form of the RTX 3050, RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3060.",
    "MSI is also set to unveil the Trident S during next week\u2019s all-digital conference, which it\u2019s teasing as a gaming machine that \u201crevolutionizes conventional thinking of what a PC gaming system is to bring the world of Triple-A PC gaming into any household.\u201d"
