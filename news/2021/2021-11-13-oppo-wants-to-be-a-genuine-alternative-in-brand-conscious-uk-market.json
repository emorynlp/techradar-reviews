  "article": [
    "Oppo may not be as familiar to British consumers as Apple and Samsung, or even Huawei, but its status as the world\u2019s fourth largest smartphone manufacturer demands respect. According to Gartner, the Chinese manufacturer has a global market share of 10.2%, boosted by an astonishing growth rate of 42.4%",
    "Like its compatriots Vivo and Xiaomi, Oppo has traditionally been boosted by strong demand in its homeland and other parts of Asia thanks to affordable, feature packed handsets. Western Europe was the logical next step in the pursuit of growth.",
    "Oppo phones debuted in the UK back in January 2019, hoping to disrupt a market dominated by a handful of players. However, speaking to TechRadar Pro\u00b8 the company\u2019s UK and Ireland Managing Director Kevin Cho strategy is not to compete solely on value \u2013 it wants to offer technologies and design features that other vendors aren\u2019t.",
    "\u201cThe UK is one of the most brand conscious markets,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor most new entrants it\u2019s a question of delivering value or specifications. For us, as a brand, value for money is not the only way [to succeed]. We feel we differentiate as we operate in the intersection between technology and beauty. We don\u2019t see the need to compromise.",
    "\u201cit\u2019s about being a viable alternative in a market that has not been disrupted traditionally by other brands. We\u2019ve made great strides in penetrating the market by bringing different options and new technologies.",
    "\u201cAll of our competitors [innovate] but we believe in delivering features that actually matter to people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
    "Cho extols the virtues of Oppo\u2019s recent handsets, citing their unibody and curved design characteristics, and claims technological features like fast charging, low battery life and immersive visual experiences are something that only it can offer.",
    "The launch of 5G is also an opportunity. Although Samsung made sure that it was an option for early adopters, the late arrival of a compatible iPhone and Huawei\u2019s well documented struggles meant there was a gap for another manufacturer. Oppo provided one of the launch devices for EE\u2019s 5G network.",
    "However, Cho does not yet see 5G as a key driver of sales. He sees it as a natural development that will become more important as operators roll out their services and new use cases emerge.",
    "\u201cThere has been buzz about 5G [in the industry] for the past two or three years but we\u2019ve now almost started to reach the tipping point where we\u2019re going to have pervasiveness.,\u201d he says, citing the inevitable consequences of the pandemic on 5G deployment and adoption. \u201cFor the first time, the handset penetration is ahead of network rollout. As soon as the operators catch up then the use cases will be increasingly relevant.\u201d",
    "Devices are just one part of the equation \u2013 marketing and business operations are just as important. Oppo took the learnings and best practices acquired from expansions into when",
    "Cho has headed up Oppo\u2019s UK operations for the past two and a half years, and identified lessons ad strategies through similar expansions into Australia, New Zealand and other parts of Europe that could be replicated and customised for the UK market.",
    "\u201cThese are great examples of how we have a strong grasp of consumer behaviour within a market,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe came in as a new entrant with little brand awareness and some scepticism so you need to build that credibility and trust.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve built our credibility through a pragmatic approach that doesn\u2019t just involve great technology but also a willingness to compromise.",
    "\u201cOppo UK has the vision to be the easiest company to partner with, whether it\u2019s the way we deliver, supply, finance or how we go to market. Every six months when we formulate our marketing plan we put [that philosophy] at the centre and bring our partners into that process to create that affiliation as partners.\u201d",
    "In order to cement these relationships with partners and customers, and localise the brand, Oppo has doubled the size of its UK & Ireland team since 2019.",
    "\u201cExpanding our [UK] presence doesn\u2019t just give us more capability and resource, it also gives us a local culture,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at our team structure \u2013 70% of our employees are actually from the UK and Ireland. We believe that by creating that local team we can genuinely engage and connect with the local markets.\u201d",
    "Marketing also helps. In addition to international sponsorship like The International Cricket Council (ICC) and FC Barcelona, Oppo has partnered with one of the most famous properties in British sport \u2013 Wimbledon. The association with such a prestigious tournament was designed to raise awareness and credibility even further.",
    "\u201cWimbledon is quite picky when it comes to partnerships and our collaboration goes beyond just having the logo next to the Oppo brand,\u201d says Cho. \u201cThe Wimbledon sponsorship is incredibly important to demonstrate to the UK consumer about what we are as a brand.\u201d",
    "Oppo\u2019s UK ambitions go beyond smartphones and into connected devices and accessories. The business market is also something it will pursue once its presence has matured.",
    "But there\u2019s no escaping the size of the challenge it faces in the UK market where only Huawei has had any real success in breaking the Apple-Samsung duopoly in recent years.",
    "So how will it define success? The first step is to become that main alternative and build from there.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever a ceiling [but] I think establishing ourselves as that clear third alternative,\u201d Cho suggests. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re not just here as a flash in the pan but a long-term fixture in the broader tech ecosystem in the UK, delivering differentiated technology that matters.\u201d",
