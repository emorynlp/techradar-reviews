    "We've seen quite a few Prime Day deals on tablets from Samsung, especially the Galaxy Tab S7 and S7 Plus, which is the top slate the brand currently offers. Thanks to the deficit of iPad discounts, if you're looking for a cut-price tablet these are your best options.",
    "Below, we've posted all the best Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 deals we've founded, including discounts on its Plus model and accessories. If you see the price of them and squirm, we empathise - we've also thrown in deals on more affordable Samsung slates too.",
    "These deals cut the price of the tablet by a fair amount, though nothing earth-shattering - we've got deals in the UK and US on the slates in a range of configurations.",
    "If you're not in the US or UK, scroll on down past the deals, because near the bottom of this article we've also listed prices on the slate in your region.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus were the company's top-end tablets of 2020, and since the Galaxy Tab S8 range hasn't launched yet, they remain as the top slates you can buy from the company.",
    "The tablets have big screens, top-end processors and stylus support, and we'd consider them the best iPad Pro rivals you can buy right now.",
    "The discounts don't exactly make the Galaxy tablets 'affordable', but the discount is a pretty sizeable one anyway, and will save you money you could otherwise spend on tablets or apps (or something else entirely).",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Samsung Galaxy Tab devices from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
