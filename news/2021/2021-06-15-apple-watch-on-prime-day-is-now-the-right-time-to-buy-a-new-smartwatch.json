    "With Prime Day 2021 less than a week away, it's time for deal-hunters to make a game plan. Once June 21 rolls around, Lightning deals will come and go in a flash, leaving little time to decide which discounts to snatch up or skip.",
    "Last year's Apple Watch Prime Day deals generally underwhelmed us, with the most significant discounts coming to older watches like the Series 3. But that happened partly because Prime Day 2020 was delayed to October, so many companies saved their best deals for Black Friday a month later. The Apple Watch 6 had also just come out, making big discounts unlikely.",
    "This year, Prime Day 2021 won't be overshadowed, and Apple will want to clear out stock before the new Apple Watch 7 arrives. But will this actually translate into amazing deals? And is it better to buy one now or wait until September for a brand-new model?",
    "For anyone considering buying one of the best Apple Watches during Prime Day, we're optimistic that we'll see some impressive discounts. But you may also want to skip Prime Day or try one of the Apple Watch deals available now.",
    "As we said before, Prime Day 2020 wasn't a typical deals event for Amazon, what with the Black Friday Apple Watch deals following closely behind. But to give you an idea of what this year's deals could bring, we've recreated below the Prime Day Apple Watch deals we saw last year.",
    "There weren't many, with discounts limited to the Series 3 and Series 6. We're hopeful that TechRadar's top pick, the SE, will also make an appearance this time \u2013 and that the price slashes will be more significant."
