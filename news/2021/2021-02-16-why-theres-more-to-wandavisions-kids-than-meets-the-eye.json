    "Spoilers for WandaVision follow.",
    "It\u2019s no accident that one of the movies showing at Westview\u2019s cinema is The Incredibles. It turns out the Maximoffs are now a fully-fledged super-family just like the Parrs, with twin boys Billy and Tommy continuing the family tradition of superhuman abilities.",
    "In WandaVision episode 6, \u2018All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u2019, we saw the boys\u2019 powers manifest for the first time. While out trick-or-treating, Tommy showed he\u2019s just as lightning-fast as his Uncle Pietro, while Billy revealed he has telekinetic and telepathic powers much like his mother, Wanda\u2019s.",
    "We should have seen it coming, of course. In the comics, the twins were members of the teen super-outfit the Young Avengers, and went by the names of Speed and Wiccan \u2013 the costumes Tommy and Billy wore for Halloween were even direct lifts from their comic book counterparts.",
    "So as Wanda and Vision\u2019s offspring become more and more integral to the WandaVision plot, we explain who Billy and Tommy are, their comic book origins, and how their presence may have sinister implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2026",
    "In WandaVision, Billy and Tommy Maximoff are the twin sons of Wanda Maximoff and Vision. They were born in the 1970s sitcom era in Wanda and Vision\u2019s house, with a bit of assistance from Geraldine (later revealed to be SWORD agent Captain Monica Rambeau).",
    "At this point the only thing we know for sure is that their conception wasn\u2019t quite as simple as \u2018when a man and a woman love each other very much\u2026\u2019",
    "At the end of WandaVision episode 2, \u2018Don\u2019t Touch That Dial\u2019, Wanda suddenly discovered she was pregnant. In subsequent instalment \u2018Now in Color\u2019, Wanda\u2019s pregnancy progressed to term in a matter of hours \u2013 she learned she was carrying twins as she gave birth.",
    "The boys\u2019 names were Wanda and Vision\u2019s respective choices \u2013 Wanda wanted Tommy while Vision wanted Billy.",
    "Although the exact circumstances behind the twins\u2019 arrival remains a mystery, it seems that \u2013 unlike Agnes, Herb, Norm and the rest \u2013 they\u2019re not reprogrammed versions of Westview residents.",
    "Having been present at the birth, Monica said that the twins are real, at least in Wanda\u2019s sitcom world: \u201cEverything might look fake in the TV but everything in there is real.\u201d Indeed, there was always something a bit different about Tommy and Billy \u2013 they were the only kids to appear in the show until the sixth episode, \u2018All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u2019",
    "As their parents never tried to keep their own powers hidden from them, Tommy and Billy never saw superhuman abilities as unconventional. Initially it appeared that the extent of their powers was the ability to age themselves in an instant \u2013 in WandaVision episode 5, \u2018On a Very Special Episode\u2019, the boys transformed themselves from infants to 5-year-olds, then 5-year-olds to 10-year-olds, in mere blinks of an eye.",
    "We learned rather more in \u2018All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u2019 when the boys went out trick-or-treating with their mom and her brother, Pietro. Tommy has the speedster abilities of his uncle, aka Quicksilver, while Billy\u2019s skill set echoes his mother\u2019s \u2013 Billy was able to use telekinesis to stop his brother in his tracks, and telepathy to communicate with his dad, Vision, on the edge of town.",
    "None of this will be a surprise to anyone familiar with the comic book versions of the characters. Even the costumes they wore trick-or-treating were consistent with the comic books, providing a great big clue about where the characters were headed.",
    "In the comics, Tommy and Billy are both Members of the Young Avengers, a supergroup of teenage heroes who made their debut in Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung\u2019s Young Avengers #1 in 2005. Other members of the gang include Iron Lad, Hulkling, Miss America and the Kate Bishop version of Hawkeye (set to be played by Hailee Steinfeld in the upcoming Disney Plus Hawkeye series). Tommy goes by the alter-ego of Speed, while Billy is known as Wiccan.",
    "Their backstory in the comics is significantly different to what we\u2019ve seen on screen in WandaVision, however. For starters, Thomas and William (to use their full names) didn\u2019t grow up together, and didn\u2019t meet until their teens.",
    "Thomas Shepherd was the only child of Frank and Mary, was raised in Springfield, New Jersey, and wound up in a detention centre after he accidentally destroyed his school. William Kaplan, meanwhile, was the eldest child of cardiologist Jeff and psychologist Rebecca. In the comics, William\u2019s marriage to Hulkling (aka Teddy Altman) was Marvel\u2019s first superhero same-sex marriage, so assuming the character is also gay in WandaVision, he\u2019d be the MCU\u2019s first gay superhero.",
    "Billy and Tommy\u2019s comic book origins are even more intriguing. Although they were nominally the twin sons of Wanda Maximoff (aka Scarlet Witch) and Vision, they were actually created by Wanda\u2019s magical hex powers \u2013 and she used part of the life essence of Mephisto (Marvel\u2019s version of the Devil) to give the boys souls. Mephisto subsequently reabsorbed these original versions of the boys, but they were later reincarnated as their Young Avengers models.",
    "There\u2019s been plenty of speculation that Mephisto, rather than Wanda, is the true villain of WandaVision \u2013 and that Wanda may have made some kind of deal with him to bring Vision back to life in Westview.",
    "Pietro had a couple of lines in \u2018All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u2019 that suggested that might be the case. First, he told Billy and Tommy, to \u201cUnleash hell, demon spawn!\u201d Then he said to Wanda, \u201cDamn it, if Westview, New Jersey, isn\u2019t charming as hell\u2026\u201d Both could be read as pretty big hints of some kind of demonic influence on proceedings.",
    "In fact, Pietro himself could be Mephisto. After all, he appeared from nowhere, looks nothing like Wanda remembers him, and seems to know a lot more about what\u2019s happening in Westview than your average resident. He\u2019s impressed with what Wanda\u2019s managed to do in the town \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a pretty big leap from giving people nightmares and shooting red wiggly-woos out of your hands\u201d \u2013 and keeps emphasizing that she can trust him. All of this is consistent with the behavior of a manipulative demon.",
    "The presence of Satan would, of course, be a massive leap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the MCU has already incorporated aliens, gods and the supernatural \u2013 with multiverses also imminent \u2013 the Devil feels another thing entirely. Though this wouldn\u2019t be the Lord of Hell\u2019s first screen appearance, with Mephistopheles having been pivotal in the two (non-MCU) Ghost Rider movies, played by Peter Fonda and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds.",
    "Then again, all this could be a red herring even bigger than the fish Wanda and Pietro received on that Sokovian Halloween\u2026",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
