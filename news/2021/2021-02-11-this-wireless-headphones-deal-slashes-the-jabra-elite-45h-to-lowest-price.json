    "Finding a pair of great wireless headphones can be an expensive endeavor, but these fantastic deals from Amazon on the Jabra Elite 45h prove you don't have to break the bank.",
    "In the US, Amazon has slashed the price of the on-ear headphones from $99 to $69, saving you $30.",
    "Meanwhile, UK buyers can save \u00a328 on the Jabra Elite 45h, which have been reduced from \u00a389 to \u00a361 at Amazon. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for the best Jabra headphones prices in your region.)",
    "The Jabra Elite 45h are a great choice if you're looking for wireless headphones and you're on a strict budget.",
    "They combine Bluetooth 5 connectivity, 40mm full-range dynamic drivers and a smattering of physical push-button controls in a wireless on-ear frame. Faux leather and memory foam, combined with winningly un-creaky plastic, make for a comfortable fit (even if the earpads themselves absorb ear-heat quite quickly and then give it straight back).",
    "There\u2019s voice control available from Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. Jabra\u2019s Sound+ control app even walks you through a brief hearing test to establish exactly how the EQs should be set to best suit your ears. By the standards of overtly affordable headphones, the Elite 45h are feature-packed.",
    "And who\u2019s about to argue with 50 hours of battery life from a single charge? There are very few headphones around, at any price, that can challenge that figure \u2013 and these wireless headphones will go for another 10 hours after just 15 minutes of USB-C charging.",
    "Best of all, the Elite 45h sound quite a lot more expensive than they are. They don\u2019t emphasize any part of the frequency range, they uncover plenty of detail, they\u2019re punchily controlled and an all-around fully enthusiastic listen \u2013 which ought to make them sound like worthy of anyone\u2019s money.",
