    "Deathloop is a pithy game full of fascinating systems, so there are going to be plenty of eureka moments as you play through it and try to break the endless loop that Colt is faced with.",
    "This can be an exciting process, but if you\u2019re really struggling and looking for some tips on how to make some progress when you\u2019re stuck in a rut, this guide should provide some useful lesser-known tips to help expand the experience and put more arrows in your creative quiver.",
    "Here are 5 things I wish I knew before starting Deathloop.",
    "Deathloop takes a few hours to get going, and the game only really starts once you unlock Residuum Infusion, which occurs when you complete the \u2018Ubiquity\u2019 lead after hunting Wenjie in The Complex. You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve got it when the game prompts you to infuse items that can carry over into subsequent loops. Don\u2019t dilly-dally in the hours prior to this, as this is when the game really opens up. You can take your time exploring the districts after this point once you have unlocked all of the game\u2019s systems.",
    "Eventually, Deathloop becomes a game about one man\u2019s endless search for working batteries, with many of Blackreef\u2019s most important systems and secrets being locked behind a door that requires multiple battery inputs. You\u2019ll often be able to find batteries in the areas surrounding these doors, in locked rooms and powering other electrical objects, but one key tip to know is that you can also steal batteries from turrets when they\u2019re deployed. Most areas are flush with turrets so this is an easy way to bypass the battery hunt and unlock those secrets early. Be careful not to throw batteries when you\u2019re holding them either, or they will explode. You can also charge dead batteries at special battery-charging stations dotted throughout the districts.",
    "When I first started playing Deathloop I would rush out of the tunnels and dispatch any goons I could see as soon as I noticed the threat. However, I\u2019ve since realised that a softer approach is more beneficial to your overarching mission. If you hear a group of Eternalists strike up a conversation, let it play out and they may well divulge some important information on a nearby Visionary or even a secret code. It\u2019s worth it just to hear the stellar dialogue that is peppered throughout the game!",
    "This one seems obvious, but I was worried about it and didn\u2019t believe it until I confirmed it myself, so it\u2019s worth mentioning here. Items that you infuse with Residuum such as weapons, slabs, upgrades and trinkets will stay in your inventory forever unless you choose to sacrifice them. This means that if you have infused a weapon at noon after a morning run, you don\u2019t need to carry it with you to the end of the loop if you find something better - swap it out for something new before you leave. It will be an option the next morning once you\u2019ve infused it, and the same tracks for slabs and upgrades. Take advantage of this by infusing the slabs you collect early in the loop before swapping them out later to infuse new slabs from Visionaries you kill in the later time periods. This means you can permanently unlock multiple powers in one run!",
    "It can be quite daunting to approach Visionaries, especially in the early game. They\u2019re based in secure compounds and are very powerful. Without the right gear or a stealthy approach, they will turn Colt to mincemeat or overwhelm him with Eternalist cronies. However, you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to kill Visionaries early on, as it is the main way to progress through the game and figure out how to break the loop. Crucially, Visionaries drop slabs that afford Colt with Dishonored-like supernatural powers, and you\u2019re going to need at least two equipped to be operating at full creative/violent capacity. Even if you\u2019ve done what you needed to do in an area, consider trying to kill the Visionaries there to get slab upgrades and upgrade your skills, especially if you have some reprise charges left."
