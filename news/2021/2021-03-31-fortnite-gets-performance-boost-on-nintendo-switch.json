    "The latest Fortnite update on the Nintendo Switch has given players a performance boost, enhancing the game\u2019s visuals and giving Fortnite a more consistent framerate. Fortnite\u2019s total file size has also dropped by over 100MB.",
    "Once you\u2019ve downloaded the latest update \u2013 which you\u2019ll be forced to do to be able to play the battle royale online \u2013 you\u2019ll find that Fortnite now runs at 1170\u00d7660 in handheld and 1560\u00d7880 when docked (up from 1000\u00d7560 and 1390\u00d7780 respectively).",
    "In a blog post for the update, Epic said it should provide significant improvements to Fortnite on Switch \u201cwithout loss of performance.\u201d If you want to experience the new visuals as soon as you can, the update is available to download now.",
    "The update should have been installed automatically, and if you\u2019re able to play the game then you already have it \u2013 as older versions of Fortnite will instruct you to update before you can play.",
    "Though if that hasn\u2019t happened, or you want to be 100% sure, you can download the update manually from the Switch Home Screen. Hover over Fortnite and press the \u2018+\u2019 button to open up Options. Once there, go to Software Update and select Via the Internet to look for and download the latest update.",
    "With the latest update installed you should now be able to enjoy Fortnite\u2019s visual improvements on Switch. Just make sure to keep an eye out for the new raptors roaming the island now too \u2013 they have teeth as sharp as the graphics."
