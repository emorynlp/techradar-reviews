    "Update: Hawkeye episode 4 is available to stream right now. Go go go!",
    "Original story follows.",
    "When will Hawkeye episode 4 be released on Disney Plus? If you've watched the first three episodes of Marvel's latest TV show so far, this is a query that you'll definitely want to have answered.",
    "In the most recent episode of Marvel's latest Phase 4 project, Clint Barton and Kate Bishop were in another predicament. Yep, after the pair broke into Kate's mother's apartment to find out more about the Tracksuit Mafia, Jack Duquesne (Tony Dalton) sprung a surprise on Clint with his own Ronin sword.",
    "It's unclear how they'll get out of this newest pickle, but one thing's for certain: we can expect more humorous and thrilling escapades in the second half of Hawkeye's episodes. And, if one tease from episode 3 is anything to go by, we're in for some major reveals to come in the show's latter half.",
    "But we're getting ahead of ourselves. You want to know when Hawkeye episode 4 is coming to Disney Plus. Below, you'll find out the exact date and time that it will be available to stream, as well as a full release schedule for the rest of the Marvel TV show.",
    "Hawkeye episode 4 will be released on Disney Plus on Wednesday, December 8 at 12 am PT / 3 am ET / 8 am BST / 12:30 pm IST / 5 pm AEST.",
    "Like any other MCU TV show, Hawkeye's release time will vary depending on where you live. For those of you in the US, it'll be a late night. For others, such as UK viewers, it may mean an early start ahead of work. Marvel shows are often discussed at the proverbial watercooler, so you may want to get ahead of the curve in case someone drops any spoilers.",
    "If you can't watch episode 4 until late on Wednesday, you'll want to mute certain words or hashtags on social media. You should mute the likes of #Hawkeye, #Hawkeyespoilers, and #Hawkeyeepisode4 if you don't want anything spoiled before you stream it.",
    "Here's the full release schedule for Hawkeye, including when episodes 4 to 6 will arrive on Disney Plus:",
    "Episode 3 was the shortest entry yet in the series at 43 minutes. And, given that the show's first and second entries were just shy of 50 minutes, we can expect Hawkeye episode 4 to clock in between 40 and 50 minutes. That could change, obviously, but we'd be surprised if it's any longer or shorter than previous entries.",
    "Additionally, we've passed the halfway mark of Hawkeye's six-episode run. So, hopefully, we'll get some big reveals and potential shocks in Hawkeye's final three episodes.",
    "Sort of. Strangely, Marvel Studios hasn't released a mid-season trailer that teases what to expect from Hawkeye's last three episodes. This is something that Marvel's other Disney Plus shows have had but, for some reason, Hawkeye hasn't received one.",
    "Still, we've received a tiny glimpse of what (or, rather, who) will appear in Hawkeye episode 4. A 15-second teaser titled 'Hit the Mark' gives us a blink and you'll miss it look at what appears to be Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova at the 0:11 minute mark:",
    "We know that Yelena will turn up at some point as she looks to avenge Natasha Romanoff's death in Avengers: Endgame. At the end of the Black Widow solo movie, we saw Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Contessa Valentina de Fontaine wrongly tell Yelena that Clint is responsible for Natasha's death. Sure, you can argue that he is on a technicality, but most people will know that he didn't actually kill Natasha on Vormir.",
    "Regardless, Yelena is out for blood and, as we said, we know she's part of Hawkeye's cast. Given that there's not much time left to introduce her in the series \u2013 there's a lot we still need to get through, and we imagine Yelena will end up helping Clint and Kate after he tells Yelena how Natasha died \u2013 she'll have to show up in episode 4, in our opinion.",
    "Of course, we don't know if this teaser's individual is Yelena (it could be someone else), but we'd be very surprised if it isn't. Either way, we don't have much longer to wait to find out."
