    "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself taking a road that Google Maps hasn\u2019t heard of, its upcoming update could be one you\u2019ve been waiting for, as you'll finally have the ability to add new roads to the platform.",
    "In a blog post, Google announced that users will also be able to rename roads, change road directionality and alter or delete existing roads. However, if you\u2019re worried about people messing around and adding incorrect information, Google said it will vet any suggestions before publishing them - though we don\u2019t know how accurate or fast its vetting will be.",
    "Regardless, this new Google Maps tool should make navigating using Google Maps easier than before. The feature will gradually be rolled out over the coming months in over 80 countries where you can already edit map information.",
    "In the same post, Google also discussed other new features that will improve user\u2019s ability to add new content to its Google Maps service.",
    "Soon we\u2019ll be able to more easily take and share images of places we\u2019ve visited without having to leave a longer review. A new \u2018Updates\u2019 section at a location on Google Maps will let you see the recent pictures shared by patrons and merchants at various restaurants, hotels, and other sites.",
    "For those who like giving longer feedback, a new challenge scheme could be for you. Currently only available on Android in the US the \u2018Local Love challenge\u2019 will task all users with adding reviews for their favorite local businesses. Depending on how this challenge goes, Google has said it could try similar campaigns in other parts of the world in the future.",
