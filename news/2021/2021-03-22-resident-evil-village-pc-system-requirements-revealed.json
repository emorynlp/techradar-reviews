    "Capcom has revealed the Resident Evil Village PC system requirements on its Steam page for the game ahead of its May 7 2021 release, with further details on requirements for ray tracing available on Capcom\u2019s Japanese website.",
    "Will you need to break the bank on PC upgrades to be able to run the game, then? Not necessarily, as Resident Evil Village looks to be impressively scalable on lower to mid-range PCs, too, as was the case with Resident Evil 7 and the Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 remakes.",
    "The minimum and recommended Resident Evil Village PC system requirements are as follows:",
    "Minimum requirements (1080p)",
    "Recommended requirements (1080p)",
    "Ray tracing recommended requirements (4K)",
    "At this point, Capcom seems to have a decent grasp on developing robust PC ports, as judging by Resident Evil Village\u2019s PC requirements, you should be able to run the game on a wide variety of machines. You may just have to tone down some graphics settings to get it running smoothly on older cards.",
    "Capcom has yet to confirm Resident Evil Village\u2019s file size on PC, but a leak via the PlayStationSize twitter account points to the game\u2019s PS5 file size being around 27GB barring any day one patches.",
    "However, the official Microsoft Store listing totals Resident Evil Village\u2019s file size at around 45GB, but this could be accounting for a day one patch as well as the inclusion of the bonus multiplayer game Resident Evil Re:Verse that\u2019s bundled with Resident Evil Village."
