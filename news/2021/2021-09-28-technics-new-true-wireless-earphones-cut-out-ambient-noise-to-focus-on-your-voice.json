    "While Technics might have a reputation for pristine audio replication, its latest true wireless earphones focus instead on the sound of your voice when you\u2019re on a phone call.",
    "The two new earphones are called the EAH-AZ60 and the EAH-AZ40, both of which feature the company\u2019s new JustMyVoice technology to detect voices when speaking and eliminate background noise during phone calls.",
    "Both pairs of buds release in October, and have near-identical designs with the same IPX4 rating and multipoint pairing.",
    "The difference between the two models is that the AZ60 will offer active noise cancellation on top of the JustMyVoice technology, while the AZ40 model will not. In addition, the AZ60 supports the LDAC audio codec and has 8mm drivers versus the 6mm drivers on the AZ40. That said, you\u2019re looking at $229 / \u00a3199 (around AU$300) for the AZ60 and $149 / \u00a3129 (around AU$200) for the AZ40.",
    "It\u2019s interesting that Technics is targeting call quality with its latest true wireless earphones \u2013 it\u2019s an area that certainly doesn\u2019t get enough attention from headphone makers.",
    "The reason why call quality is less-than-ideal on most true wireless earbuds is because they use a beamforming microphone array that should, in theory, only pick up noise coming from in front of your face, but instead seems to pick up all the ambient noise in the area.",
    "Companies like Technics are trying to fix that by adding in more microphones to pick up your voice and software that can eliminate background noise on the fly. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen in some of the best true wireless earbuds like the Sony WF-1000XM4 in the past, and it\u2019s good to see other brands doubling down on the technology.",
    "We\u2019ll have to hear them \u2013 and have others hear us \u2013 before we can pass any sort of judgment on Technics\u2019 new true wireless earphones, but the direction is encouraging and could be incredibly helpful \u2013 as these days we use earbuds for much more than just our favorite music."
