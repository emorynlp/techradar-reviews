    "SanDisk Professional is hitting the ground running with a fleet of new products to fit in at every corner of a professional workflow.",
    "SanDisk Professional\u2019s PRO-READER series will give professionals working with media a high-speed interface for transferring files to their workstation from a broad array of sources, ranging from CFast, CFexpress, CF, RED MINI-MAG, SD, and microSD cards. Similarly, the new PRO-DOCK 4 aims to streamline ingest by enabling reading up to four cards simultaneously.",
    "Of course, large projects require storage mediums and secure backups as well. SanDisk Professional\u2019s new PRO-CINEMA CFexpress VPG400 card can suit the needs of videographers and photographers with guaranteed minimum high speeds and capacity. Once you need to move your projects onto more permanent storage, SanDisk Professional\u2019s broad product portfolio will fit the bill.",
    "The SanDisk Professional G-DRIVETM SSD will cover you for smaller backups up to 2TB* while providing serious portability in a compact and durable enclosure . Meanwhile, the G-DRIVE PRO SSD provides extra fast access to your data with a Thunderbolt 3 interface, moving up to 50GB in 1 minute or less, making even large transfers and backups a task that doesn\u2019t have to take all day.",
    "For the biggest storage needs, the G-RAIDTM 2 can house two hard drives for up to 36TB* of capacity from 7,200RPM hard drives. This drive naturally runs in a RAID configuration, giving you the option of RAID 1 for more data safety through redundancy or RAID 0 for faster speeds up to 500MB/s.** It can even daisy chain with another five units, expanding to meet growing needs. The G-RAID SHUTTLE 4 takes that even further with room for up to 72TB* of storage across four internal enterprise-class drives, providing more RAID configuration options as well as a max transfer speed over a Thunderbolt 3 port of 1,020MB/s** with dual mode USB compatibility. Finally, the G-RAID SHUTTLE 8 expands on that with eight internal enterprise-class drives, as well as USB Power Delivery to serve as a hub in a pro workstation setup.",
    "The new SanDisk Professional brand extends the reach of the SanDisk brand we all know with pro-oriented products that also incorporate the prestige of Western Digital\u2019s pro-grade G-Technology brand.",
    "For all your work needs, whether you\u2019re taking your data with you on the go or you need massive backup capacity with flexible RAID options, the new line of SanDisk Professional products offers scalable and modular storage solutions for every use case.",
    "Pictures shown may vary from actual products. Product specifications subject to change without notice.",
    "*1TB = 1 trillion bytes. Actual user capacity may vary. For RAID products, storage is based on RAID 0 mode.",
    "**For transfer speeds, 1MB/s = 1 megabyte per second. Based on internal testing; performance may vary depending on host device, usage conditions, drive capacity and other factors."
