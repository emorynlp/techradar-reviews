  "summary": "Windows 11\u2019s possible imminent reveal has been hinted at again",
  "article": [
    "Windows 11 could be the name of the revamped OS that Microsoft is about to reveal as Windows 10\u2019s successor, with a number of hints dropped recently suggesting that\u2019s the case \u2013 and here\u2019s another.",
    "As spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft just uploaded a YouTube video which teases folks about being excited for the upcoming big reveal planned for later in June, providing a way to \u2018relax\u2019 if you\u2019re overly worked up about the prospect of, well, maybe Windows 11.",
    "Microsoft says: \u201cHaving trouble relaxing because you\u2019re too excited for the June 24th Microsoft Event? Take a slow trip down memory lane with the Windows 95, XP, and 7 startup sounds slowed down to a meditative 4,000% reduced speed.\u201d",
    "The key point here is that the clip is 11 minutes long \u2013 11:00 bang on \u2013 which combines with a number of other 11-based hints we\u2019ve already heard.",
    "Remember that Microsoft\u2019s event is scheduled for 11am on June 24 (bear in mind that 11 in the morning is not typical timing for a Microsoft press event). Also, a previous teaser video appears to show the number \u201811\u2019 in a shadow, too \u2013 kind of \u2013 and some prominent leakers, like Evan Blass, have already asserted that Windows 11 is imminent.",
    "The length of this YouTube clip isn\u2019t the only clue here, either. The video contains a lot of gentle backgrounds, which include a plain blue one, plus some photos of the sky and clouds.",
    "However, there\u2019s also a pastoral valley scene bathed in sunlight right at the start of the video (well, eight seconds in), and another scene of the same nature at around the four minute mark \u2013 with similar takes on this following, clearly depicting a number of green valleys with some blazing rays of sunshine for good measure.",
    "So, those could be seen as references to \u2018Sun Valley\u2019, the codename for the big revamp of Windows 10 which will see the interface visited with major (supposedly revolutionary) changes, and the big name switch \u2013 presumably to Windows 11.",
    "All of these supposed hints may mean absolutely nothing, and could just be coincidences, although at this point it now seems a coincidence or two too many. There\u2019s also the possibility that Microsoft might be pranking us and throwing some red herrings around\u2026",
    "We\u2019ll know in just a couple of weeks, of course, but given that Microsoft has let us know that support is officially ending for Windows 10 in 2025, it now seems to be certain that the OS will have a successor; whether it\u2019s Windows 11 or not. Other possibilities for new names which have been floating around include just plain \u2018Windows\u2019, or Windows 365, or even Windows Sun Valley (the latter clues of the valley scenes are present in this new video clip, too, of course)."
