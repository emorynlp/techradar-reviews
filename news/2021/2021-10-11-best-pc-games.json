    "While there\u2019s a never-ending stream of PC games out there to play, a small number of them stand above the rest and remind you why you splurged so much on maxed-out gaming laptops or gaming PCs.",
    "To really get that immersive experience, gorgeous graphics, and demanding gameplay, not to mention the most out of potent GPUs like the Nvidia RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, you have to turn to the best PC games of 2021. Theyill take you on adventures you\u2019ve never dreamed of and landscapes that will take weeks to fully uncover. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re planning out an assassination in exotic locales, flying across the world in a simulator that almost feels real, or dungeon crawling across a mythic underworld. You won\u2019t want to turn away from your screen.",
    "And, no matter what kind of titles you generally like, there\u2019s something here that will keep your gaming tastes satiated, from online games like the best co-op PC games or best MMOs to open-world games that will transport you to their worlds. So, take a look at the best PC games available right now to pick your next escapade.",
    "The Life Is Strange games have always put an emphasis on strong narratives and its newest entry, Life Is Strange: True Colors, is no different. Like the previous games, the main protagonist has a subtle power you can use to move forward in the story while keeping it grounded.",
    "In this game, you play as Alex Chen trying to uncover the truth behind her brother\u2019s accidental death. You use her power of empathy to find out what\u2019s going on, a power that lets you experience and manipulate others\u2019 emotions. Roam around a gorgeous open environment and follow the different story threads to uncover the town\u2019s dark secrets.",
    "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is aging like fine wine. Even several years after it hit the streets, it\u2019s still one of the most impressive open world games that\u2019s ever existed \u2013 mixing Skyrim\u2019s unapologetic scale with Grand Theft Auto V\u2019s incredible depth. It\u2019s such a jam-packed game, which is why it claims the top spot on our list of the best PC games in 2021. Staggering, beautiful and an absolute time sink \u2013 in a good way \u2013 The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn\u2019t just the best PC game of 2021 or among the best open world games on PC. It might just be one of the best video games of all time.",
    "Ultra-violence and constant motion meet in this post-apocalyptic dystopian game. This FPP is not for the faint of heart \u2013 it\u2019s tense, exhilarating, and you will probably die over and over trying to beat it. If you ever wanted a game that came in equal parts Doom Eternal and Mirror\u2019s Edge, you found it in Ghostrunner.",
    "The game is set in Dharma Tower, a sort-of last refuge for humanity, where you ascend the tower through platforming and katana-induced carnage to take revenge on a ruthless ruler. You do so by slicing up your enemies, dodging bullets, and using a number of unique abilities to continue making your way to the top. This is the kind of game that will leave you out of breath just playing it. And, if that sounds like your kind of game, then you\u2019re in for a treat.",
    "Supergiant Games has made a name for itself thanks to the great reception that Pyre, Transistor, and, most recently, Bastion has received. Fans of the studio have a new entry to add to the studio\u2019s pantheon of great games: Hades. Hades uses the same isometric view of the other games and tells the story of Hades\u2019 son, Zagreus, trying to escape the underworld.",
    "This roguelike dungeon crawler has a few new features up its sleeve. Not only can you romance some characters for extra bonuses, but dying in the game doesn\u2019t start you at the last checkpoint. When you die, you might start at the beginning but you\u2019re not starting over. You\u2019re able to upgrade your character and weapons to improve your chances of escaping with each subsequent death. This leads to a sense of progression that makes for a very addictive game.",
    "It\u2019s not hard to see why Control has taken the gaming world by storm. The creative team at Remedy Entertainment made sure to pack this title with plenty to love, paying very close attention to the intricate details. A deeply cinematic game, this action-adventure offers its players staggering visuals, inspired environment design and brilliant performances \u2013 not to mention, a deeply satisfying combat experience.",
    "Control places you in the capable shoes of fiery-haired Jesse Faden. You\u2019re tasked to seek out The Oldest House, a building in New York City that\u2019s in a constant state of architectural flux and only appears to those who desire to find it, and locate your missing brother, all while heading the Federal Bureau of Control as its director and overseeing the containment of paranatural entities.",
    "There\u2019s nothing quite like Control on the market, and it makes it one of the best PC games to play right now.",
    "If you ever wondered what Groundhog Day would look like in-game form, wonder no more. Deathloop, from the makers of the Dishonored series, gives the first-person shooter a fun little twist with some added strategy.",
    "In this stylish game, you play as Colt, who\u2019s stuck on an island in a time loop with a rival assassin. And, to break the loop, you have to kill eight targets before the day ends; otherwise, you start over. However, as each day resets, you\u2019ll learn what works and what doesn\u2019t, changing playstyles and learning the terrain until you find the best way to break the loop.",
    "Beyond its impeccable graphics and its excellent peripheral support, it won\u2019t take you long to realize that the Microsoft Flight Simulator is a labor of love. There\u2019s a great attention to detail here, as well as a level of realism and immersion you won\u2019t find elsewhere. So much so that if you\u2019re not a fan of flight simulations, you\u2019ll want to start getting on the bandwagon. Though that also means this game won\u2019t be for everyone. Still, if you\u2019re a flight sim fanatic or you love planes and flying, you\u2019ll relish the chance to fly iconic vehicles in some of the most beautiful yet dangerous locations and conditions in the world.",
    "Read the full review: Microsoft Flight Simulator",
    "Hitman 3 closes out the rebooted trilogy with another gorgeous entry that hews close to what makes these games so unique. It doesn\u2019t redefine the gameplay but it does introduce six new maps and wraps up the story started in 2016\u2019s Hitman. Just like the previous games, Hitman 3's maps will take you all over the world from Dubai and England to China and more.",
    "If you\u2019re not familiar with the gameplay of this series, you\u2019re in for a treat. As Agent 47, you play a calm and calculating hitman whose job is not to run and gun through a mob of bad guys as most games would have you do. Instead, you move around large maps like an English manor to find and eliminate your targets quietly and undetected. On top of that, you can play the same map multiple times to find a multitude of ways or story paths to take out your targets, giving this entry, as well as the previous ones, the kind of replayability you don\u2019t see in most games.",
    "Monster Hunter is one of the biggest gaming franchises you\u2019ve probably never heard of for years now. With Monster Hunter: World, the series broke into the mainstream and came to the PC (much to many gamers\u2019 relief), and now, it\u2019s one of the best PC games you can play to date.",
    "Monster Hunter: World puts you in the shoes of a monster hunter, and you\u2019ll hunt increasingly bigger and meaner monsters, strip them for parts, and craft bigger, badder armor. It\u2019s a deviously simple gameplay loop that ends up being one of the most compelling and rewarding PC games you can play right now.",
    "There\u2019s an incessant onslaught of content in this game, and Capcom, the developers of this monster hunting hit, are committed to bringing a wealth of free DLC to the game \u2013 as well as a new frosty expansion in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. If you\u2019re looking for an addictive, immersive and most importantly, fun game to play on your own or with all your closest friends cooperatively, Monster Hunter: World is the PC game of your dreams. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s one of the best PC games you can buy today.",
    "If the name Norman Reedus is what got your attention when someone mentioned Death Stranding, well then you\u2019re in for a treat. However, this game is getting a lot of attention for more than just the big names attached to it, which incidentally include Mads Mikkelsen and L\u00e9a Seydoux. As porter Sam Bridges, you bravely traverse an apocalyptic United States to deliver valuable cargo, navigating lands overrun by terrorists, bandits and these invisible creatures called Beached Things. This award-winning action game is a treat to all the senses as well, thanks to its great storyline, which may be reminiscent of the current pandemic, good gameplay, fun quests, and impressive sound and visuals.",
    "Mass Effect Legendary Edition may not be a new game, per se, but it gets a shiny coat of paint as well as a few extras that make one of the most exciting gaming series ever worth revisiting. It\u2019s not only been remastered with the ability to play in 4K, but it comes with just about all the content of the first three games including their DLCs. Additionally, there have been some technical and gameplay improvements for a more seamless experience.",
    "If you\u2019ve never encountered Commander Shepherd and the vast ME universe, this is the perfect time. This epic space saga not only takes you across multiple galaxies and worlds but pits you against all sorts of enemies. Whether you follow the main story or one of the many side quests, the narrative is engrossing. Best of all, you get all three games in a single package.",
    "The newest release from Rockstar Games was an instant hit upon release. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an engrossing western following Arthur Morgan and his gang as they try to survive a fictionalized Wild West as outlaws on the run. However, the game is much more than just that.",
    "Whether it\u2019s getting lost in the story, following through on every side quest to its conclusion, or just bonding with your horse, RDR2 is one of those games where you can easily sink 50+ hours into and still have something to do. The gameplay is stellar, and the graphics are gorgeous. You can even run the game in 8K, if you have the hardware. Definitely give this a look if you haven\u2019t already.",
    "Doom: Eternal takes everything from the remastered Doom of 2016 and turns it up to 11. The game is intense, visually and sonically overwhelming, and is exactly what you would expect a fever dream inspired by Doom would feel like.",
    "The gameplay is a seamless first-person shooter where you trek into hell to battle an assortment of never-ending demons and reclaim an overrun earth. Refilling your health sometimes requires quite literally tearing monsters apart, and there is some need to be creative with your weapon choice, depending on what demon you\u2019re facing. However, this game is all about creating havoc and rushing into battle as loud and as brash as possible.",
    "Not only is Doom: Eternal a hell of a ride (pun intended). It\u2019s also a gorgeous looking game that takes advantage of the newest hardware. And, it\u2019s a 2v1 multiplayer mode where one player takes control of the \u201cslayer\u201d and faces off against two more player-controlled demons.",
    "No game has been as anticipated for as much or as long as Half Life 3. So, as gamers will have to wait a little longer for it, Valve has graced us with what may be the most compelling reason to get a VR headset with Half-Life: Alyx.",
    "Half-Life: Alyx is set 5 years before Half-Life 2. What starts as a rescue mission for the protagonist\u2019s father evolves into attempting to steal a superweapon from the alien overlords. From the interactive puzzles, the well-thought out combat and the fantastic story, this prequel is a welcome dive back into the Half-Life world that has been universally praised for its quality.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for an excuse to get into VR gaming, this might be the one for you. Half-Life: Alyx\u2019s attention to detail shows what can be done with VR when taken seriously.",
    "Microsoft's racing series is only getting better with each release, and in many ways this spin-off has exceeded the main Forza Motorsport line as the best racing games on PC at present. They're definitely more fun, adding a dash of arcade fun to the strikingly recreated cars and race tracks we've come to expect from Forza.",
    "Forza Horizon 4 is easily one of the best PC games you can buy today, and this entry brings the racing to the UK after having explored America, France, Italy and Australia in the previous three instalments of the franchise. Now, you can rip through charming villages, seaside towns and the city of Edinburgh by way of many miles of country roads and dirt tracks in between. It's fast, frantic and a lot of fun.",
    "You can purchase Forza Horizon 4 through the Microsoft Store. It's also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass for PC, or you can buy the Xbox One version and get a download code for PC using the Xbox Anywhere feature.",
    "If you like the idea of playing games like Dark Souls that are so hard you\u2019ll exhaust the depths of your expletive-filled vocabulary, then Nioh 2 should probably be next on your list to buy. Like From Software\u2019s games, Nioh 2 rewards you for learning the fighting systems inside and out and squeezing every advantage out of its loot, weapons, and Yokai skills to gain the upper hand. You can gain more and more Yokai skills as you defeat enemies. You also have quite a bit of customization available to you for deeper gameplay. This sequel is a worthy follow up to the first game, also set in a fictionalized, fantastical version of historical Japan, that will have you either squealing in delight or screaming in anger.",
    "From Software is a household name when it comes to designing the best PC games. The minds behind the critically praised Dark Souls series have transported PC gamers to some of the most forsaken landscapes and through some of the most challenging yet rewarding gameplay. From Software is back at it once more, with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.",
    "Sekiro places you in the shoes of the Young Wolf, a shinobi tasked with rescuing his young master. The game will take you through 16th-century Japan, but things will get eerie and supernatural: this is From Software we\u2019re talking about.",
    "Don\u2019t expect an easy time of it, however. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an awfully difficult game to master, and you\u2019ll need quick reflexes to deflect enemy attacks, as well as to master stealth. You won\u2019t be able to hide behind a shield all day, like you were able to in Dark Souls III.",
    "The phrase \"build it, and they will come\" rings truer than ever with Minecraft, the survival-based sandbox RPG that has now been bought more than 100 million times since its release in 2009. In it, you can construct your own worlds using resources you find in the wild, or discover existing ones created by other players online.",
    "In Minecraft, you can either limit yourself to the numerous tools and blocks offered by the developer, Mojang, or you can install mods to truly capitalize on your investment. Moreover, sometime in 2021, you\u2019ll be able to take part in the Super Duper Graphics Pack, an optional piece of DLC that offers more realistic lighting effects and textures to an already amazing game.",
    "Sid Meier's Civilization VI is the most recent installment in the iconic turn-based strategy game, and it's without a doubt among the best PC games you can play to date. One of the things that make the PC the best platform for gaming on is the sheer breadth of different game genres on offer. And, what Civilization VI has to offer is its massive scope, despite the fact that it might seem slower paced next to the likes of Fortnite.",
    "Spread your empire across the map and crush your enemies. You build up your empire from a simple settlement to a world power, and you can decide to do this through military might, technological supremacy or cultural influence. Since its launch in 2016, it has had two expansion packs that really cement this game as an epic entry in our best PC games list. Civilization VI: Rise and Fall released in February 2018, with Civilization VI: Gathering Storm following in February 2019.",
    "Still among the biggest games in the world a few years after its release, Fortnite Battle Royale is a natural shoo-in for this list. After all, it is a global phenomenon and among the best PC games to play right now if you like super-competitive online games. This is a game people keep coming back to, and that's mostly due to its addictive gameplay and regular updates from Epic.",
    "Fortnite Battle Royale is actually a game mode for the Fortnite game, but this mode has become so popular, many people consider it a separate game in its own right. As with other Battle Royale games, the aim of Fortnite Battle Royale is to fight your way through an ever-shrinking map until you're the last player standing. While that might sound simple enough, there's a whole lot of depth to this game once you start playing.",
    "Paradise Lost is a game that will intrigue fans of alternate history. It\u2019s set in a world where World War 2 ended in the nuclear destruction of Europe by the Nazis. Almost 20 years after that apocalyptic event finds you, playing as 12-year old Szymon, exploring an abandoned Nazi bunker looking in search of a mysterious man.",
    "The gameplay is in line with other walking simulators. And, since your only communication is through the bunker\u2019s technology with a mysterious girl named Ewa, this game may remind you of Firewatch by way of Bioshock. Though it\u2019s a short game, the cost of entry is just right to dive into this adventure."
