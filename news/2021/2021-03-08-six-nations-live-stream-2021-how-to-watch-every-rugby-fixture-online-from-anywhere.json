    "Just three months after last year's tournament came to a close, the 2021 Six Nations is under way and once again it's proving to be quite a special spectacle - one featuring Covid-secure bubbles, squads stretched to their very limits, and remarkable results. It's unlike almost anything we've seen before, so read on as our guide explains how to watch a Six Nations 2021 live stream in time for the next big kick-off and international rugby fixtures - including for free in the UK and Ireland.",
    "Reigning champions England came into the Six Nations as firm favourites, yet it's actually Wales who are now leading the home islands pack after sealing a famous Triple Crown victory with a 40-24 win over Eddie Jones' Red and Whites - even if it was one that featured a few controversial calls from a French referee.",
    "As expected, we've also had a smattering of 11th-hour disruptions to contend with, like the postponement of the last round's scheduled France vs Scotland match. Did it stop Les Bleus and their early momentum, as they now sit behind Wales in the 2021 Six Nations table - albeit with a match in hand?",
    "Fabien Galthi\u00e9's France certainly have the talent to win it all and shed the 'nearly-man' tag that England consigned them to twice last year, with Eddie Jones' squad winning both the Six Nations and Autumn Nation Cups. But the Red and Whites have lost to the Scots as well as the Welsh now, leaving this year's tournament particularly wide open.",
    "The usually fancied Irish lost their first two matches to rule themselves out of contention for the 2021 Six Nations crown - even if they beat Scotland's young upstart side at the weekend. While Italy? Oh Italy. Once again a dead cert for the wooden spoon, there's now talk of them being replaced in the competition by a more competitive side.",
    "It's the most unpredictable tournament we've seen in years, so follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a 2021 Six Nations live stream wherever you are right now - starting with how to watch the Six Nations for FREE in the UK and Ireland.",
    "If you're outside your country of residence - whether that be the UK or anywhere else - and try to start streaming the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",

    "Despite suffering defeat in their opener, England were crowned champions for the first time since 2017, pipping a resurgent France to the post by the finest of margins on the final weekend of the longest Six Nations tournament ever.",
    "Taking place each year from the first weekend of February and usually concluding by the end of March, the tournament is contested by the international sides of France, England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales.",
    "Each Six Nations team plays the other five once per season with home advantage in alternate seasons, giving a total of 15 matches per Championship. A win earns that team four points, while a draw earns both teams two points.",
    "A losing side receives no points, however a bonus point can be picked up by a team regardless if they won, lost or drew if they score four or more tries in a game. Losing sides can also still pick up two bonus points if they score four tries or more in the process and lose by a margin of seven points or fewer.",
    "The team with the most points at the season wins the Six Nations Championship Trophy. If the winning team has defeated all five other Unions, it is given the title \u2018Grand Slam Winner\u2019.",
    "Reigning champions England lead the pack with seven wins, with Wales and France both close behind on five and Ireland on four."
