    "When it comes to horse races - or to global sporting events in general - they don't come much more anticipated than the Grand National at the famous Aintree Racecourse. And - depending on your philosophy and superstitions - the day has come to either toss out the form book or bury your nose in it. Read on as our guide tells you how to watch a 2021 Grand National live stream from anywhere in the world - including for FREE.",
    "Perhaps the biggest news in the lead-up has been that there's no Tiger Roll in this year's running. The withdrawal of the 2018 and 2019 winner means Red Rum's treble remains a unique feat nearly half a century on from the legendary thoroughbred's 1977 Grand National triumph - and that this race's odds have been blown wide open.",
    "Cloth Cap looks likely to start as one of the favourites in Tiger Roll's stead, the nine-year-old having won both of his last two races at Kelso and at Newbury. However, this will be Cloth Cap's first taste of Aintree.",
    "Potters Corner, the winner of last year's Virtual Grand National, is a contender with bags of Aintree experience, while Secret Reprieve, Any Second Now, Burrows Saint, Discorama and The Storyteller are some of the other big names in the frame.",
    "It's the most famous steeplechase in the world, with 40 runners and riders busting their lungs over 4 miles and 514 yards, 30 fences and two laps of Aintree Racecourse. Follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a 2021 Grand National live stream from anywhere - including for FREE in the UK and Ireland.",
    "If you're outside your country of residence and try to stream the Grand National via your usual broadcaster, you'll likely discover that you can't due to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "But there's still a way to tune in! By downloading and installing a VPN, you can tell your device it's back at home and enjoy your home coverage wherever you are. Make sure you read all the fine print first, though, ensuring you're in compliance with any terms and conditions.",
