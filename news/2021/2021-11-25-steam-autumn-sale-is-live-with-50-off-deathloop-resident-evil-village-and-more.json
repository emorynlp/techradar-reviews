    "Steam has some huge deals for Black Friday week, which the games store now calls its Autumn Sale, running from now until December 1 (next Wednesday).",
    "The amount of big discounts rattling about is intimidating, frankly, and no doubt if you have a decent-sized wishlist of Steam games \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 there\u2019ll be a big list of price cuts already piped through to you in a lengthy Steam Autumn Sale email.",
    "But outside of the games you\u2019re keeping an eye on, there may be other top-notch deals that could fly under your radar, which is why we\u2019re going to quickly go through some highlights here \u2013 before picking out a few of our absolute favorites in the deal boxes below.",
    "If you\u2019re after massive discounts, it\u2019s worth checking out The Sims 4 which is 88% off (as is the Deluxe Edition), Death Stranding which is discounted to the tune of 70%, and Control Ultimate Edition which is also 70% off. Another biggie is Doom Eternal Deluxe Edition at 75% off.",
    "Other notable bargains include Amazon\u2019s MMOG New World which is 25% off at Steam, and there\u2019s a 40% price cut for Days Gone.",
    "Red Dead Redemption 2 is now half-price (with the Ultimate Edition not much more expensive as it has a 60% haircut), plus Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition is 35% off. The freshly unleashed Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy also matches that with a discount of 35%, and Valheim just got a bit cheaper with a 20% price cut.",
