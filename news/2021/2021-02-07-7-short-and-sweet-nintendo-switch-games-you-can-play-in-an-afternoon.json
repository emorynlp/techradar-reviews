    "If you want to play the best Nintendo Switch games, but don\u2019t have the time to explore every crevice in Breath of the Wild, or grind your way through the interconnecting lives of Octopath Traveler, we have just the list for you.",
    "There are a huge number of Switch games you can blitz through in a few hours, and are no less deserving of your time than the longer, bigger games available on the best-selling Nintendo console.",
    "One of the biggest perks of the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite is their portability: you can play it on the sofa, while in the kitchen, the bed, or (in normal times) on your commute, and the handheld form factor makes it ideal for short and sweet play sessions that don\u2019t need a huge time investment.",
    "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together our favorite seven Nintendo Switch games that you can play from start to finish in an afternoon \u2013 or in a handful of short bursts. There are certainly more than seven out there, but it\u2019s fitting, we think, to make sure this list isn\u2019t too long either.",
    "A Short Hike was a standout Switch game from 2020. In it, you play as a young bird-lady called Claire as she attempts to climb a mountain. The game has a highly satisfying progression system \u2013 based around finding \u2018golden feathers\u2019 to help Claire fly higher \u2013 despite its brief playtime. You\u2019ll meet an eclectic cast of characters, from hapless mountain climbers to shady feather dealers trying to fund their way through college \u2013 and the game\u2019s final moments are definitely worth the trek.",
    "How long to play? 2-4 hours",
    "You\u2019ll also find Florence on iOS, but the Switch is a natural home for the brief interactive romance, which charts the inception, duration, and ending of a romance between a young accountant and a sax musician. While its mechanics are simple (you can play it on an iPhone too, after all), it manages to feel full of heart and emotionally weighty, with gorgeous animations that truly do justice to the small moments that make up a relationship.",
    "How long to play? 1 hour",
    "Sayonara Wild Hearts is a pulsing rhythm action game, and one of the most stylish titles you can find on Nintendo Switch today. You play as a woman trying to piece her broken heart together, while running, jumping, and motorcycling her way through flashy neon levels to the tune of the Sayonara Wild Hearts\u2019 pumping soundtrack. This is a game all about timing, and well worth replaying to get the most synchronous, on-the-beat experience you can.",
    "How long to play? 2-3 hours",
    "This award-winning walking sim from developer Giant Sparrow is a must-play game for the way it seamlessly blends environmental storytelling with interactive mechanics. You play as Edith Finch, who has returned to her \u2018cursed\u2019 family home to investigate the deaths of her family members, reliving their experiences as fragments from a diary play out in your surroundings.",
    "But even in the midst of a towering, ramshackle home-turned-mausoleum, there is a lightness and playfulness that turns her family tragedies into fantastical tales, the truth of which is never quite pinned down.",
    "The imagination in this game is, frankly, dizzying \u2013 whether you\u2019re hurtling down a mountain as a great white shark, teleporting to another dimension, or figuring out how to unlock the door to the basement. It\u2019ll only take 2-3 hours to play through, too.",
    "If you\u2019re hungry for more spooky walking sims around deserted houses, check out Gone Home (The Fullbright Company) on Nintendo Switch too.",
    "How long to play? 2-3 hours",
    "Switch games don\u2019t get much prettier than this. Gris is a heartachingly animated 2D platformer, with soft brushstrokes of watercolor slowly filling in your surroundings as you progress through ruins, deserts and skies to try and leave the dark ink-blot of grief behind you.",
    "There is a progression system of sorts, and a few nifty manoeuvres to help you navigate the game\u2019s delicately arranged levels, but Gris is largely about bringing color back into a gray world \u2013 and the platforming is more than good enough to hold up for its short playtime. Everything from the shape-shifting dress of the protagonist to the game\u2019s awe-inspiring, crumbling statues has a true artist\u2019s touch, and it\u2019s something we\u2019d love to see more of on Nintendo\u2019s handheld-hybrid console.",
    "How long to play? 4-6 hours",
    "No, it\u2019s not really about donuts \u2013 but Donut County is a smart and playful puzzler very much worth your (limited) time. You play as a mischievous racoon in control of a sinkhole, one that gets ever larger as you figure out how to manoeuvre a town\u2019s objects, cars, buildings and people into its endless void. Existential? Very. Delicious? That too.",
    "How long to play? 2 hours",
    "You don\u2019t need to understand this game to have a good time. While Katana Zero is big on flashy world-lore, with a time-bending drug called \u2018Chronos\u2019 that lets your katana-wielding assassin undo their actions on the fly, it\u2019s the moment-to-moment action that really gives it pulling power. The thrill of rewinding a level, second by second, to get that perfect run-through, is a real delight \u2013 while the quirkier sides of the game add a brilliant sense of spontaneity, whether that\u2019s knocking someone out with a stone bust, debating life\u2019s meaning with cosmic beings, or turning on your therapist. Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.",
