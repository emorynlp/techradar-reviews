    "Search \u2018running\u2019 in the App Store or Play Store and you\u2019ll find hundreds of apps. There are apps for pairing devices, apps for logging your runs, apps for comparing your distances with others, even apps for gamifying your workouts.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a running app, then, you\u2019re spoiled for choice. But no one will ever simply say to themselves \u201cI want a running app.\u201d An app for what, exactly? The possibilities are almost endless.",
    "I\u2019m in a bind. I need an app to help me retrain after an injury, but I don\u2019t want a generalized running app, because I\u2019ve already got too many of them, and I\u2019ve tested loads in my quest to run the entirety of Route 66 in two years.",
    "It\u2019s impossible to know if there\u2019s actually an app out there that fits my needs, because there are so many jack-of-all-trades platforms. It\u2019s made me realize that there are far too many generalized running apps out there, and maybe not enough for specific tasks.",
    "As detailed in my last running column, I\u2019m recovering from a foot injury, but in less than five weeks I\u2019ve also got a half marathon that I need to train up for \u2013 I\u2019m going from zero to 13.1 (or 21.1 if you want to be all metric about it) in a month.",
    "That\u2019s a totally plausible goal: when I started writing my running columns at the beginning of the year, I ran my own half marathon without training for it just to prove to myself that I could. But it was tough going, and I turned in a pretty poor time compared to actual organized half marathons I\u2019ve participated in.",
    "For my upcoming attempt I decided to look for online training plans, and via a quick Google search I found a few options that promised to help me build up to the full distance in a month. But these seemed designed for people who hadn\u2019t run much before, but who also had loads of time on their hands, and neither of those things is appropriate for me.",
    "But while I was looking up at my computer for a training plan, my phone made a little \u2018ping\u2019 - it was some game begging me to play again after a whole 24 hours away. And that\u2019s when I realized that my phone, and its apps, could be the driving force I need.",
    "What I was ideally looking for was a training app into which I could input my running details and training goal (half marathon, in this case), which would then tell me what kind of workout I\u2019d need to do each day to hit that goal. Even more ideally, I\u2019d then report my actual performance, and the app would adjust the predictions and plans accordingly.",
    "Being a tech writer \u2013 and specifically a tech writer writing about running apps \u2013 I didn\u2019t just download one or two apps, but filled a whole screen on my phone with a selection, ready to try out. However, not one of them provided what I was looking for.",
    "Many of the apps let me record my height, weight and other personal details, but then just put me on some generic plan that I could\u2019ve found online. Slightly worryingly, all of these random services now have my personal details \u2013 and I didn\u2019t even use the apps for running.",
    "There are plenty of paid apps out there, though what you actually get for your money in most cases wasn\u2019t clear \u2013 and I\u2019m too poor to afford some regular subscription, especially if I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m paying for.",
    "After testing dozens of apps, I felt like I\u2019d just seen the same platform in different skins \u2013 none had provided me what I was looking for.",
    "That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no such thing as an in-depth marathon-planning app; I just didn\u2019t find it. And that\u2019s the problem.",
    "Search \u2018running\u2019 in the App Store or Play Store and you\u2019ll find hundreds of different apps. There are just too many running apps out there \u2013 and if you just want a simple way to log your exercises or track your progress, it\u2019s impossible to know which one is right for you, or even what they all do.",
    "And if that\u2019s the case for me \u2013 a seasoned runner and tech journalist who has some idea what to look for \u2013 then a novice runner who just wants a virtual companion to help them learn how to run, will be in the deep end.",
    "With far too many lookalike generic running apps, it feels like you\u2019re drowning in options. And if, like me, you\u2019re looking for something specific, it\u2019s like looking for a needle in an app-store haystack.",
    "So what\u2019s the solution? Well in a perfect world we\u2019d zap out lots of the filler options, but in due course we probably won\u2019t need to. With tech and exercise devices getting smarter and smarter, it\u2019s likely that all the tools and features I, or anyone else needs, will get introduced into the popular apps, or wearable tie-in apps.",
    "Training modes are fairly smart already, though not quite enough for what I need. Before long though, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to program in the exact training schedule that I want. It\u2019s just a shame that, until then, the running app situation is so confusing."
