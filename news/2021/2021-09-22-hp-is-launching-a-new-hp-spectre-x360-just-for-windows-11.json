    "HP has launched a wide range of new Windows 11 laptops and Ultrabooks, two weeks ahead of the official launch of Microsoft's new OS, and the HP Spectre x360 16 is the star of the show.",
    "The HP Spectre x360 16 is aimed at creatives, and includes a 4K OLED 16-inch touch display and keyboard, and as always can be converted to a digital canvas. It also comes with some solid features and hardware, including a 5MP IR camera, an 11th-gen Intel Core i7 processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, and boasts a 17-hour battery life.",
    "The HP Spectre x360 16 has been unveiled on the official HP website in the US for a starting price of $1,639, and is expected to be available at Best Buy later this fall. If you're in Australia, the 2-in-1 will come in at a starting price of AU$3,399, and will be available direct from HP Australia and major retailers from January 2022. UK pricing and availability is yet to be confirmed.",
    "The HP Spectre x360 wasn\u2019t the only laptop revealed. HP announced a whole range of laptops and desktops, all powered by Windows 11. The new operating system officially launches on October 5, which means all of these HP devices have been announced much earlier than we would have expected.",
    "Microsoft just launched its own Surface products ahead of the launch of Windows 11, with the most prominent being the Surface Laptop Studio. But even Microsoft\u2019s own Windows 11 devices are only available for preorder \u2013 they won\u2019t actually ship until October 5. So it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that if you want one of these new HP devices, you\u2019ll have to wait until at least early October \u2013 and probably a bit later.",
