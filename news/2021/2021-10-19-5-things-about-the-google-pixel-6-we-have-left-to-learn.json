  "summary": "Google Pixel 6 is coming today, but we don\u2019t know everything",
  "article": [
    "The Google Pixel 6 is almost here as it's landing today (October 19), and a combination of rumors and official disclosures has given us plenty to suspect and expect, respectively, about the new handset. But there\u2019s still a handful of things we don\u2019t know \u2013 and we\u2019ve listed the 5 Google Pixel 6 things we have left to learn.",
    "It\u2019s not a long wait, to be sure, as Google has officially announced its Pixel 6 event will be at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST today (or 4am in AEDT on October 20). If you want to watch it live, here's how. Or you can read along with our Pixel 6 live blog.",
    "But before the launch we do have time to speculate on what\u2019s coming in the biggest redesign and refresh to the Google Pixel line that we\u2019ve seen in years.",
    "As a refresher, the Google Pixel 6 \u2013 in details released by Google itself \u2013 will be a premium device with a robust suite of rear cameras (main, ultra-wide, and in the 6 Pro, a telephoto), a wholly new look, and the eagerly-awaited Google-designed Tensor chipset.",
    "Rumors fill in many of the other gaps for the Google Pixel 6 and its pricier Pixel 6 Pro sibling: we\u2019re expecting a 6.4-inch 90Hz flat display and 4,614mAh battery for the standard phone, a 6.7-inch QHD Plus resolution with 120Hz refresh rate display and 5,000mAh battery for the Pro version, and up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for both.",
    "But that still leaves a lot we don\u2019t know. Here are the 5 Google Pixel 6 things we have left to learn when the stage brightens on later on October 19.",
    "When Google teased the Tensor chipset\u2019s capabilities in a blog post, the company rattled off several ways it will improve the phone\u2019s operations \u2013 but only said it will run Google\u2019s computational photography models to give the phone a \u2018completely revamped camera system.\u2019",
    "Given how central photography is to the Pixel phones\u2019 appeal, we need to know more about how Tensor will change the Pixel line\u2019s photo capabilities.",
    "Will it put Google\u2019s computational photo software into overdrive? Improve night photography? Capture faster and take clearer photos? Have more accurate color correction? Bring more color and light parity between the main, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses? We\u2019re extremely curious how Google\u2019s in-house chipset will empower its phones\u2019 most desirable feature \u2013 or if it won\u2019t help much at all.",
    "While we\u2019ve heard rumors and Android 12 code about an in-screen fingerprint scanner, and even an official Google executive\u2019s nod toward the feature, we don\u2019t know if the Pixel 6 will also have facial recognition \u2013 both as an alternative to unlock the phone and as a biometric alternative for authentication.",
    "The Google Pixel 4 relied on facial recognition as its sole biometric, so it\u2019s not crazy to think that the company may double up on authentication methods \u2013 but the older phone relied on a suite of 3D mapping sensors, and it\u2019s unclear if the company has developed a method to do that without those sensors given we only see the single camera in a punch-hole on the front of the Pixel 6.",
    "That said, Pixel team product manager Soniya Jobanputra did say back in June 2020 that facial recognition may come back to the Pixel line eventually \u2013 perhaps the Pixel 6 is the right time for it.",
    "As we understand it, the Pixel 6 Pro will be a pricier version of the standard Pixel 6, though Google has only confirmed that the former will have an extra camera over the latter to differentiate it. And by \u2018confirmed\u2019 we mean \u2018released images of both and we can see an extra rear camera,\u2019 so we\u2019re left to speculate.",
    "Rumors suggest the Pro has a larger 6.7-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate and rare QHD Plus resolution (3200 x 1800), while the standard is alleged to come with a 6.4-inch display with 90Hz max refresh rate and, assumedly, Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution.",
    "We\u2019re also expecting a bigger battery in the pricier phone \u2013 5,000mAh over 4,614mAh in the Pixel 6. But what else separates the phones is tough to determine at this time.",
    "One of the weirder and more recent rumors suggests Google will also announce the Pixel Pass, which we expect to be a multi-service bundle much like Apple One. But it may be more than software \u2013 a leak suggests that Pixel Pass could also mean users get their hardware upgraded, too.",
    "Per the leak, in addition to bundling extant Google services like Google Premium, Google Play Pass, an extended warranty, and perhaps a Google Fi data plan, the Pixel Pass\u2019s monthly subscription cost could also include a yearly phone upgrade component. In other words, subscribers may be able to sign up for a Pixel 6 and then, next year, swap it out for a Google Pixel 7.",
    "That would be a fascinating way for Google to become more of its own carrier-like platform, and expand the reach of the Pixel 6 to folks who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily upgrade to the new phone.",
    "One of the bigger mysteries surrounding the Tensor chipset and the Pixel 6 as a whole is whether its enhanced capabilities will enable Google to develop new features exclusively for the phone in the next Android updates.",
    "While prior Pixel phones haven\u2019t changed much in hardware to enable these features, we\u2019re very curious how advanced all the Pixel 6\u2019s tech will be over Pixels of old \u2013 and whether Google will capitalize on it."
