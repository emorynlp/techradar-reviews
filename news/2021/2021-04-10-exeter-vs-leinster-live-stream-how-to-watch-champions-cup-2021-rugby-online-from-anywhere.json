    "It's the European Champions Cup quarter finals, and we've been served up a cracker of a game - four-time winners and Pro14 supremoes Leinster facing reigning champions Exeter Chiefs. They're arguably the two strongest teams in the tournament, so read on as we explain how to watch an Exeter vs Leinster live stream today and catch all the rugby union action online from wherever you are.",
    "Leinster haven't had a chance to flex their muscles since the victory over Munster in March's Pro14 Grand Final. The province's planned clash with Toulouse was postponed at the 11th hour a week ago, and the Chiefs will be hoping that the last-minute cancellation will have disrupted Leo Cullen's preparations.",
    "If Exeter are to retain the title, nobody can accuse them of enjoying an easy route through the cup. They had to overturn a 14-0 deficit to beat Pool 2 leaders Lyon last weekend, which they managed by scoring seven tries in a remarkable comeback sparked by Jonny Hill.",
    "Leinster are still without some key men, most notably James Ryan, Garry Ringrose, Will Connors and Dan Leavy, but they welcome Tadhg Furlong, Johnny Sexton and James Lowe back to the starting line-up, the only changes from the Pro14 Grand Final.",
