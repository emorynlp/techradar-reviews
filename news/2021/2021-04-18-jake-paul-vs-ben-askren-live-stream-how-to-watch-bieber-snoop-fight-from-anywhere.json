    "Let's face it - Triller Fight Night is sooooo much more than just a boxing event. Yes, YouTube sensation Jake Paul is stepping up another level to take on former UFC fighter in the ring tonight. But with Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg on the bill, too, this is pure showbiz!",
    "Jake Paul has only fought two professional boxing matches before this matchup, albeit novelty one-offs. That said, he's performed well in each encounter - taking out Ali Eson Gib and Nate Robinson - so many are keen to watch the YouTuber now attempt to take on an MMA pro.",
    "But Paul's reputation certainly isn't the only reason to tune in. Music fans are looking to the star-studded line-up, with Justin Bieber, The Black Keys, Doja Cat, Saweetie, Diplo and Major Lazer lighting up the bill. That's not all, though, Saturday's fight will also see the first appearance of hip hop super-group Mt Westmore, featuring Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Too $hort and E-40.",
    "And outside all of that, there's still going to be enough time for another three fights - you can find the full card further down this page.",
    "Now that Triller has bought Fite TV, those looking to watch Jake Paul vs Ben Askren online generally only have one place to find. Fite TV will be showing the fight in a range of regions including the UK, Canada and Australia, though you'll be paying a converted cost from USD into your relevant currency to pick up a PPV pass. Keep reading to find out all you need to know.",
    "You can also find the fight through a range of cable services including DirecTV, Verizon, Spectrum, and Dish if you want to watch on the big screen as well.",
    "If you're abroad and discover that you can't access the FITE stream due to geo-blocking, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that does have one. The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a Jake Paul vs Ben Askren live stream from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping, banking much safer, and even just surfing the web much safer - so many people choose to use a VPN purely for its privacy and security benefits."
