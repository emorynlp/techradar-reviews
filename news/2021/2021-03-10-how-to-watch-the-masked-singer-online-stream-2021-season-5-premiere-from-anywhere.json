    "Here to hit us with another much-needed dose of silliness, The Masked Singer returns to TV tonight with a new gaggle of famous folks disguised in elaborate costumes. We're counting down the moments until Ken Jeong utters those six famous words: \"I know exactly who this is!\" Without further ado, here's how to watch The Masked Singer 2021 online and stream every season 5 show wherever you are in the world.",
    "The racoon in chaps surely going down as one of the show's greatest creations so far, there's a new twist to the format for season 5 of the hit US singing competition, with 2021's gang of celebs split into two groups of five - Group A set to be introduced in the opening episode, followed by Group B. Nice and simple so far.",
    "However, The Masked Singer season 5 will introduce Wild Card contestants throughout the competition, with a strong sports theme running through the 2021 run. Between them, we're told this year's competitor's boast three Super Bowl appearances, six gold medals, two world records, four Oscar nominations, nine multi-platinum singles and 26 Grammy nominations.",
    "Nick Cannon is back on hosting duties, but the new season kicks off with Reno 911! and Scream Queens star Niecy Nash anchoring proceedings because of you-know-what. Meanwhile, Jeong is joined by regular panelists and hopeless detectives Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger and Robin Thicke.",
    "It's the TV show the world can't enough of right now, so read on as we explain where to watch The Masked Singer season 5 online each and every week.",
    "If you find yourself abroad and unable to access the same streaming services, there's a reason for this: geo-blocking, a common digital annoyance that means certain content can only be viewed in certain parts of the world.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream shows like The Masked Singer online anywhere. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home."
