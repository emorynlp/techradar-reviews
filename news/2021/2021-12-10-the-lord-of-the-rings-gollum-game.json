  "article": [
    "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, developed by Daedalic Entertainment who you might know as the creators of the Deponia point-and-click adventure series, has been in active development for quite some time now.",
    "The German developer has been hard at work over the past few years shaping The Lord of the Rings: Gollum into what could be the next hit for Tolkien\u2019s Middle-Earth universe - one that has had a surprisingly strong track record when it comes to video games.",
    "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is set to be a canonical story in the Middle-Earth mythos. It follows the titular creature after he discovers The One Ring, set before the events of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. As such, it\u2019s possible the game will fill in the story-centric gaps presented here, or provide additional context to the events of Tolkien\u2019s books.",
    "Originally slated for a 2021 release, Lord of the Rings Gollum has since been delayed until 2022, when it\u2019ll launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. We're still waiting for a firm release date, though we're hoping that will change the slew of gaming events coming over the next few months, including E3 2021. Until then, however, we\u2019ve gathered together all of the details we have so far on The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.",
    "Lord of the Rings: Gollum was originally slated to release in late 2021 but in January 2021, developer Daedalic Entertainment announced that the game is being delayed until 2022, with no more solid window given than that.",
    "As part of the delay announcement, Daedalic Entertainment also confirmed that it\u2019ll be partnering with Nacon to publish the game, with the companies saying in a joint press release (via Polygon) that they\u2019re joining forces \u201cto ensure that the game will meet the expectations of fans of The Lord of the Rings and fully leverage the power of the new generation of consoles.\u201d",
    "When it does launch in 2022, you can expect to be able to play Lord of the Rings: Gollum on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC.",
    "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum received a new trailer during The Game Awards 2021. The short cinematic trailer shows Smeagol battling against his split personalities as Gollum tries to commit villainous acts to protect his precious ring.",
    "The latest trailer for the game was unveiled at the Future Games Show in March 2021. The trailer, which shows off more of Mordor, helps set the tone for the adventure and shows a bit of what the gameplay will be like playing as Gollum.",
    "Back in 2020, Daedalic released a teaser trailer giving fans a sneak peek at the game\u2019s visual style, and the kinds of environments we can expect to explore.",
    "A summer of gaming events",
    "There's still a lot we have to learn about The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, including its release date, but we're hoping that could change sometime over the next few months thanks to a slew of upcoming gaming events. As a multi-platform release, it's hard to predict with any certainty where, when, or even if the the game's developers will want to reveal more about the game.",
    "However, there are quite a few opportunities to do so as we now know that E3 2021 will take place this year from June 12 to June 15, Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest will kick off on June 10 and Gamescom 2021 will begin in August.",
    "It doesn't seem out of the realms of possibility that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum could creep up at any of these events and we're hoping to see something. Unfortunately, this isn't guaranteed. At the moment, Daedalic hasn't confirmed any plans just yet but we will update if and when it does. Given the most recent footage from the game was released as recently as March 2021, it's possible we could have to wait a little longer for more.",
    "Amazon's and Tencent's Lord of the Rings MMO is no more",
    "It looks like The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is now the only Lord of the Rings game on the horizon after Amazon and Tencent's MMO title set in Tolkien's universe is reported to have been cancelled.",
    "Bloomberg reports that the Lord of the Rings MMO's cancellation is due to \"a dispute between Amazon and Tencent\", with the latter publisher having acquired one of Amazon's other development partners on the game \u2013 Leyou Technologies Holdings Ltd. Contract negotiations fells through, and the fallout seems sensitive enough that the publication's sources asked not to be named.",
    "Amazon has, however, confirmed that it is \"unable to secure terms to proceed with this title at this time,\" and that the organization is \"disappointed that we won't be bringing this game to customers.\"",
    "Fortunately, for Lord of the Rings fans, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is still in development and expected sometime in 2022.",
    "It will have PS5 DualSense support",
    "One reason players may want to pick up the PS5 version of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is the inclusion of features made possible by its DualSense controller. Namely, the haptic feedback offered by the controller\u2019s triggers.",
    "Comments made by Daedalic\u2019s Jonas Husges indicate that the triggers\u2019 haptic feedback functionality will be tied to Gollum\u2019s stamina. The more Gollum tires himself out by running, the more resistance will be applied to the triggers, indicating that the creature is getting tired.",
    "We wonder if this will be a superficial feature purely for the sake of immersion, or if there\u2019s something more ambitious at play here. For example, players might have to manage Gollum\u2019s stamina to be able to more effectively sprint. Another possibility is that we might have to contend with increased resistance on the triggers to maintain extended bouts of speed.",
    "This inclusion points to what kind of set pieces we might see during the game, too. You don\u2019t typically do a lot of running while in stealth, after all, unless you\u2019ve been spotted and have to make like a Nazg\u00fbl chasing a Hobbit.",
    "There may be sequences where the player is being chased as part of the story, with no alternative recourse. In this case, haptic feedback on the DualSense could add another layer of challenge as players fight to keep Gollum on the move.",
    "Daedalic has confirmed that ray-tracing will be a feature",
    "Daedalic has confirmed that current-gen versions of The Lord of the Rings Gollum will put ray-tracing front and center as a graphical feature. The developer has hinted that ray-tracing could be used dynamically in the game\u2019s level design.",
    "An example was attributed to how ray-traced lighting can both help and hinder the player in their stealthy endeavors. Passages of shadows can be used to maneuver safely from the enemy, while moving light sources can expose Gollum at a moment\u2019s notice.",
    "If this is indeed the case, we can see The Lord of the Rings Gollum turning into a unique and challenging stealth-based game which could pave the way for how other developers look at how to best utilize ray-tracing in gameplay-oriented ways. A certain long-dormant stealth action franchise comes to mind.",
    "As for the game\u2019s overall visual style, it\u2019s certainly a step away from the gritty photorealism we\u2019re used to seeing from Middle-Earth projects. It\u2019s not overly cartoonish, but definitely straddles the line between that and a more realistic look. Gollum himself looks unsettlingly adorable, for example.",
    "From screenshots released by Daedalic, it looks like the game\u2019s environments have an impressive sense of scale. There are many scenes where the camera is tilted upward, immediately highlighting just how small Gollum is in comparison, while touching on the immense journey laid out ahead of him.",
    "Touching on the game\u2019s environmental progression, Daedalic confirmed the opening level will be Barad-d\u00fbr, a Mordor stronghold where Gollum is being held captive. However, the hellish landscapes of Mordor won\u2019t be the only locale we\u2019ll get to visit, as Daedalic has promised a variety of areas across Middle-Earth. Many of these environments will likely be large and explorable, offering several quest lines for players to uncover.",
    "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been in the works over at Daedalic for some time now, and its launch doesn\u2019t appear to be all that far away. What we have seen so far looks promising, and hopefully Daedalic can deliver a unique stealth-based adventure that fits perfectly into Tolkien\u2019s mythos. As always, we\u2019ll keep you updated on any news regarding the game as it approaches release.",
    "Stealth, platforming and player decisions will play a big part",
    "There\u2019s still precious few details on what The Lord of the Rings: Gollum will eventually shape up to be. However, what Daedalic Entertainment has revealed so far is promising.",
    "Gameplay will largely revolve around stealth and platforming. Gollum himself won\u2019t get much in the way of actionable abilities. True to his character, he\u2019ll be small and relatively spry, making him a perfect choice for a stealth game, really. As much as we\u2019d love to see the little guy suplex an Orc, that\u2019s likely not going to happen.",
    "Players will also have to make decisions at certain key points through choices and actions displayed in thought bubbles around the main character. What we find interesting is that the choices will be split between Gollum\u2019s own split personalities. From what we\u2019ve seen, we can choose to suppress Gollum and select choices more in line with Smeagol (his original form before coming in contact with The One Ring).",
    "Conversely, players can indulge the more feral Gollum with more cunning and aggressive choices.",
    "It sounds like a clever system that makes a ton of sense for Gollum specifically, leading us to think that the game could end up being an interesting character study. It remains unclear as to how much these decisions will affect the overarching story, but we can imagine Gollum\u2019s personality altering over time based on which side of him you choose to invest in more."
