  "article": [
    "Spoilers for The Umbrella Academy seasons 1 and 2, and the comics, follow.",
    "The Umbrella Academy season 3 won\u2019t arrive on Netflix anytime soon, but one thing has been revealed: we know what each of its 10 episodes will be called.",
    "During Netflix Geeked Week (the streamer\u2019s first-ever in-house virtual event), showrunner Steve Blackman revealed season 3\u2019s episode titles, and fans immediately began to speculate about what they could mean.",
    "With a bit of digging (including re-reading Gerard Way and Gabriel Ba\u2019s comics), we\u2019ve come up with our own theories on what the titles may tell us, including some potentially major reveals that haven\u2019t been disclosed yet.",
    "We're diving into big spoilers for the comics, plus The Umbrella Academy seasons 1 and 2 from now on. Read on at your own risk.",
    "Season 3\u2019s opening episode doesn\u2019t require much theorizing. \u2018Meet the Family\u2019 is an obvious nod to The Umbrella Academy meeting The Sparrow Academy.",
    "The latter is the alternate reality superhero group introduced in season 2\u2019s final scene. Season 3 episode 1, then, should focus on introducing viewers to these new characters.",
    "What\u2019s interesting about The Sparrow Academy is that comic fans don\u2019t know much about them either. They were only revealed in the final few pages of The Umbrella Academy Volume 3: Hotel Oblivion, so we don\u2019t know anything about their powers, personalities or motives.",
    "We imagine that Way and Ba have told Blackman about where they plan on taking the comics\u2019 story. This being an adaptation, though, Blackman could decide to veer off from the source material (so as not to spoil Volume 4) and alter the Sparrows\u2019 powers or other traits.",
    "This seems like we\u2019ll get an explanation about how time travel works in The Umbrella Academy\u2019s universe.",
    "The Umbrella Academy is a series built on time travel. The Commission uses briefcases to travel through time and space, while Five has the exact same ability (without needing a briefcase).",
    "There are no references to twine in the comics and, given that there isn\u2019t a definitive theory on how time travel works (numerous movies and TV shows have tried to explain it differently), we imagine that The Umbrella Academy will have its own take.",
    "We suspect Five will be the one to reveal all. Sir Reginald should be the obvious candidate but, given how secretive he is, we don\u2019t expect him to shed any light on how time travel works in this universe.",
    "Online speculation has suggested that this could relate to one of The Sparrow Academy member\u2019s powers.",
    "In the comics, none of the Sparrows can conjure thunderbolts or produce electricity. We also don\u2019t know if any of this superhero group will have this power in the Netflix show.",
    "The \u2018pocket\u2019 part of episode 3\u2019s title could relate to a pocket dimension that Luther and Diego visit in Hotel Oblivion. For now, though, this is one of two episode titles we\u2019re unsure of.",
    "The first of two German language episodic titles, Kugelblitz refers to a black hole formed from radiation instead of matter.",
    "There are two potential explanations for this title. First, a Kugelblitz could be the new \u2018world ending event\u2019 that the Umbrella and Sparrow academies have to try and prevent. A cataclysmic happening like this should require more than one superhero group to stop, after all.",
    "As for the second, the comics may hold the key. In Hotel Oblivion, Luther and Diego embark on an interstellar mission to a place called the Afterspace \u2013 a wild, newborn region of space where basic scientific laws don\u2019t apply. The Afterspace is full of radiation \u2013 this ties into what a Kugelblitz is made of, so there may be some connection here.",
    "It would be a huge stretch for Netflix\u2019s adaptation to suddenly send Luther and Diego on a universe-spanning adventure, particularly when the only spacefaring stuff we\u2019ve seen occurred in season 1 episode 1 \u2013 and even that was just Luther living on the moon.",
    "If we had to guess, we\u2019d say our first theory here is more likely.",
    "This sounds peculiar, but it\u2019s actually an ode to one particular phrase in William Shakespseare\u2019s Julius Caesar.",
    "In this play, the phrase \u201cthe unkindest cut of all\u201d references how Julius Caesar stabbed close friend Brutus in the back, and is now used to describe a major betrayal or hugely painful event.",
    "Season 3 episode 5, then, may allude to something similar but with a twist. \u2018Kindest Cut\u2019 could relate to something that\u2019s said or done in a cruel but kind way.",
    "There are many instances in the comics and TV show that could be categorized as tough love incidents. However, we suspect it\u2019ll have something to do with Sir Reginald (again). He\u2019s not the most sympathetic father figure and he can be very blunt with his adopted children, so we're guessing \u2018Kindest Cut\u2019 will refer to a severe life lesson he gives to the Umbrella or Sparrow academies.",
    "Of all of season 3\u2019s titles, this may be the most important. Why? It might tell us how The Umbrella Academy (and the Sparrows) got their superpowers.",
    "During Geeked Week, Blackman said: \u201cFor our superfans, Marigold will mean something to them. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve set up through the seasons, and the graphic novels that Gerard and Gabriel have made.\u201d",
    "So, what is \u2018marigold\u2019? In chapter five of Hotel Oblivion, we\u2019re given an idea of what this substance is.",
    "During their Afterspace excursion, Luther and Diego encounter a giant, squid-like monster. A large ball of yellow energy sits at the end of one of its tentacles and, as the monster reaches out to Luther, it taps its energy-imbued tentacle against his forehead.",
    "Immediately, four of Luther\u2019s oldest memories are revealed to comic readers (as show above) \u2013 a crying baby (the moment Luther is born, perhaps?), a shining light in the sky and, most importantly, a marigold flower and what appears to be an orange substance alongside some virus cells.",
    "What does all of this mean? It\u2019s unclear if the creature is the source of their powers, or if it\u2019s simply showing Luther how they got them. Either way, it appears that this 'marigold' energy is the key to how the children came into possession of their abilities.",
    "We\u2019ve seen something similar to this orange substance in the TV show already. In season 1 episode 10, Sir Reginald is in possession of a jar filled with glowing orange energy \u2013 and it\u2019s since been revealed what this jar of energy is.",
    "Speaking to Animation World Network after season 2\u2019s release, VFX supervisor Everett Burrell seemingly let the cat out of the bag. \u201cHargreeves opens a jar and a marigold flies out into space,\u201d Burrell said. \u201cThat\u2019s how the marigold gets into the kids\u2019 bodies.\u201d",
    "If we put these elements together, we can deduce that the Umbrella and Sparrow academies obtain their powers from this energy. If this is the case, season 3 episode 6 could drop some hugely important lore for comic and TV fans alike.",
    "The second German language-based title, and one that points towards a Klaus-centric episode.",
    "There are two reasons for this: Klaus is German (his name and tendency to speak the language are giveaways) and he has the word \u2018goodbye\u2019 tattooed on his left hand. Coincidentally, auf wiedersehen is German for \u2018goodbye\u2019, so it seems obvious to us that Klaus will be central to this particular episode.",
    "Even if Klaus isn\u2019t, episode 7\u2019s title makes for ominous reading. It could relate to the Umbrella and Sparrow academies going their separate ways, a member of either team permanently leaving or, grimly, someone\u2019s funeral.",
    "It would be a major moment if anyone significant dies in season 3. It would be a shock if Netflix did kill one of The Umbrella Academy siblings off but, given the next episode\u2019s title, we don\u2019t see this occurring. You wouldn't follow up a funeral with a wedding after all, right?",
    "Speaking of episode 8, its title may be throwing us a curve ball of sorts.",
    "At first glance, this appears to be a nod to Luther and Allison potentially tying the knot. The duo have a history in the comics and TV show, but we don\u2019t think this is the wedding that this title is referring to.",
    "For one, it\u2019s weird. Luther and Allison are siblings (albeit not blood-related), but it would still be pretty incestuous if they got married. Secondly, fans seemingly don\u2019t want it. In the wake of season 3\u2019s titles being revealed, some fans have expressed their dismay at Luther and Allison potentially getting hitched.",
    "Who could this be referencing, then? If not Luther and Allison, maybe Diego and Lila. The ex-lovers still have feelings for each other, despite Lily\u2019s constant betrayals in season 2, so the smart money is on them \u2013 providing Ritu Arya returns as Lila in season 3, of course.",
    "Regardless of who may tie the knot, it seems that they\u2019ll be doing so during the next apocalyptic event.",
    "\u201cThat will mean something to the audience when they have watched the season,\u201d Blackman teased during Netflix Geeked Week.",
    "Unfortunately, there are no references to bells in the comics. Like \u2018Pocket Full of Lightning\u2019, then, this is a title that we\u2019re struggling to work out.",
    "The only connection we can make is that Six Bells may symbolize a particular hour that heralds the start of an event in the TV shiw. Historically, six bells were rung on seafaring ships that signal the hours of 3AM, 7AM, 11AM, 3PM, 7PM and 11PM.",
    "Could something happen at one of these times in season 3? Possibly. The only crucial time that\u2019s referenced in the comics, though, is 9:38PM - the moment that the 43 superpowered children are born on October 1, 1989. Unless Netflix\u2019s adaptation has changed the time of their births, we don\u2019t see a link between the two.",
    "Alternatively, one of the hours (listed above) may be the time that the next world-ending event begins. It would certainly give The Umbrella Academy (and the Sparrows) a limited amount of time to prevent it, just like the former had to halt the other two apocalypses in seasons 1 and 2.",
    "That's our best guess, but we'll have to wait on season 3 to find out for sure.",
    "This title is the most important after Marigold. For comic readers, the word \u2018Oblivion\u2019 will only mean one thing: Hotel Oblivion.",
    "For the uninitiated, Hotel Oblivion is an Arkham Asylum-style prison \u2013 inside a pocket dimension in the Afterspace \u2013 where Sir Reginald sends captured supervillains to live out the rest of their days.",
    "So far, The Umbrella Academy seasons 1 and 2 have ended on cliffhangers, and we think season 3 will do likewise.",
    "If it does, the third season may end with a tease of Hotel Oblivion. That could be in the form of Sir Reginald visiting it, a post-credits stinger that simply shows the prison in all its glory, or even a jailbreak where the supervillains escape (as they do in the comics) and set up season 4\u2019s main plot thread.",
    "Oblivion could also point to the fact that the Umbrella and Sparrow academies fail to prevent armageddon, which results in, well, universal destruction. We can\u2019t see that happening, though, so Hotel Oblivion is the logical choice here."
