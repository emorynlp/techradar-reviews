  "article": [
    "Season 2 of Star Trek: Picard has a stardate! The ongoing mission of Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (retired) will resume on Paramount Plus in February 2022, the streaming giant confirmed at September's Star Trek Day event.",
    "Having pitted its eponymous hero against classic adversaries the Romulans and the Borg \u2013 as well as a bunch of rogue androids \u2013 in its first outing, Star Trek: Picard season 2 takes Jean-Luc where he's never gone before. Now, with his present turned into a \u201ctotalitarian nightmare\u201d, he's forced to take his newly formed crew back to the 21st century to set things right.",
    "Also coming along for the ride are old-school villains Q and the Borg Queen, and more friendly faces such as Guinan. There's also a new role for Brent Spiner, who played the Enterprise's android officer, Lt Cmdr Data, for more than three decades.",
    "Picard's latest adventure is just three months away, so we dove into Starfleet's logs to tell you everything you need to know about the Star Trek: Picard trailers, cast, story and more.",
    "As the great man himself would say: make it so...",
    "Spoilers lie ahead if you're yet to watch Star Trek: Picard season 1.",
    "Release date: Star Trek: Picard season 2 will debut in February 2022, though a specific date hasn't been offered up yet. It'll stream on Paramount Plus in the US and Amazon Prime Video in other territories.",
    "Story: Jean-Luc Picard and the ragtag crew of La Sirena travel back in time to the 21st century to fix the timeline \u2013 with a bit of help from the god-like Q and a Borg Queen.",
    "Is there a trailer? A new Star Trek: Picard season 2 trailer was unveiled at the Star Trek Day event in September 2021.",
    "The Star Trek: Picard season 2 shoot was originally supposed to get underway in June 2020, until Covid-19 put everything on hiatus. Production on season 2\u2019s 10-episode run eventually got under way in California in February 2021.",
    "That delay means we'll see Star Trek: Picard season 2 after Star Trek: Discovery season 4 (due to leave spacedock on November 18) finishes its mission. The Star Trek Day event on September 8, 2021 confirmed that Jean-Luc's second solo voyage will debut in February 2022 on Paramount Plus in the US \u2013 as with season 1, the show will stream on Amazon Prime Video in other territories.",
    "The first teaser for Star Trek: Picard season 2 was released during the First Contact Day event in April 2021. Alongside numerous Next Generation Easter eggs (including a model of Picard's first starship command, the USS Stargazer) the major reveal was that John de Lancie will be reprising his role as omnipotent superbeing Q.",
    "A more full-featured trailer featuring Stewart, de Lancie and other members of the cast was released on June 16, 2021. It doesn't give much away about the plot, other than suggesting that Picard and company are trying to stop a dark future from coming to pass.",
    "We learned even more about Star Trek: Picard season 2 in the longer trailer unveiled at Star Trek Day \u2013 including a sighting of the Borg Queen...",
    "Red alert! Big spoilers for Star Trek: Picard season 1 follow \u2013 change course now if you haven\u2019t seen it yet.",
    "Jean-Luc Picard will be a new man in Star Trek \u2013 literally. When Picard\u2019s human body succumbed to terminal Irumodic Syndrome, his consciousness was transferred into to an artificial \u2018golem\u2019 body created by Dr Altan Soong, the biological son of Data\u2019s \u2018father\u2019, Dr Noonian Soong. Although Soong Jr made it clear that the new body is effectively identical to the old one \u2013 it will still age and die, for example \u2013 it\u2019s going to have an effect on the way the 90-something character approaches his life.",
    "\u201cI wanted to know exactly what they had done to me when they saved [Picard]\u2019s life,\u201d Patrick Stewart said in an interview with Gold Derby. \u201cWas there any chance that this might have an impact on Picard\u2019s personality or behaviour? [Executive producers Terry Matalas and Akiva Goldsman] felt it probably wouldn\u2019t, but it lies there as an option should we need to take it. But also there is another human aspect being introduced in season 2, which I am not allowed to talk about. But it\u2019s going to have, I think, quite an impact.\u201d",
    "With the first year\u2019s main story arcs about a the Romulan Zhat Vash\u2019s efforts to wipe out all Synthetic life and the reclaimed Borg Cube (now crash-landed on the Synthetic homeworld of Coppelius) now seemingly done and dusted, Star Trek: Picard season 2 is primed to seek out all-new worlds \u2013 and civilisations.",
    "\u201cDespite 178 episodes of TNG [The Next Generation] and four feature films, there are events coming up in season 2 that have never been seen before,\u201d Stewart teased at First Contact Day.",
    "It\u2019s clear that not everything will be new, however, now that we know Q is back in Jean-Luc Picard\u2019s orbit. A member of the omnipotent Q continuum, the mischievous character cropped up regularly in The Next Generation (and spin-off shows Deep Space Nine and Voyager) to make life as awkward as he could for Starfleet. He always took a particular interest in Picard, having put humanity on trial in TNG pilot \u2018Encounter at Farpoint\u2019 \u2013 an arc that was only partially resolved in series finale \u2018All Good Things\u2019.",
    "It looks like Q will be continuing his self-convened legal proceedings in Star Trek: Picard season 2. \u201cDo you recall what I said, Jean-Luc, when last we parted ways?\u201d Q asks Picard in the latest season 2 trailer. \u201cThe trial never ends.\u201d Not only do we learn that Picard and Q haven't met in the more-than-two-decades since Jean-Luc's days on the Enterprise-D, we know that the former Starfleet officer is \u201cway too old for [Q\u2019s] bulls**t.\u201d",
    "\u201cQ's arrival is, as it often was, is unexpected,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cBut it also comes at a shattering moment in the episode. And I do mean a shattering moment. Whether it's directly connected to Q or not, I'm not sure, but there is significant trauma. And in fact at the moment, I'm working on how the trauma of this moment hangs around Picard for quite a substantial part of the episode and then \u2013 there [Q] is.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn the same way that we have tried to do with Picard himself, Terry Matalas and I don\u2019t pretend that the interstitial years [between The Next Generation and Picard] didn\u2019t happen,\u201d executive producer Akiva Goldsman told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cObviously, chronological time is less relevant to Q. The time between shows is probably not even the blink of an eye in Q time \u2013 if you even have Q time. But we definitely chose to follow suit when it came to him, so as we tried to evolve the other characters, the same is true of Q. This is a show of a different time with actors of a different age. We\u2019re now talking about the issues that come up in the last [stage] of your life. We wanted a Q that could play in that arena with Picard.\u201d",
    "Goldsman also described Q as a \u201ctrickster god\u201d and expanded on the importance of Picard\u2019s relationship with Q. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion in [Star Trek: Picard] season 2 about the nature of connectedness,\u201d he said. \u201cQ\u2019s kind of a great lightning rod for that because in some ways he\u2019s one of Picard\u2019s deepest\u2026 not deep in the same way that Riker is or Beverly Crusher was but in its own [way, a] uniquely, profoundly deep relationship.\u201d",
    "Picard's relationship with Q may be deep, but it's also problematic. In the latest Star Trek: Picard season 2 trailer, Jean-Luc says that \"Q went back in time and turned our world into a totalitarian nightmare,\u201d amid scenes of a drastically changed 24th century. Seven of Nine \u2013 now without the residual Borg implants on her face \u2013 points out that \u201ctime has been broken\u201d. Picard adds that, \u201cThe only way to heal our future is to go back and repair the past.\u201d",
    "This means a trip back to 21st century, where Picard and his newly formed crew will have \u201cthree days before the future is changed irrevocably\u201d, and Seven of Nine will have to take a crash course in driving a car.",
    "But with the time travel element already strongly hinted, perhaps the biggest revelation in the Star Trek: Picard season 4 trailer is that Jean-Luc's route back in time involves the Borg Queen \u2013 though it's yet to be revealed whether this is the Borg Queen from Star Trek: First Contact, the one presumed dead after Voyager's return from the Delta Quadrant, or some other incarnation. Or maybe we're guilty of thinking in [merely] three-dimensional terms...",
    "Whichever Borg Queen it is, time travel is familiar territory for Star Trek, the most famous examples coming in Star Trek 4 (where Kirk and crew travelled back to 1980s San Francisco) and First Contact (where Picard fought the Borg in the 21st century). Expect plenty of culture clash comedy/drama as Jean-Luc and his highly sophisticated 24th century companions get used to slumming it present-day Earth.",
    "One major difference between Star Trek: Picard season 2 and its predecessor is that this time Jean-Luc \u2013 now long-retired from Starfleet \u2013 has his own crew. So don\u2019t be surprised if the new season feels more of an ensemble show, with more time devoted to Cris Rios, Raffi Musiker, Soji Asha, Elnor and Seven of Nine. Integrating all of them \u2013 and new characters \u2013 into the narrative will be one of the new season\u2019s hardest missions.",
    "\u201cThat's the challenge,\u201d season 1 showrunner Michael Chabon told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cFirst, it's got to be good, right? It has to be focused on Picard but have room for all the other characters. It\u2019s never going to be just a show about the crew of a starship that's part of Starfleet and everyone's wearing uniforms and they're flying around, encountering alien life and weird planets. Those are the challenges we face going into season 2, and I'm so excited about the story we\u2019ve come up with.\u201d",
    "And for anyone who was left underwhelmed with the season 1 finale, the production team have hopefully found a solution going into Star Trek: Picard season 2. \u201cFigure out the end earlier!\u201d said Goldsman when the Hollywood Reporter asked what the team had learned from their first year. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do a serialized show, you have the whole story before you start shooting. It\u2019s more like a movie in that way \u2013 you better know the end of your third act before you start filming your first scene.\u201d Surely that's good advice for every screenwriter...",
    "This is the crew manifest for Star Trek: Picard season 2 as it stands:",
    "The show was always built around the star power of Sir Patrick Stewart, and he\u2019ll be joined in the Star Trek: Picard season 2 cast by his regular La Sirena crew: Michelle Hurd (Raffi Musiker), Santiago Cabrera (Cris Rios), Evan Evagora (Elnor), Alison Pill (Dr Agnes Jurati), and Isa Briones (Soji Asha). Star Trek: Voyager veteran Jeri Ryan will also be back as former Borg Seven of Nine.",
    "It was confirmed at September's Star Trek Day that Seven will come face-to-face with another former member of the Collective, as the trailer introduced the latest iteration of the Borg Queen. The Last of Us star Annie Wersching takes over the role from Alice Krige (Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Voyager) and Susanna Thompson (Star Trek: Voyager)",
    "In addition to the returning John de Lancie as Q, there are some other The Next Generation veterans heading back to the Final Frontier.",
    "The first is Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan.",
    "Stewart formally invited his former co-star to join the Star Trek: Picard season 2 cast during an appearance on Goldberg\u2019s TV show, The View. \u201cIt was wonderful having you, and we cannot wait to have you with us again one more time,\" said Stewart.",
    "Officially the bartender in Ten Forward, the Enterprise-D\u2019s bar/relaxation area, Guinan (a centuries-old El-Aurian) was Picard\u2019s confidante. She also had little time for Q, so it\u2019ll be intriguing if they end up colliding with each other in the new season.",
    "And although Brent Spiner said he'd played the android Data for the last time in Star Trek: Picard's first season \u2013 \u201cI wouldn't really entertain the idea of doing [Data, an ageless character] again because I just don't think it would be realistic,\u201d he told TV Guide \u2013 he is back in season 2. So who's he playing?",
    "\u201cI can tell you I'm not Data,\u201d Spiner told Inverse. \u201cI know they haven't revealed much about me being in the show. I can tell you I'm a member of the Soong family. And, that I'm not playing a character I've ever played before.\u201d",
    "In the words of Data himself, this is \"most intriguing\".",
    "Alongside his most famous role as the Enterprise's resident artificial human, Spiner has also played Data's android \u2018brothers\u2019 Lore and B-4 \u2013 as well as their creator, Dr Noonian Soong and his 22nd century ancestor, Arik Soong. He also appeared in Star Trek: Picard season 1 as a new member of the family (and AI expert), Dr Altan Inigo Soong.",
    "So who is this mysterious new character? We're ruling out another android, because if Spiner's too old to play Data, he's too old to play another robot. But could the character be Altan's human brother in the Picard era, a new person in the new, alternative, dystopian 24th century, or a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent (approx) Picard and co meet when they travel back to the 21st century? Seeing as both Picard and Soji (one of Data's daughters) have connections to Data, both would surely have an interest in meeting an ancestor.",
    "As for the rest of the Next Generation crew, the one star certain to return is Jonathan Frakes \u2013 though not necessarily on screen. He confirmed to TrekMovie that he\u2019s back to direct a pair of Star Trek: Picard season 2 episodes, but claimed that he wasn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019d be back on screen as Captain William Riker.",
    "The time travel element of the story may make make bringing the Next Generation cast harder this time out, but if Riker does return, it\u2019s a safe bet Marina Sirtis will be back as his screen wife, Deanna Troi.",
    "But what about Worf, Geordi LaForge and Dr Crusher?",
    "Thanks to the amount of time the role requires in the make-up chair, Michael Dorn said he\u2019d only be up for returning as the Federation\u2019s resident Klingon, Worf, if it was really worthwhile.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m only interested in if it\u2019s something really interesting,\u201d he told Inverse. \u201cIf the character was a major part of the franchise or whatever the show is. He\u2019s not just going to show up, beat somebody up, and then go home.\u201d",
    "While Worf\u2019s status is ambiguous, two cast members have seemingly ruled themselves out of a return.",
    "In April 2021, LeVar Burton told Whoopi Goldberg on The View (via TrekMovie) that, \u201cI can say unequivocally that I am not doing season 2 of Picard\u201d \u2013 though it\u2019s important to add that he hasn\u2019t ruled out an appearance as Geordi La Forge in a future season.",
    "And there\u2019ll be no return (yet) for Gates McFadden \u2013 which means that Star Trek: Picard season 2 won\u2019t be able to explore the status of Jean-Luc\u2019s will they/won\u2019t they relationship with Dr Beverly Crusher.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not in the second season,\u201d she told TrekMovie. \u201cI\u2019m sad that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m disappointed because it would have been so much fun to just work with those people. But we\u2019ll see. I have no idea\u2026\u201d",
    "But don\u2019t give up hope just yet, because this could be a clever deployment of smoke and mirrors. Marina Sirtis claimed she wasn\u2019t going to be in the first season of the show and look what happened there\u2026",
    "Star Trek: Picard season 2 won't be the end of Jean-Luc's story \u2013 the show's Star Trek Day panel confirmed that a third season has been given the greenlight by Paramount Plus.",
    "According to an interview in Variety, Michael Chabon won't be as heavily involved in season 2 of Star Trek: Picard as he was in the first. He's shifting his attention to developing a TV series for Showtime based on his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. But he will continue to give notes to the writers. \"I\u2019m still an executive producer on Picard,\" he told Variety. \"I\u2019m writing two episodes. I was there breaking the second season, all the way through. I was engaged, I think, to exactly the same degree as I was on the first season.\"",
    "Terry Matalas, a veteran of Twelve Monkeys and MacGyver will take over as the Star Trek: Picard season 2 showrunner.",
    "Star Trek: Picard will be available to watch from February 2022, on Paramount Plus in the US and Amazon Prime Video in the rest of the world."
