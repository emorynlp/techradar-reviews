    "Ultra-wide monitors have risen in popularity in recent years, with games natively supporting resolutions that could easily show a display that\u2019s almost three monitors long.",
    "While there've been some great examples in simulation and racing games, platformers have yet to take advantage of this wide perspective, which is where Greak: Memories of Azur comes in.",
    "Released in August for PC, Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation and Xbox consoles, the team at Navegante wanted to make sure that the family-focused platformer was able to run on the widest of wide-screen monitors currently available.",
    "For PC Gaming Week, we spoke to Rodrigo Fernandez, programmer and co-creator of the game over at Navegante, which is an independent video game studio based in Mexico.",
    "As Greak is an indie-title, we wanted to know just how long the team was developing Greak for, and when ultra-wide came in as an idea.",
    "\u201cWe started as a company just learning how to make games, and as we\u2019re based in Mexico we just played around with Unity 5 until we were confident enough to create one.\u201d Fernandez tells us. \u201cWe always had the character in mind but not the crux of the game. We were fans of Lord of the Rings on the SNES, which also had a similar mechanic to Greak.",
    "We knew the game would have multiple characters but weren't sure how to approach it, so we just kept iterating over the idea and came up with the finished product.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith ultra-wide, it was something we had in mind for a while, especially when designing the UI. It was one of the key parts when considering this, alongside how the game works really fits well to the environment of Greak.\u201d Fernandez explained.",
    "\u201cWhen it comes to ultra-wide the UI can suffer, due to it reducing in size as the resolution gets bigger and wider. Another aspect was the camera, so we had to make sure that it could zoom out without compromising the gameplay and the graphics.\u201d",
    "\u201cWith Unity 5 (a game engine development suite) we\u2019re able to simulate just how the game looks in many resolutions, ultra-wide included, so while we did test it on some real-world ultra-wide monitors, we were able to make sure that a player could go from the start of Greak to the end in an ultra-wide resolution.\u201d Fernandez tells us.",
    "There\u2019s also roadblocks when factoring in ultra-wide for a game, so we wanted to see how this factored in as Greak is a platformer, not a racing game.",
    "\u201cAs it\u2019s a platformer, a game in this genre can usually glitch out when in ultra-wide, but as Greak has lots of panoramic landscapes, we wanted to take advantage of it. After a lot of testing, the team were really happy about the result, but it\u2019s just the start.\u201d Fernandez adds.",
    "\u201cWe kept refining the game to see whether any objects were being left out, but it did work out in the end.\u201d",
    "With the Steam Deck now official and pre-orders falling as far back as the middle of the next year, we wondered whether Navegante is looking to bring Greak to the handheld.",
    "\u201cWhile we haven't approached Valve about the Steam Deck, we\u2019d love to spend some time with it, as we\u2019re definitely interested in bringing Greak to the platform. It runs on Linux but we don\u2019t see why it would stop us from bringing the game to the handheld.\u201d Fernandez explains.",
    "Players have been enjoying the game in the weeks since its release, but they\u2019ve been vocal in requesting local co-op, especially as you can switch between characters. We asked if this was something the team was considering.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve been requested by a lot of people that local co-op play is something they\u2019d like to see, especially when coupled with ultra-wide support.\u201d Fernandez continued.",
    "\u201cIt makes sense, especially with multiple characters, but it\u2019s difficult as it\u2019s a single player co-op game, especially when you\u2019re alternating between characters in a Metroidvania landscape. So it could be tough to add co-op, but we\u2019re definitely thinking about all the requests, and it fits well.\u201d",
    "The story heavily involves the aspect of family, and being there for one another. In regards to this, we asked why this was a factor in making it an important part of Greak.",
    "\u201cYou have to be able to be comfortable about the story you\u2019re trying to tell, but we also wanted a simple message so we could tackle it properly.\u201d Fernandez adds. \u201cPretty much the concept of families sticking together, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re very strongly about. My sister is the producer on the team for example, so it\u2019s something we understood super well.\u201d",
    "\u201cEspecially with this conflict in Greak, we wanted to find just how the first character could get help, and we thought it made sense to make it a family affair.\u201d",
    "With many more games bringing in accessibility features, we wanted to know if this was something the team wanted to implement with Greak, and if they were thinking of bringing in more features in regards to this.",
    "\u201cWe tried to make Greak very accessible difficulty-wise. There\u2019s many fringes of skill throughout the game, so we wanted to make sure that the areas didn\u2019t require a heavy amount of it so players could just enjoy the game without feeling frustrated or anxious.\u201d Fernandez tells us.",
    "\u201cWe added in plenty of different configurations for controllers, but we also took in a lot of feedback from the demo, so there\u2019s plenty that we\u2019ve implemented, but we\u2019re always listening to others who may want a feature to help them play the game as best as possible.",
    "Especially as Greak factors around family, we wanted to make sure it was accessible for all, so we\u2019re always wanting to hear from players about their thoughts.\u201d"
