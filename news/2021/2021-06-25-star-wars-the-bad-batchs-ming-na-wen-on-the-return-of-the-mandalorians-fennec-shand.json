    "Spoilers for the latest episode of Star Wars: The Bad Batch follow.",
    "\u201cAny story about her is fascinating to me,\u201d she adds. \u201cI had created all this imaginary backstory for her, because I thought she was only supposed to be in one episode of The Mandalorian. Now I'm really curious [to see what The Bad Batch creator and Lucasfilm executive creative director] Dave Filoni and the other writers are going to come up with.\u201d",
    "When you\u2019re a bounty hunter in a certain galaxy far, far away, it\u2019s not hard to make an impression. IG-88, Bossk, Zuckuss, 4-LOM and Dengar barely appear in focus in The Empire Strikes Back, yet these silent assassins became integral figures in the Star Wars underworld after appearing in Darth Vader\u2019s infamous line-up. Even Boba Fett spoke just four lines of dialogue before becoming the superstar of the mercenary universe.",
    "When Agents of SHIELD and Mulan star Ming-Na Wen turned up as Fennec Shand in a season 1 episode of The Mandalorian, she instantly became a worthy heir to their lineage of scum and villainy \u2013 she even wore the kind of outfit memorable action figures are made of.",
    "The fact she was left for dead at the end of \u2018The Gunslinger\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough to stand in her way, either, as Shand proved that every assassin deserves a second shot when she returned (with cybernetic enhancements) in the show\u2019s second season. She\u2019ll also appear at Fett\u2019s side in upcoming Disney Plus spin-off The Book of Boba Fett.",
    "In the meantime, however, we\u2019re getting a glimpse of Fennec Shand\u2019s early years courtesy of The Bad Batch. In The Clone Wars follow-up \u2013 set in the early days of the Galactic Empire \u2013 she\u2019s a rookie bounty hunter on the trail of Omega, a young female clone under the protection of a team of uniquely skilled Clone Troopers who defied the Emperor\u2019s Jedi-exterminating Order 66.",
    "\u201cThis is Fennec Shand, like, 20 years younger,\u201d Ming-Na Wen tells us over Zoom. \u201cSo [the question is], who was she as a young Fennec, and how did she become a bounty hunter?",
    "\u201cI'm curious to find out why she became a bounty hunter at such a young age. Was she an orphan? Did she grow up in a bad family situation? How did she learn her skills, and who taught her? Also \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong in this (Editor's note: we\u2019ve checked, and she isn\u2019t) \u2013 in The Bad Batch Fennec Shand doesn't have her [facial] scar. So I'm really interested to find out how she got that scar.\"",
    "Fennec Shand had her first entanglement with the eponymous Bad Batch in the show\u2019s fourth episode, \u2018Cornered\u2019, when the mercenary attempted to capture Omega on the planet of Pantora. While that assignment failed, Fennec\u2019s back on the clones\u2019 trail in episode 9, \u2018Bounty Lost\u2019 (available now on Disney Plus), crossing paths with both the Bad Batch and the infamous Cad Bane, a Duros bounty hunter who\u2019s taken style tips from Clint Eastwood. Despite Shand\u2019s questionable motives, however, she\u2019s eager to make Omega, her young target, believe she\u2019s on her side.",
    "\u201cI think ultimately, Fennec is quite the mercenary character,\u201d Ming-Na explains. \u201cShe\u2019s very about taking care of herself, so even when she is helping Omega \u2013 or when it seems like she is befriending her \u2013 it\u2019s with an ulterior motive. Everything that she does, she\u2019s very cunning, she\u2019s very adaptable, and I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s such good bounty hunter. She knows how to read people, she knows how to make them scared and how to make them trust her. I don't know if it was very altruistic what she was doing with Omega \u2013 I\u2019m glad if you thought she was because then she\u2019s doing a good job!\u201d",
    "Anyone familiar with Star Wars lore will have noticed the links between Omega and Boba Fett \u2013 Shand\u2019s future savior and partner in crime \u2013 seeing as both are clones created on the world of Kamino. When we ask if we should be looking out for any Fett connections in The Bad Batch, however, she raises the forcefield of secrecy she perfected on Agents of SHIELD.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s such a good question, I wish I could answer it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve had years of training with Marvel, it\u2019s probably now in my DNA. I think I\u2019ve become that friend that you could say anything to and I will be able to keep your secrets to my grave.",
    "\u201cI guess the only way I can answer your question is that obviously Fennec loves Boba Fett because he saved her, but at the same time, probably doesn\u2019t appreciate him because he saved her, and now she owes him this huge debt. There is something great about her where she does honor the code, so she is honorable in that sense. And to me that that that says a lot about her integrity, so maybe there is something about her that is genuinely grounded and trustworthy. Maybe there\u2019s a good person underneath all those assassin kill skills that she has \u2013 if that\u2019s possible?\u201d",
    "Where Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze started out as animated characters in The Clone Wars before showing up in The Mandalorian, Fennec Shand has moved in the opposite direction. Unsurprisingly, Ming-Na says the voiceover experience is very different to her live-action adventures.",
    "\u201cPhysically it\u2019s definitely a lot easier,\u201d she admits. \u201cI don\u2019t have to spend two hours getting my hair done \u2013 that\u2019s a very elaborate hairdo \u2013 and I don't have to be sweating in my four-layered leather outfit with boots and gloves. I also don\u2019t have to do any stunts, so that part\u2019s really great.",
    "\u201cThe one thing about voiceover work is that for an actor, a lot of times it\u2019s a very lonely job, because you\u2019re really just in the studio with the producers, the directors or the writers, and none of the other actors. The Bad Batch, especially, was unique because of Covid. They sent me the audio equipment and the computer and everything, and I set it up in my closet and recorded all my lines with the directors on Zoom. It\u2019s really amazing how much our technology has advanced to where you could take a major project like this and still get high quality audio from inside my closet!\u201d",
    "Another advantage of working in animation is that there\u2019s almost no limit to the iconic characters Fennec Shand could meet as she makes her way through the galaxy \u2013 pretty much anyone who\u2019s alive at the end of Revenge of the Sith could find themselves in her sights.",
    "\u201cOh my goodness, can you imagine if Fennec meets up with Han Solo,\u201d says Ming-Na, activating fan mode for a moment. \u201cI would go nuts! If I'm in the same room, with the trio of Luke, Han and Leia, that would be so crazy. I\u2019m about to cry right now, just thinking about it as a possibility. Dave [Filoni], are you listening?!\u201d",
