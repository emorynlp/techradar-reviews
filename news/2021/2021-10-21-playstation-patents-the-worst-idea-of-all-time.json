    "\u2018Git gud\u2019, or get kicked. That seems to be the message Sony is suggesting with its newly-uncovered PlayStation 5 patent filing \u2013 and it might just be the worst idea we\u2019ve ever seen for online gaming.",
    "The patent, called \u201cSpectators Vote to Bench Players in a Video Game\u201d has now been granted by the U.S Patent Office, following a filing from Sony back in January 2020. It describes how spectators of an online game will potentially be able to vote to kick out an active player.",
    "Once the voting is over, all players would be sent a notification explaining that spectators had voted out a player, causing them to be kicked from the game. A voting threshold among spectators would need to be reached, meaning a single spectator wouldn\u2019t have the power to kick out everybody.",
    "Spectators could also send a warning to underperforming players. The patent includes an illustration exploring how a spectator can \u201cwarn [the] player to improve\u201d, or to provide a custom message with a vote \u2013 perhaps to indicate someone may be playing unfairly.",
    "As with all patent filings, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a specific plan is in place to implement this vote-to-boot system. But it\u2019s suggestive of reinforcing a frustrating and worrying trend in gaming attitudes.",
    "The \u201cgit gud\u201d meme, which began life as a light-hearted challenge to players to fight through the frustration of difficult parts of a game to improve their skills, has increasingly become an exclusionary, toxic part of gaming culture, and a fenced-off members club approach to how gaming should work; that only the skilled are allowed to be involved. And this patent seems to feed that idea.",
    "At best, the patent idea can be viewed as a way to allow players to police their own communities. And while giving power to the game\u2019s audience is good on paper, this feels so easy to abuse. It\u2019s passing the buck, the responsibility of monitoring player engagements, away from the game makers and onto the gamer. Where\u2019s the fun in that? If it\u2019s just about making sure like-minded players play together, surely this is what developers\u2019 in-game matchmaking systems are for? They\u2019re employed to ensure that players of the same ability level face each other, and hopefully stamp out any frustrations that way. And that\u2019s before mentioning friends lists.",
    "I\u2019d imagine this wouldn\u2019t be used at a system level, but rather in specific games or game modes \u2013 an American Idol / X-Factor game with live performance, for instance, would be a perfect home for this. But giving too much power to the mob doesn\u2019t always result in a democratic utopia \u2013 just look at how abusive players banded together for the Twitch \u2018Hate Raids\u2019.",
    "If I have to not only endure a random Fortnite squad telling me I\u2019m awful for not getting enough kills, but also have to face an audience of people with the power to cut my game time short just because I\u2019m not a pro-level player, or at least send me a custom message slagging off my skills, I might log off for good."
