    "When it comes to database structure, businesses essentially have one choice: relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL). The former organize data in a series of tables and have a predefined schema, while the latter have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. But which is better?",
    "With the rise of cloud and container technology, relational and open source database system PostgreSQL (or Postgres as it\u2019s fondly called) is showing remarkable versatility. Despite having existed for more than three decades, it isn\u2019t afraid of learning new tricks from its younger NoSQL cousins.",
    "TechRadar Pro spoke with Marc Linster, CTO at open source database firm EDB, to find out about the benefits of Postgres and the qualities that set it apart from proprietary and non-relational alternatives."
