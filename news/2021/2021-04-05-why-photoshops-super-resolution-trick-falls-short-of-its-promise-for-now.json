    "Adobe Photoshop has been embracing the power of AI to a mildly terrifying degree recently, but now it's getting something slightly less scary than neural filters \u2013 a new feature called Super Resolution.",
    "The handy new tool, which is now available in Camera Raw 13.2 and will be landing soon on Lightroom and Lightroom Classic, has a simple claim \u2013 to be able to double the resolution of your photos using machine learning, while improving their quality.",
    "This is a big deal for most photographers, particularly those of us who remember the early days of the megapixel wars. Back in the day (we\u2019re old, okay?) you couldn\u2019t go near a camera launch without the megapixel count of a camera being thrust at you.",
    "Four megapixels. Eight. 12. 18. We remember when the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, with its 30.4MP sensor, arrived \u2013 that was it, the end of the resolution wars. From that point on, virtually any camera you could buy would offer enough resolution to do virtually anything with the images you wanted.",
    "That\u2019s doubly true in the age of Instagram. Actually, it\u2019s 25 times more true in the age of Instagram, as in most cases you only ever need to upload a 1080 x 1080 image \u2013 just 1.2MP\u2019s worth of photography.",
    "Adobe doesn\u2019t think resolution worries have gone away, though, which is why its new Super Resolution has made its way to Adobe Camera Raw. It advertises something simple \u2013 it will take an image (JPGs and raws are both supported) and doubles the number of pixels along the horizontal and vertical edges.",
    "Sceptics will be reaching for their \u201cbut it already does that\u201d comments as we speak, but Super Resolution uses machine learning, theoretically allowing it to produce superior-quality results. But does it? We ran it through some tests to find out.",
    "Using the tool is simple. Use Adobe Bridge and open an image in Adobe Camera Raw (ACR), then right-click your image and click Enhance \u2013 or use CMD-Shift-D if you\u2019re in a rush.",
    "The Super Resolution tool itself is a simple one \u2013 a lonesome checkbox marked Super Resolution, and the ability to click and hold on your image preview to see what ACR is going to do.",
    "Click Enhance (it's good to see Adobe finally embracing the terminology of late-90s classic Enemy of the State), and your computer will whir away for a bit. Super Resolution is heavily dependent on your system\u2019s GPU, so the more you spent on that, the faster your results will come.",
    "Of course, Photoshop, Bridge and Lightroom (other photo editors are available) have offered image upscaling for years, so what advantages does Super Resolution offer? Having read some breathlessly enthusiastic experiences, we eagerly set up a few comparisons and\u2026results were variable, to put it mildly.",
    "If all you want is to create a supersize version of a decent, un-cropped image, you can save substantial amounts of time \u2013 and even image quality \u2013 using Photoshop\u2019s bog standard image resize.",
    "We tried a few images \u2013 opening them, resizing them to 200% their original linear dimensions, and then layering an 'enhanced' resize on top. While there was always a difference between the two, the difference was rarely in Super Resolution\u2019s favor.",
    "A good example of the limitations of Photoshop's Super Resolution mode is this frame of a robin. On the left is what the original image (which you can see here) looks like resized to twice its original dimensions using Photoshop\u2019s basic image re-sizer, with resampling set to automatic. You can see the full-size version here.",
    "And the version on the right (which you can see in full-size here) is what it looks like after being 'enhanced'. Can you tell the difference? Us neither, although with Super Resolution producing an enormous DNG file each time you use it, our hard disk certainly could.",
    "Also, zooming into 100% showed a problem. The difference is almost unbearably slight, but the basic resize (left) shows more sharpness and fine detail than the far more processor and hard disk intensive Super Resolution file on the right. That makes the score '1-0' in favor of doing things the old fashioned way.",
    "Next up, we tried comparing the two techniques on this photo of a rhino. This time we\u2019ll skip straight to the side-by-side comparison, as there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll spot the difference otherwise.",
    "This time, our subject does show a slight improvement in texture and sharpness where we\u2019ve used Super Resolution (right) versus using the basic resize tool (left). You can see the full-size version here.",
    "However, it\u2019s also mis-colored our image, dropping in some violet aberrations that now need fixing. Even if these weren\u2019t here we\u2019d still wonder whether Adobe\u2019s new AI-powered tool was worth it.",
    "Resizing an image using Photoshop\u2019s bargain-basement re-sizer \u2013 in these first two examples \u2013 produced similar or better results and was ridiculously fast (about 22 seconds, versus over 54 seconds) compared to the Super Resolution tool.",
    "It\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Super Resolution, though \u2013 our experiments suggest there will be times when the feature is worth its weight in, if not gold, at least something reasonably heavy-duty.",
    "For example, here\u2019s a picture of the bank-side in photo-friendly Porto.",
    "And below is a super-aggressive crop of the same image. After the crop we were left with an image just 2,733 x 1,822 pixels, which is pretty tight if you\u2019re looking to print.",
    "We resized the image using Photoshop\u2019s old-style re-sizer and the Super Resolution tool, and the results are actually pretty striking. For a closer look, check out the full-size version.",
    "You still need to be paying attention, but the basic-resize version (left) is way softer than the Super Resolution version on the right.",
    "There\u2019s more detail, sharpness, and although the trained eye will pick up a slightly raised amount of chromatic aberration (purple and green fringing), it\u2019s barely worth mentioning.",
    "Our last Super Resolution test was this photo of a tiger, which is cropped down from this original snap.",
    "And, after upscaling using both Super Resolution and Photoshop\u2019s old-school image re-sizer, here\u2019s the side-by-side comparison of the results. Or you can get a closer look by checking out the full-size version here.",
    "At this point we began to question our eyes, our sanity, our reason for being. The basic resize \u2013 which took seconds \u2013 is visibly, appreciably sharper than the Super Resolution version on the right.",
    "All of this leaves us struggling to make a call. There isn\u2019t really a buying decision, as such \u2013 if you have a Creative Cloud subscription that includes Photoshop, you already have Super Resolution, so the question is if it\u2019s worth the extra time.",
    "In some cases, appreciably, yes \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to enlarge images, preserving, or even creating, extra sharpness as you go. In other cases, appreciably, no \u2013 your images could very well end up slightly softer, and in either case you\u2019ll be splitting hairs between getting Photoshop to do a basic up-rezzing job or spending more time having Adobe Camera Raw doing its 'Enhance' job.",
    "All of which is before you consider Topaz\u2019 popular Gigapixel AI software. It\u2019s long-winded and expensive at $99.99, but given our crop of Porto to work on, it produced a visibly stronger image than either of Photoshop\u2019s efforts. This is particularly noticeable in the full-size image.",
    "Then we tried using Gigapixel on our robin image \u2013 just as a sanity check, you see \u2013 and the whole thing fell apart again, with our Gigapixel image introducing a load of previously-absent noise, mottling the fine detail of our bird.",
    "If ever there was a topic of image editing that deserved the deployment of the shrug emoji, image resizing appears to be it. Get a closer look with the full-size version of the below comparison.",
    "Still, despite these mixed results, the writing\u2019s certainly on the wall for image editing \u2013 AI and cloud-based edits are going to be the way of the future. Has Adobe cracked it?",
    "Super Resolution is an interesting but irritatingly inconsistent way of up-rezzing images, particularly compared to some excellent third party software. But if you\u2019re unwilling to spend the money for Gigapixel, if you find yourself frustrated with how Photoshop upscales using its traditional tools, we\u2019d give the cloud a try."
