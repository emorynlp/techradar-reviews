    "If you're looking to buy a brand new cheap tablet you're likely considering the Amazon Fire range - they're some of the most popular slates on the market, designed for people who like using the company's various apps and services.",
    "Latest to come out of the big A is the Amazon Fire HD 10 (2021) series, and Fire Kids Pro devices, unveiled in late-April - there are six devices in total, which you can pick up in loads of countries around the world.",
    "If you're really keen to buy a new tablet, though, it might not be worth doing so straight away - and if you were thinking of buying a different Amazon device too, like a Kindle ereader, a wait of just a few days could pay off big time.",
    "This even applies if you already own an Amazon tablet or ereader, and just want some accessories. Here's why.",
    "A big tech event on the horizon is Amazon Prime Day - it's kicking off on June 21, so that's barely any time to wait if you want to pick up a new tablet.",
    "Amazon Prime Day is a several-day-long event (yep, despite the name) where loads of different products are discounted, including tech gadgets: phones, TVs, headphones and more should all get some substantial price drops.",
    "Amazon\u2019s own devices usually see pretty big - and consistent - discounts too, with generally 10% to 20% of the price removed.",
    "So if your mouse is hovering over the \u2018add to basket\u2019 button on a new Amazon device, whether it\u2019s a Fire HD tablet, a Kindle, a Fire Stick, a home hub or something else, you should hold off for a couple of weeks - Amazon Prime Day will almost definitely save you some cash.",
    "If you\u2019re considering buying a new device, the initial expense isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019ll be paying.",
    "You\u2019ll need a case, possibly a stand, a power pack or something else, depending on what you\u2019re buying. Amazon makes a lot of accessories for its own devices, but third-party companies do too.",
    "Odds are, over Prime Day, we\u2019ll likely see loads of accessories reduced - so whether you want a car charger or a themed case, they could get discounted as well.",
    "Even if you already have a Kindle or Fire device but need an extra, waiting for a little while longer to buy that accessory could pay off.",
    "As previously mentioned, we don\u2019t know Amazon Prime Day\u2019s kick-off date, but since its June window is pretty soon, it\u2019s worth being patient if you want a new gadget. TechRadar will cover the Prime Day sales, bringing you all the biggest discounts, so check back regularly for them.",
