  "article": [
    "Foxconn, the major manufacturing supplier to Apple and Tesla, has partnered with Chinese startup Byton to help produce the company\u2019s first electric vehicle, the M-Byte.",
    "The deal could prove an important lifeline for the car manufacturer, which is struggling to produce its first vehicle having unveiled its M-Byte concept car several years ago, and marks a strategic move for Foxconn as it looks to build on its existing presence in the auto industry.",
    "When Byton first revealed its electric SUV at CES 2018, it was clear the Chinese company had invested heavily in the technology and interior aesthetic of the vehicle in an attempt to stand out from the EV crowd. A 48-inch full-width display \u2013 plus screens for each of the rear passengers \u2013 was, at the time, the jewel in the M-Byte\u2019s crown, along with facial recognition software to tailor the driver\u2019s seat position to a personal profile and voice control to ensure a totally-hands free UI.",
    "Two years on from its initial announcement, the M-Byte still hasn\u2019t arrived, and it\u2019s a more crowded market than ever \u2013 Tesla, for instance, recently announced a record-breaking year in 2020. But Byton is still betting on its vision, with its first vehicles now set to hit the road in 2022 having partnered with Foxconn to accelerate production. The Taiwanese manufacturing giant\u2019s $200 million investment \u2013 and its long history of building iPhones for Apple and supplying parts to Tesla \u2013 will be a welcome one.",
    "New updates suggest the vehicle is set to retail at $45,000 (around \u00a334,000) for the basic model \u2013 that\u2019s $10,000 (or around \u00a37,000) cheaper than Tesla\u2019s least expensive offering, the Model 3 \u2013 which sets the M-Byte apart as a relatively affordable SUV, given the promises of the technology inside it.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that Byton is planning to offer two powertrain options to customers: a rear-wheel drive model with a 72 kilowatt-hour battery pack (for an estimated 224 miles of range), and an all-wheel drive model that includes a larger 95 kWh battery pack (for approximately 270 miles of range).",
    "It\u2019s unclear whether the vehicle will implement the entire range of smart features previously suggested \u2013 autonomous driving and car-to-car communication software, for example \u2013 but it seems reasonable to assume that its lower cost will come at the expense of the glossier features included in upcoming competitor EVs, like the Mercedes-Benz EQS electric sedan. Concept images from several years ago still appear ambitious even in today\u2019s market, so it will be interesting to see the finished product come 2022.",
    "Could this be China\u2019s first successful automotive export to the world? Foxconn previously revealed plans for its own electric car, and Apple itself is already working on in-house car technology for the company\u2019s inevitable foray into the auto industry, so the jury is out on whether Byton can deliver its attractive, affordable offering in time for buyers to take notice.",
    "In any case, the EV revolution isn\u2019t coming \u2013 it\u2019s already here."
