    "Fresh leaks have shed new light on what to expect from Samsung\u2019s upcoming foldable phones, including their colors, features and more.",
    "We\u2019ve already heard rumors that the Galaxy Z Flip 2 \u2013 likely to be the company\u2019s next clamshell foldable \u2013 will be available in 128GB and 256GB storage options and come running Android 11, while the Galaxy Z Fold 3 \u2013 expected to be Samsung\u2019s new tablet-sized foldable \u2013 will come equipped with the same OS and a higher storage capacity.",
    "But now we\u2019ve got a better idea of the colors both devices will arrive in, too. A recent SamMobile report suggests the Galaxy Z Flip 2 will be launched in a handful of new colors, including light violet, green, black and beige, while the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will arrive in a choice of black or green.",
    "There\u2019s likely to be additional color options available when the phones officially launch, but these are the first color-based rumors we\u2019ve heard regarding Samsung\u2019s upcoming foldables.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that we don\u2019t know for sure what the Galaxy Z Flip 2 will be called. We\u2019ve heard conflicting reports that the device might in fact be called the Galaxy Z Flip 3 (since a 5G version of the Galaxy Z Flip followed the original and is considered by some to be the Z Flip 2 in all but name), but we do expect it to be officially labeled as either the second or third model in the Z Flip range.",
    "In terms of new features coming to the devices, we\u2019ve also learnt that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will likely become the first of Samsung\u2019s foldable phones to offer some degree of water resistance.",
    "According to fresh rumors from leaker @chunvn8888, the Z Fold 3 won\u2019t have an IP rating \u2013 the international standard for how well sealed a device's electrical parts are from the elements like dirt, dust and moisture \u2013 but it will be splash resistant.",
    "Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be able to submerge the phone in the bath like you could with, say, an iPhone 12, but this nonetheless represents an improvement over its predecessor, which was particularly prone to spill-related damage given its exposed hinge.",
    "We\u2019ll know more about both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 2 (or 3?) when the devices officially launch \u2013 likely sometime in 2021 \u2013 but in the meantime we'll keep you updated with all the leaks and rumors as they emerge."
