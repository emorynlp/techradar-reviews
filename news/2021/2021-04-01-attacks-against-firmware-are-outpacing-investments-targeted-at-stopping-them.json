    "Businesses are investing more and more of their cybersecurity budgets to try secure firmware, but these investments are barely moving the needle, new research has suggested.",
    "Firmware, unique computer software providing low-level control for specific hardware components, has become a popular target among cybercriminals.",
    "Now a report from Microsoft claims more than 80% of enterprises experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years while allocating less than a third (29%) of their budgets to protecting the firmware.",
    "Instead, they\u2019re focusing their investments on security updates, vulnerability scanning, and advanced threat protection solutions. What\u2019s more, the National Institute of Science and Technology\u2019s (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD) says the number of attacks against firmware rose five times in the last four years. Criminals are getting better and more destructive, every day.",
    "At the same time, many respondents said they were worried about malware accessing their systems and fear it may be difficult to detect them in time. For Microsoft, what the respondents are trying to suggest is that firmware is more difficult to monitor and control. Furthermore, the lack of automation is only making firmware vulnerabilities that much more dangerous.",
    "Automation may lend a helping hand, as most respondents (82%) said they didn\u2019t have the resources to tackle more high-impact security issues as they\u2019re overwhelmed with low-yield manual work like software patching or hardware upgrades. A fifth (21%) of SDMs said they aren\u2019t monitoring their firmware data. What\u2019s more, 71% said they spend \u201ctoo much\u201d time on work that could be automated.",
    "Firmware owes its popularity among cybercriminals, partly for being a (relatively) easy target. Many devices available today don\u2019t offer visibility into the firmware, making it hard for IT security professionals to keep tabs on them and make sure they aren\u2019t compromised. But, it is also popular as it holds sensitive information, such as credentials or encryption keys.",
    "To make matters worse, many security teams are tackling the issue by bringing a knife to a gunfight. Instead of focusing on \u201cstrategic work\u201d, as Microsoft puts it, many are focusing on \u201coutdated protect and detect\u201d models of security, such as the lack of proactive defense investment in kernel attack vectors.",
    "Just below half (46%) of the respondents said they invested in hardware-based security features such as Kernel data protection (KDP), or memory encryption (36%), which are good at blocking malware that corrupts the OS kernel memory."
