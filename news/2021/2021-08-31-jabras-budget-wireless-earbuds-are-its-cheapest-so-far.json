    "With Alexa built-in, and support for Siri and Google Assistant, the new buds come with Jabra's proprietary MultiSensor Voice technology, which the company says will allow them to deliver \"ultimate call clarity\" in noisy environments.",
    "The technology utilizes four built-in microphones alongside bone conduction sensors and clever algorithms to analyze your voice and your environment. This allows the earbuds to detect the types of sound being picked up by the microphones, and when they spot wind noises, a voice pick-up sensor in each earbud is activated.",

They're 16% smaller than the Jabra Elite 75t, and were designed using a database of 62,000 ear scans, allowing the company to create a map of the average human ear and redesign the earbuds accordingly. An IP57 water and dust resistance rating means the buds should be pretty durable, as well.",
    "As for the sound? Jabra hasn't shared very much information of the kind of audio performance we can expect from the Elite 7 Pro, but you will be able to create personalized audio profile with the company's MySound technology \u2013 and if they sound anything like their predecessors, the Jabra Elite 85t, they'll boast a clear, natural sound, with an impressive bass response.",
