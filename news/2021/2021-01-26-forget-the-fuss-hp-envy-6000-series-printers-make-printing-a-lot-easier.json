    "Printing is a hassle. At least, it probably is for many of us who are still using an old printer or who don\u2019t have a printer at all. We might be using an outdated printer that never seems to have all of its ink cartridges working at the same time and only works with one computer in our whole house. The HP ENVY 6000 Series can take us into modern day with a printing experience that\u2019s ready for 2020.",
    "The HP ENVY 6055 is a do-it-all printer. It can print documents, envelopes, and photos alike. You can scan items to make high-quality, digital copies of them. And, you can copy with ease. But, what\u2019s most important is how prepared the HP ENVY 6055 is for the modern device ecosystem. We\u2019re all on a variety of devices from our computers and tablets to our phones. Where old printers might not have worked with all of the computers in your home, the HP ENVY 6055 is ready to work with pretty much everything.",
    "The HP ENVY 6055 connects directly to your in-home Wi-Fi, even supporting an 802.11ac dual-band connectivity. Bluetooth is also an option. When the printer\u2019s on your wireless network, you can easily use it with the devices in your home. Even phones and tablets can work with it using the HP Smart app. That\u2019s not just for printing either, as you can scan documents to your phone as well. The HP Smart app will also let you manage the printer from any connected device.",
    "In a world where we have TVs and microwaves connecting to Wi-Fi, it\u2019s more than just a little convenient to have a printer that operates wirelessly as well. It can eliminate so much fuss trying to figure out how to use it with various devices that may not have an old USB-A port, as even many laptops have now abandoned that port. Now, when you have a document on your phone, you won\u2019t have to try emailing it to yourself so you can open it on your computer to print it \u2013 you can just send it to the HP ENVY 6055 directly from your phone. Thanks to a large 100-sheet paper tray, you won\u2019t have to worry about whether the printer is well stocked before starting those printing jobs.",
    "The HP ENVY 6055 can also solve the issue of running out of ink. Through HP\u2019s Instant Ink program, it can automatically order more ink when it\u2019s running low, so you never have to run out to a print shop last minute, thereby defeating the purpose of even owning a printer.",
    "So, if you\u2019re ready to take your printing into the modern day, check out the HP ENVY 6055."
