    "Major spoilers follow for Foundation\u2019s first three episodes. Watch them first before reading on.",
    "As Apple TV Plus\u2019 supposedly next big hit, Foundation is taking its time to hit its stride. Ordinarily, a great TV series would\u2019ve hooked viewers by now and already be delivering compelling drama, humor, suspense or action each week.",
    "But Foundation isn\u2019t done with its character and story set-ups \u2013 something that its third entry, The Mathematician\u2019s Ghost, is guilty of. There\u2019s a decent amount of progress in its Trantor-centric plot, but episode 3\u2019s Terminus storyline feels like a backwards step as it introduces us to more cast members and settings that, while admittedly key to Foundation\u2019s plot, slow its pacing down once more.",
    "Unlike its predecessors, Foundation episode 3 takes a different approach to its branching narratives. Rather than jumping back and forth between each storyline, The Mathematician\u2019s Ghost\u2019s first half is entirely devoted to its Trantor-based plot. Terminus\u2019 story thread, meanwhile, is reserved for later.",
    "It\u2019s a strategy that works well. Yes, Trantor\u2019s story includes the show\u2019s now customary time jumps \u2013 400 years into the past, then 19 years after the Star Bridge bombing and, finally, another 17 years into the future. Given that Foundation\u2019s story spans an entire millennia, this cycling through time is ultimately necessary.",
    "With episode 3 devoting its first half to Trantor, too, its time hopping isn\u2019t as confusing as Foundation\u2019s two previous entries: its singular storyline, unfolding in the same location, being much easier to follow. This approach also gives Foundation time to provide a clearer insight into how each of Cleon I\u2019s clones are created, carry out their royal duties and undergo their \u2018ascension\u2019 when they\u2019re no longer fit for purpose.",
    "And that helps Trantor\u2019s main players to ingratiate themselves to us. What\u2019s notable about Cleon\u2019s clones, and their humanoid advisor Eto Demerzel, is that they\u2019re more available from an emotional perspective than their human counterparts. You can sense the regret and dread in each clone ahead of their \u2018ascension\u2019: a pleasant name for the process where each one is incinerated at the end of their lifespan.",
    "Seeing Brother Dusk \u2013 now known briefly as Brother Darkness \u2013 being terminated in mere seconds makes for harrowing viewing. It\u2019s a somewhat anticlimactic way for someone\u2019s life to end, but it provides viewers with an insight into the callous and self-righteous nature of Cleon I\u2019s original clone plan. It gives no regard to the thoughts and feelings of his clones, regardless of whether they\u2019re considered to be truly alive or not. It\u2019s the first time where Foundation poses an ethical question to its audience and, by doing so sensitively, it challenges us to ponder whether Cleon I\u2019s plan is amoral or not.",
    "The same is true of Demerzel. As a humanoid who\u2019s outlived Cleon I and every one of his clones, we witness the impact that each one\u2019s death has had on her. It\u2019s a sad and lonely existence for Demerzel, particularly after we learned that she\u2019s the last of her kind in episode 2.",
    "Again, we\u2019re able to relate with a non-human emotionally \u2013 compare that to the disconnect we feel with Cleon I, or other humans we\u2019ve seen in the show, and there\u2019s a stark contrast between characters we resonate with and those we don\u2019t. It\u2019s akin to TV shows like Westworld or Humans where, as an audience, we care more for humanoids than the series\u2019 real people.",
    "If there\u2019s one aspect of episode 3\u2019s Trantor storyline that\u2019s slightly confusing, it\u2019s how it uses Lee Pace and Terrence Mann to briefly embody younger versions of their emperors.",
    "Pace and Mann end up portraying Brother Dawn and Brother Day \u2013 they played Day and Dusk respectively in Foundation\u2019s first two episodes \u2013 during Darkness\u2019 \u2018ascension\u2019. Initially, it\u2019s difficult to adapt to the pair\u2019s altered roles but, thankfully, it\u2019s only for one scene before they revert back to Day and Dusk respectively. And, while it\u2019s disorienting, it is pleasing that Foundation uses the same actors to inhabit these roles. It maintains continuity between the three emperors\u2019 appearances as they age and forgo the use of prosthetics or other makeup.",
    "While Trantor\u2019s story is straightforward, the same can\u2019t be said for Terminus\u2019. Its plot picks up with Seldon\u2019s followers eventually landing on their new home, but it begins to rush through events with very little time for viewers to immerse themselves in these new surroundings.",
    "We\u2019re quickly reintroduced to the Vault, watch a CGI timelapse of Terminus City being built, and spend a very brief moment meeting a young Salvor Hardin. It\u2019s all a bit breathless, even more so when the show fast forwards to \u2018present day\u2019 where an adult Salvor (Leah Harvey) is now Warden of Terminus.",
    "The pacing of episode 3\u2019s second half feels more imbalanced when, after we meet adult Salvor, it slows right down. More characters are introduced, such as Daniel MacPherson\u2019s Hugo, while various plot exposition hampers the episode\u2019s flow.",
    "It\u2019s an issue that grates even more when The Mathematician\u2019s Ghost actually starts to go somewhere.",
    "We get all-too-brief conversations between Salvor and her parents Abbas (Clarke Peters) and Mari (Sasha Behar), which offer a tiny but fun insight into their family dynamic. Meanwhile, a meeting between Terminus\u2019 main leaders, after Anacreon warships are spotted orbiting Terminus, and a sequence where Salvor chases an unknown child into a wrecked spaceship, provide some much needed tension and horror to proceedings.",
    "But it\u2019s just not enough to satisfy viewers\u2019 demands for greater character development or better plot pacing. Episode 3\u2019s ending, which sees Salvor ambushed by an Anacreon landing party, could kickstart the Terminus story arc into life. But, with Salvor\u2019s fate unknown until episode 4 \u2013 the credits roll immediately after she\u2019s surrounded \u2013 we have to wait another week for Foundation to simply get going.",
    "The Mathematician\u2019s Ghost is a disjointed Foundation entry that continues to wrestle with pacing and plot issues. The change in narrative approach certainly helped its Trantor-centric storyline, but its Terminus plot arc appears to suffer as a result. So it\u2019ll be interesting if subsequent episodes stick to this new formula or return to the location-swapping blueprint that was used in episodes 1 and 2.",
    "If Foundation wants to break away from its continual pacing problems, though, it might need to do away with its location hopping and multiple time jumps. Yes, the show\u2019s world building has been necessary, but it\u2019s been to the detriment of in-depth character development, action sequences, shocking twists and interesting subplots.",
    "Unless there\u2019s a real need to establish any new major characters or locations, Apple\u2019s live-action adaptation needs to start focusing on those latter points. Otherwise, it may struggle to maintain viewers\u2019 interest before season 1 reaches its midway point.",
    "New episodes of Foundation debut exclusively on Apple TV Plus every Friday."
