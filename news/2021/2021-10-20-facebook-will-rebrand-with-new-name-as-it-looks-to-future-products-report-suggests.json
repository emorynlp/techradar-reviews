    "Facebook will soon change its name, a new report suggests, as it seeks to demonstrate that it has expanded beyond its social media roots, and has its sights firmly set on creating future products such as the metaverse.",
    "According to The Verge, it\u2019s as yet unclear whether the name change will come to the Facebook platform itself, or whether the rebranding will take the form of a new parent company for Facebook to sit under, alongside other Facebook-owned brands including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus.",
    "The Verge\u2019s report quotes \u201ca source with direct knowledge of the matter,\u201d who claims Facebook\u2019s founder Mark Zuckerberg will discuss the name change at the upcoming Facebook Connect conference on October 28.",
    "TechRadar reached out to Facebook for comment on the matter, though a spokesperson for the company would only say: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on rumor or speculation.\u201d",
    "It makes sense that Facebook would want to rebrand to better reflect the various products and brands it now runs, such as the virtual-reality focused Oculus. We saw a similar strategy back in 2015 when Google restructured and created a new parent company for itself named Alphabet, with the Google suite of products and services becoming a subsidiary under that new parent.",
    "Six years on, it\u2019s safe to say the DNA of Google hasn\u2019t changed all that much, and similarly, the creation of a new parent company for Facebook may have little effect on Facebook\u2019s current range of products and services, and is likely more focused on future ambitions.",
    "With that said, it must be acknowledged that Facebook is in the midst of a brand crisis. Last month, The Wall Street Journal released \u201cThe Facebook Files\u201d \u2013 a controversial set of leaked documents that showed Facebook had conducted its own research into Instagram\u2019s negative impact on the mental health of teenagers.",
    "The whistleblower soon revealed herself as former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen, who has since testified to the United States Senate regarding what she claims are harmful practices at the social giant.",
    "If Mark Zuckerberg is to announce plans to change the name of Facebook on October 28, it's also a convenient excuse to put some space between the company\u2019s other brands and the dark reputation its social media platform has earned."
