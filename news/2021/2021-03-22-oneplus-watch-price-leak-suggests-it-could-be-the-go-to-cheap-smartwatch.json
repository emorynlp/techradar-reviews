    "We know the OnePlus Watch is confirmed to appear at the OnePlus 9 launch event on March 23, but now we\u2019ve got a better idea of how much it\u2019ll cost too.",
    "According to serial OnePlus leaker Ishan Agarwal, the Chinese company\u2019s wearable debut will cost around \u20ac150 on the European market (which converts to around $178 / \u00a3128 / AU$230).",
    "At that price range, the OnePlus Watch undercuts the launch cost of many of its mid-range smartwatch competitors, including the Amazfit GTS 2, and would be noticeably cheaper than more premium options like the Apple Watch SE and Samsung Galaxy Watch 3.",
    "Of course, it\u2019s worth taking every rumor with a healthy helping of salt, though we already know the watch is set to enter the market at an 'affordable price point', as per recent comments made by OnePlus CEO Pete Lau on a company forum.",
    "Agarwal also advises caution when converting this expected European price into other currencies \u2013 he warns they \u2018will be different\u2019 than expected \u2013 but these conversions nonetheless offer a good indicator of the ballpark figure expected of the OnePlus Watch worldwide.",
    "Despite its imminent official announcement, we\u2019ve already seen what the OnePlus Watch will look like \u2013 and we\u2019ve got an idea of what its internals might look like, too.",
    "A tweet posted by popular tech YouTuber Unbox Therapy revealed a circular case, two visible side buttons and a rubber wristband; a design which most rumors predicted.",
    "The design looks similar to the circular Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 (without the touch dial), but this single image doesn\u2019t reveal a great deal else about the watch. We do know it\u2019s expected to arrive in a silver color variant (thanks, Android Central), in addition to the black case color featured above.",
    "We also know the OnePlus Watch won\u2019t come running Google\u2019s Wear OS software, suggesting we could see it using its own proprietary operating system (rather than Apple\u2019s watchOS or rival Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS). Previous leaks also pointed towards this being the case.",
    "All our questions will be answered on March 23, though, so make sure you stay tuned to TechRadar for our coverage of the OnePlus 9 launch event.",
