    "The Google Pixel 6 range has only just gone on sale but already there\u2019s evidence of the Google Pixel 7 being in the works, and there\u2019s even some news about its chipset.",
    "Tech journalist Mishaal Rahman has spotted mention of a \u2018GS201\u2019 in some Android code changes, and this is almost certainly the next generation of the Google Tensor chipset \u2013 possibly called the Google Tensor 2.",
    "That\u2019s because the original Tensor powering the Pixel 6 range has been linked to the model number GS101. The code doesn\u2019t reveal anything else, and it\u2019s not really surprising that Google would be working on the next generation of this chipset, but it does suggest that the company will stick with Tensor rather than switching back to a Snapdragon chipset.",
    "And given that this reference has been found in official Google code, it\u2019s not something we really need to take with a pinch of salt \u2013 though of course anything could happen between now and the Pixel 7\u2019s launch, likely in October 2022.",
    "In smaller Pixel 7 news, 9to5Google has spotted references to the codename \u2018Cloudripper\u2019 buried within code for some of the apps that ship with the Pixel 6.",
    "The site believes that this is a codename for a baseboard or developer board that will be used by the Pixel 7 range. So this again doesn\u2019t tell us much, but it is evidence that the Google Pixel 7 range is already in the works.",
    "Google Tensor was one of the most exciting aspects of the Pixel 6 range prior to launch, as it\u2019s a completely new chipset and there was lots of speculation about how powerful it would be.",
    "As it turns out, while Tensor is plenty powerful, it\u2019s not a match for the likes of the Snapdragon 888 found in many Android flagships, let alone Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic chipset in the iPhone 13 range.",
    "So for the Google Tensor 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) we\u2019d like to see a real boost given to the performance, so that it\u2019s as exciting in reality as the original Tensor was in our imaginations.",
