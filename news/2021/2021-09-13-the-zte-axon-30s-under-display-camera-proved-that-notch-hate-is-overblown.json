    "Every year, a new iPhone is revealed and inevitably met with the same first criticism: the unsightly notch is still there. Android phones, for their part, still have punch-holes in their displays. But now that I\u2019ve had time with the ZTE Axon 30, a phone with an under-display camera and a clean display, I can confidently say: all that notch hate is pretty overblown.",
    "It\u2019s certainly better to have a display without a notch or punch-hole \u2013 it\u2019s aesthetically pleasing to have a screen unmarked by a camera-containing hole or strip. It\u2019s easy math: more screen area means more screen to watch movies and play games.",
    "But you\u2019re actually not missing much by missing out on the full-screen experience, not enough to really envy anyone. Why? Because that chunk of screen is pretty much dead real estate anyway.",
    "This isn\u2019t a knock on the ZTE Axon 30, either \u2013 the under-display camera is pretty much invisible (you can barely see an off-color square above the camera if you angle the phone to catch outside light just right).",
    "But that small patch of screen on the far left side just isn\u2019t used or noticeable most of the time. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to argue that, like me, you probably wouldn\u2019t notice if the notch or punch-hole was gone. Not just because we\u2019ve trained ourselves to ignore these gaps in our phone media consumption, but because modern media just isn\u2019t made with the extreme sides in mind.",
    "Next time you watch a movie or TV show, whether on your phone or a theater-size screen, see how often you\u2019re paying attention to the leftmost and rightmost sides. If you\u2019re humoring me, you\u2019ll probably give it a strong few minutes before your attention is inadvertently drawn toward the center.",
    "The center has everything worth watching \u2013 filmmaking convention keeps most of the subjects and action closer to the middle of the screen. This draws from theater tradition before it, giving patrons a good angle no matter where they\u2019re seated, and the same is roughly true of movie theaters.",
    "There are exceptions, of course, especially from filmmakers playing against convention by hiding elements in the corners of the frame, from William Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist (remember the demon face?) to Ari Aster\u2019s Hereditary. But they\u2019re exceptions proving a rule: keep action focused on the center. This has become convention enough that we\u2019re now trained to pay attention to the middle of the screen, perpetuating a cycle of creation and consumption that most media doesn\u2019t bother with the edges of the screen.",
    "(The same is true of video games, too, but there\u2019s something else to consider in smartphone gaming: if you\u2019re playing with your device rotated sideways, your thumb is probably covering up that leftmost area where a notch or punch-hole would be.)",
    "But there\u2019s another convention at play, too: UX design. After half a decade of the notch, which was popularized by the Essential Phone and iPhone X in 2017 (and debuted on the Sharp Aquos S2 \u2013 thanks, Phone Arena), most of the area on the top of the display is relegated to mail and message notifications, battery life, phone signal, and other indicators.",
    "Phone UX designers consider the notch in their designs, and cram all those icons in there instead of forcing more crucial interaction up top. It makes sense, but does mean that most interaction is designed to happen in the area below where any notch or punch-hole would be.",
    "That\u2019s for phone owners lucky enough to have notches and punch-holes \u2013 because many phone owners around the world don\u2019t have them. While a little out of date, this mid-2020 Statista report claims that global market share of iPhones with notches (aka the iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR, and iPhone 11 models) is a little over 45%. That means over half the models in use are either older (the iPhone 8 and prior) or the iPhone SE models.",
    "That\u2019s just an example, and though it\u2019s harder to track Android phones, it\u2019s certain there are enough non-iOS phones without notches and punch-holes as well.",
    "But even with a phone packing an under-display camera and a full, unblemished screen, you still might not be able to watch your media from display edge to display edge \u2013 and it\u2019s the same reason you\u2019re still getting black bars around the edges of some media you watch on even the best TVs out there.",
    "The reason I couldn\u2019t watch media that filled the entire ZTE Axon 30\u2019s display? Because those shows and movies weren\u2019t shot in the 20.5:9 ratio to fit that phone\u2019s screen. I fired up The Fellowship of the Ring on HBO and got giant vertical bars on either side, which made sense as it was shot in 2.35:1. Likewise, I fired up The Good Place (1.78:1) and saw the vertical bars.",
    "Or you could think of it in terms of resolution: given the phone\u2019s irregular Full HD Plus resolution (2460 x 1080) is larger than the typical Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080), those black bars are coming in to bookend a lot of media. Sure, you can expand the screen to fit the picture with some players (like YouTube and Netflix), but that cuts off some picture. No matter the reason, there\u2019s a good chance that if you\u2019re watching something, you probably aren\u2019t seeing the extreme edges of the phone \u2013 so it doesn\u2019t matter if you had a notch or not.",
    "Overall, this isn\u2019t something to worry about, as under-display cameras seem to be the next big development in phone design after other methods like pop-up selfie lenses have been abandoned."
