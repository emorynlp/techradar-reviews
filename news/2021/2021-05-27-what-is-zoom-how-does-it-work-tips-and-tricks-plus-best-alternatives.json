  "summary": "Zoom meetings have become a part of everyday life",
  "article": [
    "Video conferencing platform Zoom has become a household name after enjoying a breakout year, in large part due to the pandemic and rise of remote working.",
    "It's used primarily by businesses to host meetings with remote colleagues and clients, but Zoom is an equally useful tool for keeping in touch with friends and family.",
    "Zoom video conferencing is celebrated for its ease of use, high quality video and audio, and collaboration facilities - and the basic version is also completely free of charge.",
    "Attendees can join a Zoom meeting without even signing into the app, but must register for an account to host a video meeting. Premium versions support Zoom meetings with up to 1,000 participants, call recording, unlimited phone calls and much more.",
    "The Zoom app is available on all major desktop and mobile operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android and iOS.",
    "For more information, visit our how to use Zoom guide.",
    "Zoom is available free of charge to anyone and the basic free version offers all the facilities most people will need. However, as with anything, you get what you pay for.",
    "Free Zoom offers video conferencing for up to 100 participants, provided the meeting runs for no longer than 40 minutes, at which point attendees are ejected from the conference. If you don\u2019t mind the hassle of dialling back in, the host can simply start another call.",
    "It also supports unlimited one-on-one meetings, screen sharing, chat, virtual backgrounds, whiteboard and more.",
    "The paid version, meanwhile, effectively removes time limits for group video conferences (pushing the cap to 24 hours), and also allows the host to record meetings to cloud or on-device storage and schedule repeat meetings.",
    "The most basic paid version costs $149.90/\u00a3119.90/AU$209.90 per year when billed annually or $14.99/\u00a311.99/AU$20.99 per month, which is a little more expensive in the long-run.",
    "Quoted prices do not cover additional add-ons - such as webinar facilities, large meetings (up to 1000 participants) and additional cloud recording storage - which will bump up the price.",
    "While the word Zoom is used by some as a byword for video conference, there are many Zoom alternatives on the market capable of rivalling the big name brand.",
    "Here are a few alternatives to Zoom that make an equally good choice for businesses looking for the best video conferencing services around:",
