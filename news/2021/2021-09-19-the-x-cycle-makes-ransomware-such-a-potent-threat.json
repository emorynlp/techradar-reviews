    "The threat posed by ransomware has grown ever more acute in recent years, as cybercriminals adapt their approach to manoeuvre around protections put in place by businesses.",
    "First, the emergence of double extortion attacks (whereby criminals exfiltrate as well as encrypt data) meant businesses could no longer rely on extensive backups for recovery. And now, hackers are beginning to adopt triple extortion techniques, adding DDoS attacks to their arsenal.",
    "The rise of the cyber insurance market has offered a way for businesses to mitigate the financial risk of ransomware, but also incentivizes further attacks by increasing the likelihood of a payout.",
    "To find out about the combination of factors that makes ransomware so effective, as well as the measures businesses can take to minimize risk, TechRadar Pro spoke with Aare Reintam, COO at security firm CybExer Technologies."
