    "Christopher Nolan is a big fan of the theatrical experience \u2013 but he doesn't seem to dig streaming in the same way. Back in 2020, the Tenet director described HBO Max as \u201cthe worst [streamer] of the lot,\u201d adding that Warner Bros\u2019 hybrid release plan makes \u201cno economic sense\u201d when it comes to 2021 movies like Dune and The Suicide Squad.",
    "Well, Nolan\u2019s reservations about streaming haven\u2019t dampened the spirits of Netflix film chief Scott Stuber, who has voiced his desire to release the director\u2019s next movie on the platform.",
    "In an interview with Variety, Stuber claimed he would do \u201ceverything [he] can\u201d to work with Nolan \u201cif and when he comes up with his new movie,\u201d adding that you need to have \u201czero ego\u201d in Hollywood and lauding Nolan for being \u201can incredible filmmaker.\u201d",
    "High praise, indeed \u2013 but it\u2019s not Netflix who needs convincing. Back in 2017, Nolan told IndieWire that \u201cNetflix has a bizarre aversion to supporting theatrical films\" and a \u201cmindless policy of everything having to be simultaneously streamed and released.\u201d He has since toned down his feelings for streamers, but it still seems unlikely that Nolan would ever sign off on a deal that would see one of his movies never make it to the cinema.",
    "So what would Nolan stand to gain from penning a partnership with Netflix? Well, while the streamer would no doubt open the war chest to bring his vision to life, the big-budget director has never struggled for financing on his projects. Tenet cost a reported $200 million, while The Dark Knight Rises was green-lit with a budget of nearer $230 million.",
    "Netflix likes to spend big, that much is clear, but rarely that big. To date, the streamer\u2019s biggest movie has been Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, which commanded an estimated budget of $159 million.",
    "Reports suggest Netflix\u2019s spy drama The Gray Man will become its most expensive ever at $200 million, but that figure only just approaches the region of Nolan\u2019s latest projects. This year's Red Notice, starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, could cost upwards of $160 million, according to a Variety report.",
    "It\u2019s also unlikely that Netflix\u2019s carte blanche approach to creative direction would be a major draw for the director. Typically, the streamer has given the reins over to filmmakers whose visions would be otherwise stifled by studio executives who have no time for bold ideas \u2013 David Fincher\u2019s Mank, for instance \u2013 but again, that isn\u2019t a problem Nolan has faced in recent years.",
    "Being the sure-fire, cash cow director he is, Warner Bros. has had no qualms signing off on completely original IP like Inception because it knows his movies will turn a profit \u2013 outside of pandemic times, of course.",
    "Still, in a reality where Netflix did manage to land Nolan, they'd have no problem giving his movies a platform. The streamer currently has around 210 million paid subscribers \u2013 which is probably slightly more than would typically see the director's movies in theaters.",
    "That\u2019s still a fairly arbitrary comparison, though, and Nolan would likely argue on the contrary \u2013 putting his movies in cinemas allows everyone an equal opportunity to see them.",
    "For Netflix, landing Nolan is clearly still a dream scenario, based on Stuber's words. As for whether he stays with long-time collaborators Warner Bros., that's an altogether larger question \u2013 especially with rumors of a departure to rival studio Universal on the cards.",
    "Besides, Nolan isn\u2019t the only acclaimed director on the streamer\u2019s radar. Netflix recently penned a deal with Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie studio, Amblin Partners, which will see it produce several new feature films for the platform every year \u2013 with some projects potentially directed by Spielberg himself.",
    "These new movies aren\u2019t yet associated with any budgetary or genre requirements, either, so it\u2019s likely that Netflix will benefit from more high-profile productions like Michael Bay's 6 Underground or The Irishman in the near future, in any case.",
    "If Netflix were to bag Spielberg and Nolan? Then theaters might have cause to panic.",
