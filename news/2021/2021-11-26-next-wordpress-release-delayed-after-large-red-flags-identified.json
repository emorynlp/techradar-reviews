  "article": [
    "The WordPress developers have decided to push back the release of the next major version of the popular content management system (CMS) to January, 2022, after some developers expressed concern about the pace of development.",
    "\u201cI think there are some large red flags here that some things are not ready for 5.9\u2026.Overall, it seems like right now we are rushing things in a dangerous way,\u201d wrote Addison Stavlo, a contributor to WordPress\u2019 Gutenberg editor.",
    "The original plan was to release WordPress 5.9 in mid December, 2021. However, things weren\u2019t smooth during the alpha release cycle, forcing core developers to make several changes.",
    "Not impressed by the changes to \u201cso many things at the last minute,\u201d Stavlo wondered why delaying the release wouldn\u2019t be a better idea than making \u201cregrettable decisions.\u201d",
    "As she announced the revised schedule Tonya Mork, Core Tech Lead for the 5.9 release, shared that the team had two options; either move the major features that had unresolved issues to the WordPress 6.0 release, or delay the release of WordPress 5.9.",
    "After careful deliberation, the core developers decided that the issues would be best handled now than later.",
    "\u201cThe 6.0 release isn\u2019t due until April 2022\u2014too long for the community to wait for them [the features]. After processing this list of issues, Core Editor team saw the features could ship in 5.9 with the revised schedule. This decision, to delay the 5.9 release, was not made lightly,\u201d explains Mork.",
    "5.9 is still in feature freeze, and Mork stresses that the developers will use the elongated development period to iron out the issues and help 5.9 get to a Stable state.",
