    "Having a bunch of smart devices in your home, whether that\u2019s smart speakers like the Amazon Echo, smart displays like the Lenovo Smart Clock, or the many security cameras and video doorbells out there, is an increasingly common part of living in a connected modern home. We can use voice commands to dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or even change channels on our smart TVs \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing an explosion in the number of ways we can interface with our various gadgets and toys.",
    "When you\u2019re a technology journalist, though, the smart meter goes up to 11 \u2013 and there\u2019s a personal cost when you\u2019re living with people who don\u2019t share your level of ease around intelligent devices.",
    "I\u2019ve reviewed a number of smart speakers, like the Amazon Echo Plus, or (my personal favorite and ongoing music buddy) the Pure DiscovR \u2013 and I have to keep a bunch of associated smart plugs and security cameras on site, too, just to make sure different devices work in tandem. So the number of wires, plugs, and speakers packed into my shelves and cupboards is, at times, a bit embarrassing, especially when I\u2019m only ever going to have one or two devices set up at any one time.",
    "My previous flatmate made it clear when I moved in that \u201cthe Alexa\u201d wouldn\u2019t be allowed in communal spaces, out of privacy concerns. Not that two geeks in their 20s were saying much worth listening to between sessions of Halo and anime binges, but the principle still stood: why would anyone be ok with being constantly overheard, when it\u2019s not even a device they plan on using?",
    "My partner prefers to use a \u2018dumb\u2019 Bluetooth speaker unable to eavesdrop on us, too, and it means any testing periods or new device setups have to be carefully arranged, so as not to compromise someone else\u2019s feeling of safety in their home.",
    "There have been too many privacy scandals around mainstream smart devices to dismiss them as paranoia. There are security bugs that let hackers listen in to private conversations, reports of Amazon staff listening to user conversations, and hacking vulnerabilities in smart locks \u2013 while the Amazon-owned Ring has been beset with both data breaches and reports of employees accessing live camera feeds.",
    "In order to pick up voice commands, Alexa speakers and the like have to be \u2018listening\u2019 all the time anyway, and a study by researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London found that they can activate by mistake up to 19 times a day.",
    "When it comes to smart speakers, devices that by design are meant to sit in the background until they\u2019re needed, it is worryingly easy for me to forget they\u2019re in the vicinity. (Waiting, listening, plotting, and the like.)",
    "Having used so many of them in a professional capacity means I can forget the unease surrounding their presence in personal spaces. And it\u2019s hard to feel precious about my own data or privacy when I have to sign up to countless technology platforms with my personal details in the name of testing and reviewing.",
    "The compromise I often end up making is only using smart speakers with the microphone muted \u2013 something that\u2019s relatively easy to do, though culls their most convenient feature, that being the voice commands. If I have to go and unmute to talk to it, why not just search it on my phone, or use a less advanced Bluetooth speaker?",
    "The Pure DiscovR comes with a physical way to disconnect the microphone, though it also limits the volume and bass frequencies \u2013 meaning I have to choose between audio quality and personal privacy when considering the feature.",
    "Being wary of our devices, and the companies that make them, always seems sensible. Amazon, Google, and the like are inevitably serving their own interests, even if they're offering convenient products and services at the same time \u2013 and user data is a big part of how these companies monetize their products.",
    "But given how prolific smart devices are now, there\u2019s a growing pressure to accept the potential for privacy invasion \u2013 and that\u2019s a pressure I end up exerting on the people around me, just by proximity. When we choose to let smart devices and voice assistants into our lives, it\u2019s very easy to end up making that decision on behalf of your families, friends, and flatmates \u2013 and it\u2019s very hard to see our collective acceptance going backwards at this point."
