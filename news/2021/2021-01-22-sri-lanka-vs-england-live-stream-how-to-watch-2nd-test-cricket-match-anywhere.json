    "England's short visit to Sri Lanka concludes this weekend, with the tourists taking a 1-0 lead into the 2nd and final Test in Galle. A superb double century (228) from captain Joe Root helped propel the Three Lions to victory in the first encounter, but the hosts are sure to put up a fight in a bid to force an overall series draw. Read on as we explain how to get a Sri Lanka vs England live stream and watch the 2nd Test online, no matter where in the world you are right now.",
    "Root will once again be unable to call on the services of all-rounder Moeen Ali following a positive Covid-19 test, but his top-class slow bowling skills weren't as missed as they might have been, with fill-in spinner Jack Leach notching a five-wicket haul in the 1st Test.",
    "Leach retains his place for the 2nd Test, with England making only one change to their side, with experienced fast bowler Jimmy Anderson coming in so fellow veteran paceman Stuart Broad can be rested. As in the 1st Test, Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope are England's main absentees alongside Ali.",
    "After a disappointing 1st Test performance, Sri Lanka could ring a number of changes, with Kusal Mendis confirmed to be replaced by Oshada Fernando in the starting XI. Suranga Lakmal could also return to the side, with the places of Dasun Shanaka and Wanindu Hasaranga also thought to be under threat.",
