    "Having a PS5 or Xbox Series X is all well and good, but what use is all that next-gen firepower without a gaming TV that can show it off with style? Thankfully, Black Friday TV deals have kicked off in earnest, and plenty of them would make great gaming TVs.",
    "For Sony PS5 owners, Sony TVs are an obvious choice \u2013 though you'll want to stick to 2021 models like the A80J OLED (discounted to $1,399 after a $400 price cut) that actually package in HDMI 2.1 support. You shouldn't ignore sets from competing manufacturers, however, whether it's a premium LG OLED or a budget TCL TV able to meet a smaller wallet.",
    "When it comes to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, you simply need an LG gaming TV. LG is the only TV maker yet to support Dolby Vision gaming \u2013 a feature you'll get only on Xbox consoles \u2013 and you'll want to make sure you're future-proofed for the HDR games starting to trickle into the market. But you can see all the best discounts on Black Friday gaming TVs below.",
    "Don't see anything you like? Check out the discounts on other Black Friday TV deals, or head to our PS5 Black Friday deals and Black Friday Xbox Series X/S deals guides to actually get your hands on a console first.",

    "You might also want to check out the capabilities of HDMI on PS5."
