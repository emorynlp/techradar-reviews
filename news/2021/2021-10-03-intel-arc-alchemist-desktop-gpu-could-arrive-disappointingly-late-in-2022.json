    "Intel\u2019s Arc Alchemist desktop GPU may not emerge until the second quarter of 2022, going by the latest from the rumor mill, which has also shared some renders of what the graphics card could theoretically look like when it does debut.",
    "This comes from YouTube-based hardware leaker Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, who in a new video (spotted by VideoCardz) claims that when Intel talks about a Q1 2022 launch for its Xe-HPG (high-performance gaming) products, the chip giant is referring to laptop GPUs, and the actual Alchemist desktop graphics cards might not arrive until Q2.",
    "The theory is that Alchemist laptop GPUs will launch alongside Alder Lake mobile chips, to make for some seriously pepped-up gaming laptops, and that desktop Alchemist products could then follow the quarter after. The delay may be tied in with supply chain and production worries, rather than any concerns about things like drivers, but as ever, take anything heard on the GPU grapevine with a good deal of skepticism.",
    "As mentioned at the outset, Moore\u2019s Law is Dead also shared some interesting images in this latest video, representing a purportedly fairly accurate mock-up of what these next-gen GPUs will look like.",
    "We have to note carefully here that these images of Intel\u2019s desktop Alchemist graphics card are simply renders (there\u2019s a nifty animation shown in the video, in fact) created for Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, which is illustrative of what the GPU should look like. These are in no way actual pics of Intel\u2019s card, in other words (which obviously isn\u2019t finished yet anyway).",
    "The renders are based on fresh info that several sources have given to Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, with early engineering sample shots that the leaker already had from some time back being used as a reference point to put together the renders.",
    "Moore\u2019s Law is Dead further explains that this is pretty much what \u2018most\u2019 current reference test boards look like \u2013 there are other designs out there, he clarifies, but in all likelihood, this is what the finished design will be. That\u2019s not certain, naturally, and there\u2019s obviously a good chance that even if this is what the Alchemist flagship turns out to be, there will be various changes between now and the launch of the card.",
    "In short, apply very liberal scatterings of your preferred condiments, and bear firmly in mind that this is just an idea of what the finished desktop graphics card might look like, with various elements potentially changing (he mentions the color, vent placement, and other finer details that\u2019ll almost certainly be fine-tuned \u2013 and who knows, bigger changes could come, even if these renders are on the money for the test boards now).",
    "If this is what Intel\u2019s new desktop GPUs will turn out like, or something along these lines, then we\u2019re giving it a tentative thumbs-up: the rendered card looks quite nifty in our opinion \u2013 not fancy, but kind of slick in its simplicity. Which isn\u2019t a bad line to take, really.",
    "What\u2019s a bit disappointing here is the possibility that we might have to wait for the second quarter of 2022 before we see the desktop versions of the Alchemist graphics card (remember, though, that this potential delay is merely whispers on the grapevine).",
    "Gamers are hungry to see what Intel has to offer, but with that Q1 2022 release date already floated, if the desktop GPUs don\u2019t actually pitch up until Q2 \u2013 which could mean June, or the middle of the year, even if that is seemingly an unlikely scenario \u2013 folks could lose patience and buy an AMD or Nvidia card instead. Or alternatively, at that point the next-gen products from Teams Red and Green may be just around the corner \u2013 with the rumor mill spinning away furiously by then \u2013 and in that case, the danger is that gamers may wait a bit longer to see what those RTX 4000 (presumably) or RDNA 3 products bring.",
    "That said, if Intel goes for the throat on the price front \u2013 as we expect might be the case, as an obvious line of attack \u2013 that could still tempt buyers later down the line next year (indeed, overall availability of GPUs could well still be shaky at the point, anyway).",
    "However, when it comes down to it, we\u2019ve been waiting quite some time for Intel to debut these desktop Xe-HPG cards, and pushing things out further to possibly the middle of next year feels dangerous to us. Still, Alchemist won\u2019t be ready until it\u2019s ready, and if supply chain pressures get in the way, there won\u2019t be much Intel can do about it."
