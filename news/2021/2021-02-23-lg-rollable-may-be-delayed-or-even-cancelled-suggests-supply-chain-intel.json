  "article": [
    "Update: In a statement to The Verge, LG denied it has delayed or cancelled the LG Rollable with a spokesperson saying \"I can firmly deny that any such decision on future mobile products has been finalized.\" However, this comment leaves open the possibility that a decision to cancel the LG Rollable could be finalized in the future.",
    "Original story: Yet another rumor suggests that the LG Rollable may have been delayed, if not cancelled outright.",
    "LG has allegedly told its suppliers, including those providing displays, that the rollable project has been put on hold, according to Yonhap News.",
    "The Rollable was dramatically unveiled at the online-only CES 2021, and subsequently confirmed a 2021 release date \u2013 but weeks later, we heard that the device might be cancelled. These uneven rumors make us wonder if the LG Rollable is coming out this year after all.",
    "Which hasn\u2019t meant the end of LG Rollable news, as we just heard about more patents that could regard the upcoming unfurling device. The latest patent looks a lot like the model we saw on the virtual CES 2021 stage, but it could end up being an alternative design.",
    "If the LG Rollable ends up cancelled, that might be the end of LG\u2019s endeavors releasing phones, as we heard last month that the company was considering selling its smartphone business.",
    "If that happens, LG may still be in the smartphone industry, if only to make display panels for iPhones. That'd be a sad turn of events given all the work they seemingly put in to making a rollable phone happen. Butm if so, we\u2019ve still got the TCL Rollable supposedly coming, along with a Samsung rollable phone potentially on the way, too.",
