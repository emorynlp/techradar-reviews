  "article": [
    "AMD appears to be convincing more laptop OEMs to include Ryzen processor options, as it looks like Dell\u2019s next Alienware M15 will ship with an AMD Ryzen 5000 CPU.",
    "That\u2019s according to Twitter leaker Rogame, who has uncovered laptop benchmark listings featuring multiple Alienware M15 R5 laptops. Currently, Dell is only selling Alienware M15 and R3 and R4 options, which ship with 10th-generation Intel Core CPU options.",
    "If the leaked benchmarks are anything to go by, the so-called Alienware M15 R5 will offer different Ryzen CPU options. The top-end variant appears to be powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card, while two mother variants will ship with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and either an RTX 3070 or RTX 3060 GPU, respectively.",
    "According to the leak, all three Alienware M15 Ryzen Edition R5 models will come equipped with 16GB RAM, an NVMe SSD and the same 15-inch FHD 144Hz display panel as the current Alienware M15 models.",
    "If anything like Dell\u2019s current Intel-powered Alienware M15 R4 laptops, it\u2019s likely better display options will be on offer, though there\u2019s no word on a 17-inch model.",
    "Dell isn\u2019t the only gaming laptop maker that\u2019s looking to offer AMD Ryzen CPU options, according to rumors. A recent leak suggests the incoming Razer Blade 14 will use an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card.",
    "There\u2019s also talk that the next-generation Dell G15 and HP Omen 15 laptops will also be available with AMD Ryzen 5000 CPUs and Nvidia RTX 3000 graphics.",
