    "We've seen our fair share of Dell XPS 13 deals over the past few days - thanks to Dell's own Presidents' Day sales dropping a few doorbusters here and there, but we think we've just spotted the best ones yet.",
    "In particular, this Core i7 model with a 256GB SSD for $734.99 (was $1,049.99) and this Core i7 model with a 512GB SSD for $783.99 (was $1,149.99) have caught our eye. As you've probably gleaned from the specs so far - these are pretty powerful machines for the money and it's not every day you see an XPS 13 almost break the sub-$700 barrier with such a powerful processor under the hood.",
    "It is, however, worth noting that these XPS 13 deals are for an updated older model and do have a slightly thicker bottom bezel than the newest 2020/2021 chassis version. That said, the newest models simply can't hold a candle to these ones when it comes to outright value as you'd be looking at paying at least an extra $200 just to secure yourself the latest model with an i3 processor.",
    "With a 10th gen Core i7, this XPS is also easily beating out its competition from other brands right now too, such as the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon ($949.99) and the newest Apple MacBook Air M1 ($987.61). Both of these ultrabooks are fine choices with high-end features, excellent build quality, and up-to-date specs but right now they can't compete with the XPS 13 with regards to value. Subsequently, these XPS 13's are looking like a rather solid buy right now for those looking for a slick ultrabook.",
