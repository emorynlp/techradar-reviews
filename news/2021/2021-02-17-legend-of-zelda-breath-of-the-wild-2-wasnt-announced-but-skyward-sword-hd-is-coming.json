    "The February Nintendo Direct didn\u2019t have any news about Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 \u2013 but we did find out that a Wii-era game from the series is coming: Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD is headed to the Nintendo Switch on July 16, and you can preorder it now.",
    "While Twilight Princess was technically the first game in the series to launch on the Wii in 2006 and have motion controls, Skyward Sword followed in 2011 with even more refined and precise gesture inputs using the Wiimote and Nunchuck controllers.",
    "These have been recreated using the Joy-Cons on the Switch (for sword-slashing, shield-blocking, and bow-shooting); in the Switch version\u2019s trailer (below), Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma assured that the controls have been tightened up.",
    "Players can also opt for button-only controls (tilting the right thumbstick will approximate gesture controls), making the game playable for Switch Lite owners...or those who don\u2019t want to deal with motion controls.",
    "As Aonuma pointed out, Skyward Sword was the last mainstream Zelda game to debut on consoles before Breath of the Wild launched with the Switch in early 2017, and several of the game\u2019s signature elements \u2013 like sail gliding, item upgrading, and the stamina gauge \u2013 actually debuted in Skyward Sword.",
    "Alongside the Skyward Sword HD news, Nintendo announced that Zelda would be gracing the Switch in other ways \u2013 physical ways, really, with a new Joy-Con design.",
    "The right Joy-Con has a purple-ish hue modeled after the Master Sword, while the left is a true blue with red accents following the classic Hylian Shield color scheme \u2013 which is fitting, given those map to sword-slashing and shield-blocking gesture controls you'll be making in Skyward Sword HD.",
    "The Zelda Joy-Cons come out July 21 just after Skyward Sword HD and, for now, we'll just keep waiting for Breath of the Wild 2 news."
