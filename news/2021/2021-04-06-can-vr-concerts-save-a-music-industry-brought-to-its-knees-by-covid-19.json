    "Ever wanted to travel to an alien world on a virtual spaceship to see David Guetta\u2019s avatar DJ-ing your own personal concert? Well, now you can, thanks to a new VR experience called Sensorium Galaxy, a multi-user social virtual reality platform where users are transported to virtual alien \u2018worlds\u2019 to watch their favorite DJs in concert.",
    "Available on \u201cthe most popular VR headset brands and PC\u201d, Sensorium Galaxy isn\u2019t just about seeing DJs at the decks \u2013 according to the company, it\u2019s an evolution of social networking, letting users \u201cimmerse themselves in exciting new worlds to get together with their loved ones, meet new people, and take part in unique virtual activities\u201d.",
    "These worlds come with \u201csupernatural features,\u201d as Sasha Tityanko, Sensorium\u2019s deputy CEO (Art & Marketing) explains. One such world, called Prism, is \u201ca remote planet filled with black rock, lakes, and oceans,\u201d where \u201ceverything transforms and evolves, under the influence of music that the artist plays while they\u2019re giving a performance\u201d.",
    "Prism was created alongside Yann Pissenem, CEO and founder of The Night League and one of the leading figures in the Ibiza dance scene \u2013 and it\u2019s in this virtual world that you\u2019ll find Guetta behind the decks.",
    "In a video premiere exclusive to TechRadar, you can see Guetta in action as he\u2019s transformed into a virtual avatar, in what he describes as \u201ca next-level experience\u201d:",
    "So how does it work? Ivan Nikitin, Sensorium\u2019s Head of Product, explains: \u201cIf you're a VR user, you put on the HMD (head-mounted display) and you enter the virtual world. The first location is aboard your personal cabin, which we call starships. It's a general lobby area for users to gather together and meet new people, meet with friends, and from there, to go to all the different worlds.\u201d",
    "Of course, you may not have a host of friends with access to VR headsets, ready to join you in your adventures \u2013 but Sensorium has thought of that.",
    "\u201cYou're immediately greeted by a computer-controlled character, kind of a virtual being, which is driven by a combination of genetic algorithm, and reinforcement learning\u201d, says Nikitin. In other words, these characters learn from their interactions with real users, in theory, becoming smarter as time goes on.",
    "\u201cThey're able to support a natural, flowing conversation with the user, so those virtual beings become your companions in your virtual travels across the Sensorium Galaxy. The way we see the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is that as you keep sharing the experiences and information with those beings, and at some point they will know enough about you to be able to match you with like minded users,\u201d he explains.",
    "It may sound far-fetched, but Sensorium Galaxy has attracted a host of well-known DJs who want to bring their music to the virtual masses \u2013 and it could be the boon that a music industry brought to its knees by Covid-19 needs right now.",
    "Live music is just one of the industries that has suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic over the last year, with festivals, tours, and gigs cancelled across the world.",
    "Just as workplaces have looked to the likes of Zoom and Microsoft Teams to bring face to face meetings online, the music industry is looking at ways it can continue to bring the live music experience to fans from the comfort of their own homes \u2013 and the answer might lie in virtual reality.",
    "The goal isn\u2019t to exactly replicate the experience of a live music concert, as Yann Pissenem tells us. For example, in VR you may be able to fly, dance in between your favorite band members, and even \u201csee the audience from the eyes of the DJ\u201d.",
    "\u201cYou can be dressed as you want, you can be as tall or as big as you want \u2013 and you can act in a different way to how you would normally\u201d, he explains excitedly. \u201cThere are no limitations.\u201d",
    "There are obvious benefits to using virtual reality for live music performances, not least the ability to experience them in a way that would not be possible in real life. Virtual concerts are accessible from anywhere, at any time, so you don\u2019t have to wait years for your favorite artists to tour in your country.",
    "Virtual reality is only now approaching mainstream adoption in a meaningful way. Right now, there are just four main players when it comes to mainstream VR headsets you can use at home, including Oculus, PlayStation, HTC, and Valve \u2013 and these headsets don\u2019t exactly come cheap.",
    "But, VR is a technology that\u2019s on the rise, both in terms of its prominence and its capabilities \u2013 and what was once a sci-fi pipe dream is well on its way to becoming a full-blown cultural phenomenon, and a new way for us to experience art, meet new friends, and play games.",
    "It may not end up being the savior of the live music industry, and we daresay music lovers will be heading back to stadiums, concert halls, pubs, and clubs as soon as restrictions are lifted \u2013 but there\u2019s no doubt that VR experiences like Sensorium Galaxy offer an exciting new perspective for music fans, artists, and the wider industry."
