  "article": [
    "It\u2019s been an interesting period for even the best Apple Watch apps. Not too long ago, it seemed as if the Watch had lost its sparkle, with many big-name apps either languishing or being pulled from the Watch altogether - but as a new era approaches, it seems that things are much more vibrant in the Watch app space.",
    "You see, the problem was one of function - app developers spending too much time wondering 'could we make an Apple Watch app?' and not 'should we...?'",
    "When watchOS 6 landed, it brought an App Store to your Apple Watch for the very first time, thereby encouraging app developers to take the Apple Watch more seriously, and with watchOS 8 and the Apple Watch 7 - not to mention the iPhone 13 range - having since landed, there's never been a better time to join the ecosystem.",
    "Our favorite apps - the list of which is ever-growing - exist because they\u2019re useful, or because they\u2019re entertaining, or because they make your life that little bit better.",
    "In this round-up you\u2019ll find apps for podcasting and procrastinating, for getting fit and getting stuff done, for messing around and for sorting stuff out.",
    "So if you've recently been given a new Apple Watch, or just want to refresh your stock, dive in and start getting the most out of your Apple Watch, and make sure to check this article regularly, as we'll add a new app every couple of weeks, highlighted below.",
    "Outdooractive is designed for hiking, cycling and other outdoor activities, and it now includes features from the popular and recently discontinued ViewRanger app beloved of many climbers and cyclists \u2013 although the takeover hasn\u2019t been greeted with universal joy by the people who\u2019ve been using it for years. ViewRanger is still available, but it won\u2019t be updated anymore.",
    "So what\u2019s on offer here? The Outdooractive app delivers highly detailed topographical vector maps based on OpenStreetMap (subscribers also get Ordnance Survey ones) and enables you to plan and annotate routes, record your travels, and navigate from A to B with visual or audio guidance.",
    "On your wrist it provides zoomable maps, key stats, and a simple but effective navigation interface that\u2019s easy to see in even the most inclement weather. Pro subscribers can use the app in offline mode, can see satellite imagery as well as vector maps, and can access more trail maps from providers throughout the globe.",
    "Although Outdooractive is available as a free app, it\u2019s limited in what it can do if you don\u2019t have a subscription: think of the free version as a taster or trailer for the main event rather than a fully featured app in its own right.",
    "There's no denying that the main thrust of the Apple Watch since the second model is for fitness: it's packing GPS, heart rate, water resistance and improved sensors to make the most of the fact people like to work out with this thing - it even connects to gym equipment.",
    "This list of Apple Watch fitness, running, wellbeing and health apps are nearly all must-have - if you're going to do one thing with your new Watch, use it to become a healthier you in mind and body.",
    "Tempo is popular with runners and walkers thanks to its intelligent analysis and excellent Apple Watch integration: it can get data from any fitness tracking app that logs data to Apple\u2019s Health app, and then provide analysis of your performance. We\u2019re pleased to see that the app also works for wheelchair users.",
    "Earlier this year the app added Personal Bests to show you your fastest times, and in the latest update Tempo has added Goals. Goals enable you to set a distance goal, and that goal can be for a single workout or for multiple ones.",
    "So for example if you\u2019d like to follow the lead of The Proclaimers to walk 500 miles and then walk 500 more, you can set that goal in Tempo and it\u2019ll track your progress even if you use other apps to monitor your walk or run in real time.",
    "The app enables you to tag your workouts in all kinds of ways: you can even see if a particular pair of running shoes have affected your performance. You can also add Tempo calculations to many of your Apple Watch faces so you can see your progress.",
    "Like most fitness tracking apps Tempo is subscription-based, but unlike many there isn\u2019t a confusing range of options: there\u2019s a single subscription plan of $9.99 / \u00a39.49 / AU$15.99 per month.",
    "Here\u2019s an interesting one: the Lumen app is designed to connect to Metaflow\u2019s own health tracker, also called Lumen. It uses your breathing to identify what your body is up to, and it does that by getting you to inhale, hold your breath for ten seconds and then exhale fully. Lumen will then calculate your CO2 and tell you whether you\u2019re mostly burning fat or carbohydrates. You can then use the app to identify the optimal diet, workout and sleep schedule to get the results you want.",
    "The Watch app does three things: it provides information from the Lumen tracker, it enables you to log your carbohydrate intake, and it can set your daily \u2018carbs budget\u2019 if your program requires low carb days.",
    "It\u2019s impressive stuff, but it\u2019s also expensive: the three subscription offers are a three-month \u2018metabolism booster\u2019 for \u00a3199 (around $275/AU$375), a six-month \u2018advanced fat burn\u2019 for \u00a3249 (roughly $340/AU$470), and a twelve-month \u2018optimal health\u2019 for \u00a3299 (approximately $410/AU$565), but those prices also include the Lumen device itself.",
    "After the three, six or twelve-month period expires, all three plans move to a \u00a319 (roughly $25/AU$35) per month subscription. There\u2019s a 30-day risk-free trial, though, so if you decide Lumen isn\u2019t for you then you can return the sensor and get your money back.",
    "How fast is your arm? If you play ball or racket sports, if you\u2019re a golfer, a frisbee fan or a hockey player, Arm Speed Analyzer can tell you how fast you can move and how quickly you accelerate. That means you can use it for golf swings and tennis serves, baseball or cricket pitching, frisbee throwing, hockey stick swinging, or anything else that involves speedy throwing, swinging, sweeping or hitting.",
    "Arm Speed Analyzer claims to be the most accurate speed tracking app that uses your Apple Watch\u2019s accelerometer to track speed and acceleration.",
    "Using the app is fast and simple. It shows you four key pieces of information: your real time speed and acceleration, your most recent speed and acceleration, your personal best top speed and your previous session\u2019s top speed. The app also records your history so you can go back and see how much you\u2019ve improved over time and how consistent your speeds have become.",
    "Although the app is called Arm Speed Analyzer, it can also analyse your kicks \u2013 although we wouldn\u2019t recommend doing it publicly in case someone thinks the Apple Watch strapped to your ankle is an electronic tag for offenders.",
    "If lockdown has got you thinking about fitness, Couch to 5K is a great way to get into shape \u2013 and if you\u2019re thinking about Couch to 5K, then Watch to 5K is a great way of tracking it. The app is designed for absolute beginners who want to work towards running a 5K over a period of 9 weeks, and it creates a training plan of three runs per week for nine weeks.",
    "The schedule will be different for every week, and if you complete all nine weeks you should be able to achieve 5K in under 30 minutes.",
    "The app can work on its own, which is one of the reasons its creator made it: he was fed up with 5K training apps that needed you to lug your iPhone along for the run. So he wrote one that didn\u2019t. It provides key metrics such as your distance traveled, your average pace, your calories burnt, and your heart rate, and all the details of your workouts are stored in Apple\u2019s Health app.",
    "As you\u2019d expect your runs are tracked and count towards your goals in the Fitness app, and you can record your route to review it later. We like this app a lot: it\u2019s a simple, useful, and effective app from an independent developer who spotted a problem and wrote an app to solve it.",
    "Time to Walk is a new and really rather inspired idea for Apple Fitness Plus subscribers: it enables you to go for a long walk while listening to a notable figure tell their story. As Apple puts it:",
    "\u201cEach Time to Walk episode is shaped by the guest\u2019s personal, life-shaping moments and includes lessons learned, meaningful memories, thoughts on purpose and gratitude, moments of levity, and other thought-provoking topics, recorded while walking outside or in locations that are meaningful to them. The narrative comes to life through photos that appear on Apple Watch, perfectly timed to amplify a corresponding moment the guest shares.\u201d",
    "If you\u2019re a wheelchair user, Time to Walk will become Time to Push and will automatically start an Outdoor Wheelchair Walk Pace workout.",
    "There are four guests at the time of writing: the legendary Dolly Parton, NBA star Draymond Green, musician Shawn Mendes and Orange Is The New Black star Uzo Aduba.",
    "There will be new episodes every Monday until the end of April 2021, and they will be downloaded automatically if you have a Fitness Plus subscription, appearing automatically in the Workout tab on your Apple Watch Fitness app. Each episode will be 25 to 40 minutes long and will come with a music playlist to keep you walking or pushing afterwards.",
    "Apple\u2019s long-promised move into premium fitness apps launched in December 2020. Apple Fitness Plus is a subscription service rather than just an app, but it has been designed with the Apple Watch in mind: it uses the Watch sensors to track your workouts and to respond to what\u2019s happening on screen on your iPhone.",
    "For example, if your trainer says to check your heart rate, your Apple Watch will display that data; in tough workouts it\u2019ll display a countdown timer to help your motivation, and the optional Burn Bar tells you how your performance compares to other people who\u2019ve completed the same workout that you\u2019re doing.",
    "Subscriptions cost $9.99 / \u00a39.99 / AU$14.99 per month and are also available as part of Apple One bundles. You can share your subscription with up to six family members without having to take out an Apple One Family or Premier plan.",
    "To use Apple Fitness Plus on your Apple Watch you\u2019ll need watchOS 7.2 or later. There\u2019s no new app to install: fitness appears as a new tab in the Fitness app on your iPhone, and your Watch will respond automatically based on the workouts and/or training you select in the iPhone app. The app is also available for iPad and Apple TV.",
    "Most of the Apple Watch apps in the health and fitness category are trackers of some kind: step trackers, calorie trackers, cycle trackers and so on. Moodistory is a tracker too, but it\u2019s interested in your mental state rather than your physical performance.",
    "The newly added Apple Watch companion app means it\u2019s one of the fastest ways to record your mood and give it context, and it\u2019s designed for sheer speed of entry: if you want to leave detailed notes that\u2019s best left to the iPhone app. On your Watch you just tap and go.",
    "Mood tracking can be very useful for people whose mental state has its ups and downs, or for people who want to get an understanding of the patterns that may shape their moods.",
    "By recording how you feel over a period of time you can begin to see if there are particular trends, and if you\u2019re also including contextual information that information can help you identify any triggers that might bring you down or lift you up. You can even collate the information and output it in PDF form from the iPhone app, which may be useful if you\u2019d like to share your mood history with a counsellor or other qualified professional.",
    "We featured version 7 of Heart Analyzer back in 2019 and liked it a lot. Version 8 is new for 2020 and it\u2019s a very big update \u2013 especially on iPhone, where it has a brand new and very nice user interface.",
    "Unfortunately the Apple Watch\u2019s display is rather limited compared to the phone, but while the Watch component isn\u2019t quite as pretty as the new iPhone app, it\u2019s still very effective and makes good use of the available space.",
    "On your wrist, Heart Analyzer v8 comes with improved, customizable complications for the Infograph faces so that you can have your heart rate chart right there in front of you. The Watch app offers live heart rate monitoring and trend charts, weekly metrics and workout views, and it can also record calories burned and distance traveled. As you\u2019d expect, it integrates well with Apple Health.",
    "Things are even more impressive on iPhone, where you can view personalized metrics such as day/night resting heart rates, average heart rates, and historical data going back years. The new interface makes everything much clearer and achieves the tricky balance of giving you lots and lots of data without being overwhelming.",
    "Don\u2019t let the name fool you: although it\u2019s named after a bike race term and is primarily designed to accompany the famously expensive exercise bike, Peloton isn\u2019t just about cycling. It\u2019s a fitness helper for running, yoga and high intensity training too, and it can also help you with meditation through its guided learning sessions.",
    "The Peloton app offers a useful combination of streaming video classes, progress tracking, and music playback to keep you motivated. The latest app introduces a particularly cool feature: you can now use Chromecast to send the video from iPhone or iPad to compatible TVs for that big-screen experience, and you can pre-load the video to make sure you don\u2019t encounter any buffering during a workout.",
    "The Watch component has much less screen space to work with, but it does a lot with what it\u2019s got. It displays pace and distance metrics for runs, heart rate tracking for all kinds of exercises, and all the stats you could want. It also integrates with Apple\u2019s Health app to keep your vital statistics up to date. The app doesn\u2019t just connect to your Apple Watch: if you have Bluetooth-enabled monitors you prefer, you can connect them too.",
    "Strava needs no introduction for serious fitness fans: it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s top fitness apps for runners, cyclists and swimmers, as well as gym-goers, kayakers and yoga practitioners. The latest version brings proper support for the Apple Watch, enabling you to sync workouts and activities you\u2019ve recorded with Apple\u2019s Workout app with the Strava app and its online tracking, to build a better overall picture of your fitness activities.",
    "Strava is on a constant update cycle, so just days after the Apple Watch sync was introduced there was another update with improved stroke analysis for swimmers and better cadence analysis for runners; two weeks previously there were new features for skiers and for activity sharing, as well as a bunch of interactive 3D maps.",
    "The big selling point of Strava is its social aspect, which elevates it above other GPS-enabled fitness apps: you can compare your performance not just with yourself but with other users, you can compete to become the king or queen of particular geographical leaderboards, and you can share with friends and followers to get encouraging words and helpful feedback.",
    "The best bits are in the Premium subscription, which is fairly cheap by fitness-app standards: it\u2019s currently $5.99/\u00a35.99/AU$9.99 a month or $59.99/\u00a344.99/AU$89.99 a year.",
    "Hole19 claims to be the most-used golf GPS range finder in the UK, with more than 10 million rounds registered, and it claims to be as accurate as a real caddie \u2013 although it doesn\u2019t specify which one.",
    "As is usually the case with sports apps the bulk of the work is done by the iPhone app, with the Apple Watch companion providing just the essential features and information you need while you\u2019re on the green.",
    "The main app offers two key tools: GPS range finding so you can see how far you are from your goal as well as any hazards, and a digital scorecard that you can use to track your stats over time.",
    "On your watch, it shows you the distance to the front, center and back of the green; swipe and there\u2019s an input screen where you can track your performance. It\u2019s all very simple and straightforward, enabling you to track your playing without distracting you for too long.",
    "The usefulness of the app depends mainly on whether it knows about the course(s) you want to play. Hole19 knows over 42,000 courses in 201 countries, so yours should be covered, but the app\u2019s free to try so you can make sure it\u2019s right for you before signing up for a subscription.",
    "What can you do in seven minutes? You could listen to one and a half pop songs. You could watch one-tenth of an episode of Game of Thrones. Or you could change your life. That\u2019s what Seven promises. It\u2019s an app based on the idea that anybody can get much fitter if they can spare just seven minutes a day. No gym memberships, no equipment, just you and your Apple Watch.",
    "We\u2019d recommend starting with the phone, though: it shows you how to do each exercise properly, something the Apple Watch\u2019s screen isn\u2019t big enough for. There\u2019s no point knocking yourself out for your seven minute stretch if you\u2019re doing it wrong and causing more harm than good. Once you know what you need to do though you can rely on your Watch to time your exercises and breaks and to record your activity.",
    "The app is easy to use, packed with useful exercises and provides good visual feedback and motivation. You can compete with your friends or just earn in-app achievements, and if you sign up for the $9.99/\u00a39.99/AU$14.99 monthly subscription you get access to over 200 exercises to keep your regime interesting. By enabling you to exercise anytime, anywhere, Seven might just help you get the exercise habit.",
    "Built for serious tennis players under the guidance of Andy Roddick and James Blake, Swing Tennis Tracker is designed to analyze your swings as well as record your stats. It isn\u2019t just a solo app: it can also sync scores with other Apple Watch users on the court. There\u2019s excellent Siri integration for starting matches and practice, integration with the Activity and Health apps, and excellent visual feedback to show you how hard you\u2019re hitting.",
    "The Watch component concentrates on the recording and feedback, while the phone app takes care of scores, stats and video, as well as providing action advice after each hit. It\u2019s a great app for individual players but it can also be used by parents, coaches and in teams, to track others\u2019 performance too.",
    "There are two subscription plans, the $4.99/\u00a34.49/AU$7.99 per month Premium and the $9.99/\u00a39.49/AU$15.49 Pro. The former unlocks historical statistic graphics, head-to-head records against non-Swing users and unlimited analysis graphs for each session, while the Pro subscription adds video lessons from tennis pros and intelligent analysis of your performance that identifies key areas for improvement after each session.",
    "The ongoing love-fest between Nike and Apple continues to bear fruit: the latest iteration of the Nike Run Club app introduces some welcome improvements.",
    "It now integrates with Siri Suggestions, which means the app can now suggest good times for a run based on your previous runs (the feature is off by default so it won\u2019t nag you if you don\u2019t want it to), and there are new Apple Watch complications including one for the Infograph face that shows how far you\u2019ve run this month.",
    "There\u2019s hardly a shortage of running apps in the App Store but Nike\u2019s budget is a bit higher than most, so the app feels a lot more premium than many others. It tracks and stores all your runs thanks to your Watch\u2019s built-in GPS, enables you to listen to audio guides as you run, offers a range of challenges to keep you motivated and has good social sharing features, so you can turn your friends into cheerleaders.",
    "It\u2019s very well designed and the Watch app doesn\u2019t sacrifice substance for style: while visually it\u2019s very attractive it also shows all the information you actually need as you\u2019re pounding the pavements. It\u2019s a really good running app.",
    "Nike and Apple are best friends forever, so it\u2019s not a huge surprise to see Nike unveil another Watch app. This one\u2019s really good, too. Describing itself as \u201cyour ultimate personal trainer\u201d, Nike Training Club has more than 180 workouts covering strength, endurance, mobility and yoga, and they\u2019re all free. There are daily personalized picks based on your previous activity, flexible training plans to help you achieve your fitness goals, and tips from top trainers.",
    "The app splits jobs between phone and Watch. The former is where you do the planning and tracking; the latter is what you wear while you\u2019re actually working out. By necessity as well as design that means focusing only on the information you really need right now, such as your heart rate and how many reps you still have to do before you can undo all your efforts with some cake and beer.",
    "The app is by no means unique in its combination of Watch and workout tracking, although it does have Nike\u2019s immediately recognizable and individual visual style. But what\u2019s significant about this app is that none of its many workouts are hidden behind in-app purchases or pricey subscriptions. Everything in the app is free.",
    "If you\u2019ve ever felt that life is just that bit too busy or stressful, Headspace could help. It\u2019s based around mindfulness, which is all about getting you to feel calmer without too much effort. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite of effort: mindfulness is about taking a break from the rush.",
    "The Apple Watch app is part of a wider offering for iPhone and iPad: it acts as a reminder and a coach, urging you to pick an exercise and focus on it for the allotted time. It also has an SOS mode for when things feel too much and you need help instantly. But it\u2019s the main app that does most of the work, with daily mindfulness exercises and sessions designed to help with everything from workplace stress to sleep problems.",
    "It\u2019s very well done but one thing that might raise your stress levels is the cost: while the app is free to try it really needs a subscription to unlock its most useful features, and that subscription is $12.99/\u00a39.99/AU$19.99 per month or $94.99/\u00a374.99/AU$149.99 per year. That\u2019s an auto-renewing subscription too, so you need to disable that in iTunes if you don\u2019t want it to recur automatically.",
    "Medical apps don\u2019t just exist to persuade you that your mild headache is terminal brain cancer. They can help keep you healthy too. While WebMD does indeed let you compare your symptoms with various illnesses and conditions to scare yourself silly, that\u2019s not the most interesting thing about it or its Watch companion app.",
    "WebMD enables you to detail your medication schedules, with dosage information and the option to be reminded of what you need to take and when you need to take it. This can be in the form of a notification, or you can have it as a Watch face Complication so it\u2019s right there in the middle of the display.",
    "It can also remind you of any prerequisites, such as whether you need to take your medicine with food or on an empty stomach. It\u2019s the sort of simple but very useful thing the Apple Watch does well.",
    "Over on the main iPhone app there\u2019s plenty more to discover. You can read up on the side effects and precautions of specific pills or patches, find out if you need to go hiding from the flu or just catch up on the latest health and wellbeing news from various credible sources.",
    "If your idea of good exercise involves going far from the madding crowds, you\u2019ll like WorkOutDoors. It\u2019s a workout app that\u2019s based around vector maps that you can easily rotate and zoom, tracking your location and your progress.",
    "It uses the Watch\u2019s GPS (if you have a GPS-enabled Watch) so there\u2019s no need to take your phone on a hike, cycle or snowboard run, and features such as breadcrumb tracking, custom points of interest and customizable stats displays enable you to make the app truly your own.",
    "In a nice touch you can export your workouts from the iPhone app in GPX format, which can be imported into many other workout apps and sites.",
    "It\u2019s very, very well thought out. For example, something as simple as the stats display is available in a variety of sizes to suit different kinds of activity (not to mention different levels of eyesight).",
    "It makes good use of color-coding to make routes crystal clear, waypoints can provide extra information such as directions, and the map automatically rotates as you move so you\u2019re always sure of the right direction. It\u2019s a brilliant app for pretty much any outdoor activity.",
    "The trick to living better isn\u2019t to damn near kill yourself on a treadmill and then give up after a few weeks. It\u2019s to make smaller, lasting changes to your life, changes that you can and will actually stick to. And that\u2019s what Streaks offers.",
    "Whether you\u2019re trying to eat more healthily, exercise more or break a smoking habit, Streaks enables you to track positive and negative habits. It offers a range of reporting tools so you can see exactly how well you\u2019re doing, and you can track up to 12 different tasks at once.",
    "They needn\u2019t be exercise or eating tasks: you can remind yourself to walk the dog, study, take vitamins or practice a musical instrument. It\u2019s good to see wheelchair users included in the default tasks list too.",
    "Where Streaks really shines is in its integration with the Health app, which enables it to pull data to use for monitoring suitable targets you\u2019ve set. That reduces a lot of the form-filling of similar apps, and it\u2019s particularly effective if you\u2019re trying to work on good healthy habits or eliminate unhealthy ones, or both.",
    "There\u2019s a Complication too, so that you don\u2019t forget your goals, and the whole thing is customizable so that you can get it just-so.",
    "Information is power and if you're trying to lose weight, calorie tracking is a good way to stay focused. MyFitnessPal works out a daily calorie allowance based on how much weight you want to shed. Eat a meal and your allowance is spent, take exercise and you earn credit.",
    "The Watch gives you a running total of remaining calories and how that breaks down into protein, carbohydrates and more. It can integrate with your steps total so you don't have to add those manually. It's simple but convenient and helpful.",
    "If walking's your thing, Walkmeter helps track your every step, showing your perambulations on a map and generating detailed graphs. The Watch app has clear data reporting and you can start and stop a walk from your wrist using the Watch's Force Touch actions.",
    "Apple's own Workout app does a lot, but this app has more detail and the mapping detail on the iPhone is great. The app is free but for full Watch performance you need to upgrade to the Elite version for $9.99/\u00a39.99/AU$14.99. There's a lot here, including training plans and announcements as you hit targets or distances.",
    "You may know CARROT from its weather app, which combines Dark Sky-style weather forecasting with sarcasm and lies. But CARROT wants to make you unhappy in many other ways - and what\u2019s better for a sadistic AI than being in control of a fitness app?",
    "Enter CARROT Fit, which takes a somewhat unusual approach to motivating you to get healthier and lose weight.",
    "CARROT promises to \u201cget you fit - or else\u201d. To achieve that it offers a dozen punishing exercises (more are available via in-app purchases) accompanied by threats, ridicule, bribes and the occasional compliment.",
    "It\u2019s rude, crude and much more entertaining than trying to complete the rings on Apple\u2019s own activity tracker, and we\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s the only fitness app that rewards progress with cat facts. But there\u2019s a proper fitness tracker in here too: it\u2019ll track your steps and weight loss, remember your workouts and add data to Apple\u2019s health app.",
    "Most of the personality is in the main iPhone app, but the Watch alerts include such cheery prospects as \u201cseven minutes in hell\u201d. If you find getting fit or losing weight a little bit tedious, CARROT might be the, ahem, carrot that you need to get motivated.",
    "If your Watch strap is feeling a little more snug than it used to, this app may be the answer: it\u2019s designed to help you achieve your weight loss goals \u201cwithout the unsustainable gimmicks, fad diets, restrictive foods, on-site meetings, or large price tags of other weight-loss companies.\u201d",
    "It tracks the calories you\u2019ve consumed and the goals you\u2019ve set, focuses on nutrition as well as overall calorie intake, works happily with other fitness apps and trackers and provides an online peer group where everybody encourages each other to achieve their ideal weight.",
    "It also enables you to set exercise goals and focus on general wellness, so it\u2019s not just about losing weight.",
    "The Apple Watch app doesn\u2019t replace the phone app completely - for example, you\u2019ll need your phone handy if you want to use the barcode scanner to automatically record what you\u2019re eating, and the team-based features such as group challenges are phone-based - but it\u2019s a great way to focus on your goals, monitor your progress and keep your motivation no matter how sorely tempted you may be.",
    "The program is $39.99/\u00a329.99/AU$62.99 per year but you can explore the app for free without signing up.",
    "Fitness fanatics look away now: for those that find exercise really boring, and their get up and go often gets up and goes while they stay sedentary. Mount Burnmore could be the answer to that lethargy: it turns fitness into a game.",
    "The concept is quite clever. Mount Burnmore depends on \u201cactive energy\u201d, which it pulls from the Health app: the more calories you\u2019ve burned, the more active energy you have in the game.",
    "When you have sufficient energy you can attempt to solve the game\u2019s puzzles, which involve finding routes around the titular mountain, collecting in-game items and smashing things with a pickaxe.",
    "There\u2019s a Complication that enables you to see your progress without launching the full game, and the app makes good use of the Digital Crown to help you navigate around larger levels later in the game. There are also leaderboards to compare with other players and in-game challenges to win freebies.",
    "It\u2019s bright, breezy and a bit brash, and we suspect it\u2019s best suited to older children rather than grown-ups - although if you do give this one to the kids you might want to disable in-app purchases, as they can be used to buy in-game items.",
    "Mindfulness, the art of focusing on being present and aware in the world instead of being constantly distracted by things and thoughts that don\u2019t matter, isn\u2019t something you\u2019d associate with the Apple Watch. If you aren\u2019t careful with your notification settings your Watch pings away merrily all day, interrupting countless trains of thought.",
    "But the Happier app hopes to use the Watch to make you feel better, not more harassed.",
    "The app itself is free, but it\u2019s designed as a gateway to paid-for mindfulness courses. If you don\u2019t go for them you can still take advantage of the app, though. You can tell the app how you\u2019re feeling - we suspect \u201cmeh\u201d is the most-used option - and it then responds with uplifting quotes to help you feel a bit more optimistic.",
    "It can pop up to remind you to take a meditation break, and you can dictate a positive thought to a private journal or to the Happier community. That\u2019s not as daft as it sounds: there\u2019s some evidence that keeping a journal of positive things can boost your mood over time.",
    "Just be careful what and how you share: one iTunes reviewer says that they were able to locate their private journal with Google."
