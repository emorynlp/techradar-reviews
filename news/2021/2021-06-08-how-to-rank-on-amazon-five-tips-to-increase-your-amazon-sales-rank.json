    "Whether you want to earn some side cash, replace your income, or get rid of some old books, selling on Amazon is a great way to make money online. With Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Amazon makes it simple to launch and scale an ecommerce business.",
    "New and even experienced Amazon sellers often ask, \u201cHow do I get my products to rank higher in the search results?\u201d It\u2019s a crucial question with a multi-pronged answer.",
    "First, it\u2019s important to understand what we mean by \u201crank\u201d. As an Amazon seller, rank can refer to either your Best Sellers Rank (BSR) or your organic keyword rank. The BSR is your overall product ranking in your main product category; organic rank refers to the position in which your product appears in the results for a particular keyword search, and is a function of keyword relevance and sales velocity.",
    "We\u2019ll focus on strategies for achieving a higher organic ranking, as it makes your product more likely to convert into sales and is a key driver of profitability.",
    "Amazon\u2019s search algorithm (known as A9) arranges products on search results pages according to their organic rank. Amazon wants to present shoppers with products they\u2019re most likely to buy, so the more relevant your listing\u2019s keywords are to a given customer\u2019s search query, the better its chances of showing up on the first page of search results. Higher-ranked products appear at the top of the page, followed by lower-ranked products moving down the page.",
    "It\u2019s easier to conceptualize organic rank if we consider the absence of those determining factors. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re selling a mesh trucker hat but somehow forget to include the keywords \u201cmesh\u201d or \u201ctrucker\u201d anywhere in your listing. Your hat won\u2019t show up for \u201cmesh trucker hat\u201d searches, because there\u2019s nothing in your listing telling Amazon that it\u2019s relevant. And because it doesn\u2019t show up in searches, your sales velocity probably isn\u2019t that great.",
    "In order to rank higher for relevant keywords, you need an optimized listing, plus a strong conversion rate. Fortunately, there are simple strategies you can follow to help increase your rank.",
    "Optimize your listing title Your listing title is one of the most important pieces of an effective Amazon listing. It should entice both customers and A9 with clues about your product\u2019s relevance.",
    "When writing your title, place your most important keywords at the beginning, so customers immediately know what you\u2019re selling. Front-loading your title keywords is also vital because Amazon truncates long titles in certain categories.",
    "After you pull customers in with your great title, the rest of your listing needs to sell them on your product.",
    "Strategically price your product Pricing is competitive on Amazon. If you\u2019re priced too high, customers may opt for the more affordable choice; priced too low and you could spark a \u201cprice war\u201d that devalues your niche.",
    "So, how do you choose the perfect price for your products?",
    "Optimize your images for conversions While they don\u2019t directly influence A9, high-quality images and infographics in your listing will help improve your conversion rate by enticing customers \u2014 which in turn boosts your sales rank.",
    "You should use the maximum number of allowed images (in most cases, seven) on your listing to give customers as much information as possible about your product.",
    "The main image must have a pure white background, but the others can feature eye-catching elements like interesting lifestyle settings, informative text, and logos. Use infographics and size comparisons or charts to provide important information that helps customers convert.",
    "Create compelling listing copy Between your listing\u2019s bullet points and description section, you get ample room to describe your product to potential customers. Use these spaces to sell your product in a compelling yet informative way \u2014 skip the fluff.",
    "On your product detail page, Amazon displays the product\u2019s title, images, price, and bullet points \u201cabove the fold.\u201d That is, those are the listing elements a buyer can see before scrolling down.",
    "You should pack this section full of concise but detailed information, and fit in any relevant keywords that you didn\u2019t use in your title. If your customers can find what they\u2019re looking for without doing much on-page digging, they\u2019re more likely to convert.",
    "Your \u201cbelow the fold\u201d copy, including your description or A+ content (if you\u2019re brand registered), is where you can add additional information about your product and tell your brand story.",
    "Keep in mind that on mobile, your description or A+ content shows up before the bullet points. Two in three consumers shop on mobile devices in 2021, so don\u2019t skimp on this section.",
    "Drive paid traffic One of the most effective ways to increase your rank on Amazon is by advertising your listing, either through Amazon pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns or by driving external traffic to Amazon via Facebook and Google ads.",
    "Amazon PPC ads allow you to target keywords, categories, and even competitors\u2019 products. They\u2019re especially helpful when you need to generate visibility for a newly launched product. An optimized listing should have no problem converting traffic generated by your advertising campaigns.",
    "You should regularly analyze your ads\u2019 performance and make changes to increase your return on ad spend. As your campaigns convert into sales, you\u2019ll see your sales rank improve.",
    "The key to ranking well on Amazon comes down to relevance, conversion, and sales volume. With a fully optimized listing and a competitive price, you\u2019ll be on track toward a higher rank."
