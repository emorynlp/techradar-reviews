    "Cool cool cool cool, we're not emotional at all. Already two episodes into the final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine ever, a barrel of laughs have already been had, and there are another two new episodes this week with the whole gang. Here's how to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8, episode 3 and 4 online where you are.",
    "Used to the sex tape title jokes and Terry talking about himself in the third person, it's fair to say Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8 has kicked off with a slightly more somber tone.",
    "Always raring to contextualize itself within the current times, the 99th Precinct sees drastic changes due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. With a beautifully diverse cast, too, it feels right that we should see the effect of the George Floyd protests and the pre-existing issue of police brutality in the US. That's on top of all the other new changes our favorite cast finds themselves adjusting to as Jake and Amy become parents, and Holt aspires to become commissioner.",
    "Delivering two new episodes a week, episodes three and four of season 8, the former titled 'Blue Flu' looks to portray the difficulties of staffing issues in the wake of the virus as Holt and Amy attempt to manage the understaffed precinct.",
    "In episode 4, it appears to be another kind of balancing act - aptly named 'Balancing' - as Jake and Amy attempt to organize childcare around their work in the force.",
    "Buckle in for another two installments of the eighth and final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and keep reading for everything you need to know about how to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8, episode 3 and 4 online where you are.",
    "Happen to be out of the country when this final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine airs? No problem. While you'll find the content is geo-blocked when you try and tune in, you can still catch all of the action via a VPN.",
    "A VPN allows you to watch your favorite show from anywhere in the world. It does this by changing your IP address to one in the country you live in normally. Here's everything you need to know to get started:",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location, i.e., US for Hulu, or Australia for SBS' free stream",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Australia, just head to SBS On Demand"
