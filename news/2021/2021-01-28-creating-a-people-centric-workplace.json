  "article": [
    "The light is appearing at the end of the long, dark tunnel that was 2020. With vaccination schemes now underway, we can (albeit cautiously) dare to dream of a general return to relative normality. Yet in the wake of the pandemic, neither our personal lives nor our work lives will ever be quite the same.",
    "A wholesale change to working practices, and the nature of how and where we work, is set to be one of the big lasting legacies of 2020. Cal Henderson, co-founder of Slack, recently came forward to say he thinks that the age of the office is coming to an end. In a less extreme view, AWS\u2019 CEO Andy Jassy predicts we\u2019ll see the rise of \u2018hot offices\u2019, where employees will mostly work remotely, only coming into the office when they need to work on specific projects. And Microsoft founder Bill Gates predicts the age of business travel is over, with only 50% of business trips set to resume.",
    "As the office evolves it\u2019s clear employers will have to adapt their spaces in line with new, post-pandemic wellbeing and workplace trends, and create an office centered around \u201csuper experiences\u201d that makes it a destination in itself.",
    "So, in what ways will working practices change, and how do we see the physical workspace evolving?",
    "Ultimately, the pandemic has re-focused the discussion on how employees can best work, and how teams are spending their time. It has also given employers the opportunity to ensure they\u2019re in a better position to help people find a good work life balance.",
    "Yet even after Coronavirus, it\u2019s clear we won\u2019t be working from home forever. The UK government says work from home orders may stay in place until April 2021 and with this in mind a flexible, and hybrid, way of working is set to stay. Employees feel that way too \u2013 a recent Simply Communicate survey found only 2% want to go back to the full week in the office.",
    "With the digital tools available and the experience gained over the past 10 months, the idea of everyone being in the office everyday seems old fashioned and unnecessary. People don\u2019t want to travel into an office to then just be sat at their desk for eight hours. What they want is to connect with colleagues, to learn, to be inspired and to share with others.",
    "Whilst getting your head down to work is important, social time and collaboration is equally valued, and central to general wellbeing. For many employees, their work is central to their sense of self, their meaning and purpose, and after a long period of being at home alone, they\u2019ll be yearning for those in-person, face-to-face experiences. This should be placed at the forefront of modern office culture and design.",
    "Offices will become destinations unto themselves - for collaboration, innovation and strengthening team relationships - and less about desk-based or task-based work. The space should also be vibrant and different. These offices should offer a mixture of meeting rooms and open operational space, which will promote gathering for teamwork, collaboration and company-wide networking events. At the same time, smaller collaborative working areas, enabled by video, will facilitate break away group work for those both physically present and working remotely. Banks of individual cubicles will disappear, and instead we\u2019ll see occasional, dedicated concentration pods for when employees need to get their heads down between meetings. And how about relaxation pods should employees want a quick break and recharge?",
    "Beyond work, offices also need to become social destinations in themselves. A recent JLL study found that nearly half of employees hope their office will prioritize social spaces, such as coffee areas, lounges or outdoor terraces and gardens. Common areas play a central role in nurturing informal work relationships, which improve development opportunities and help career outlook - especially crucial for people early in their work life. These spaces allow employees to maintain the inspiration, energy and social connection that comes with belonging to a physical team and environment \u2013 something which many found a real challenge to maintain virtually during the pandemic.",
    "Flexible schedules and shared spaces will also lead to a \u201crightsizing\u201d of office space, where organizations will rethink their real estate, in what will undoubtedly save costs. Some are even predicting that we\u2019ll see the creation of an office \u2018ecosystem\u2019, which will comprise of employees working from offices, houses, and third places such as cafes, co-working spaces, and libraries.",
    "While all of the above will support flexibility, functionality and employee wellbeing, for it to all work it needs high-end peripherals and collaboration software to pull it together. This tech needs to help us and not take us away from people, helping our collective mental health in environments that could be potentially isolating. This human centered approach to work collaboration requires non-intrusive, seamless video conferencing and productivity tools. Through each space in the office, from large town hall style areas, through to smaller huddle rooms, personal workspaces and even satellite offices in the suburbs, these video solutions and smart productivity technologies can help to bring together a team as one.",
    "Fortunately, there are a wide variety of high-quality video tools available that can fit the needs of the modern worker within each individual environment. From large 4K cameras with the ability to pan, tilt and zoom to focus on an individual speaking within a large room, to wide angled huddle room cameras for smaller groups, and webcams with integrated high-quality microphones and optics to make sure remote workers are seen and heard just as clearly as if they were physically in the office.",
    "The hybrid office presents itself with an opportunity to make work better for employees, while creating a more committed and motivated workforce. There\u2019s also potential to save money through reduced office related overheads.",
    "Tied together by smart technologies such as video, this hybrid office has the potential to make employees happier, more motivated and equipped to do their best work. Video will pivot from being the technology we used to survive during the pandemic to the one we use to thrive."
