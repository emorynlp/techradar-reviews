  "article": [
    "From the talented creator of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda brings you his Tony award-winning musical, In the Heights to your screen, in the bringing together of lovers, dreamers, and music from a Dominican community in a New York neighbourhood called Washington Heights. Here's how to watch In the Heights with a HBO Max subscription, and further details of its release across the globe.",
    "In the Heights tells the story of bodega owner Usnavi de la Vega, and the close-knit community of the largely Dominican neighborhood called Washington Heights. Despite the hardships of daily life, each find love, hope, and friendship in each other, and work hard to turn their suenos (\u201clittle dreams\u201d) into reality.",
    "There\u2019s a wonderful cast of characters here. Anthony Ramos (who may be familiar to viewers from the filmed version of Hamilton) is the wide-eyed grocery store owner Usnavi, who yearns for both the Dominican Republic and the stunningly beautiful Vanessa (Vida\u2019s Malissa Barrera). His upbeat best friend Benny (Corey Hawkins, The Walking Dead) works at Rosario\u2019s cab company, and harbors romantic feelings for the owner\u2019s daughter Nina (singer Leslie Grace). She\u2019s smart and determined, but, after struggling to pay her way through college, has returned crestfallen to the Heights.",
    "Also starring Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) and award-winning actor Jimmy Smits (NYPD Blue), In the Heights is a visually spectacular celebration of community that critics are calling the film event of the summer. And, if you\u2019re a fan of La La Land and West Side Story, you\u2019ll want to check out the below guide for how to watch In the Heights online, streaming on HBO Max until July 11.",
    "This all-singing, all-dancing, emotion-packed spectacular will be rolled out to cinemas across the world \u2013 where it\u2019s been deemed safe to do so, anyway. In Canada, In the Heights will be available in theaters on June 11, the same day as it\u2019s released in the US. It reaches UK audiences a week later on June 18, and lands in Australia shortly after on June 24.",
    "At the moment, there\u2019s no confirmation whether In the Heights has been procured by any of the major VOD platforms in these territories. However, many of the 2021 Warner Brothers films released on HBO Max \u2013 like The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It \u2013 have been made available internationally to rent as PVOD (premium video on demand) titles, on services like Amazon Prime Video, Apple iTunes, and Google Play Store. While we don\u2019t know for certain yet, it\u2019ll be worth checking these websites to see if that holds true for In the Heights."
