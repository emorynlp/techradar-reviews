    "The 2021 European Championship has undoubtedly been a fantastic feast of football...one year after it was supposed to originally take place. And either one of England or Italy would be more than worthy winners.",
    "Both have impressed, but neither have had an easy journey getting here. The Three Lions had to go through extra-time against a determined Danish side in the semi-final.

    "This is because of geo-blocking, which restricts certain services and content to specific parts of the world. However, you can get around geo-blocks by using a VPN, or Virtual Private Network. It's completely legal, very affordable and easy to use - and it also encrypts your browsing, offering protection against cybercriminals and government snooping.",

    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",

    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just choose between and head to BBC iPlayer or ITV Hub"
