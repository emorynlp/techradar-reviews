    "Popular 90s teen sitcom Saved By The Bell is the latest classic TV show to receive a 2020 reboot - and it's out now on NBC streaming service Peacock. Follow our guide as we explain how to watch the Saved By The Bell reboot online and stream Peacock's 2020 version of the show from anywhere in the world today.",
    "Fans of the original aren't likely to be disappointed, with old favorites Zack, Slater, Kelly, and Jessie all back as adults, joining a host of new cast members that make up the Bayside High of the 21st century.",
    "Those new cast members include John Michael Higgins as Bayside\u2019s new boss-in-chief, Principal Toddman, while Haskiri Velazquez, Mitchell Hoog, Josie Totah, Alycia Pascual-Pena, Belmont Cameli and Dexter Darden star as the new crop of students.",
    "From the old school, Mario Lopez reprises his role as lovable meathead AC Slater, now Bayside's (what else) gym teacher. While Elizabeth Berkley's Jessie Spano is now a parent - mother of the captain of Bayside's football team - and the school counsellor.",
    "They're understood to have the largest roles of the original gang, but Tiffani Thiessen is also back as Kelly Kapowski and it just wouldn't be Saved by the Bell without Zack - Mark Paul Gosselaar's character coming back as the Governor of California, no less! Still married to Kelly (obvs!), their son Mac Morris (Hoog), is now a student at the school in the reboot.",
    "Fans of the original can expect plenty of knowing references and in-jokes typical of the show's humor, but the Saved the Bell reboot also promises to tackle plenty of serious issues. Its central storyline, for instance, is the integration of students from a recently closed low-income high school into the traditionally preppie Bayside fold.",

    "Heading abroad again now that global travel restrictions are easing? Then trying to tune into Peacock like you would from home is likely going to be impossible because of geo-blocking.",
