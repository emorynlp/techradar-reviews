    "For sports fans after something different at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the modern pentathlon is like an ultra-high-stakes version of game shows like Takeshi\u2019s Castle, where participants have to navigate various tricky courses just to get to the final. Follow our guide below as we explain what modern pentathlon is and how to watch an Olympics modern pentathlon live stream.",
    "This sport sees athletes competing in five disciplines: fencing, freestyle swimming, equestrian show jumping, and laser run (shooting and cross-country running, combined).",
    "Russia\u2019s Aleksander Lesun and Australia\u2019s Chloe Esposito won gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and they hope to repeat the feat this time. But five years is a long time, and they\u2019re going to face stiff competition from all corners. Look out for France\u2019s Valentin Belaud (2019 World Champion) and Elodie Clouvel (Rio Olympics silver medallist).",
    "In this article, we look at the key event dates and how you can watch modern pentathlon at Olympics 2020 live and online. For additional information on the other games, read this detailed guide on how to get an Olympics live stream for all this summer's gold-tinted sporting action.",
    "Catch a modern pentathlon Olympic live stream where you are with many native broadcasters offering free coverage across the Olympics schedule. In the UK, BBC and BBC iPlayer will be broadcasting live coverage of key events, while Channel 7 in Australia, and its online counterpart, 7Plus, lead the charge with the most comprehensive live stream across all events.",
    "Other countries with free Olympic live streams include RTE in Ireland, TF1 in France, and ARD and ZDF in Germany.",
    "No matter where you are around the world, there should be an Olympic Games stream to ensure you can watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, whether paid-for or free. However, you may find your preferred domestic coverage is geo-restricted when abroad, or that your place of work, college, or school has prevented the ability to access your chosen service and watch online.",
    "Thankfully, there's any easy work-around. Simply download a VPN and you can spoof your device into appearing as if it's located somewhere else. Essentially, then, you can appear as if you're where your coverage is geo-locked to and watch as if you're right at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location, i.e. UK for iPlayer, US for Sling TV",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to BBC iPlayer",
    "With many countries around the world taking part in the Olympic Games, you can find a broadcaster to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in most countries, whether free or platforms that charge.",
    "For those countries we haven't mentioned above, Wikipedia's dedicated page allows you to see a breakdown of Olympic Games TV channels to tune into."
