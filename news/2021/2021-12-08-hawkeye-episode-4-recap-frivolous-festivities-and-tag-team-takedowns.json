  "article": [
    "Spoilers for the first four episodes of Hawkeye follow. You've been warned.",
    "Serialized TV usually has to walk an awkward tightrope between two, often contradictory forces. While every episode ideally needs to further the arc plot, it should also function as a distinct unit, with its own beginning, middle and end.",
    "Bizarrely, Hawkeye episode 4 \u2013 aka \u2018Partners, Am I Right?\u2019 \u2013 doesn\u2019t really deliver on either front. Yet it remains a wonderful continuation of a TV show that may be on course to be the MCU\u2019s best so far \u2013 assuming it can stick the landing better than its predecessors.",
    "In most TV shows, an action-light episode such as this would feel like filler, the talky instalment that allows showrunners to save their special effects budget for later in the run. Most TV shows, however, don\u2019t have a central pairing as engaging as Kate Bishop and Clint Barton, and the writing team has earned the right to position their friendship (not that Barton would call it that) high in the storytelling mix. First and foremost, \u2018Partners, Am I Right?\u2019 is an episode about family, whether it\u2019s the one we\u2019re born with or the ones we build for ourselves.",
    "Although the previous episode\u2019s cliffhanger teased a duel between dodgy stepdad-to-be Jack Duquesne and Barton, the low-key resolution provided is far preferable \u2013 in this unlikely superheroic twist on meeting the parents, Eleanor Bishop\u2019s confused \u201cWhy is there an Avenger in my dining room?\u201d is the perfect summation of a wonderfully weird moment.",
    "Hawkeye has already shown it can skip effortlessly between drama, comedy and heartfelt character beats, and the scenes in the Bishop townhouse are no different. Kate and Clint\u2019s very different takes on their working arrangement \u2013 she thinks they\u2019re equal partners, he still sees her as an over-excited kid \u2013 are played for laughs, but Eleanor\u2019s protective instincts bring a more serious edge to the conversation. Indeed, \u201cLet me clarify, she is not a superhero,\u201d is how most parents would respond when their daughter brings an Avenger home.",
    "Jack remains an enigma. On one hand, he\u2019s the skilled fencer who made a beeline for Ronin\u2019s retractable sword in episode 1 and \u2013 it\u2019s now been revealed \u2013 runs a business that launders money for the Tracksuit Mafia. At the same time, his persona is that of a clown, his mangled aphorisms and comedically smooth manner suggesting he may not be the criminal mastermind Clint and Kate believe him to be.",
    "Whatever the truth, the affection between Jack and Eleanor seems real, and their dance moves, while not necessarily what Kate wants to see, do open her eyes to the importance of family at Christmas.",
    "With only three days left to the big day and Clint still stuck in the Big Apple, Kate\u2019s ad hoc house party may not be quite the celebration he was planning with his kids, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. The tasteless jumpers, cocktails-in-a-bag and coin-tossing tricks \u2013 surely they\u2019re going to come in handy later\u2026 \u2013 turn out to be a fun prelude to some darker moments, as Clint finally lets his guard down.",
    "One of Hawkeye\u2019s biggest strengths remains its ability to reveal new layers of a character who was chronically underserved by the Avengers movies. Here we see the tragedy of a man who devoted his life to being a weapon for others, hoping he was being \u201caimed by the right people at the right targets\u201d, and subsequently lost his entire family in the Blip, before watching his best friend sacrifice herself to save the universe.",
    "Admitting he was the man in the mysterious Ronin suit is clearly a massive step, but the bigger moment is arguably when he tells Kate his greatest shot was the one he didn\u2019t take: i.e. the one that would have killed Natasha Romanoff before she defected. It\u2019s a shame Hawkeye and Black Widow\u2019s friendship \u2013 one that allegedly defines both characters \u2013 was never properly explored on screen.",
    "When the action does come, it\u2019s worth the wait \u2013 a spectacular rooftop mel\u00e9e involving Clint, Kate, Maya \u2018Echo\u2019 Lopez, and a mysterious new assailant who isn\u2019t the special guest star we were expecting.",
    "While we\u2019ll be waiting a bit longer for Kingpin/Wilson Fisk to make his (widely rumored) debut in the show, the arrival of Natasha\u2019s \u2018sister\u2019, Yelena Belova, is an extremely welcome development. Her extremely professional moves are a reminder of just how much Kate has to learn, and make Clint realize it\u2019s time to heed Eleanor\u2019s advice and send his proteg\u00e9e home.",
    "Who Yelena is working for \u2013 whether it\u2019s herself or another, more shadowy benefactor \u2013 is one of the biggest mysteries of an episode that offers up rather more questions than answers, though.",
    "What\u2019s the relevance of the Rolex watch that\u2019s suddenly become an essential McGuffin? Is Jack really integral to the Tracksuit Mafia? Or is Eleanor the true criminal mastermind? The \u201curgent\u201d phone call she makes after Clint leaves the house suggests she knows more than she\u2019s letting on\u2026.",
    "As for bona fide answers? The unexpected return of those friendly neighborhood LARPers does, at least, explain where Clint and Kate are going to get their new-look Hawkeye suits. With Tony Stark no longer around to hand out sophisticated nanotech outfits, these are important things to consider.",
    "In a brief, six-part season, an episode that does so little to advance the plot could feel like an indulgence. Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld are so watchable as Clint and Kate, however, that \u2018Partners, Am I Right?\u2019 remains another extremely fun outing for the MCU\u2019s wonderful reinvention of Hawkeye.",
    "On the flipside, it does feel like there\u2019s still an awful lot of storytelling for the final two episodes to deliver, especially if both Yelena and Kingpin are to be integral to the story \u2013 and if Clint is going to make it home for Christmas.",
    "WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki have all floundered in their final acts \u2013 hopefully Hawkeye can avoid a similar fate.",
    "New episodes of Hawkeye stream on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
