  "article": [
    "On September 28, Amazon unveiled a host of new products including a home security robot, a Mickey Mouse themed smart speaker, and a second iteration of the Halo fitness tracker. Unlike the original Halo Band, which was a passive device that fed biometric data into a smartphone app, the new Halo View has a screen and looks much more like a conventional fitness wearable.",
    "The Halo View offers all the features you\u2019d expect from an entry-level fitness tracker, including heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, workout tracking, sleep monitoring, smartphone notifications, and skin temperature tracking. What sets is apart from the competition is the price \u2013 at $79.99 (about \u00a360 / AU$110) it\u2019s one of the cheapest around. For that, you\u2019ll be able to see your daily step count, activity sessions, heart rate, calories burned, time spent asleep and awake, and sleep temperature.",
    "If you\u2019re thinking that list sounds rather short, that\u2019s because the Halo View\u2019s other metrics \u2013 including activity score, activity intensity, sleep score, and sleep stages \u2013 are locked behind a paywall, and only accessible if you have an Amazon Halo subscription.",
    "The price of entry isn\u2019t particularly steep. You get 12 months free with a new Halo View, after which it\u2019s a rolling payment of $3.99 (about \u00a33 / AU$5.50) per month. That\u2019s cheap for a service that also includes guided workouts, meditation and mindfulness sessions; recipes and nutrition advice; personalized exercise plans to help improve functional mobility; and body composition analysis. Indeed, it\u2019s a fraction of the price of Apple Fitness Plus.",
    "What\u2019s interesting is that Amazon has chosen to draw Halo View owners in by locking a few metrics that you might normally expect to be free \u2013 and that might be a sign of things to come.",
    "Fitbit owners don\u2019t have to pay monthly to check their sleep and activity scores, but they will get more out of their fitness tracker if they subscribe to Fitbit Premium. Like Amazon, Fitbit offers new owners a free trial, after which membership costs $9.99 / \u00a37.99 / AU$15.49 per month.",
    "Like Amazon Halo subscribers, Fitbit Premium members also get access to a catalog of instructor-led workouts, plus nutrition advice and meditation sessions. They also get more in-depth analysis of their health data. This includes personalized tips to help you develop healthier habits, a detailed breakdown of your nightly sleeping patterns, and (if you own a Fitbit Sense) an analysis of your daily stress score.",
    "Those are all great to have, and really help you make the most of your device, but no key features have been hidden away for subscribers\u2019 eyes only. Until now.",
    "When Fitbit unveiled its latest fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 5, on August 24, it also announced a new feature \u2013 the Readiness Score. This is a figure calculated using your heart rate, recent activity history, and sleep score, and essentially tells you how much energy you have for the day ahead.",
    "If you\u2019re well rested and have a high score, the Fitbit app can suggest some intense workouts to get your heart pumping. If you\u2019re a bit drained, it can offer some gentle yoga sessions so you can keep moving, but without burning yourself out.",
    "It sounds impressive, but as Fitbit\u2019s colorful promo video makes clear, the Readiness Score (which will be launching at some point in the coming months) is for Fitbit Premium subscribers only.",
    "The Charge 5 can certainly be used without it (it\u2019s absolutely packed with sensors, and captures more health metrics than any other Fitbit device to date), but there\u2019s a definite message here: you need Premium to get the full experience.",
    "It\u2019s too early so far to say that there\u2019s definitely a pattern here, but it\u2019s certainly interesting that we\u2019ve seen two big fitness tracker launches within the last two months, both of which are designed around the assumption that you\u2019ll not only pay the one-off cost of the fitness tracker itself, but keep a rolling subscription going as well, in order to access more of your health data as part of a bundle of fitness tools and resources.",
    "It\u2019s not hard to imagine how, a year or two from now, we might see the start of \u2018fitness tracking as a service\u2019 where the wristband is free up front, but you\u2019re locked into a contract paying a set fee each month to access your own biometric data. The concept of paying a fee to see your own heart rate seems strange, but it might not be too far off."
