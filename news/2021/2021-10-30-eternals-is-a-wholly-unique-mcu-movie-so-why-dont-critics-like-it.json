  "article": [
    "There\u2019s a quote from Avengers: Endgame director Joe Russo, as part of the recently released Story of Marvel Studios book, that sums up the daunting task of developing a new MCU movie.",
    "\"The big thing I used to say all the time was, 'People tell you how much they love chocolate ice cream,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou give it to them six days a week, they're gonna throw it in your face on day six. And the problem is, if you have three chocolate ice creams in the can at 200 million dollars a pop, you're screwed. So you better start figuring out ahead of time how to be disruptive.\"",
    "As the co-director of four Marvel movies, Russo knows what he\u2019s talking about. Fan expectations grow with each new entry in the MCU \u2013 so much so that Marvel Studios must constantly break its own glass ceiling to please its fanbase. So the Marvel movie formula needs to be disrupted and tweaked occasionally to keep it fresh.",
    "Russo\u2019s quote couldn\u2019t be more apt, then, for Eternals, the next movie in Marvel\u2019s Phase 4 slate. It\u2019s a film with all of the right ingredients: an Avengers-esque line-up of superheroes, an all-star cast, an Oscar winning director in Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and a creative, novel vision that sets it apart from its predecessors.",
    "What\u2019s not to love, then? Well, a lot of things, judging by the film\u2019s critical reception.",
    "Currently, Eternals holds a 61% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. To put that into context, Eternals is considered to be the worst MCU movie to date. Read that again: the worst. MCU movie. To date.",
    "As things stand, based on its average score, critics think that Thor: The Dark World \u2013 believed to be the worst Marvel film ever, which led to director Alan Taylor stating the backlash made him \u201close the will to make movies\u201d \u2013 is a better MCU flick than Eternals. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron are also viewed as far superior films.",
    "And yet, as someone lucky enough to see Eternals ahead of its November 5 release, I can\u2019t grasp the absurdity of how poorly received Eternals has been, relatively speaking.",
    "Marvel movies need to reinvent themselves in order to stay relevant and remain at the top of their game, and we\u2019ve already seen examples of this on multiple occasions.",
    "Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the first MCU film that the Russo brothers directed, was a superhero flick dressed up as an espionage thriller. It hadn\u2019t been done in the MCU before and, following the period setting of Cap\u2019s first MCU runout, it made Chris Evans\u2019 supersoldier feel subsequently fresh and innovative.",
    "Cosmic entries including Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as fantasy-style flicks like Doctor Strange, also helped the MCU to branch out into different genres. Black Panther, too, was a celebration of Black communities, traditions and cultures, with Wakanda adding a new dimension to the fiction. Even Thor: Ragnarok breathed new life into the God of Thunder\u2019s MCU series with its 80s-style, comedic elements \u2013 that didn\u2019t seem possible after Thor: The Dark World.",
    "So Marvel has previous for switching up its moviemaking formula. Sure, from a structural standpoint, MCU films haven\u2019t changed much: they\u2019re still humorous, action-heavy, heartfelt at times and comprise three distinct acts.",
    "What does change, though, is how each director or head writer chooses to tell these stories. They determine how their MCU film is shot, written or edited. And they decide on each movie\u2019s tonal or aesthetic differences. This constant reinvention through the use of different storytellers, albeit with Marvel's in-chief creative team keeping a tight hand on the steering wheel, keeps the Marvel movie formula fresh.",
    "Eternals is no different. It pushes the envelope of what a Marvel movie can be through its storytelling and visuals, as well as offering a teasing insight into just how little of the MCU we\u2019ve actually explored.",
    "I\u2019m not only talking about Eternals from a representation or inclusivity standpoint here, either. It\u2019s vitally important that the world\u2019s biggest cinematic universe is more reflective of the world around it. So it\u2019s pleasing that Marvel Studios continues to diversify its predominantly white, cisgender male superhero line-up, albeit slower than expected.",
    "But the scope of this film is what's exciting. Eternals is ambitious in how its story spans 7,000 years of human history. It\u2019s visually arresting in its use of different color palettes to set the tone for various scenes. Moments of joy or celebration are vivid and brightly lit, while more serious scenes are gloomier affairs made up of paler or faded hues.",
    "Eternals\u2019 numerous real-world locations not only give it a global appeal, but also bring a grounded, natural and realistic feel to its tale. And, when it does need to go more cosmic, such as when the Eternals talk to the Celestials, the sheer scope of these sequences present a universal depth that outstrips what we\u2019ve seen in any Thor, Guardians or Avengers flick.",
    "Sure, there are missteps. Some decisions made by the Eternals are a tad silly, while a few hard edits are noticeable early on in the film. We\u2019ll dive into some other niggles in our review early next week.",
    "But Eternals shouldn\u2019t be belittled for trying something new. Nor should Zhao be criticized for tackling a superhero movie, even if it\u2019s a far cry from her previous projects. Directors should push their own boundaries, too, so Zhao shouldn\u2019t be singled out for branching out into new territory.",
    "Maybe critics\u2019 opinions on sites like Rotten Tomatoes shouldn\u2019t be taken as gospel, either. Maybe Marvel fans should wait to see Eternals for themselves and, in what would be an ironically amusing twist, its audience score may outweigh its critical score. After all, another comic book movie \u2013 2018\u2019s Venom \u2013 is adored by most Rotten Tomatoes users, whereas critics universally slammed it.",
    "I get it: people don\u2019t like change. I didn\u2019t like how Zack Snyder altered the ending to his 2009 Watchmen movie adaptation. In July, He-Man fans were furious with the direction that Netflix and Kevin Smith took that franchise in for Masters of the Universe: Revelation, too. As a result, even though Revelation: Part 2\u2019s trailer looks like it\u2019ll rectify Part 1\u2019s errors, some He-Man fanatics won\u2019t be tuning in to watch it.",
    "To suggest that Eternals is the worst ever MCU film, though, is simply wrong. Sure, it takes some big swings that some viewers may be unimpressed by, but they represent a necessary effort to bring something unique to the traditional Marvel movie formula. If every MCU film was made in the same way, fans would get bored quickly, their box office hauls would fall, and the MCU would eventually die off.",
    "Marvel Studios took a big risk with 2008\u2019s Iron Man, which paid off. It took another major gamble by bringing the Avengers together in 2012: an ensemble movie that similarly wowed audiences. And, until March's re-release of James Cameron\u2019s Avatar in China put it into first place again, Avengers: Endgame was the highest-grossing movie of all-time. Not bad for a company that\u2019s made its name on risky endeavours.",
    "Eternals deserves the same treatment. Yes, it\u2019s a high-risk entry in the MCU, but it has to be. We need originality and ingenuity in movies, including Marvel films, and Eternals provides that in spades. It seems, though, that this very same creativity isn\u2019t what most critics want from a Marvel movie \u2013 and I can\u2019t fathom why."
