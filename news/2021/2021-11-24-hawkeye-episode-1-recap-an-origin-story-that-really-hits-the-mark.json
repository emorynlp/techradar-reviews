    "Spoilers for the first episode of Hawkeye follow. You have been warned.",
    "Origin stories have always been tricky things to pull off. The path to superhero status is riven with clich\u00e9s, while spending too long on explanations can be a distraction from the story you really want to tell. As an introduction to rookie archer Kate Bishop, however, this debut episode of Hawkeye gets almost everything right \u2013 in fact, within the first 20 minutes you know almost everything you need to.",
    "Anyone casually flipping through Disney Plus, expecting to see Clint Barton: The TV Series, will possibly be surprised to see the focus is more on Bishop than the original Hawkeye. If you've read our interview with the show's director and producer, you'll know this already. Still, as bold a move as it is, it pays off spectacularly.",
    "The pre-credits sequence shows how the young Kate lost her father in the Chitauri assault of the first Avengers movie \u2013 nearly a decade on, the Battle of New York continues to be a pivotal event in the MCU \u2013 and is subsequently inspired by Hawkeye\u2019s archery antics on the battlefield. \u201cI need a bow and arrow,\u201d she says at her dad\u2019s funeral, vowing to protect her mother against anything that comes their way.",
    "A brilliantly animated credits sequence \u2013 delivered in the trademark purple hue of Bishop\u2019s comic-book look \u2013 picks up the story, showing how she became a champion archer, gymnast and fencer. As well as being a crash course in Superhero Skills 101, it\u2019s a wonderfully efficient piece of storytelling. The first time we see Kate in action is also revealing, as she uses her unique talents to shoot \u2013 and accidentally smash up \u2013 a vintage belltower as part of a bet. It\u2019s a good job her mom\u2019s rich enough to pay the repair bill\u2026",
    "Barton himself hasn\u2019t been forgotten, and the episode skilfully switches between its two protagonists throughout. He\u2019s the last of the original Avengers to get title billing, and on paper it\u2019s easy to see why \u2013 next to supersoldiers, Norse gods, billionaire tech geniuses and super-spies, a guy who\u2019s simply really good with a bow and arrow is very much a supporting player. Even so, \u2018Never Meet Your Heroes\u2019 quickly shows why he\u2019s the perfect anchor for a TV show.",
    "In a nutshell, Hawkeye is a hero with baggage. When Thanos delivered the most famous finger snap in history, Clint Barton lost everything. So, with his wife and three kids turned to dust, he transformed himself into the vigilante Ronin, unafraid to push the limits of the PG-13 rating as he embarked on a violent mission to eliminate organised crime. Then, to make matters worse, he had to sacrifice his best friend, Natasha Romanoff (aka Black Widow), to recover the Soul Stone on Vormir. Even with his family restored, a backstory like that is going to leave a mark.",
    "Jeremy Renner is brilliant here, with his gruff, unshowy performance revealing the vulnerable, human side of a hero. Though clearly devoted to his kids, there\u2019s an underlying sadness lurking behind the eyes, most notably when an actor playing Black Widow in a production of hot new Broadway smash Rogers: The Musical brings the memories flooding back. Barton is clearly uncomfortable with his massive celebrity, the weight of the lives he took in his Ronin guise taking a considerable toll.",
    "And yet despite that darkness, this episode is lots of fun \u2013 and not just because its \u201csix days \u2019til Christmas\u201d setting is all the excuse Marvel needs to turn the soundtrack into a festive jukebox.",
    "From the hilarious glimpses at the Steve Rogers show \u2013 surely a real-life MCU musical can\u2019t be too far behind? \u2013 to Kate Bishop\u2019s inventive fight sequences, there\u2019s a real lightness of touch here. Hailee Steinfeld instantly makes the role her own, whether she\u2019s in the midst of a dispute with her mom, going undercover, or beating up mobsters with vintage wine bottles.",
    "But as skilled and inventive as Kate is, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s far from the finished article. Indeed, as soon as she dons the Ronin suit it\u2019s inevitable she\u2019s about to find herself in over her head, and becomes the target of the so-called Tracksuit Mafia \u2013 aka the bad guys \u2013 whose leader has made it his business to pursue with extreme prejudice.",
    "Lucky for her, running around in that outfit is a sure fire way to attract the attention of one Clint Barton, the ideal mentor for someone with her skill set. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d he asks after saving her from the angry mob. On the evidence of episode one, finding out the answer is going to be a blast.",
    "The latest MCU TV show hits the ground running, and serves as a near-perfect set-up for the new series. As well as deftly introducing Kate Bishop and revealing some of Clint Barton\u2019s demons, it poses some intriguing questions that bode well for the show as it continues.",
    "How did Eleanor Bishop\u2019s fortunes turn around in the decade since the Battle of New York? What did she do that upset Armand Duquesne III so much? Why is Jack, her new fianc\u00e9, so obsessed with Ronin\u2019s retractable sword? Why is the watch recovered from the Avengers Compound so important? And where can we get tickets for Rogers: The Musical? Hopefully the answers will come in the five remaining episodes of Hawkeye, rather than down the line in a follow-up MCU movie or TV show.",
    "Marvel has just given us a fantastic early Christmas present \u2013 fingers crossed we haven\u2019t just unwrapped the best gift first.",
    "New episodes of Hawkeye stream on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
