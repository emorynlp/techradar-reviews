    "Apple Arcade is adding 32 new games to its service in its biggest expansion since the service launched in September 2019. This raises Apple Arcade's catalogue to over 180 games, and you can enjoy them all on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV devices.",
    "The 32 new games (all listed below) include Arcade Originals like Star Trek: Legends - an official team-based RPG - and NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition, as well as the highly-anticipated JRPG Fantasian \u2013 the latest game from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who described the game and his career in an in-depth interview with TechRadar.",
    "Many of the new games are joining one of two newly-added categories in Apple Arcade: Timeless Classics and App Store Greats. Timeless Classics will expand Apple Arcade's library of more traditional games like Chess and Backgammon, whereas App Store Greats will add some popular mobile favorites such as Fruit Ninja Classic and Monument Valley.",
    "All of these games and more can be enjoyed on Apple Arcade without ads or in-app purchases. You can play them all for yourself with a subscription that costs $4.99 / \u00a34.99 / AU$7.99 a month and you\u2019ll get a one-month free trial when you first sign up.",
    "With 30 new games to choose from, it can be hard to work out which to jump into first, but there are a few standout titles that you should definitely check out.",
    "For fans of traditional games, Really Bad Chess is a fantastic app that mixes up a classic - by giving you random pieces. Chess masters can enjoy the challenge of having to win with eight rooks and 7 pawns, while beginners can enjoy playing without the need to learn intense strategies.",
    "If you\u2019d prefer something more modern, Monument Valley - the surreal puzzle game where you wander through impossible architecture - could be one for you. Cut the Rope is getting a 3D remaster and The Oregon Trail remake will let you relive a classic from your childhood.",
    "World of Demons is a new hack-and-slash game released just for Apple Arcade by PlatinumGames, makers of the Bayonetta series and Astral Chain.",
    "Last but not least, Fantasian will give players a Final fantasy-style, turn-based RPG experience in a beautiful world made using real-life dioramas. This game looks stunning and we can\u2019t wait to try it out for ourselves.",
    "Want to know exactly what's been added? Here's the full list of new Apple Arcade games that were just added:",
    "Apple Arcade is Apple\u2019s answer to services like Google Play Pass and, to an extent, Xbox Game Pass. It\u2019s a subscription platform that, for a monthly fee, gives you unlimited access to a library of games. It\u2019s like the Netflix of App Store titles.",
    "Once you\u2019ve subscribed you\u2019ll be able to download and play every App Store game that\u2019s included on the platform, including some Arcade exclusive games you wouldn\u2019t be able to play otherwise.",
    "Currently, Apple Arcade is only available on Apple devices - iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV - so Android fans are unfortunately stuck with just what\u2019s available on Play Pass. With now over 180 games to play, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find something you enjoy."
