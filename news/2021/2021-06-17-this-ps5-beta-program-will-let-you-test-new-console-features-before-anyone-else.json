    "Sony has announced it will soon be holding its first ever PS5 system software beta program, which will allow participating players to test out new console features - and provide feedback - before they\u2019re publicly available in an update coming later this year.",
    "Announced on the official PlayStation blog, you can sign up for an opportunity to participate in the first PS5 system software beta program via the official signup page. There are some conditions, though. You must be over 18 and living in the US, Canada, UK, Japan, Germany or France in order to be eligible to take part.",
    "Once you\u2019ve signed up, look out for an email from Sony in the future that will confirm your place by showing you how to download the beta version of the upcoming PS5 system software. As an added bonus, you may also be added to a potential participant pool of future beta programs beyond this first test, too.",
    "Sony has made no mention of what features will specifically be available in the upcoming system software beta. However, the phrase \u201cmajor system update\u201d mentioned in the blog post, tied with the fact that Sony is debuting a beta program for it, could hint that the update will have big things in store that improve the user experience on PS5.",
    "Microsoft has done something similar for a while now. The Xbox Insider Program is a service that\u2019s free to sign up to, and allows Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One owners to test out features ahead of time, as well as occasionally register interest in closed betas and other preview programs.",
    "The PS5\u2019s momentum shows no signs of halting, then, with the last major update in April adding requested features like cross-generation Share Play, support for USB extended storage and improvements to PS5\u2019s Game Base social feature. Now that Sony is getting the players involved, perhaps that old slogan of \u201cfor the players\u201d is coming to fruition in a more literal sense."
