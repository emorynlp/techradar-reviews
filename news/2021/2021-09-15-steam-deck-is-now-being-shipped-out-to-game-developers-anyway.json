  "article": [
    "Steam Deck developer kits are now being sent to game developers for them to test the hardware with their products ahead of its big release at the end of the year.",
    "These dev kit models are \u201cfunctionally identical\u201d to the finished product, as we\u2019ve heard before, and while there\u2019ll be small differences, they won\u2019t be anything that matters.",
    "This is not really a surprise seeing as at the start of September, Valve announced that it was getting ready to ship developer kits, and for requests to be made for the limited number of these which were being prepared.",
    "So those requests have been received, processed, and the lucky devs deemed important enough are getting a Steam Deck imminently. The engineering samples of the handhelds are intended to give Valve the \u201cchance to guide game developers through the process of getting their games on Steam Deck\u201d, the firm notes, and to get feedback on possible issues as the final phase of work on the device ramps up.",
    "We also got a glimpse of some pics of the dev units being given their final updates (above) and then subsequently packaged up ready to be shipped (below).",
    "To all intents and purposes, then, the Steam Deck hardware is done, with just polishing and honing to perform \u2013 and hopefully that\u2019s something of a hint that Valve is on-track to launch the portable PC as planned in December.",
    "After all, it\u2019s taken less than a fortnight to get the names of interested parties, process them and ship out dev sample units, so that seems to be pretty quick \u2013 even if at this point, it needs to be. Remember, we\u2019re only a few months away from the actual retail launch now, so testing needs to proceed with some urgency.",
    "Of course, even if things seem to be on track right now for the big launch, exactly how many units might be available in December is another question entirely \u2013 particularly given how quickly pre-orders were pushed way out into 2022 when they first went live.",
    "What\u2019s clear enough is that a great deal of gamers are going to be doing some waiting, it\u2019s just a question of how much waiting. Currently, the Steam Deck pre-order page shows expected availability of \u2018after Q2 2022\u2019 for all models, which indicates July 2022 or later."
