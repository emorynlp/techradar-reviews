    "March Madness TV sales have arrived at Walmart just days before the big tournament officially begins. You can find incredible deals on a wide range of TVs from top brands like Samsung, LG, Vizio, and more. One of our favorite March Madness TV deals is this Sceptre 75-inch 4K TV that's on sale for just $648 (was $1,799.99). That's a massive $1,152 discount and an incredible price for a big-screen 4K TV.",
    "This 75-inch set delivers bold, bright colors and sharp contrasts thanks to the 4K HD resolution, which produces four times the number of pixels as a Full HD display. And while this big-screen TV lacks smart capabilities, it does includes four HDMI ports that allow you to connect up to four devices at once, so you can stream, browse, and listen to all of your favorite multimedia. You're also getting a USB port so you can conveniently listen to music and view digital pictures from your TV. See more of the best March Madness TV deals from Walmart below and keep in mind these are limited-time offers, so you should take advantage now before it's too late.",
