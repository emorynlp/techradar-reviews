    "Djokovic's latest shootout with Rafael Nadal has already gone down in tennis lore, the Serb recovering from a chastening first set to inflict just the third defeat of the King of Clay's 17-year Roland Garros reign in spectacular fashion.",
    "The world No. 1 has been chasing his second Career Grand Slam for five years, though Nadal's clay court dominance has always rendered it a dim prospect. That's not the case in 2021.",

    "If you're abroad right now, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic French Open coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",

This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred Djokovic vs Tsitsipas live stream.

This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone."
