    "Outdoor usability has also improved thanks to a brighter screen that goes up to 1,000 nits that features Getac's LumiBond 2.0 Technology which provides better viewing angles, contrast ratio and sunlight readability. Working in low-light environments is easier too as the S410 has a backlit keyboard as well as a larger touchpad.",

An IP53 rating even allows users to operate in dusty and light rain conditions without having to worry about damaging the S410.",
    "President of the rugged and video solutions business group at Getac, Rick Hwang explained how customer demand helped influence the design of the S410 in a press release, saying:",
