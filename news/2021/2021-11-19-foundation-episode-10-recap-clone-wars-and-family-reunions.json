    "Huge spoilers follow for Foundation episodes 1 to 10. You\u2019ve been warned.",
    "It\u2019s been more than three years since Apple took a gamble and announced its TV adaptation of Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation book series. The complex nature of Asimov\u2019s seminal works led many to believe it was unadaptable and, given how much Apple TV Plus\u2019 latest big-budget show has diverged from its source material, you could argue that those initial beliefs were correct.",
    "The Leap \u2013 Foundation episode 10\u2019s actual title \u2013 seems allegorical, then, given the leap of faith that Apple took in greenlighting David S. Goyer\u2019s small-screen adaptation. But it\u2019s been justified, with Foundation growing stronger with each passing week.",
    "Wrapping up a season\u2019s worth of plot threads while also laying the groundwork for season 2 may have been difficult for Goyer and company to pull off. After all, plenty has happened across its multiple storylines. However, Foundation episode 10 does a great job at both, delivering last-minute shocks and glimpses into the show\u2019s future narrative arcs.",
    "So what\u2019s the state of play on Trantor? The Leap picks up where episode 9 left off, with Brother Day, having returned from Maiden, meeting with Brother Dusk to discuss the fate of Brother Dawn and Azura.",
    "The conversation is tense, with Dusk strongly advising that the pair should be killed for their crimes. He goads Day for leaving, too, but Day bats away Dusk\u2019s thorny comments with relative ease.",
    "Day\u2019s mettle is tested more when he meets Dawn afterward. Playing the good and bad cop, Day removes Dawn\u2019s handcuffs before chastising him for conspiring with the enemy. Dawn bites back saying it\u2019s Cleon I\u2019s fault \u2013 that is, his desire to create a clone army to rule the Galactic Empire long after his death \u2013 for originally putting them in this unsolicited position.",
    "It\u2019s a valid point. The themes of choice and fate have been revisited time and again throughout Foundation. While Dawn and Day wouldn\u2019t exist if they hadn\u2019t been created by Cleon I\u2019s cloning program, they clearly question their place in the universe based on what they\u2019ve experienced in season 1. They appear to be going through an existential crisis, which is unexpected for clones that don\u2019t possess free will or a soul.",
    "All of this makes for a pretty emotional scene and, given that their shared screen time has been limited so far, it\u2019s also enjoyable to see Lee Pace and Cassian Bilton trade barbs. It feels like an argument a father and son would have \u2013 a point forced home by Dawn\u2019s claim that he\u2019s longed to call Day his \u2018father\u2019, even though they\u2019re both clones of the same man. If that\u2019s not an unsettlingly warped relationship, we don\u2019t know what is.",
    "Instead of taking his frustrations out on Dawn or Dusk, it\u2019s Azura who bears the brunt of Day\u2019s pent-up anger later on.",
    "Initially, Day walks a similar good cop, bad cop line with Azura as he did with Dawn, but it doesn\u2019t last. Mocking her about the so-called legacy she\u2019ll leave behind, Day eventually reveals how he\u2019ll punish her for her crimes: every person that Azura has ever known, including her family, friends, former lover and colleagues, will be killed. That amounts to 1551 innocent people! With a flick of Day\u2019s wrist, the horrifying deed is done. Everyone Azura loved is wiped out in an instant \u2013 upon her own death, then, her legacy dies with her.",
    "It\u2019s an incredibly ruthless decision. Does the punishment fit the crime? In Day\u2019s eyes, yes. And, as viewers, you can kind of understand his stance from a \u2018preserving the status quo\u2019 perspective. Still, it\u2019s extremely harsh and is a reminder of the totalitarian attitude of the Empire\u2019s rulers.",
    "As for Azura? She\u2019s locked away, constrained by shackles to stop her from committing suicide, and sensory shrouded for the rest of her days. Oh, and she\u2019ll be kept alive by an intravenous drip. So that\u2019s the last we\u2019ll see of her.",
    "And yet that isn\u2019t even the biggest jaw-dropping moment to occur on Trantor. Two more big shocks arrive in this narrative\u2019s last main sequence, both setting up some tantalizing plot threads to be explored in the future.",
    "With Azura\u2019s fate sealed, it\u2019s Dawn\u2019s turn to face the music. Brought before his elder \u2018brothers\u2019, Dawn is told by Dusk that, due to his differences and transgressions, he\u2019d already be dead if it was up to Dusk. With Day presiding over the Empire\u2019s key middle throne, though, it\u2019ll be him that decides Dawn\u2019s fate.",
    "Astonishingly, Day reveals that Dawn will be allowed to live. Delivering his verdict, Day suggests that his Great Spiral walk and meeting with other pilgrims on Maiden (which we saw in episode 8) did leave a lasting impression on him. He also explains that Halima\u2019s doctrine \u2013 \u201ca soul incapable of change is a soul doomed to stagnation\u201d \u2013 and Hari Seldon\u2019s take on a similar belief system earlier in season 1 have reshaped how he views the Cleonic dynasty. Change, as Day puts it, is a good thing and it\u2019s time for the clones to embrace it.",
    "Furious, Dusk blasts Day for destroying Cleon\u2019s legacy, and egotistically claims that history should bow to them. The duo fight as Dawn cowers in Eto Demerzel\u2019s arms. It\u2019s clear that Day, who was Brother Dawn in episodes 1 and 2, was deeply affected by events he saw in those entries, hence his empathetic stance towards Dawn.",
    "It\u2019s a courageous stance to take but, ultimately, one that doesn\u2019t matter. As Day and Dusk row, Demerzel snaps Dawn\u2019s neck, killing him instantly. As a stunned Day and Dusk watch on, she tells them that she\u2019s loyal to the Cleonic dynasty and, as such, their pure bloodline must be maintained. Dawn, then, had to die.",
    "Shocking as it is, it\u2019s the culmination of events that have festered for some time. Ironically, it\u2019s Demerzel\u2019s programming, rewired so that she\u2019s loyal to the Empire, that condemned Dawn to death. It also speaks to how much faith she\u2019s lost in Day after their Maiden trip. Symbolically, it\u2019s representative of a father losing his son, too: we saw how familial Day and Dawn\u2019s relationship was earlier in episode 10 and Day\u2019s distress at Dawn\u2019s death is further evidence of this.",
    "Distraught, Day burns Dawn\u2019s body using the Empire\u2019s disintegration device, before Shadow Master Obrecht arrives with more bleak news.",
    "As it happens, Azura\u2019s gang didn\u2019t just change Dawn\u2019s genetic makeup \u2013 they altered every clone\u2019s DNA, meaning that Day and Dusk could also be impure. Enraged, Day destroys the original Cleon\u2019s glass tomb, symbolizing the start of the Cleonic dynasty\u2019s destruction. Meanwhile, Dusk wrecks Dawn\u2019s part of the Empire\u2019s mural, and Demerzel rips off her human face in anguish for what she\u2019s done, revealing her subsurface robotic makeup. Fault lines have formed in the Empire\u2019s usually tight-knit group and they may never be the same again.",
    "By contrast, things on Terminus couldn\u2019t be more harmonious. Following his release from the Vault, Hari Seldon\u2019s digital construct tells the assembled Terminus, Thespis and Anacreon crowd (and viewers by extension) why the latter two have been at odds for thousands of years. Simply put, Cleon\u2019s first clone \u2013 Cleon II \u2013 killed Anacreon\u2019s grand huntress millennia ago and blamed it on Thespis\u2019 king to pit the planets against one another. That, Hari explains, prevented both kingdoms from leading a revolution against the Empire, which maintained the latter\u2019s hold on everyone they continue to rule.",
    "Next, Hari explains why he\u2019s an AI construct of his former self. It\u2019s a pretty convoluted explanation but, basically, the night before Raych murdered him, he swallowed a pill that contained millions of tiny self-replicating machines (we see Hari ingest the pill in episode 2). Upon his death and ejection from the Foundation\u2019s main ship, these machines rebuilt his body with synthetic and natural materials to turn him into a digital construct.",
    "It\u2019s a lengthy exposition dump, but it\u2019s necessary to understand Hari\u2019s master plan. He adds it was always his plan to unite Terminus, Thespis and Anacreon. Now that they have the Invictus, they can use it to trick the Empire into thinking that the planets wiped each other out. This means that they\u2019ll no longer concern themselves with what\u2019s actually happening on all three worlds. That, Hari says, means that the trio of planets are free of Imperial rule and they can start building a fleet of battleships to go to war with the Empire in the distant future.",
    "Admittedly, it\u2019s all a bit fanciful from a plot perspective. Clearly, Hari is a very intelligent man with the ability to foresee things: it\u2019s psychohistory, after all, which he\u2019s studied extensively.",
    "Not for the first time, though, Foundation installs him as some messianic figure who\u2019s 10 steps ahead of the Empire and, as such, his plan can\u2019t fail. That reduces the stakes somewhat leading into season 2 and beyond, then, as we know everything has already been mapped out by Hari. Of course, any future Seldon Crises could throw a wrench in the works. But, for now, it\u2019s slightly absurd that one man\u2019s predictions hold the key to overthrowing a tyrannical dynasty that\u2019s ruled for centuries.",
    "Regardless, inspired by Hari, the three races band together and, over the next few months, set his plan in motion.",
    "For Salvor Hardin, though, questions remain. Having asked Hari about why he\u2019s been guiding her in her dreams before he returns to the Vault \u2013 he has no answers for her \u2013 Salvor is none the wiser about why she\u2019s special.",
    "That is, until she has another vision months later. Salvor deduces that the two children she\u2019s seen in her visions are Raych and Gaal and, following a conversation with her mother Mari, realizes that she must be Raych and Gaal\u2019s child. Back in episode 2, we watched Gaal put her embryo in cryostasis. After Gaal is jettisoned from the Foundation\u2019s main ship during episode 2\u2019s finale, Mari ends up being a surrogate for Gaal\u2019s embryo \u2013 i.e. Salvor.",
    "Salvor decides to search for Gaal to get answers about her abilities, but not before she has touching goodbyes with Mari and Hugo. Based on these farewells, you get the sense that Salvor may never see them again. And that\u2019s definitely the case, based on how Foundation\u2019s season 1 finale ends.",
    "Episode 10\u2019s final sequence reunites us with Gaal. Her stasis pod, which left the Raven spaceship in episode 7, touches down on Synnax and she uses a self-assembling canoe to sail back home.",
    "Tragically, though, her entire village has been destroyed. As Gaal had predicted earlier in the season, Synnax\u2019s rising oceans would destroy its inhabitants if they didn\u2019t change their habits, and that\u2019s what plays out. It\u2019s a poignant moment: much like Demerzel, it seems that Gaal is the last of her kind.",
    "Or so she thinks. A light catches her eye beneath the surface and, swimming down, Gaal discovers another stasis pod with someone inside. Rescuing the unknown individual, she takes them topside with the view of waking them up.",
    "The following night, the individual wakes up and recognizes Gaal. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the person who was in the pod is none other than Salvor, who explains that she\u2019s been asleep for over a century waiting for Gaal. She reveals that she\u2019s Gaal\u2019s daughter and then, removing her blanket, that she\u2019s in possession of Hari\u2019s Prime Radiant. She goes to hand it to Gaal but, after the camera switches to a wide shot, the screen cuts to black. If nothing else, it\u2019s exciting to see two of Foundation\u2019s main characters finally meet. And we suspect that their journey together will form a major part of Foundation season 2.",
    "The Leap is an enthralling final entry in Foundation\u2019s first season. It simultaneously puts a cap on the series\u2019 most tantalizing storylines and lays the foundations for plot points still to come. For a show that makes a big deal about some of its characters\u2019 abilities to see into the future, that latter aspect will only become increasingly more important in season 2 and beyond.",
    "If the past 10 entries have taught us anything, it\u2019s that every word uttered or action taken has a purpose to it. And, as a culmination of everything that\u2019s come before, Foundation episode 10 proves this to be the case. Everything in this show has a consequence, or a cause and effect, and that\u2019ll continue to be a key strength of Apple\u2019s adaptation moving forward.",
    "It\u2019ll be interesting to see where season 2 takes these characters and the direction that its plot goes in. Aside from a few key story elements, Foundation has fully diverged from the source material \u2013 so much so that it\u2019ll be difficult to relate back to Asimov\u2019s works in the future. Apple's adaptation has become its own thing at this point but, as it charts its own path forward, it remains to be seen whether that\u2019ll be a good or bad thing.",
    "For now, Apple can take comfort in the fact that Foundation\u2019s first season was an overall success. Lacking Hari and Gaal\u2019s foresight, it\u2019s impossible for us to determine where Foundation goes from here. And that, whichever way you look at it, is exciting.",
    "Foundation will return on Apple TV Plus for its second season. No release date has been confirmed as yet."
