    "The Olympics only come around once every 4 years (or 5 in this case) so when it does lots of broadcasters are hot on the coverage. Therefore, you should be able to watch the synchronised swimming fairly easily.",
    "In the UK, the BBC and its iPlayer streaming site/app is live-streaming the Olympics for free, and so are the likes of Kenya\u2019s KTN, Ireland\u2019s RTE, and Australia\u2019s Channel 7. Keep reading to find out what options you have available to watch synchronised swimming at Olympics 2020.",
    "You should be able to find an Olympic Games stream (whether paid or free) in whatever country you happen to be in. But you may find that: a) your usual domestic coverage is geo-blocked when overseas; or b) that your place of work or college has blocked the ability to watch online where you are.",
    "There's a really easy way to solve those issues, thankfully. By downloading and installing the best VPN service, you can effectively trick your computer, phone or tablet into thinking that it's somewhere completely different. That way you can enjoy your usual coverage without having to find an illegal stream.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to BBC iPlayer",
    "It won't come as a surprise that the Olympics is being shown in most corners of the globe - although with varying levels of coverage and without free broadcasters in some countries.",
    "If you're not in any of the countries mentioned above, then we'd suggest taking a look at the dedicated Wikipedia page of all of the world's Olympic Games channels."
