    "We finally know when we\u2019ll get our hands on Elden Ring, the upcoming collaboration between Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin and From Software, the studio behind the Dark Souls. But there\u2019s still a while to wait until Elden Ring releases on January 21, 2022.",
    "In the meantime, you might be looking for some games to fill the void. Fortunately, there are plenty of dark fantasy games around, both from FromSoftware and other developers, which are in a similar vein to Elden Ring. So we\u2019ve put together a list of some of the best, which have either been chosen for their stylistic similarities, Norse mythology elements or for simply providing a vibrant fantasy world.",
    "Read on for the best games to play while you're waiting for Elden Ring.",
    "The first game, and the following two entries, are kind of a given. If you really want to get to grips with the kind of atmosphere, challenge level and environments that Elden Ring is likely to offer, then look no further than developer FromSoftware\u2019s critically-acclaimed Dark Souls series.",
    "The Dark Souls trilogy sees players battling through a series of interconnected dark, medieval fantasy environments, taking on dragons, phantoms, demons and many more horrors.",
    "While Elden Ring will offer a more open world than Dark Souls - and some other key differences - it does bear a striking resemblance visually to the lauded series. What\u2019s more, it sounds like Elden Ring will feature some Dark Souls-like boss battles, so it\u2019s worth getting as much practice in as you can before taking on FromSoftware\u2019s next challenge.",
    "Elden Ring is being touted as the \u201cevolution of Dark Souls\u201d, so if you haven\u2019t played the games in the series before, or want a refresher on what to expect, then this is a good place to start.",
    "Elden Ring looks to take inspiration from Norse mythology, a topic which has gained quite a bit of media popularity in recent years. So if you\u2019re looking for another dark fantasy-style action adventure, with Norse and Celtic influences, then look no further than Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice.",
    "While Hellblade\u2019s execution differs largely to that of FromSoftware\u2019s previous titles, and likely from Elden Ring, it does see protagonist Senua taking on some of Norse mythology\u2019s\u2019 most hostile figures in an effort to make her way to Helheim.",
    "Hellblade is a dark tale, with an even darker atmosphere, and will scratch the itch of those who wish to venture into a gloomy world filled with enemies derived from true myth - with lorestones scattered throughout the world tells stories of Norse legends. The combat's a little different from the Dark Souls games, but it offers its own challenges to get to grips with.",
    "Another one made by FromSoftware, Bloodborne\u2019s environment differs a fair bit from that of Dark Souls. While keeping within the dark fantasy vein, Bloodborne is more Gothic-leaning, set in a Victorian-era inspired by the likes of HP Lovecraft.",
    "Bloodborne features as much detailed exploration as Dark Souls did, offering a large, interconnected world to investigate - with plenty of unsettling, supernatural enemies to take on. Bloodborne\u2019s network of corridors and open spaces sounds like it will have nothing on the size of Elden Ring\u2019s map, but it offers a great insight into how FromSoftware builds its worlds - though Elden Ring won\u2019t have any friendly NPCs, unlike Bloodborne. Bloodborne could also provide an insight into how Elden Ring\u2019s multiplayer will work (it's a mix of invasions and summoning allies), though we expect it will differ somewhat.",
    "Like Dark Souls, Bloodborne's lore is embedded in every detail of the world, gradually building up a full picture of the nightmare unfurling around you. With George R.R. Martin writing the overarching mythos for Elden Ring, we imagine it\u2019ll have a slightly different flavor than the worlds of previous FromSoftware titles",
    "A moody, desolate open-world? Check. Hulking beasts that require patience and skill to defeat? Check. Good-boy buddy vibes from a companion horse? Check. Shadow of the Colossus is almost certain to play very differently to Elden Ring, but the feeling it gives off appears very similar.",
    "Just as Elden Ring will have you uncovering the mysteries of its map as you traverse its traps and evade or hunt its gigantic beasts, so too did Shadow of the Colossus present a world rife with mystery, magic, and a fair dose of sadness too. Its mix of monsters and mystical ruins seems a good fit as a pre-Elden Ring appetiser.",
    "This is our final FromSoftware offering, we promise. The remake of Demon's Souls was actually made by Bluepoint Games in collaboration with Sony, rather than with From's oversight - but this does give us an idea of just how good the studio's worlds can look on next-gen consoles.",
    "Demon\u2019s Souls on PS5 boasts an incredibly detailed world, with the ability to run at 60fps in Performance Mode or 4K at 30fps in Cinematic Mode. This action RPG also has a Photo Mode, DualSense support and a beautiful orchestral score.",
    "As with the other games on this list, it\u2019s worth trying Demon\u2019s Souls to get to grips with FromSoftware\u2019s offerings, but we mainly recommend it because it\u2019s the best indication of how Elden Ring will perform on PS5 and Xbox Series X - with some of these features and modes hopefully making their way to Elden Ring. If nothing else, it's the nicest-looking version of this type of game you'll find anywhere right now.",
    "Some might think it's sacrilege to include games inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s legendarium in this list. But Tolkien and George R.R. Martin are considered two of the best fantasy writers of all time, even if the tone of their work varies wildly, so we make no apologies. If you're into dark fantasy games generally, you should check out the Middle-Earth games.",
    "Neither Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor nor Shadow or War focus on Bilbo Baggins or that troublesome ring. Instead, the games take place between The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings, and focuses on Talion, a Gondorian Ranger, who teams up with the wraith of an Elf Lord to avenge their loved ones. They're more Assassin's Creed-like open world games than Souls-like dungeon crawlers, but the superficial similarities in art style should impress anyone who's excited about Elden Ring.",
    "The Middle-Earth games tap into the overarching lore of Tolkien's work, offering a familiar setting, but developer Monolith fleshes this lore out with one of the best combat systems in modern gaming: the Nemesis system. The Nemesis system is an AI-controlled system that sees each Orc you kill being replaced by one of lower rank, while those that manage to kill you are rewarded with a promotion and an ability to sense your weaknesses. It\u2019s an extremely dynamic system that makes Middle-Earth's Orc army almost a living and breathing entity - and often a bit of a pain to deal with.",
    "Hollow Knight is quietly one of the best Soulslike games around, making it a perfect game to play while waiting for Elden Ring. Hollow Knight boasts a dark, atmospheric world, brooding enemies and strategic boss fights, making this indie platformer a much more challenging experience than you might expect. But, like many Soulslike games, that feeling when you finally take down a tough boss is euphoric.",
    "Nioh is one of myriad titles that takes Souls-style combat, of creeping through haunted-seeming locations and battling tough monsters with an emphasis on stamina management, and transports the gameplay - this time to the Sengoku period of Japan (well, a magical realism take on it).",
    "This isn\u2019t just a Dark Souls clone though, as there are some features which really transform the Soulsian mechanics. There\u2019s a much bigger focus on looting gear and swapping out your equipment, From Software\u2019s typical open world is swapped out for a linear experience, and different \u2018stances\u2019 let you choose the speed of play - this latter trait makes Nioh\u2019s combat much quicker.",
    "This game came out when Dark Souls titles were still in their \u2018slow, tactical gameplay\u2019 phase but with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, From Software has introduced much faster fighting into its titles, and according to Elden Ring interviews, that game will be even quicker-paced. So of all the Soulsian games not developed by FromSoftware, this could be the most similar to the upcoming one.",
    "Want to remind yourself why George R.R. Martin is one of the best fantasy authors around? Then it\u2019s worth playing the Telltale Games\u2019 episodic Game of Thrones series. Sure, Martin didn\u2019t write the dialogue in the episodes, but he did create the entire world on which the game is based - so it\u2019s a must-play for those who want to soak themselves in more Game of Thrones lore before moving on to Martin\u2019s next project.",
    "Like all Telltale games, don\u2019t expect a whole lot of action in this one, it\u2019s primarily narrative-driven with your choices affecting how the story plays out. It can be a bit slow at times but the intertwining of various iconic character\u2019s stories and the ability to cuss out Ramsay Snow pretty much makes up for that.",
    "Of all the Souls-like games on the market, arguably the most similar to that text-book is actually a mobile game: Pascal\u2019s Wager (well, it\u2019s also available on Steam, but launched first on phones).",
    "Pascal\u2019s Wager borrows heavily from From Software\u2019s playbook, both in terms of combat (dodging and rolling, knowing when to strike and when to back away, and managing stamina as you fight and explore creepy towns) and tone (you\u2019re in a mysterious semi-inhabited land, you need to maintain your sanity, everything has a strong Victorian-Gothic character).",
    "It\u2019s perhaps not the best Souls-clone on the market, and it doesn\u2019t add anything to the established formula like Deck 13\u2019s games or the Nioh series did, but the fact you\u2019re playing a detailed 3D game on your mobile balances that out. Plus, compared to some other titles, it\u2019s not brought up in conversations surrounding Dark Souls or Elden Ring too much, so there\u2019s a good chance it flew under your radar."
