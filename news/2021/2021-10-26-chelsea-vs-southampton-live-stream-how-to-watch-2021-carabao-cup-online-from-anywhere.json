And they meet again today with an EFL Cup quarter-final place at stake. Here's how to watch a Chelsea vs Southampton live stream and catch all the action from the Carabao Cup from wherever you are on Earth.",
    "Chelsea may have won 7-0 at the weekend, but it's their defence that has been their shining light, keeping clean sheets and grabbing crucial goals to bail out an oddly out of step forward line.",

    "Southampton just can't seem to get the ball in the back of the net on a consistent basis. Eight of the 18 goals they've scored came in one game, though the fact that that was a Carabao Cup tie is certainly a positive omen.",
    "Here's how to watch a Chelsea vs Southampton live stream today from anywhere in the world.",
    "We've set out below all the ways you can watch Carabao Cup action in a number of countries around the world. However, if you're away travelling for work or pleasure, you probably won't be able to tune in like you normally would at home.",
