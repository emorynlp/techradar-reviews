    "The best backpack is going to offer you comfort and utility while also complementing you personal style. As such, there are as many kinds of backpacks out there are there are needs, budgets, and styles.",
    "So which is the best backpack for you? That obviously depends on your needs and style. If you're looking for a more subtle style with excellent capacity, a Lo & Sons backpack might serve you well, while a Hex backpack might better serve those who need organization more than capacity.",
    "Whatever your situation and budget, we've looked over some of the best backpacks out there and brought our favorites together to help you find the right backpack for your needs and budget.",
    "The North St. Belmont is one of our favorite backpacks for the diversity of color and material options, but it has a lot more going for it than just its style. The interior compartment features a water-resistant material that will hold up against even the hardest downpours, and which also features a pair of velcro strips for optional compartment attachments that add some versatility and customization options.",
    "The compartment can also fit up to a 15-inch laptop comfortably, though we managed to squeeze in a 17-inch laptop as well, but the fit isn't as great.",
    "The backpacks are made by hand in Portland, Oregon, so these run a bit on the expensive side, especially considering that beyond the main compartment there is only a front pocket and two side pockets by default, none of which have the same water-resistant lining as the main compartment. Still, if you're looking for a light-duty commuting option with some great style and protection from the elements, then the North St. Belmont is one of the best backpacks you're going to find.",

    "Lo & Sons is known for making high quality, classic-looking bags of all kinds, and the Hanover Deluxe 2 definitely keeps this tradition alive. The back laptop compartment is roomy and well protected, and can fit up to a 15-inch laptop.",
    "If you've got a bigger laptop though, we were able to fit a couple of 17.3-inch laptops in the main compartment fairly easily, and the removeable foam insert even helped us keep things nice and organized as well.",
    "Fortunately, the padded straps are very comfortable on a long commute and the construction is solid enough to throw around a bit without worrying about sullying the pristine look of the backpack.",
    "We didn't throw it around too much though, since this is not a cheap backpack by any means, so you'll want to take better care of it than your throwaway backpack from high school.",
    "And while it does have some water-resistant construction, it isn't waterproof, so definitely make sure one of those convenient side pockets is holding an umbrella if the weather looks particularly iffy.",

    "The Everlane ReNew Transit is the best backpack we've tested if you're looking for something with more of a couture feel while keeping things functional for your commute.",
    "With a capacity of 27L, it's surprisingly spacious, with plenty of room for a 15-inch laptop, a change of clothes for the gym, work materials, and even a bento box or similar container for your lunch.",
    "The straps also offer a good degree of comfort for a bag that has more style than most commuter backpacks. Best of all, the Everlane ReNew Transit comes in at just $75, making it one of the cheapest backpacks we've tested, making it very easy to recommend for just about anybody.",
    "If capacity isn't your biggest concern, and you just need a backpack that can hold your Ultrabook and some daily essentials, the Able Carry Thirteen Daybag should be at the top of your list.",
    "Not only is it incredibly light on its own, but it has some nicely padded straps, which makes it extremely comfortable no matter how much stuff you stuff in it. Plus there are plenty of pockets, so you can keep things separate. There's a main compartment for your laptop and other such items, a back hidden compartment where you can put your wallet if you don't have pockets or don't want to carry your purse, and a pocket on the front where you can store stuff that you need quick access to.",
    "Plus, the laptop pocket itself is nicely lined with this soft fur-like material that means your laptop isn't going to get scratched, even if your bag gets tossed around a bit while you're moving around the city.",
    "It is limited to 14-inch laptops, though, so creatives with beefy 15-inch devices may want to look elsewhere.",
    "If you ever need to go from work to the nearest hiking trail, the Lo & Sons Hakuba backpack might be just what you're looking for.",
    "Easily the best backpack for a versatile transition from work to play (or more work in the gym), the Hakuba features a huge interior compartment with organizing insert, expandable water bottle pocket on the side, and a separate shoe compartment on the bottom to keep sweaty gym shoes and clothes apart from important work materials.",
    "Like most other Lo & Sons products though, your color options are somewhat limited, though if you've ever wanted a navy blue camo backpack, Lo & Sons has you covered. While not the cheapest backpack going, you can still get a good deal with the occasional sale on the Lo & Sons website.",
    "The Solo NY Grand Travel TSA backpack isn't going to appear on a fashion runway anytime soon, but that's fine, since this backpack is meant for another kind of runway.",
    "Designed to make travel easier than ever, this backpack has a TSA-friendly design for faster opening and access to clear an airport checkpoint faster, while also featuring interior compression straps to make for tighter packing when you're on the road for work.",
    "The 17.3-inch laptop sleeve is also one of the largest we've come across, so if you've got a beast of a mobile workstation, this bag can more than accommodate it.",
    "The Hex Technical Backpack lives up to its name with an extensive number of compartments to store everything from hard drives to battery packs, including a top pocket for a wireless charging pack (Hex wireless power bank sold separately), though other wireless charging packs will fit as well, making it an excellent companion for traveling or long commutes when you might need some extra juice for a phone of tablet.",
    "The number of compartments and organizing pockets is also impressive, though the actual interior compartment capacity is less so, coming in at just 17.5L. This can still hold the essentials, including a 16-inch laptop, but you'll need to use the space efficiently if you're going on a longer trip.",
    "Fortunately, the material construction is very durable and features an antimicrobial exterior shell, so you don't need to worry too much about what it's picking up from sitting on the floor of a bus terminal or subway car.",

    "The Able Carry Max lives up to its name with a huge 25L main compartment and a sizeable secondary 5L compartment for extra storage and a back compartment that can fit a 17-inch laptop comfortably.",
    "The back panel also features a ventilated design to keep things cool on the go, while thick padded straps help keep you comfortable on a long commute or cross country trip.",
    "That said, the additional pockets aren't as plentiful as we'd have liked on a bag this expensive, but the durable, tear-resistant materials at least means that this investment is likely to last a very long time."
