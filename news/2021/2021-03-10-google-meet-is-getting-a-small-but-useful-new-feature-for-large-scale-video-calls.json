    "Back in November of last year, Google added the ability to create up to 100 different breakout rooms per call in Meet.",
    "However, deciding who goes into which breakout room and setting them all up can take up valuable time, so for this reason, the company is now rolling out a new feature that will let users setup breakout rooms before starting a meeting.",
