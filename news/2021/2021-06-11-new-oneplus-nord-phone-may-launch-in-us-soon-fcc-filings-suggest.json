    "A new OnePlus phone might be released in the US soon, as two unnamed devices have been certified by the FCC. Could these be versions of the OnePlus Nord N200 5G?",
    "TechRadar first confirmed from OnePlus CEO Pete Lau that the N200 5G would be coming exclusively to the US and Canada. The phone would launch a bit later than the OnePlus Nord CE 5G\u2019s June 10 release date, Lau said \u2013 meaning a forthcoming launch of these two mystery phones lines up with the N200 5G\u2019s launch window.",
    "The two phones approved by the FCC only have model numbers, DE2118 and DE2117, which could represent the T-Mobile and unlocked versions, theorized PhoneArena, which first noticed the filings. The site further pointed out that the phones were likely distinct from the earlier Nord N10 and N100 phones, which used a BE prefix for their model numbers; no OnePlus phone has used a DE prefix before.",
    "Given the just-released OnePlus Nord CE 5G was confirmed not to come to the US, we can reasonably expect that these FCC-approved models don\u2019t refer to that phone. The Nord CE \u2013 for \u2018Core Edition\u2019 \u2013 is a version of last year\u2019s OnePlus Nord that\u2019s stripped away a few features for more affordability, OnePlus confirmed to TechRadar ahead of its release.",
    "Nor do we suspect the FCC-approved phones to be the OnePlus 9T and 9T Pro, which we expect later in the year when the T-series OnePlus flagship phones typically launch. Thus, the OnePlus Nord N200 is a good guess, but we\u2019ll wait to hear more about an upcoming US release."
