    "Update: My mom got her Facebook account back. Shortly after tweeting this article at the @fbsecurity account, Facebook security personnel reached out to me and, after an investigation of the account and some back-and-forth, reset the account (and we immediately set up 2FA).",
    "I am relieved, and overjoyed that my mom's memories and pandemic social life have been restored to her \u2013 but I'm still frustrated at the lengths it took to restore her account. Most people don't have this platform to make a plea to Facebook nor have their tweets noticed by Facebook personnel; indeed, multiple people replied on Twitter or emailed me to express that they, too, were failed by Facebook's internal account recovery tools and feel abandoned by a platform they've spent years on.",
    "I asked the Facebook security contact who helped me what these people should do, and reached out to Facebook's press account \u2013 neither responded with a helpful answer. Should they just tweet at @fbsecurity in hopes that someone will take an interest in their plight? I wish I had a real answer. If I get one, I'll post it here.",
    "In the meantime, I'll leave the article below as a warning: help your parents and loved ones set up 2FA before their online lives are lost.",
    "In the middle of June, someone stole my mom\u2019s Facebook account. She asked me for help, and with so many other fires to put out \u2013 gadgets to review, articles to write, dinner to make, pets to take care of, a bachelor party to plan \u2013 it fell by the wayside. But now that Facebook has radically limited its account recovery process, there\u2019s no way to get it back. A decade of my mom\u2019s digital life is gone.",
    "Like a bit under three billion people around the world, my mom has stored some of her life on Facebook \u2013 mostly in photos of vacations and milestones, but also in the web of people she\u2019s kept up with over the years on the most popular social network on the planet. It\u2019s her only link with many of these folks, and in an ordinary year, losing these connections would be devastating.",
    "But it\u2019s been far from an ordinary year: like others in their 60s, my mom has kept at home, and Facebook has been her only lifeline to the outside world. The pandemic has ripped away our social lives, and we\u2019ve turned to online alternatives \u2013 but for many older individuals, Facebook is the only place to go. And as things tenuously start to open up, her network of associations and groups is all on Facebook, planning without her.",
    "She didn\u2019t have 2-factor authorization on her account \u2013 she struggles to remember her passwords as it is. She could have clicked the email alert notifying her that her Facebook account\u2019s password had changed \u2013 but she didn\u2019t, figuring it was a phishing scam. We\u2019ve been trained to watch out for unofficial messages so well that we can barely tell when it\u2019s the real thing.",
    "And thanks to the way Facebook has set up password recovery, with no customer service contact to reach out to \u2013 no human being to reason with, no authority to make our case \u2013 all those memories and networks are gone.",
    "If you search \u2018Facebook account recovery\u2019 on Google, you\u2019ll find half a dozen methods, because Facebook has changed their process so many times over the years. It makes sense \u2013 as the social network got bigger and instituted more complex security methods, scammers got more sophisticated in their ways to steal accounts.",
    "That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see online (and perhaps remember) some methods to recover your account, like having your friends report it was hacked. Some recourse, some method. But now, if someone else got into your account and changed the password and recovery email, you\u2019re done. The account is gone. Because, for all that Facebook calls it a \u2018Help Center,\u2019 it only offers one route to reset the password: send it to the email address on file.",
    "Y\u2019know, the one changed to the hacker\u2019s email address.",
    "There was a brief window to contest the password change: if we\u2019d clicked on the possibly-phishing email, there\u2019s a now-expired link to tell Facebook that this was a hack. But there\u2019s nobody to make our case to, now. The hacker has the last decade of my mom\u2019s digital life. And access to all the accounts she signed up with using Facebook \u2013 y\u2019know, like Facebook encourages.",
    "Former baseball pitcher Vernon Law might have said it best: \u201cExperience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards.\u201d While the lesson here is obviously to add 2-factor authentication to everything, it\u2019s also that you need to do this for your parents and grandparents, too. We\u2019ve entered an age where their digital lives \u2013 not just financial but social \u2013 need to be safeguarded.",
    "Most of them probably won\u2019t make the jump to the next Facebook, if there is one. Their friends are on one social network, and so is their digital history. They\u2019ve settled in. They\u2019re (digitally) home.",
    "Like any human being on the planet, they won\u2019t want to go through even more hassle to get into their accounts. Tough. Download a free Authenticator mobile app (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy) and load Facebook into it or set up a security key. Make them open their phone to authenticate every time they want to idly scroll their timeline and comment on posts. Have them change their password at the first whiff of strange activity.",
    "Because if you don\u2019t, and a hacker locks them out, you won\u2019t have much recourse beyond tweeting desperately at any Facebook-related account. Or writing a blog pleading for Facebook to listen.",
    "So that\u2019s it, Facebook \u2013 I\u2019m begging you to reach out to me on Twitter or over email [david(dot)lumb@futurenet.com] to get my mom\u2019s Facebook back. I promise I\u2019ll turn 2-factor authorization on the second she\u2019s in."
