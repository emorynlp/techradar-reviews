    "Raya and the Last Dragon is an animated Disney movie with plenty to say. In a world where scepticism and division have been rife in recent years, the film's exploration of trust, unity and friendship has never felt more pressing.",
    "Vital as it is for any film to broach such themes, however, it's Raya's approach to (and examination of) representation and inclusion that stands it out from its contemporaries.",
    "With Disney taking steps to address its controversial past regarding racial stereotypes, Raya and the Last Dragon feels like a step in the right direction, and the significance of putting diversity front and center of the studio's latest animated flick isn't lost on the film's crew.",
    "Ahead of Raya's initial Disney Plus Premier Access launch back in March (the movie is now available to all Disney Plus subscribers), TechRadar sat down with the film's Head of Story Fawn Veerasunthorn and Disney environment modeler Liza Rhea to discuss how Raya reflects Disney's progression towards becoming a more inclusive studio.",
    "We also talked about how the movie's cast helped with the push towards greater representation and the difficulties of making a film during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "Raya and the Last Dragon follows Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), a warrior on a quest to find the last living Dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) after a cataclysmic event occurs. The Druun \u2013 a mindless, evil plague born from negativity \u2013 has wiped out large swathes of Kumandra\u2019s human population, and it\u2019s up to Raya to find Sisu and destroy the Druun threat for good.",
    "Doing so won\u2019t be easy. Sisu\u2019s Dragon Gem \u2013 a magical stone that ended the Druun\u2019s first attack 500 years earlier \u2013 was destroyed during a mass altercation between Kumandra\u2019s warring factions, and it's up to Raya to repair the gem and restore peace to her world.",
    "The plot of Disney\u2019s latest movie may be one built around working together to achieve a common goal, but little did the film\u2019s 900-strong crew know that its themes would soon cross over into the real world.",
    "At the height of Raya's production in March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic struck. With the team now forced to finish development remotely, numerous problems emerged. Equipment had to be sourced and delivered to over 400 homes, internet issues needed addressing, workflows and pipelines were altered and spontaneous visits to people\u2019s offices were no more.",
    "In Veerasunthorn and Rhea's cases, though, those issues paled in comparison to a much bigger problem \u2013 family.",
    "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges was the work-life balance,\u201d Veerasunthorn says. \u201cSuddenly, the schools closed so I had a child \u2013 who had been in pre-school \u2013 who was home all of the time and running around. She had to come to the meetings [about Raya's production] as there were no other options.\u201d",
    "\u201cI was five-and-a-half months pregnant when lockdown happened,\u201d Rhea adds. \u201cI was concerned with how I would work ergonomically from home. But Disney worked so quickly to get us everything we needed. It was something we had to quickly figure out. \u2018When could we do the work?\u2019 and \u2018When can we meet?\u2019, but there was a lot of wiggle room with figuring out how to get that up and running again.\u201d",
    "Pre-pandemic, the biggest challenge that the Raya team faced was authentically recreating a world region often overlooked in mainstream popular culture \u2013 Southeast Asia, which Disney was yet to explore in great detail in its movies.",
    "While the film is set in the fictional land of Kumandra, paying tribute to the variety of real world cultures and traditions in Southeast Asia was a key goal throughout production.",
    "In order to accurately portray Southeast Asia\u2019s heritage and lifestyles on screen, the Raya team comprised Disney employees with ties to the region and experts from different real-world nations.",
    "Thai-born Veerasunthorn, alongside screenwriters Adele Lim and Qui Nguyen, whose roots reside in Malaysia and Vietnam respectively, provided insight into the movie\u2019s many details. Disney\u2019s Southeast Story Trust \u2013 composed of leading academics headed up by Lao visual anthropologist Steve Arounsack \u2013 also ensured that details including costumes, food items, combat styles, and Southeast Asia's tradition of strong female leaders were faithfully recreated.",
    "The pressure to authentically represent hers and other cultures, in Veerasunthorn\u2019s opinion, was evident from the beginning. Still, an overall sense of motivation to provide true Southeast Asian representation eventually trumped any worries that she had.",
    "\u201cThere are lots of ways of life that overlap between different cultures in this region,\u201d Veerasunthorn explains. \u201cThe close proximity to the water and its importance in our rituals, the awareness and respect for the invisible world, and the importance of family and respect for your elders. This will be the first time I\u2019ve ever seen my culture portrayed on this scale before, so there\u2019s a need for doing it right. When you think of Asian representation, people think of East Asia. I think this film will be able to show that there are different, diverse and beautiful cultures within the continent.\u201d",
    "For team members without those experiences, research trips (taken before the pandemic hit) to nations including Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia helped to immerse them in different cultures. Communication between Raya\u2019s Southeast Asian consultants and the film\u2019s many departments, such as modeling and animation, was also vital to ensure that Kumandra\u2019s environments, architecture and inhabitants were accurately realized.",
    "\u201cEven though it is a fantasy adventure film, you can really feel them [Southeast Asian cultures] in the environments and artwork,\u201d Rhea said. \u201cAs modelers, we worked closely with the art director (David Wormsley) and visual effects team, and we have a library of photos and videos to look at and really get ourselves in that headspace. I think when people see the film, they\u2019ll see the environments are so rich with inspiration from Southeast Asian cultures.\u201d",
    "Given the distinctions between Southeast Asia's nations and cultures, it was crucial that each was uniquely represented. Kumandra's five lands \u2013 Heart, Talon, Fang, Spine and Tail \u2013 were all given their own personalities and aesthetics to provide them with individual identities, and tie back into the movie's aim of inclusion and diversity.",
    "Whilst each land's environments differed in style and tone, there is one constant throughout that harks back to a universal Southeast Asian heritage \u2013 the prominent role that water plays in the region.",
    "With Sisu modeled on Southeast Asia\u2019s serpentine Naga dragons, and water\u2019s historical context in its culture, Rhea\u2019s experiences of working on another water-based movie \u2013 Frozen 2 \u2013 helped to create the right surroundings for Raya\u2019s aquatic sequences.",
    "\u201cOur departments are broken up into modeling and effects, and the latter are the ones who handle all of the water,\u201d Rhea says. \u201cThey also handled that for Raya, but we [the modeling team] had to create the world for the water to flow into, so it is a lot of back and forth and collaboration working with those departments.\u201d",
    "Selecting the right actors for Raya's various roles was equally important from a representation standpoint. Character whitewashing has become a hugely controversial topic within the film industry and, only recently, Marvel Studios (a subsidiary of Disney) admitted its regret over casting a white actor \u2013 Tilda Swinton \u2013 as The Ancient One, an individual of Himilayan descent, in 2016's Doctor Strange.",
    "As Disney continues to wrestle with, acknowledge and address its own contentious history with cultural stereotypes, Raya's predominantly Asian cast feels like a step in the right direction \u2013 even though the movie has drawn criticism from some quarters for its lack of Southeast Asian actor representation.",
    "Disney, then, still has some way to go with rectifying such issues. Where the studio excels, though, is creating believable and relatable relationships between its movies' various protagonists. In Raya and Sisu, Disney's latest animated feature has two such individuals who are brought to life in stellar fashion by their voice actors.",
    "\u201cEvery time Awkwafina recorded I couldn\u2019t wait to hear what she brought,\u201d Veerasunthorn says. \u201cSometimes she would adlib and the directors would encourage that. And, for Kelly, I think there\u2019s a subtlety in her acting that comes across as a warrior and a very likable person that you want to get to know. You want to show strength but not in a way that\u2019s stoic or serious. I think Kelly really brought a good balance to her.\u201d",
    "Raya and the Last Dragon has plenty of traditional Disney characteristics, but perhaps its most surprising exclusion is sing-along tunes. As good as James Newton Howard\u2019s moving score is, some fans may be disappointed that Raya\u2019s cast doesn\u2019t regularly break into song. Veerasunthorn reveals, however, that this was never the plan.",
    "\u201cIt didn\u2019t start as a musical to begin with,\u201d she explains. \u201cOur directors were intent on trying to make something contemporary, so we had to use split-screen, quick cuts, and comedy that the team really enjoys. It was cool that we had a film that looks like a historical period piece. The story is classical but still has all the heart and fun of Disney.\u201d",
    "Raya and the Last Dragon represents an important step forward for Disney. It isn't the first of its many movies to begin delivering on its promise for greater representation, but it's one that celebrates the originality and uniqueness of Southeast Asia in such vivid detail.",
    "With its Stories Matter program leading the charge in redefining how The Walt Disney Company reflects the world around it, we should see a more diverse lineup of Disney films in the future. Providing a space for stories to be told about different cultures and world regions is imperative in the present day, and it's a hope that many viewers hope that Disney follows through on.",
    "\u201cWe knew that we wanted to make our film a contemporary subject so that the audiences of today can enjoy it,\u201d Veerasunthorn explains. \u201cBut we also want people to have a conversation with their family members about these topics [surrounding diversity and inclusion]. As filmmakers, we\u2019re aware that we should put that into the film, not just for specificity but for authenticity for the audience in those region, too.\"",
    "Raya and the Last Dragon is now available to stream for everyone on Disney Plus."
