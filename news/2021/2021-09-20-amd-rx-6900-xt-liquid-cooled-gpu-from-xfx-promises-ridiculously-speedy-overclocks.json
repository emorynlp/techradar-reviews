  "summary": "XFX claims 3GHz and more is achievable",
  "article": [
    "XFX has officially launched a new RX 6900 XT graphics card which the firm claims is capable of being pushed to 3GHz plus when overclocked, reaching new heights for the performance of this beefy flagship Big Navi GPU, and indeed offering the \u201chighest overclocking potential available today for any Radeon RX GPU\u201d, as the maker observes.",
    "So, this is a high-end 6900 XT running the Navi 21 XTXH GPU and as you might expect, it comes complete with a very serious cooling setup, namely liquid cooling with a custom-designed EK water block.",
    "The maker notes: \u201cThe base of the [water block] is CNC-machined out of nickel-plated high-grade copper, while its top is CNC-machined out of glass-like cast Acrylic. The watertight sealing is ensured by high-quality EPDM O-rings, while brass standoffs are already pre-installed and allow for a safe and easy installation procedure.\u201d",
    "The XFX Radeon RX 6900 XT Zero WB (WaterBlock Limited Edition) will come running at defaults of 2,375MHz for the standard game clock speed, with boost to 2,525MHz, but as mentioned, keen overclockers \u2013 the target audience of enthusiasts for this card \u2013 will be able to crank speeds up to 3GHz and even beyond, according to XFX.",
    "XFX further notes that there\u2019s a 14+2 phase power design with a larger V-Core than AMD\u2019s reference spec to better distribute power across more VRMs, meaning in short more stability and headroom for overclocking.",
    "The card also features fully addressable RGB lighting \u2013 well, where would we be without the obligatory \u2018go faster\u2019 lights to underline the performance on offer?",
    "This certainly looks like another impressive step forward for the 6900 XT flagship, overtaking the likes of the PowerColor RX 6900 XT Red Devil Ultimate which we saw come out earlier this year, being capable of a 2,850MHz overclock. This new XFX graphics card is unlocked to be pushed past the 3GHz cap which was in place when that PowerColor product was released.",
    "Of course, you\u2019ll need a fair old rig to put this mighty XFX graphics card inside, and it will require 3 x 8-pin power connectors, and in excess of 350W of power consumption when this card has the pedal to the overclocking metal. What isn\u2019t clear is how long boosts of 3GHz or over might be realistically maintained with XFX\u2019s RX 6900 XT Zero WB.",
    "What sort of power supply does your PC need to run this card, then? XFX states a minimum of an 850W PSU, but if you\u2019re serious about overclocking \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, surely that\u2019ll be everyone who buys this product \u2013 then you\u2019ll need some headroom for stability. Remember, 850W is just the minimum, and XFX actually recommends going for the 1,000W unit if you\u2019re buying a PSU from its own range. So that gives you a better idea of what we\u2019re looking at here: a 1,000W PSU, or maybe more for safety\u2019s sake.",
    "The other consideration here is the pricing, which XFX is still yet to reveal \u2013 we should know that imminently, when the card goes on sale, presumably following shortly after this official launch.",
    "Given that this is the fastest Big Navi card on the block (water block even), you can expect to pay a hefty premium on top of the price tag for a \u2018bog standard\u2019 6900 XT (which is already seriously expensive). So, only fat wallets need apply, but that\u2019s hardly a surprise when we\u2019re talking about a liquid cooled top dog offering for a flagship GPU.",
