  "article": [
    "Trade disputes? Midi-chlorians? Whiny teen romance? A Star Wars fan craves not these things. Nonetheless, that\u2019s what George Lucas gave them when he unleashed his divisive prequel trilogy on the world \u2013 though it soon turned out he hadn\u2019t entirely forgotten about the adventure and excitement that made a generation fall in love with a certain galaxy far, far away\u2026.",
    "First released on the Cartoon Network in 2003, the original, 2D Clone Wars cartoon was Star Wars with the talky bits surgically removed. Set just after Attack of the Clones had kickstarted the galactic conflict that would subsequently conclude in 2005\u2019s Revenge of the Sith, it was our first proper glimpse of the skirmish Obi-Wan Kenobi had teased in A New Hope.",
    "And even though the first run of episodes clocked in at just three minutes apiece, you rarely felt short-changed on the storytelling front \u2013 it was like watching Star Wars on fast forward. The contrast with the often-ponderous prequel movies couldn\u2019t have been starker.",
    "For its first animated Star Wars show since \u201980s spin-offs Droids and Ewoks, Lucasfilm turned to Genndy Tartakovsky. At that point the animator was already hot property, best known for his work on Cartoon Network hits Dexter\u2019s Laboratory and Samurai Jack \u2013 he\u2019d later go on to direct the Hotel Transylvania movies, and help future The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau storyboard action sequences in Iron Man 2.",
    "Tartakovsky brought an entirely new aesthetic to the Star Wars galaxy. While the characters, creatures and spaceships were mostly lifted from the movies, he gave them a highly stylized, angular look heavily influenced by anime. And \u2013 much like JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson and Favreau himself a decade later \u2013 he was given license to reimagine Star Wars with the eyes of a fan, in a way the franchise\u2019s creator, Lucas, never could. The result was a blur of whirling lightsabers and blaster fire, that also managed to push the boundaries of physics like a Looney Tunes cartoon.",
    "While the Expanded Universe that existed beyond the Star Wars movies was nowhere near as vast, prominent or complex as it is now, Tartakovsky\u2019s show displayed considerable understanding \u2013 and affection for \u2013 what had come before. One episode, for example, showcased an army of IG assassin droids jetting into battle, while another featured Ortolans, the blue elephant-like race that counts Max Rebo (of Jabba\u2019s house band fame) as a member.",
    "There were also casual references to key Star Wars locations like Dantooine and the fourth moon of Yavin, authentic sound effects, and fun in-jokes \u2013 the look of Muunilinst, home of the Intergalactic Banking Clan, was inspired by the US dollar bill.",
    "Jedi who had previously been little more than faces in the council chamber on Coruscant suddenly got the chance to lead their own episodes. The amphibious Kit Fisto memorably headed underwater to settle a dispute between the Mon Calamari and trident-wielding Quarren on Mon Cala \u2013 it was like watching Aquaman 15 years early.",
    "And proving that Clone Wars was never regarded as a throwaway kids\u2019 show, it was notable for introducing key elements of Star Wars lore, such as Anakin Skywalker's ascension to the rank of Jedi Knight, or the first screen appearance of lightsaber-powering kyber crystals. Episode III villain General Grievous (originally voiced by Futurama\u2019s John DiMaggio) made his debut in the cartoon as Count Dooku\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, alongside wannabe Sith (and future fan favorite) Asajj Ventress. And even though conversation was never a priority, Clone Wars still found time to develop Anakin\u2019s secret relationship with Padme, or Palpatine\u2019s Machiavellian scheming \u2013 especially in a third season that upped each episode\u2019s runtime to 12 minutes.",
    "According to animator Bryan Andrews, one of Lucas\u2019s directives was that \u201cwe want you to animate the opening crawl [for Revenge of the Sith]\u201d. Clone Wars delivered on that front, too, culminating with Palpatine being captured by Grievous, and a space battle brewing in the skies above Coruscant. With a total duration of two hours, the 25 instalments of the Clone Wars added up to Episode 2.5 in all but name.",
    "Finally, after a long period in the wilderness \u2013 the series was available in unauthorized form on YouTube, and via used DVDs on eBay \u2013 Disney Plus is rolling the show out on April 2, 2021, giving all Star Wars fans a chance to watch it at their leisure.",
    "After the show finished its all-too-brief run in 2005, its thunder was subsequently stolen by a CG-animated namesake that ran for seven seasons (from 2008), and became as integral to official Star Wars continuity as the movies. Soon after Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012, Tartakovsky\u2019s show joined Ewoks, Droids, Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure and numerous Expanded Universe novels and comics in the Star Wars Legends range of stories that are no longer considered canon.",
    "Even so, the 2D Clone Wars\u2019 fire hasn\u2019t gone out of the universe entirely. While the CG version of The Clone Wars largely rewrote Anakin and Obi-Wan\u2019s adventures between Episodes II and III, showrunner Dave Filoni (now a key player on The Mandalorian and spin-offs like Ahsoka) was clearly heavily influenced by Tartakovsky\u2019s take on Star Wars. Familiar storylines \u2013 like aforementioned Mon Calamari/Quarren tiff on Mon Cala \u2013 are reimagined, while characters who first came to prominence in the earlier cartoon (such as Ventress or Jedi Padawan Barris Offee) received meaty story arcs. There are also clear echoes in the character design.",
    "The CG Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars Resistance may have dipped deeper into Star Wars lore, but it\u2019s unlikely any of Lucasfilm\u2019s more recent animated shows would have had the chance to plug the gaps between the movies had Tartakovsky\u2019s turbo-charged cartoon not blazed a trail first. Clone Wars deserves to be a series long remembered, and is more than worthy of its newfound place on Disney Plus. It may no longer be canon, but it\u2019s not like putting the infamous Star Wars: Holiday Special up there, is it?",
    "Both volumes of Star Wars: Clone Wars will release on Disney Plus on April 2."
