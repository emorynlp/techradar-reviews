    "Ever left the house in a hurry, only to get a sinking feeling a little while later - you've left the coffee maker, radio, hair straighteners, or even your favorite lamp switched on? Chances are heading back to switch off the offending item isn\u2019t viable - so what can you do?",
    "This is where the best smart plugs come in as they allow you to power an outlet on or off from your smartphone, even when you\u2019re not at home. So rather than wasting hours returning home, just take your smartphone and in a few taps you\u2019ll be able to turn off a device you\u2019ve left switched on.",
    "However, if you\u2019re not entirely sure how these smart home devices work, what you can actually do with them and how you can use them to automate your home, we\u2019re here to demystify things.",
    "Want to get your hands on the best smart plugs now? Check out these great deals for some of the best on the market.",
    "Smart plugs have grown in popularity over the past few years - according to market research firm Statistica, a fifth of US households own smart home automation devices including smart plugs. It\u2019s not hard to see why as these are some of the most affordable and easiest ways to start your smart home journey, and subsequently make your life easier.",
    "There are two types of smart plug available; the simplest and most common versions plug into an existing power outlet, with everyone from Amazon and Philips Hue to We-Mo and even IKEA producing this kind of smart plug.",
    "Alternatively, you can get smart outlets that can be installed in place of your existing power outlet, from brands such as TP-Link. However, you\u2019ll need to access your home\u2019s wiring to replace these, which will mean calling in a professional and is likely to result in the wall around the socket needing a paint touch-up. The upheaval, and expense this will cause, could mean this isn\u2019t the option for you.",
    "Just like the best smart lights and other smart home devices, whichever type of smart plug you plump for, they\u2019ll use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to connect to your smartphone and allow you to control the plug from an app.",
    "Bluetooth smart plugs are the simplest to connect, but unlike those that connect using Wi-Fi, they can\u2019t be easily controlled when you\u2019re away from home.",
    "This is because they require a hub, sometimes also called a bridge, which relays commands from your smartphone to the cloud and back to the smart plug.",
    "These hubs are usually manufactured by the band itself, for example, the Philips Hue Bridge which can be used with Philips smart plugs and its Hue smart lights. However, if you use Apple devices such as an iPhone or iPad and have chosen to use Apple\u2019s HomeKit smart home ecosystem, then Apple\u2019s HomePod Mini or an Apple TV 4K can be used as hubs to allow compatible smart plugs such as Eve Energy, to be controlled when you\u2019re not at home.",
    "As well as allowing you to switch the socket, and whatever is connected to it, on and off from your smartphone, smart plugs also let you set schedules for when the outlet will power on or off automatically. Some even keep track of how much energy the appliance connected to the plug is using.",
    "Smart plugs that use Wi-Fi don\u2019t need a hub or bridge as they have a direct connection to the internet so the commands can be relayed straight to the plug, even if you\u2019re not at home. Wi-Fi also means the smart plug can be controlled by a voice assistant too - so you can ask Alexa, Google Assistant and/or Siri to switch it on or off, once you\u2019ve used the relevant app to identify the plug. The voice assistants can also ensure the smart plug work with other smart home devices; for example switching on a radio connected to the plug when the smart lights are diamond to create the perfect wind-down atmosphere in the evenings.",
    "Not all smart lights work with all voice assistants, however, so make sure you check it will work with your current kit before you buy.",
    "With so much choice in the smart plug market, including big names such as Amazon, Philips Hue and TP-Link rubbing shoulders with the likes of Eve and WeMo, it can be hard to know which is the best smart plug for you. We\u2019ve rounded up the best from each of the big hitters to help you choose."
