  "article": [
    "If Apple releases a new Apple TV in 2021, it will very likely come with an improved remote that will offer improved Siri functionality and the one thing Apple TV owners really want: more physical buttons and fewer touchpads.",
    "There\u2019s nothing confirmed from Apple at this point, but 9to5Mac says that it has learned about the existence of the remote (codename \u2018B519\u2019) from one of its sources that will replace the \u2018B439\u2019 Siri Remote that\u2019s currently shipping with both the Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K today.",
    "Corroborating 9to5Mac\u2019s reporting, MacRumors also noted that Apple removed all mentions of the words \u201cSiri Remote\u201d from its tvOS 14.5 beta that\u2019s rolling out to developers and have replaced it with the more generic \u201cApple TV Remote\u201d verbiage.",
    "It\u2019s not much, but it could be another indication that a change is coming.",
    "So when will we see a new Apple TV remote? It\u2019s hard to say for certain, but should all the plans come together in time, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see the new hardware at the all-digital WWDC 2021 that was recently announced and out on store shelves by the end of the year.",
    "Since the launch of the Apple TV HD back in 2015, the Apple TV Remote has been a divisive subject \u2013 some reviewers and owners loved the minimalist design of it, while others (us included) had a hard time adapting to the touch-sensitive directional pad.",
    "It\u2019s unclear how much of the remote would change in the latest iteration; however, any sort of change would be a welcome one at this point.",
    "For now, we\u2019ll just have to see what June 7 \u2013 the starting day of WWDC 2021 \u2013 will bring."
