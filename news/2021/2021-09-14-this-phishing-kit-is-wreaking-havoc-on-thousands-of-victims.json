    "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a phishing kit that\u2019s being used by different threat actors to scam people around the world.",
    "Researchers at vpnMentor chanced upon two different campaigns that used slightly altered versions of the phishing kit, to target people mostly living in Israel and France.",
    "\u201cAccording to our research, the first scammer successfully collected 380 Israeli credit cards. That\u2019s a conversion rate of over 8.5% \u2013 quite an accomplishment by phishing standards,\u201d notes vpnMentor.",
    "The researchers have already notified the credit card companies, though they admit they can\u2019t yet put a number on the effectiveness of the second scam.",
    "In the first scam, the attackers masqueraded as the UPS courier services and scammed over 4400 people. While a majority were Israeli citizens, there were individuals from the US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and from all over Europe.",
    "The second scam targeted customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Bank in France, and is thought to have tricked about 1700 people.",
    "Irrespective of the impact of the scams, vpnMentor argues that the implications of the attack are far more worrying.",
    "Instead of being devised by the attackers, the researchers believe the phishing kit was probably acquired by newbie internet scammers hoping to dabble in online fraud to make a quick buck.",
    "\u201cThis is becoming an increasingly popular form of cybercrime \u2013 \u2018hobby hackers\u2019 with minimal technical experience buying easy-to-use tools like phishing kits to try out cybercrime, often just for fun,\u201d share the researchers.",
    "In fact, vpnMentor was able to discover the phishing kit only because the \u201chobby hackers\u201d were inexperienced enough to leave their database of the scammed information completely unsecured and unencrypted.",
    "While the cost of such activities may not be as high as more sophisticated, high-profile campaigns like Solarwinds, their damage can quickly add up, because of the large attack surface area."
