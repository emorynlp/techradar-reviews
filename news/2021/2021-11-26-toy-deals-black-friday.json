    "It's official - Black Friday 2021 (November 26) is here and with it we're seeing loads of Black Friday toy deals, so numerous popular toys and gifts have been discounted (for a limited time).",
    "The Black Friday deals have been a long time in the making, because some reductions started weeks in advance, but with the dark week-ender now properly here, we're seeing the bulk of the sales now.",
    "We've seen lots of Black Friday Lego deals too, if that's more your thing - we've included some sets here, but if you click that link you'll see our hub with hundreds of discounts.",
    "Now that Black Friday is here, there are no more toy deals to wait for - we probably won't see Cyber Monday bring much - so if you see a discount that you like, it's worth pulling the metaphorical trigger on it.",
    "Whether you're looking for a birthday or Christmas gift for a loved one, or just want something for yourself (no judgment here), the Black Friday toy deals below cover loads of bases. We've got offers on Playmobil, Lego, Barbie, Sylvanian Families, Hot Wheels, branded action figures and more, so there's something for everyone across all age groups.",
    "Black Friday is the perfect time to start shopping for toys for your little one, or even for older collectors and enthusiasts \u2013 especially this year. Normally Black Friday presents a great opportunity to nab loads of toys at heavily discounted prices, often making Christmas shopping a breeze when done online, but this year may present special challenges as global supply chain shortages may make toys harder to come by. In the UK, this may be exacerbated by the Brexit-caused lorry difficulties, as the BBC reported.",
    "This year, Black Friday is taking place on November 26. In the US, it's already a busy time of year due in no small part to Thanksgiving celebrations, but both US and UK buyers should take note if they want an opportunity to make Christmas and holiday shopping as stress-free as possible.",
    "According to statistics site SpendMeNot, toys are among the most purchased items during Black Friday. That's somewhat understandable, considering the term covers a fairly broad range of items, but the site also noted that US retailer Walmart were popular with Disney's Frozen and Ryan's World toys and games.",
    "Last year's Black Friday in the UK was particularly big for Osmo and Lego toys, games and sets. The former is a relatively modern series of educational products for children, while the latter should need no introduction. We expect big discounts to continue for these brands and more during this year's Black Friday sales period.",
    "We've only seen a few deals yet, which we've listed below. Until the really outstanding deals start rolling in, we can point you to the top online retailers to look in both the US and UK to scope out the toys you'll want to pick up when they're discounted later. Here's where to look:",
    "The Osmo brand really hit its stride last year, and we expect its success to continue as it finds its way into the hands of more young learners this year. Stalwarts such as Lego, Playmobil, Star Wars, Disney and more similarly aren't going anywhere. Once again, Black Friday 2021 will be an opportune time to get your hands on toys from popular brands aimed at all ages.",
    "Toys can be tricky to research on Black Friday for the average consumer, if only for the abundance of retailers all selling the same products at varying prices. It can be hard to know which retailers are offering any given toy at the lowest price.",
    "If you're completely lost, Google Shopping is a great search engine for sifting through deals on any one toy. Here, you can compare prices and see which retailers offer the best deals, as well as availability, delivery costs and more.",
    "But you may want to buy toys earlier than later this year \u2013 the shipping shortages affecting other markets may impact toy availability as well. The UK may have it even worse, as the Brexit-caused lorry difficulties could even make it harder to get toys from ports to shop shelves, according to the BBC.",
    "Our advice: buy early, and hopefully you'll be able to get all the items on your shopping list."
