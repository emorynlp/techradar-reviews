  "article": [
    "Billions of user records, including Facebook account details, have been leaked and put on sale on a popular hacker forum, experts have warned.",
    "Analysts at CyberNews say that the database appears to include names, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII).",
    "The database has allegedly been compiled by combining 3.8 billion phone numbers from a previously scraped Clubhouse database, with the owner\u2019s Facebook profiles, making it valuable to scammers.",
    "If genuine, the database \u201ccould serve as a goldmine for scammers,\u201d opines CyberNews\u2019 senior information security researcher Mantas Sasnauskas.",
    "According to CyberNews, the compilation is an upgrade to an original scrape from breached Clubhouse servers, which only contained the phone numbers of Clubhouse users and people from their phone contact lists.",
    "While the original list wasn\u2019t of much use to scammers, the addition of the users\u2019 Facebook profiles brings a lot more contextual information about the owners of the phone numbers, including usernames, locations based on phone number suffixes, their Clubhouse network sizes, and Facebook profiles, suggests Sasnauskas.",
    "He goes on to explain that if the database is indeed genuine, the data can be used by threat actors to devise all kinds of malicious campaigns. For instance, attackers could use the info to brute force the passwords of the affected users, or perhaps even conduct targeted phishing and social engineering campaigns.",
    "The poster is reportedly asking $100,000 for the full database of 3.8 billion entries, but is open to the idea of selling the data in piecemeal fashion.",
    "Update: Clubhouse responded to our coverage with the following statement:",
    "\"There has been no breach of Clubhouse. There are a series of bots generating billions of random phone numbers. In the event that one of these random numbers happens to exist on our platform due to mathematical coincidence, Clubhouse\u2019s API returns no user identifiable information. Privacy and security are of the utmost importance to Clubhouse and we continue to invest in industry-leading security practices.\""
