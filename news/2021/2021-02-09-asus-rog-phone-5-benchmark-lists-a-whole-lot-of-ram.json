    "The Asus ROG Phone 5 (or ROG Phone 4 as it might be called) could land in the next few months, and being a gaming phone we\u2019d expect it to land with a hefty helping of RAM, but an early benchmark suggested it might just have 8GB of the stuff. Now though, another benchmark has been spotted, this time with double that amount.",
    "A Geekbench listing for an Asus phone with a model number associated with the ROG Phone 5 (and the same model number as the previous 8GB listing) this time lists 16GB of RAM.",
    "That\u2019s more what we\u2019d expect from the handset, especially as the Asus ROG Phone 3 comes with up to 16GB of RAM anyway \u2013 though there may well be an 8GB model of the ROG Phone 5 too.",
    "Both listings also mention Android 11 and a Snapdragon 888 chipset, with the latest benchmark unsurprisingly recording higher scores than the previous one.",
    "The single-core result here is 1,131, while the multi-core result is 3,729. That\u2019s up from 1,081 and 3,584 respectively on the previous benchmark, so not a huge improvement, but one that might still be noticeable in use.",
    "Of course, we\u2019d take both of these early benchmarks with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s possible that they\u2019re fake, or referring to a different Asus phone, or simply won\u2019t be representative of what the Asus ROG Phone 5 is ultimately capable of, since they\u2019re presumably running on non-final hardware.",
    "Still, elsewhere we\u2019ve heard that the Asus ROG Phone 5 will have a 6.78-inch screen, a 6,000mAh battery, 65W fast charging, and a 64MP main camera, so from what we\u2019ve heard so far it\u2019s shaping up to be an impressive handset.",
    "It\u2019s unknown exactly when the Asus ROG Phone 5 will launch, but its predecessor the ROG Phone 3 landed in July 2020, so around July of this year is our best guess for now.",
