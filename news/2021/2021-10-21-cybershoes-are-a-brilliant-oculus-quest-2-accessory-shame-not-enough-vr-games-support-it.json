  "article": [
    "Oculus Quest 2 owners can enjoy a new level of immersion, thanks to the Cybershoes peripheral now being supported by four new games. With Until You Fall, Contractors VR, Grapple Tournament from Tomorrow Games now added to the roster that means 13 VR games now work with the $349 / \u00a3349 peripheral.",
    "The Cybershoes package on Amazon includes a 360-degree swivel chair and two Cybershoes \u2013 devices that strap to your feet over your sneakers. After connecting them via Bluetooth to your headset, you can use the Cybershoes\u2019 rollers to simulate walking in VR \u2013 your movement is then translated into the game to make your digital avatar mimic you.",
    "Users have said the experience is great \u2013 and can help players enjoy immersive smooth movement without feeling motion sick \u2013 but right now support for the shoes is still a little lacking on Oculus Quest 2. We hope more developers implement support soon, otherwise, Cybershoes owners might be left feeling a little disappointed by their purchase.",
    "The Cybershoes for Oculus Quest look fantastic and exactly the sought of tool that would enhance my VR experience. We\u2019ve been playing a lot of Resident Evil 4 VR recently \u2013 and adoring every second \u2013 and the prospect of being able to actually walk around using our own movement is an enticing one.",
    "However, even with the Cybershoes, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that as Resident Evil 4 isn\u2019t one of the 13 games that is currently supported by the add-on right now.",
    "We can\u2019t really imagine many other Quest 2 players would be willing to shell out on the peripheral either. I can definitely see the appeal for PC VR players, with support for over 70 games \u2013 including blockbusters like No Man\u2019s Sky, Half-Life Alyx and Doom VFR to name just a few \u2013 meaning they\u2019d definitely get plenty of use out of them.",
    "On Oculus Quest the support is much more lacking \u2013 and that\u2019s not the only issue that might make Oculus Quest players stay away from the Cybershoes.",
    "The Oculus Quest 2 offers a relatively affordable VR experience for what you get, at its $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$479 asking price. But the Cybershoes are asking you spend the same again (and then some) for a peripheral that isn\u2019t currently usable in most games.",
    "This slowly starts to create a chicken and the egg scenario. If the Cybershoes aren\u2019t widely popular, developers might not be keen to spend time implementing them into their games. Players then don\u2019t want to pick up the shoes because support is lacking, and the cycle continues on.",
    "With PC VR players the support isn\u2019t as much of a concern, and the price may be easier to swallow too. Given that users probably have to spend around $1,000 / \u00a31,000 or more for their setup to begin with, adding a $349 / \u00a3349 peripheral doesn\u2019t seem so ludicrous.",
    "It\u2019s still fairly early days for the Cybershoes \u2013 the current model only released in May \u2013 so we can\u2019t yet pass final judgement on them, but we hope support for them grows soon on the Oculus Quest. Otherwise this might be yet another gaming peripheral that was best left on the store shelf."
