    "If you're on the hunt for an excellent early Black Friday Xbox deal, then look no further. Right now, you can pick up this Xbox Series S Fortnite and Rocket League bundle for $299 at GameStop in the US and for \u00a3249.99 at Amazon UK. (Not in the UK or US? Scroll down for deals in your region)",
    "It's worth noting that Amazon UK's bundle is only available for pre-order right now and won't be released until December 13, but GameStop's bundle is available right now. Either way, it's perfect timing for those looking for an Xbox Series S (or something for the Fortnite/Rocket League fan in your life) just in time for Christmas - especially as we don't expect to see this bundle drop further in price in further Black Friday deals.",
    "Looking for more video game deals? Then check out our dedicated Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals, PS5 Black Friday deals and Xbox Series X Black Friday deals pages.",
    "US",
    "UK",
    "So what do you get for that price tag? The bundle includes an Xbox Series S console (which alone goes for \u00a3249.99/$299), an Xbox Wireless Controller, free-to-play Fortnite and Rocket League game downloads, a high-speed HDMI cable, power cable, and two AA batteries to get you going.",
    "But, the real kicker is the Rocket League and Fortnite content that comes included. This bundle includes the Fortnite Midnight Drive Pack Set, which consists of the Dark Skully outfit, Dark Skully Satchel Back Bling, Dark Splitter pickaxe, and 1,000 V-Bucks. There's plenty of Rocket League content too, with the Purple Masamune Car, Purple Virtual Wave Boost, Purple Zefram Wheels, and 1,000 Rocket League Credits included in the bundle.",
    "It's worth noting, however, that this bundle doesn't include Fortnite: Save the World.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Xbox Series S from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
