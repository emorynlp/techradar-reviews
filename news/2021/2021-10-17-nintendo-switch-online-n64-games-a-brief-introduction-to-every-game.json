    "Nintendo Switch Online is a service that could be better. It\u2019s Nintendo\u2019s own version of PS Plus or Xbox Live, albeit with a less refined online play experience, a library of NES and SNES titles bolted on and some extra digital goodies here and there for subscribers.",
    "That\u2019s not to say Nintendo Switch Online is entirely without merit. The aforementioned NES and SNES libraries are quite robust at this point, offering up several classic titles alongside more obscure hits. NSO subscribers also have free access to the excellent Tetris 99 and Pac-Man 99 online multiplayer games.",
    "But Nintendo Switch Online is on the cusp of getting much better. During the September 23 Nintendo Direct presentation, the company announced that Nintendo 64 (as well as Sega Genesis / Mega Drive) games will be coming to the service via a higher tier known as \u2018Expansion Pack\u2019.",
    "If you\u2019ve never had the pleasure of exploring some of the best games from Nintendo\u2019s 3D breakout console, though, you\u2019re in luck. We\u2019ve put together a guide below, acting as a brief introduction to every N64 game currently announced for Nintendo Switch Online, and we\u2019ll be updating the list as future updates roll out.",
    "This quirky 3D platformer starring a dysfunctional bear and bird pair is just one of many excellent titles developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64. Not only is Banjo-Kazooie a superb collect-a-thon style platformer, it\u2019s filled to the brim with a delightfully juvenile sense of humor, superbly creative level design and some Metroidvania elements where finding new power-ups is essential to progress.",
    "Seeing Banjo-Kazooie come to Nintendo Switch Online was a bit of a surprise. Despite the titular pair featuring as DLC characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Rare and its IP are owned by Microsoft. That said, Nintendo and Microsoft seem to have an amicable relationship, so we\u2019d love to see even more Rare titles like Perfect Dark and Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day come to NSO somewhere down the line.",
    "Probably the most unremarkable addition at launch, Dr. Mario 64 is a revision of the NES original. A puzzle game where players have to line up pills with evil viruses of the same color, Dr. Mario 64 is a block-based puzzler where, unfortunately, the novelty can wear thin after just a few rounds. Especially as it doesn\u2019t feel quite as fluid or straightforward as genre stalwarts like Tetris or Puyo Puyo.",
    "Dr. Mario 64 does at least introduce some brand new modes, and obviously ups the presentation when compared to the NES original. But if you\u2019re not a diehard puzzler, you\u2019ll likely only be able to squeeze a few minutes of fun here before moving on to other - better - games available on Nintendo Switch Online.",
    "Speaking of better games, F-Zero X is simply one of the best on the N64, and a must-play if you\u2019re looking to check out a futuristic racing game that\u2019s aged shockingly well. While the visuals are lacking, even for an N64 game (everything looks like it\u2019s been made from cereal boxes), F-Zero X picks up the slack with a buttery smooth 60fps performance - a rarity on the N64.",
    "There\u2019s a good chunk of replay value available in F-Zero X, too, with tons of racers to unlock, as well as cups with new tracks across several difficulty levels. Pack in one of the best soundtracks on the system and F-Zero X is well worth anyone\u2019s time, even decades after its original release.",
    "You could make the argument that most Kirby games are somewhat homogeneous, and there\u2019s some truth to that. Most feature the series\u2019 iconic \u2018copy\u2019 ability that allows Kirby to take on the powers of his enemies, and most of them are also side-scrolling platformers to boot.",
    "Kirby 64 doesn\u2019t break this trend, it just does it much better than most other titles in the series. Featuring wildly imaginative levels and boss fights (including a particularly creepy final boss), Kirby 64 takes the established series formula and just makes the best possible game it can with it.",
    "The ace up Kirby 64\u2019s sleeve is Power Combos, a system which combines the powers Kirby absorbs into something entirely new. It\u2019s a fresh take on the formula, even to this day, and leads to some very fun and creative outcomes that help extend the game\u2019s replay value.",
    "Considered by many to be the crown jewel of the Zelda series, and perhaps one of the best games ever made, Ocarina of Time was the Final Fantasy 7 of Nintendo\u2019s 64-bit machine - a breakout hit that catapulted the series to prolific new heights.",
    "While OoT does suffer from some of that early 3D aging when it comes to the controls, the game\u2019s appeal is still undeniable, and perfectly playable once you\u2019ve adjusted to the slightly dated control scheme.",
    "Arguably everything about Ocarina of Time is iconic. From locales like Kakariko Village and Lon Lon Ranch, to the wonderfully memorable soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is a cozy, nostalgic game for those who played it back in the day, and is to this day one of the series\u2019 crowning achievements.",
    "The second of two Zelda titles to hit the N64, Majora\u2019s Mask somewhat lives in the shadow of its slightly older brother. And that\u2019s a shame, as you can make a strong argument for it not just being the better of the two games, but potentially the best Zelda title ever made.",
    "Majora\u2019s Mask famously had very little development time, so the team cleverly reused assets to put Link in a land separate from Hyrule, known as Termina, where a colossal moon threatens to crash into the land in just three short days.",
    "Majora\u2019s Mask is best known for its overtly mature storytelling, invoking themes of existentialism and loss. The game is even theorized to be based on the five stages of grief - a real concept that details one\u2019s thought process after experiencing the death of a close friend or loved one. The game isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, but those who can stomach the darker, often creepier tone will be treated to one of the best games the N64 has to offer.",
    "Okay, there\u2019s a bit more to Mario Golf on the N64 than that, even if it describes the game to a tee (geddit?). The game does use its Mario flair to the best of its ability, however, featuring a healthy selection of courses set all around the Mushroom Kingdom. There\u2019s even an impressive amount of modes, including tournament play, mini-golf and a mode dedicated to unlocking extra characters.",
    "While future titles in the Mario Golf series would expand the formula in terms of depth and modes on offer, they wouldn\u2019t exist without this N64 origin point, and it\u2019s a surprisingly good first effort from the development team at Camelot.",
    "Mario Kart 64 wasn\u2019t the first game in the long-running series, but it arguably cemented its reputation as a friendship-ruining, controller-snapping exercise in frustration, thanks to 4-player multiplayer support (that\u2019s even accessible via Nintendo Switch Online) and the introduction of Mario Kart\u2019s most heinous item: the Blue Shell, a heat-seeking missile that makes a beeline for the player unlucky enough to be in first.",
    "Still, Mario Kart 64 is an incredibly fun time, if lacking the polish of later entries in the series with unrefined drifting and relatively basic tracks to race on. While Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is objectively superior in pretty much every way, Mario Kart 64 is still well worth checking out on Nintendo Switch Online as a curiosity, especially if you\u2019ve got friends to play along with.",
    "Mario Golf developer Camelot returned with Mario Tennis just a year later, and much like its golfing counterpart, served as a surprisingly competent foundation for future titles in the Mario Sports subseries. It\u2019s also where Waluigi made his debut, so we\u2019ll forever be thankful to the N64 classic for that.",
    "Much like Mario Golf, there\u2019s a swathe of modes on offer in Mario Tennis, all of which will test your skills on the court. There\u2019s a good amount of depth with a range of shot options at your disposal, from top spins and lobs to drop shots and more. An energetic, catchy soundtrack keeps the game feeling frenetic, especially as you build up a minutes-long rally with your opponent.",
    "Paper Mario is one of the most beloved games on the N64, reintroducing Mario and friends to the RPG genre (after Super Mario RPG on the SNES) with a delightful papercraft aesthetic that holds up to this day. While several Mario stalwarts like Toad, Peach and Bowser are featured, Mario also teams up with a loveable bunch of original characters who help him out in battle.",
    "And it\u2019s the battle system that really stands out in Paper Mario, offering an easy to understand / hard to master turn-based system that throws in some interactive button prompts that can help to boost or mitigate damage based on who\u2019s dishing it out.",
    "Paper Mario stands out as one of the few actual RPGs on the N64, and it\u2019s arguably the best on the system. However, it was eclipsed by its phenomenal Gamecube sequel, The Thousand Year Door, which we hope also hits Nintendo Switch Online should the company choose to add Gamecube games to its service (which it absolutely should).",
    "Before New Pok\u00e9mon Snap finally graced our Switches earlier this year, the original N64 title stood on its own as something entirely unique for over two decades. Pok\u00e9mon Snap eschews the usual formula of freely exploring large worlds and battling Pok\u00e9mon, to instead travelling down an on-rails track taking pictures of them instead.",
    "It sounds utterly mundane, but there\u2019s an undeniable charm to Pok\u00e9mon Snap that makes it worth playing to this day. Throw in items and alternate routes that can lead you to discovering entirely different Pok\u00e9mon on each run, and you have a game that\u2019s tons of fun and can be beaten in a single afternoon.",
    "Seeing Treasure\u2019s Sin and Punishment arrive on Nintendo Switch Online is hugely noteworthy. Previously a Japan-exclusive, the game was eventually released in the west as part of the Wii\u2019s Virtual Console service\u2026 which has since been shut down. Thankfully, the game\u2019s resurgence on NSO will give curious players a chance to easily play this overlooked N64 classic.",
    "An on-rails shooter similar to Starfox 64, Sin and Punishment instead takes place on-foot, where the player is able to freely move, strafe and jump to attack and avoid incoming fire. As is usually the case with Treasure titles, the graphics are incredibly impressive for the time, and features nearly impeccable gameplay matched with a superb soundtrack.",
    "While Sin and Punishment never garnered more than a cult audience, main character Saki did eventually show up in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as an Assist Trophy item.",
    "Still the best in the series to this day, Star Fox 64 (known as Lylatwars in Europe) is an on-rails shooter where you pilot your ship - the Arwing - through planets, asteroid fields and space colonies rife with obstacles and baddies to shoot down.",
    "Simply playing Star Fox 64 feels great, especially with the lock-on feature that allows you to easily rack up points in each mission, allowing you to aim for each stage\u2019s completion medal. Throw in some suitably intimidating and fiendishly hard boss fights and you\u2019ve got a game that\u2019s stood the test of time better than most on the N64.",
    "Each campaign run lasts less than a couple of hours, but replay value is incentivized through multiple routes to the final boss, each offering their own missions and side objectives that, upon accomplishing, can lead to the game\u2019s best ending.",
    "We\u2019re happy to see that Switch owners will still have a way to play Super Mario 64, especially if they missed out on the bizarrely limited time release of Super Mario 3D All-Stars. Nintendo\u2019s seminal 3D platformer should need no introduction, but it does remain a wonderfully imaginative and iconic game to this day.",
    "As Mario, you\u2019re let loose in Princess Peach\u2019s castle, exploring it to find paintings that contain portals to other worlds, each of which contains several missions where the player can gather Power Stars needed to progress through the game. There\u2019s a total of 120 to collect, and there\u2019s even a special surprise waiting should you choose to go for 100%.",
    "Considered to be the very first 3D cover shooter, Koei\u2019s WinBack (known as Operation WinBack in Europe) was undoubtedly revolutionary for its time. Unfortunately, the game\u2019s fundamentally awkward control scheme renders the N64 version of the game incredibly difficult to stomach.",
    "Remembering to pop in and out of cover, aiming, reloading and keeping an eye on where the next onslaught of bad guys are coming from means that you\u2019ll be employing both mental and physical gymnastics while playing WinBack. It\u2019s an unexpected addition to Nintendo Switch Online, for sure, but if you have the means we\u2019d recommend the slightly more polished PS2 version of the game.",
    "Sadly, Yoshi\u2019s Story gets somewhat overlooked among its N64 peers like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, and while Yoshi\u2019s adventure isn\u2019t quite as memorable or as iconic, it\u2019s got a ton of heart that makes the game hard to resist for at least one playthrough.",
    "Yoshi\u2019s Story carries on the tradition of the dino\u2019s titles having experimental visual styles. While Super Mario World 2: Yoshi\u2019s Island featured a bright and cartoony look with thick, chunky linework, Yoshi\u2019s Story opts for a more subdued pre-rendered style, looking like the world\u2019s been made from a variety of arts and crafts materials.",
    "It\u2019s still got all the egg-chucking, enemy-devouring action you\u2019d expect from a Yoshi title, but this time you\u2019re not carrying around a screaming infant, making Yoshi\u2019s Story objectively better than its predecessor."
