    "If you're looking for the cheapest Samsung Galaxy Buds deals, then you've come to the right place. We've rounded up the best sales available online, which include the all-new Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, the Galaxy Buds, and the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus. Following the release of 2019's Samsung Galaxy Bud, two subsequent additions to the range are now available - the Samsung Galaxy Bud Plus and the recently released Samsung Galaxy Bud Live. All three are worthy alternatives to the likes of the Apple AirPods and Sony WF-1000XM3, and you'll find all the best prices on all three models right here.",
    "All Samsung Galaxy Buds come with a small compact case that doubles as a charging capsule. On a full charge, the baseline buds last an impressive six hours of playtime, while the newer models can range all the way up to 11-hours on a single charge. The Galaxy Buds are lightweight, compact, and come with three adjustable ear tips and wingtip sizes so you can find a size that's right for you. The water-resistant earbuds have touch controls so you can turn up the volume, skip songs, and more by tapping either 'bud. You'll find the best Samsung Galaxy Buds deals below, comparing prices for every model that's on sale online, which include the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, the Galaxy Buds, and the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus.",
    "The Galaxy Buds Live were released in September of last year with a starting price of $169.99 (\u00a3179 / AU\u00a3319). Thanks to sales like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, we've already seen significant price cuts on the wireless earbuds. The Samsung Galaxy Bud Live are the first Galaxy Buds to offer active noise cancellation, something the series has been lacking so far, and pack in an impressive 11-hour battery life. They also feature a new striking kidney bean-esque aesthetic, which really sets them apart from the usual AirPods style you see on most wireless earbuds.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Buds currently retail for $129 (\u00a3139 / AU$249) which is actually cheaper than Samsung's previous Bluetooth earbuds, the Gear IconX ($149.99 / \u00a3157). The only features that the Galaxy Buds lack when compared to the Gear IconX are the ability to load your music to the earbuds, increased water-resistance, and audio coaching for exercises. The Samsung earbuds are also cheaper than Apple's Airpods ($159/\u00a3159) which makes the Galaxy Buds one of the most affordable high-end wireless earbuds on the market.",
    "You'll find all of the prices below from several different retailers so you can find the best deal that's currently available.",
    "With the launch of the Galaxy Buds Live, the Galaxy Buds Plus might not be the top dog in the range anymore, there's still plenty on offer here with these excellent wireless earphones.",
    "Firstly, they're the cheapest Galaxy Buds in the range to offer some form of noise-cancellation, albeit in the form of noise-reduction this time as opposed to a full on active system. While not reaching the lofty heights of the Sony WF-1000XM3 or Apple AirPods Pro, retailing at just $149.99 (\u00a3159 / AU$299) means you can pick these up for a veritable steal versus the competition.",
    "Here's a quick roundup of the best prices currently available at the big retailers in your territory.",
