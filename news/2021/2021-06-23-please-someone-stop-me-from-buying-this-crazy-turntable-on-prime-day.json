    "Amazon's annual sales event is nearly over, and that means many of us are scrambling to find the perfect Prime Day deal before they all sell out.",
    "And, I don't know if it's the tiredness talking (I'm pulling an all-nighter to bring you the best audio deals this year \u2013 you're welcome), but I can't stop thinking about this old-timey phonograph-style turntable that's been discounted in the sales:",
    "Now, we've all seen how the best turntables you can buy today blend elements of the past with modern trappings like Bluetooth connectivity and USB ports that allow you to upload your vinyl to your computer.",
    "I've never seen a record player do it quite so overtly as this Phonograph Record Player from Idealforce \u2013 a brand that seems to sell everything from battery packs to toy helicopters.",
    "The sheer variety of items sold by this store leads me to believe that it might not be an authority on audio devices \u2013 and that I probably shouldn't sink over $400 on one of its turntables.",
    "Still, the specs are pretty impressive. In spite of its enormous ornate horn that harks back to the age of Edison and the gramophone, the Phonograph Record Player comes with wireless connectivity, allowing you to stream music from your phone to be played by its inbuilt speakers.",
    "You're also getting an USB port, which is a feature dedicated audiophiles with aging vinyl collections would covet. And, for good measure, it features a CD player, radio player, AUX-in 3.5mm audio port, and a 40mm subwoofer.",
    "Not to mention the street cred that having a fully-working phonograph would surely earn you in 2021.",
    "Alas, it was not meant to be. There's no way I can justify spending all that money on an untested product, even if the reviews are largely favorable \u2013 it simply won't fit into my pokey two-bedroom London apartment.",
    "But, there are plenty of other turntable deals you should consider this Prime Day, and these record players are from reputable companies with great track records when it comes to delivering fantastic audio. No horn necessary.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for turntables from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
