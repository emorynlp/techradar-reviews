    "There are three main groups of tablet Prime Day deals - there's the expected smattering of Amazon Fire tablet discounts, a very select number of iPad deals, and then some bigger Samsung Galaxy Tab reductions.",
    "In case you missed the headline, the Prime Day tablet deals we're looking at here are on the latter, Samsung's Android tablets that rival iPads in a few ways. The company has slates that hit the cheap, mid-range and top-end of the tablet market.",
    "There are six discounted models in all, with some seeing better discounts than others, and several of them having discounts on different configurations. Some of the brand's cheapest tablets have seen reductions though, so if you don't want to spend much at all, you really don't need to.",
    "Remember that a cheap tablet can be just as good as a pricier one if you don't need it for anything intensive.",
    "We've got deals in the US, and we've got deals in the UK - based elsewhere? Scroll down for prices in your region.",
    "Samsung has three main lines of tablets.",
    "The first one, that you're probably most interested, is the Galaxy Tab A line. These are affordable slates with weak processors and usually no stylus support, but they're fine as portable entertainment devices to distract your kids (or yourself) on journeys and long waits.",
    "The company's main series of slates is the Galaxy Tab S line, and this covers premium models (the numbered ones) and mid-range ones (the e or Lite devices). These have more features, longer-lasting battery lives and stronger processors, but cost more as a result.",
    "Finally, there's the company's Active line, though there are only Prime Day deals on these in the US. These are rugged slates for people who need an outdoor work unit, and are generally not consumer devices.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Samsung Galaxy Tab devices from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
