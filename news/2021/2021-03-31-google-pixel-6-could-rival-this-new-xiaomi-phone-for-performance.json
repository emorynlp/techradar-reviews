    "We haven\u2019t heard much about the Google Pixel 6 or the Pixel 5a yet, but we have a good idea of what chipset might power the phones \u2013 and we've already seen it in the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G.",
    "That recently announced Xiaomi phone was the first to include the Snapdragon 780G chipset, which is a successor to the Snapdragon 765G in the Google Pixel 5 and the Pixel 4a 5G, so it\u2019s a prime candidate for the upcoming models.",
    "If this is indeed the chip that will power Google's new phones, we'll have high hopes for the performance of the handsets. While we haven\u2019t yet reviewed the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G, the Snapdragon 780G inside it is a 5nm chip, like the top-end Snapdragon 888, and Qualcomm claims that its CPU offers up to a 40% performance uplift over its predecessor.",
    "It supports 5G of course, and it should also enable improvements in the photography department, with, for example, new low-light architecture that's designed to help with night shots.",
    "A number of sites have suggested that this could be the chipset used in the Google Pixel 5a and the Pixel 6, and it\u2019s a logical assumption, although it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no actual evidence that this is the chipset that will be used.",
    "In fact, we\u2019d previously heard that the Pixel 6 might be powered by the Snapdragon 775 \u2013 but that chipset is yet to be announced and may not be real, so the 780G is now our best guess.",
    "It\u2019s also possible that the Google Pixel 6 will get a high-end chipset like the Snapdragon 888, rather than a mid-range one. After all, prior to the Pixel 5 these phones had high-end power. But in that case we\u2019d still think the Snapdragon 780G is a likely candidate for the Google Pixel 5a.",
