    "Microsoft is levelling up the dark mode feature in Microsoft Word to make it even darker.",
    "Where the existing dark mode on Word dims the toolbar, ribbons and surrounding area of a page, tests are ongoing using a new dark mode which further blackens the canvas itself \u2013 giving users the option to switch between their preferred levels of darkness.",
    "In an official Office Insider blog post, Microsoft Word program manager Ali Forelli described the update as a \u201clong-requested feature\u201d only made more pertinent by the ever-increasing amount of time we spend at our screens. \u201cIt has become increasingly important,\u201d he said, \u201cto reduce eye strain and accommodate light sensitivity.\u201d",
    "Among changes which will see the updated dark mode switch previously-white pages to charcoal grey, the colors used in documents themselves will also be adjusted. Reds, blues, yellows and other bright colors will be \u201cshifted slightly to mute the overall effect of the color palette\u201d and to better match the darkened background.",
    "The update will introduce a \u2018Switch Modes\u2019 tab in the Word ribbon to switch between a dark and light canvas (similar to that which exists in OneNote), along with an option to permanently disable the dark canvas and stick with the traditional dark mode.",
    "This darker dark mode (let\u2019s go with \u2018double dark\u2019) is currently available to beta testers of Office 365, so expect it to arrive in your Word program in the coming months.",
    "Of course, this will come as useless news to those who don\u2019t know how to activate the original dark mode in Microsoft Word, or indeed those who didn\u2019t know it existed in the program at all.",
    "According to Microsoft, Office\u2019s dark mode is only available if you have a Microsoft 365 (previously known as Office 365) subscription, though you can still opt for a dark grey theme on Office 2016 and Office 2013. This works on any version of Windows, including Windows 7, 8, or 10.",
    "To change your theme, click the \u2018File\u2019 menu at the top left corner of an Office application like Word, Excel, Outlook, or PowerPoint. Click the \u2018Account\u2019 option in the sidebar, then the \u2018Office Theme\u2019 dropdown menu to select your desired theme.",
    "The default theme is \u2018Colorful\u2019 (which keeps your Excel green, your PowerPoint red etc.) but you can also select \u2018White\u2019 for brighter whites across Office applications. To enable dark mode, select \u2018Black\u2019 for the darkest possible style or \u2018Dark Gray\u2019 for more of a charcoal feel.",
    "To put Office in dark mode on Mac, you\u2019ll need to change this setting in the macOS system preferences. Click the Apple menu in the top left, select \u2018System Preferences\u2019, then \u2018General\u2019 and at the top of the dialog box you can switch your macOS from Light to Dark.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that documents you create while in your chosen dark mode will still have a white background and black text by default. You could change your documents to have a black background and white text, but those colors would be part of each document you save.",
