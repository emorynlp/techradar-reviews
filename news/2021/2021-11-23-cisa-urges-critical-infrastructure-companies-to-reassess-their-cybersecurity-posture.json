  "article": [
    "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are reminding organizations, businesses, and critical infrastructure to stay vigilant against threats during the upcoming holiday season.",
    "The advisory leans on history to warn critical infrastructure partners that the holidays provide an opportune time for cyber actors from \u201chalfway across the world\u201d to launch attacks to disrupt critical networks and systems.",
    "The agencies suggest that all personnel in an organization must undertake all necessary steps to proactively protect themselves against cyberattacks, including possible ransomware attacks, during the holidays, when businesses operate on skeletal staff.",
    "=\u201cCISA and the FBI strongly urge all entities\u2013especially critical infrastructure partners\u2013to examine their current cybersecurity posture and implement best practices and mitigations to manage the risk posed by cyber threats,\u201d suggest the agencies.",
    "Furthermore, CISA and the FBI suggest that all organizations remain vigilant against the multiple techniques cybercriminals use to gain access to networks, including phishing scams.",
    "They\u2019ve also listed a series of actions that organizations must undertake to protect themselves. These include implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts and remote access, mandating the use of strong passwords, and best password practices, and other actions.",
    "Although they haven\u2019t identified any specific threats, the agencies argue that recent 2021 trends show that threat actors tend to launch malicious ransomware campaigns during holidays and weekends, including the US Independence Day and Mother\u2019s Day weekends.",
    "The agencies also suggest that organizations review and update their incident response and communication plans, which will reduce the risk of severe business/functional degradation in the event an organization falls victim to an attack.",
    "Add another layer of security by protecting your accounts with the best security keys, in addition to protecting computers with the best endpoint protection tools"
