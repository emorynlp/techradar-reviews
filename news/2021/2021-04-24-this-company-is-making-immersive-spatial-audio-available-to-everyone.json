    "Immersion Networks isn\u2019t the first software or hardware company to compose a high-minded mission statement talking about its desire to make recorded music sound better. Unlike the overwhelming majority of these companies, though, Immersion Networks has gone ahead and done it. And unlike any other company, Immersion Networks doesn\u2019t want to sell you a license or a decoder to enjoy the benefits of its hard work \u2013 it merely wants to sell you a service.",
    "Despite the fact that it\u2019s been around since 2014, there\u2019s no special reason why any music lover should have heard of Immersion Networks. Despite the fact that its founders are hugely influential figures in the world of audio technology, there\u2019s no special reason why you should have heard of them either.",
    "But while both Paul Hubert and James \u2018J.J.\u2019 Johnston seem happy to remain in the background, it seems likely that \u2018mix\u00b3 from Immersion Networks\u2019, the fruit of their most recent labors and the product with which Immersion Networks is poised to announce itself to the world at large, will bring them a degree of attention whether they like it or not. The same goes for Jim Rondinelli, who joined Immersion Networks a little later.",
    "The credentials of all three are deeply impressive. Paul worked alongside Steve Jobs at Apple, installing the first Macs at Prince\u2019s Paisley Park Studios and creating audio formats that liberated the potential of satellite radio. J.J. has long been preoccupied with the relationship between audio coding and human perception and, as one of the principal drivers of the MP3 codec, should be thanked fulsomely by pretty much anyone who\u2019s ever listened to a digital audio file. Jim, meanwhile, has the audio engineering and production credentials to account for his significant collection of gold and platinum records.",
    "Immersion Networks, and mix\u00b3 in particular, began because Paul and J.J. asked themselves one of those questions that looks fairly straightforward when written down: \u201cHow do we make music sound better in as simple a way as possible?\u201d",
    "The \u201cbetter\u201d part of the question actually is straightforward. What Paul and J.J. mean by \u201cbetter\u201d is actually \u201cas the artist hoped\u201d. By including all the nuance, all the presence, all the intimacy, all the straight-ahead musicality that has, until now, pretty much evaporated the moment the music leaves the recording studio. \u201cSimple\u201d, though, is quite obviously a relative term\u2026",
    "In order to give creators the chance to convey the sound exactly as they intended, and to give them the chance to deliver truly spatial audio without the need for any new hardware of any kind, Immersion Networks took a perilously deep dive into every aspect of human hearing and perception of sound. For years, the paradigm of sound reproduction relied on getting a linear response from a pair of loudspeakers \u2013 because, after all, we have two ears.",
    "But Paul and J.J. understood that this is not how sound perception works in the real world. In the real world, there are many distinct localization cues \u2013 and the sound changes as we move around in any specific environment. How, then, to best recreate the original sound experience? What elements of the sound field are most important to human perception?",
    "They set up a laboratory full of complex equipment of their own design and construction, in order to test numerous head-tracking approaches and \u2018listen\u2019 to the ear canals of literally hundreds of individuals.",
    "In order to assess the way sound travels to different parts of the listener\u2019s ear, and the microseconds of difference this involves, they even built a device informally known as the \u2018Ear of Sauron\u2019.",
    "They learned that, when attempting to evoke a sense of space (and placement within that space), the crucial parameter is timing. So they worked out how to capture a frankly staggering amount of information about sound timing, and then how to distill it down to the essential information a listener needs to experience truly spatial audio.",
    "And then, by way of an encore, they worked out how to deliver this information without the need for new hardware, special speakers, or headphones. In effect, they discovered the latent superpower lying dormant in your existing audio equipment.",
    "The results are exciting for two very distinct reasons. Firstly, they\u2019ve yielded an end-to-end cloud-based platform that can make extraordinarily advanced audio processing functionality available to anyone. mix\u00b3 from Immersion Networks is an entire system for the capture, creation, mixing, and delivery of spatial audio, with a resultant sound that\u2019s almost startling in its immediacy. mix\u00b3 intends to put the listener where the listener was always intended to be.",
    "\u201cSurround sound systems often rely on the room they\u2019re in to do the heavy lifting \u2013 or you have to do a room simulation in your computation\u201d, Paul explains. \u201cBoth approaches make it hard to get close to the listener. We make you feel the sound is coming from right next to you \u2013 and that\u2019s where the magic is.\u201d Immersion Networks\u2019 transcoding process turns \u2018ordinary\u2019 stereo masters into fully immersive audio that is just as capable of whispering in your ear, or tip-toeing behind you, as it is delivering shock and awe from a cavernous soundstage.",
    "And secondly, Immersion Networks sees mix\u00b3 as a service, not a hardware set-up or a licensing opportunity. \u201cEstablished big brands like Dolby want to sell you a license or a decoder,\u201d says Paul. \u201cOur model changes that. We can take any content and transcode it, without any additional changes required from the creator.\u201d",
    "Audio creators simply upload their files to the Immersive Networks platform, and in moments have a transcoded, fully immersive mix ready for distribution. The associated cost will simply be for usage of the platform, and Immersive Networks is adamant its service will be affordable even to bedroom musicians and DIY creators. \u201cWe\u2019re giving people a tool that would require a $50K Mac Pro to run in a studio,\u201d reckons Paul. \u201cCloud processors give everyone access.\u201d",
    "So \u201chow do we make music sound better in as simple a way as possible?\u201d has resulted in the democratization of an audio technology of rare potency, and the ability of any musician or creator to enhance and deepen the emotional impact of their work. \u201cWe never forget the emotional side of delivering something in spatial audio,\u201d emphasizes Paul. \u201cYou feel part of the experience. You feel present.\u201d",
    "mix\u00b3 from Immersion Networks is available from mid-May of 2021 at https://mixcubed.com/. And in the meantime, these demos will give you some idea of just what your existing music player and headphones are capable of when they\u2019re used in conjunction with mix\u00b3."
