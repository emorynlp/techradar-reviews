  "article": [
    "We spend nearly a third of our lives in bed, so a supportive and comfortable mattress is essential to help us sleep well. On average, the best mattresses have a lifespan of around seven to 10 years (some last much longer). However, how long a mattress lasts depends on a few different factors, which we look at here.",
    "For example, how you sleep, your weight and whether you share a bed or snooze alone each play a part in how long a mattress lasts. Some materials, such as natural latex, are also more durable and therefore longer lasting.",
    "Here we look at how long the different types of mattresses should last (on average), and point out some key signs that it\u2019s time to upgrade yours. We\u2019ll also share some basic care tips to help you look after your bed so that it lasts longer (and therefore saves you money in the long-term).",
    "If after reading this you decide that you are ready to upgrade, now is the perfect time as there are some great Cyber Monday mattress deals live this weekend, with savings from many leading sleep brands.",
    "Although there are many combinations of materials used in mattresses, the main types are memory foam, hybrid, latex, or innerspring. Each type will have a slightly different lifespan. Here\u2019s a quick run-down of how long each type of mattress lasts on average:",
    "If you\u2019re still sleeping soundly on your bed, but your mattress is over five years old or needs a little boost in terms of comfort or support, consider investing in one of the best mattress toppers. Get the right one and it can give you a few more years of comfortable sleeping on your current bed.",
    "Memory foam is pretty durable and you can expect to get around eight to 10 years\u2019 use out from it. This is mainly because there aren\u2019t a lot of materials and components in these mattresses, meaning there\u2019s less to deteriorate and compromise the quality.",
    "Memory foam mattresses generally need to be rotated regularly and must be kept clean and aired. If you start waking up with aches and pains and find that the foam is no longer supporting you and offering pressure relief, it\u2019s time to upgrade.",
    "Sink-in body cradling that\u2019s gone from the sublime to the ridiculous is also a red flag. Watch out for the memory foam discoloring (turning yellow) too, as this is a sign of mattress old age.",
    "Latex is the most resilient of all materials listed here, which means that latex mattresses are the longest-lasting. However, this only applies if you buy a 100% natural latex mattress as these can last from 15 to 25 years. Look for the terms organic, Dunlop or Talalay when considering a latex bed.",
    "Natural latex mattresses often cost more but this is balanced out by the length of time they last for. Blended or synthetic latex has a shorter lifespan of between five to 10 years. It also softens more than natural latex and can produce off-gassing.",
    "Hybrid models aren\u2019t as durable as memory foam, but you can still expect several years of use. Some brands, such as Purple and Casper, state that their hybrid mattresses can last as long as 10 years, due to the high-quality materials they\u2019re made with.",
    "With more layers and components in a hybrid than in most other beds on the market, they can be prone to a little premature sagging, hence the slightly shorter average lifespan.",
    "Hybrids can be rotated regularly but should not be flipped unless the manufacturer specifically states otherwise. This is because they generally have a soft top and a sturdy base. You might also void the warranty if you flip a hybrid mattress when it isn\u2019t designed to be flipped.",
    "Springs wear down over time and can cause sagging, meaning that innerspring mattresses generally have a lifespan of around five to seven years. But they are extremely popular due to their bounce, comfort and cheaper price tags.",
    "Of course, this can be a false economy as you will end up replacing your mattress more often. If you do want an innerspring bed, it\u2019s worth looking at one with an extra layer of coils combined with a soft pillow top for extra comfort.",
    "Along with the type of mattress you\u2019re sleeping with, there are other factors that will contribute to its lifespan:",
    "Original quality The quality of your mattress when you originally bought it makes a difference to how long it will last. A very cheap bed is almost certain to wear out before a model made with durable materials.",
    "Body weight and sleep position Those with a heavier body weight may find their mattress sags more quickly. If you\u2019re of a heavier build, it\u2019s worth looking for a mattress made with stronger, durable materials alongside heavy duty springs.",
    "By the same token, side sleepers put a lot of weight onto the bed in the hip and shoulder regions, causing points in the mattress that sag quicker. Memory foam is the best choice for side sleepers, as they help support and provide pressure relief to the right areas.",
    "Frequency of use This is somewhat obvious, but a mattress that sits in your guest room and is only used occasionally will last longer than the one you sleep on every night.",
    "Following some simple tips will help extend the lifespan of your mattress, which will save you money in the long-run as you won't need to replace your bed so often:",
    "1. Rotate it regularly to help keep the surface even and prevent any indents. Although some mattresses can be flipped, make sure you check the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines first. Some mattresses are one-sided only and could be damaged if flipped.",
    "2. Put your mattress on a sturdy base. Most manufacturers recommend what type of bed bases suit their mattresses but, as a general guideline, a box spring, platform, or bed frame with evenly spaced slats should provide decent support.",
    "3. Clean and air your bed frequently to keep it fresh. Many modern mattresses have washable covers that can be removed and machine washed, though some can only be spot-cleaned. Run the vacuum over your mattress and wash your bedding regularly to help prevent the build-up of dust mites, bacteria and sweat.",
    "4. Use a mattress protector at all times. These slip over just like a fitted sheet and help to safeguard your bed from dirt, spills, sweat and bacteria. They are easy to machine wash and dry, and they needn't cost much either.",
    "If you don\u2019t know how old your mattress is, there are other ways to tell if it needs replacing. Some classic signs to look for include how:",
    "What you sleep on makes a big difference to how comfortably you sleep, so it pays to get this one right. A good bed needn\u2019t cost the earth though, so don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that the most expensive mattress is better than all others.",
