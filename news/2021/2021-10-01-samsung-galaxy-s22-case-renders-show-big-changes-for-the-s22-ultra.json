    "Other than the Google Pixel 6 \u2013 which is in a weird half launched state \u2013 the Samsung Galaxy S22 range is arguably the next major smartphone launch we\u2019re expecting, and we now have a good idea of what to expect from the phones visually, thanks to some leaked case renders.",
    "The most interesting are those showing the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, shared by leaker Ice Universe. These show a phone with a far more angular design than the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. It\u2019s a shape that\u2019s more like the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra in fact.",
    "The images also show a cut-out in the case which might be for the rumored S Pen slot, all of which, along with the rumored name change to the Samsung Galaxy Note 22 Ultra, suggests that the Note range might be coming back sooner than expected.",
    "The back of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra also looks different, with a camera block that\u2019s more of a \u2018P\u2019 shape, though it sounds like Ice Universe isn\u2019t certain this will be the exact shape, based on the accompanying text.",
    "Next up there\u2019s the Samsung Galaxy S22 and Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus, with renders for both of these phones shared by SlashLeaks. These are less interesting simply because they look a lot like their predecessors, though it appears that the Samsung Galaxy S22 might have larger camera lenses than the Galaxy S21.",
    "However, given that the lenses also look potentially bigger than those shown on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus, we wouldn\u2019t read too much into this \u2013 they might have been incorrectly rendered.",
    "In any case, all of these designs look broadly like what we\u2019ve seen before in previous leaks, so while we\u2019d take them with a pinch of salt, they may well be accurate.",
    "A lot of people were disappointed that there wasn\u2019t a new Samsung Galaxy Note this year, but the range hasn\u2019t made a huge amount of sense for a while now.",
    "The Note range used to have larger screen sizes than the S range, but in recent years that hasn\u2019t so much been the case, leaving the S Pen as the only major differentiator. That hardly seems enough to justify a whole line of handsets, but it is a useful feature to have, so Samsung adding it to the S range makes sense.",
    "That started with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra this year, but that phone didn\u2019t have a slot for the S Pen, while it\u2019s looking increasingly like the Galaxy S22 Ultra will.",
    "We\u2019re not sure it\u2019s necessary to change the name or design in line with the Note range, as also might be happening. But either way, whether we get the S22 Ultra or the Note 22 Ultra, it seems the spirit of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note range will probably live on, without the excessive number of overly similar premium handsets that the company has been offering for the last few years.",
