    "Generally speaking, I think FIFA gets a bad rap.",
    "Yes, it\u2019s rage-inducing. Yes, it\u2019s the same every year. Yes, it could be construed as a gambling platform for teens. But it\u2019s also still the best football simulator money can buy (sorry, PES). For that reason, it remains the go-to game for millions of soccer fans around the world, including the pros.",
    "That being said, FIFA 21\u2019s career mode still sucks. It\u2019s really not good, especially after EA claimed that the management mode was getting a major overhaul before the game's release. Hell, it even warranted a dedicated trailer for the first time in forever, so I was frustrated to discover that career mode is still the same old dialogue-clicking, training-skipping simulator as previous entries in the series.",
    "But hey, I just said FIFA is the same game every year, so what did I expect.",
    "On paper, FIFA 21\u2019s \u201cmanage every moment\u201d ambitions for career mode sound great. On the back of Football Manager\u2019s increased popularity in recent years, a FIFA game offering more immersive managerial involvement could only prove a welcome direction for the franchise, especially considering the historically gameplay-focused nature of the series.",
    "But what EA meant to say when it was throwing around lines like \u201cnew depth in matches, transfers and training\u201d was that it had actually just made existing game mechanics more tedious under the guise of deepening the experience for the player.",
    "The main \"changes\" (let\u2019s go with EA\u2019s phrasing here) come in the form of an interactive match sim, more detailed player development, active training and scheduling, new transfer options and enhanced opposition A.I.",
    "Let\u2019s start gently. The first in the list, in fairness, is a welcome addition, allowing you to jump in-and-out of simulated matches on the fly if your team isn\u2019t quite delivering the tiki-taka style football you hoped for. The new player development features, too, are also genuinely fresh, giving you the option to train players in different positions should you wish to turn Wan-Bissaka from a defensive right back into a marauding winger (good luck with that, by the way).",
    "Ultimately, though, you'll end up being dissuaded from seeing what novel features like this have to offer because of the awful user interface in FIFA 21's career mode. Seriously, there are just too many menus and submenus to warrant the arduous journey you'll need to embark on to find out exactly how to put this player in that position or have your team play in a certain way.",
    "This tedium is made even more apparent by the new active training and scheduling feature. In theory, these tools should empower you to flex your footballing philosophy by deciding which days in the calendar are used for training, resting and recovery. But in reality, this is easily the worst thing about career mode. You now have to monitor match sharpness alongside player morale and fitness, finding the right balance between honing your plans on the training pitch and awarding your team adequate rest to prepare for the next game.",
    "It all sounds very Pep Guardiola, but it\u2019s actually just super annoying. Between each game, you\u2019ll have to decide which training sessions to simulate, skip or play out yourself (Godspeed to those that do), and you end up spending far more time sifting through the training schedule than you do performing the managerial tasks that are actually fun \u2013 like scouting players, brokering transfers and tweaking formations.",
    "Kudos to EA for at least beefing up the training options, but if players were after a career mode that focused so much on the backroom, off-the-pitch elements of management, they\u2019d just play Football Manager. And even with these new options, you\u2019re still by-and-large unable to craft your own style of football \u2013 at least any sort of identity beyond those afforded by your choice of formation.",
    "All this means that FIFA 21's career mode lacks the tactical micromanagement that the Football Manager series excels at, and instead aims for some sort of middle ground between game and clipboard that just makes you wish it had stuck to its sim-to-next-match roots.",
    "Yes, FIFA 21's career mode is different to FIFA 20, but only in that it gives the player more of the same \u2013 more training, more scheduling, more replying to emails. What I \u2013 and, I suspect, most players \u2013 want to see is not the augmentation of existing systems, but entirely new ones.",
    "FIFA\u2019s bottom line has always been about offering players the opportunity to experience the thrill of football from their sofas. The appeal of career mode, in particular, lies in the opportunity to build and play with an unrealistically-good team of Galacticos, the romantic pursuit of bringing a Championship team to the height of the Premier League or the journey of watching promising youngsters grow into megastars. It\u2019s about progression, not maintenance. We need to be able to upgrade stadiums, purchase sponsorships and create new kits, not trudge through seasons where we spend half the time simulating training sessions.",
    "Ironically, the career modes of old encouraged the idea of progression more than FIFA 21. Stadium and income growth used to be a feature of previous entries, simpler times when you could hop from game to game with ease and crack out ten genuinely-enjoyable games in an evening playthrough. Nowadays, though, your eyes have turned square by the time you finish pre-season because you\u2019ve clicked through so many menus and tiles it physically hurts to simulate Tuesday night shooting practice.",
    "Career mode symbolizes EA\u2019s laziness the most, too. The same backgrounds as last year are used for press conferences and transfer negotiations, as well as the same (downright lifeless) dialogue options. Quite laughably, even some of the supposedly \u2018new\u2019 mechanics are actually just re-added features that were previously canned by the developer. The addition of a shiny new loan-to-buy option when signing players in the latest game, for example, isn\u2019t new at all, but a contract element that was removed after FIFA 15. Did EA think we wouldn\u2019t notice?",
    "Ultimate Team will always prevail as EA\u2019s most prized asset, that much is clear enough \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. FUT is a cash cow like nothing else in the gaming industry, and if you\u2019re into competitive multiplayer and card-collecting, it\u2019s a highly-addictive and frequently rewarding mode (which brings its own problems to the table, but that\u2019s a debate for another day).",
    "What EA doesn\u2019t realize, though, is that a large portion of its player-base only purchase its flagship soccer game for career mode and couch play \u2013 the teenagers who once stayed up all night scoring rabonas on FIFA 11 are now deep into their twenties, and I\u2019m telling you, we haven\u2019t got the patience for it anymore.",
    "Still, the appeal of turning around the fortunes of Sunderland A.F.C. with the latest wonderkid remains an attractive after-work proposition, that\u2019s why suckers like me continue to shell out for what is essentially the same offering every year \u2013 I just wish EA would surprise us one time."
