    "Whether you need to sign some PDFs every once in a while or you frequently have to create, edit, sign, and share PDFs all the time for your job, being able to quickly and efficiently work with PDFs is important. This is where special PDF software comes in, as these programs allow users to create, edit, and convert PDF documents to other file formats, among other functions. Unfortunately, these programs also tend to be fairly expensive, and because of this, they\u2019re not attractive options for many people.",
    "Thankfully, though, Wondershare\u2019s PDFelement (available for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and the Cloud) solves this problem entirely by offering premium functionality and performance for a mere fraction of what alternatives like Adobe Acrobat cost.",
    "Here\u2019s a full overview of everything you need to know about Wondershare PDFelement, including a deep dive into its functions, newest features, pricing, and more.",
    "The main thing that makes PDFelement such a great PDF software is how deep and extensive it is in terms of functionality.",
    "With PDFelement, you can create, comment on, annotate, edit, convert, review, and sign PDF documents with just a few easy clicks, making the software incredibly convenient and user-friendly.",
    "PDFelement also allows you to password protect your PDFs, collect form data from them, and permanently redact sensitive information if need be.",
    "The newest version of PDFelement, PDFelement 8, also comes with some new quality-of-life features and optimizations that makes the user experience even better.",
    "These include a new translucent UI/UX that\u2019s designed to be as simple, clean, and easy to navigate as possible while also being stylish, improved file conversion quality by 50% with unmatched quality, dark and light mode options, the ability to add notes to annotations, support for trackpad signatures and multi-tab navigation, and optimizations for the annotation process.",
    "Another thing that\u2019s awesome about PDFelement is that it has stellar performance.",
    "Compared to other bloated PDF softwares that often take a long time to open and are slow, PDFelement opens near-instantaneously and every action you perform within the program is snappy and quick, saving you time that you can spend on more important parts of your workflow.",
    "Considering the fact that most people need to have multiple tabs and programs open at once while they work, the fact that PDFelement doesn\u2019t hog system resources and executes its functions efficiently is fantastic.",
    "In addition to its numerous features and functions as well as its superb performance, PDFelement is also much more affordable than alternative PDF software options.",
    "The Pro version costs $79.99/year, or alternatively, you can get a permanent license for $129.99. Meanwhile, the pro bundle version costs $99.99/year or $159.99 for a lifetime license. Compared to much pricier options like Adobe Acrobat, these prices are incredibly affordable.",
    "Notably, there are even free trials available that allow you to try the software out for yourself before committing to a purchase. Also, there\u2019s a significant discount available for the Mac and iOS software bundle until July 30.",
    "Between PDFelement\u2019s awesome features, excellent performance, and consumer-friendly pricing, it\u2019s easily one of the best PDF softwares available on the market today. Alternative options may have similar functionality, but many of them have poor performance and cost significantly more money. PDFelement has all of the same superb features and functions that the competition offers - and in some cases, even more - while also running smoother and costing less. For this reason, it\u2019s arguably the best software you can get if you need to work with PDFs.",
    "Ultimately, whether you need to create and edit PDFs, sign forms, collaborate with others, or convert files into other types of documents, PDFelement is perfect for you. Details here."
