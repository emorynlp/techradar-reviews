    "The Apple vs Epic Games trial might have begun as a battle to put Fortnite back on iPhones, but now it\u2019s become the tool to air all of gaming\u2019s secrets. The latest revelation explains why Xbox might be so keen to push Game Pass as far as it can and not keep it exclusive to just its own console platform.",
    "Xbox vice president Lori Wright was called as a witness for the court battle. According to Protocol, when asked by Epic Games\u2019 lawyer about the profit margin on Xbox console sales Wright replied \u201cWe sell the consoles at a loss\u201d. Later asked if an Xbox console had ever been sold for a profit she said \u201cNo.\u201d",
    "One of gaming\u2019s worst kept secrets is that consoles almost always sell at a loss - and make money back on the sale of games \u2013 but it\u2019s still surprising to hear that out loud. Though the comments might explain Microsoft\u2019s push for Game Pass to launch on as many platforms as possible; if it can sell you the games without making a loss on the consoles then it's a win-win.",
    "Epic\u2019s lawyer\u2019s line of questioning might seem odd for a court battle between Epic Games and Apple, but the Fortnite developer was using Xbox\u2019s profitability to justify why it has no issue with a 70/30 revenue split on consoles but does on mobile.",
    "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers \u2013 who will be the sole person deciding the outcome of the case \u2013 had previously stated Epic would have to convince her why Apple was specifically at fault. She feared her verdict could otherwise have too far-reaching an impact on digital storefronts in general.",
    "Consoles have been a loss leader over the past few decades, but is Xbox able to change the game with Game Pass? Is Game Pass actually making them money when consoles aren't?",
    "This is a question that a lot of people outside of Xbox want to know because the answer isn\u2019t clear. We know that Game Pass Ultimate costs $14.99 / \u00a310.99 / AU$15.95 a month, and based on comments earlier this year, it has around 18 million subscribers. That would be a rough $270 million per month, or $3.2 billion a year.",
    "Obviously, it isn\u2019t that simple: Game Pass has different tiers and frequent deals selling it for way cheaper, but those numbers still aren\u2019t something to scoff at. As more people buy Xbox Series Xs, and as XCloud \u2013 the Game Pass streaming service - comes to more platforms like Smart TVs, we\u2019re sure to see that number grow even more.",
    "And that growth is likely what\u2019s most important right now. Speaking to Eurogamer, analyst Daniel Ahmad said Xbox is \u201cvery much in a user acquisition stage\u201d. He explained further that \u201conce people have that library, they're very unlikely to unsubscribe, and they're going to keep subscribing then for years to come.\u201d",
    "Once enough people are stuck in the ecosystem, that\u2019s when profits start rolling in. So Xbox is just in that waiting game right now, sustaining its platform while more and more people subscribe.",
    "Unfortunately, that means we\u2019ll have to wait too. It\u2019ll take time before we know if Game Pass is a success or not, though given how much people love it, it seems like everyone is hoping it does well."
