    "It may have cost $7.5 billion dollars to make me realize it, but Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series S suddenly makes sense. Almost to the point where I\u2019d consider it a genuine threat to Sony\u2019s PS5.",
    "The Xbox Series S was designed to be an affordable entry point into the Xbox ecosystem and next-gen gaming \u2013 and while some may argue that a commonly found resolution of 1080p in the majority of titles doesn\u2019t qualify as a true generational leap \u2013 it\u2019s hard to deny that Microsoft\u2019s all-white Xbox hasn\u2019t achieved its lofty goal.",
    "The Xbox Series S can run the graphically intensive lighting and reflection technology known as ray tracing; it\u2019s able to output games at 120fps, and it offers blazing-fast load times thanks to its 512GB internal SSD drive (though I do wish significantly more of it was available to use). You can purchase and play all the latest blockbuster titles on it, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, and even true next-gen Xbox exclusives like The Medium.",
    "Resolution qualms and framerate counting aside, then, the Xbox Series S really is a fantastic proposition for those who want a next-gen console that doesn\u2019t break the bank, as long as you\u2019re prepared to accept some of its caveats.",
    "But despite the Xbox Series S\u2019s appeal, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s resonated quite as well with consumers as it could have. After all, if you\u2019re a fan of Xbox games or already a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, wouldn\u2019t you simply opt for the Xbox Series X so you get the best experience possible? That was certainly part of my thought process before Microsoft\u2019s next-gen consoles released, even though I adore the almost impossibly small form factor of the Xbox Series S.",
    "You could also argue that the Xbox Series S doesn\u2019t do enough to sway fans of PlayStation hardware over to the green side. The price differential between Sony\u2019s PS5 Digital Edition and the Xbox Series S isn\u2019t significant enough to justify choosing Microsoft\u2019s machine over the PS5 Digital Edition, which is essentially a PS5 without a disc drive. Why would you pay $299 / \u00a3249 / AU$549 for the Xbox Series S, when for over $100 more you can buy a PS5 Digital Edition?",
    "However, if there\u2019s one investment Microsoft has absolutely nailed in recent years it\u2019s Xbox Game Pass. I don\u2019t need to write any more superlatives about what many rightfully call \u201cthe best deal in gaming\u201d, and it still often feels too good to be true and somehow continues to get better.",
    "The Xbox Series S was always going to be buoyed by Xbox Game Pass, then. And I\u2019m sure that being able to access every title from Xbox Game Studios on day one, like Halo Infinite, will have influenced a fair few people into buying Microsoft\u2019s cheaper Xbox purely based on that fact alone.",
    "But the Xbox Series S\u2019s watershed moment came when Bethesda games were added to Microsoft\u2019s service as part of the company\u2019s acquisition of Bethesda\u2019s parent company, ZeniMax Media.",
    "This was no small selection, either, featuring a staggering 20 titles, some of which already run better than ever before thanks to FPS Boost, a new Xbox Series X and S feature that can sometimes quadruple the framerate of older titles.",
    "There\u2019s also the enticing promise that future Bethesda titles like Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6 will arrive on the service on day one, just like Microsoft\u2019s first-party output.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a fan of exclusives or not, there\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re still the best way to sell consoles and entice gamers to change their allegiance to a piece of plastic. And with Bethesda games now on Xbox and PC moving forward, PlayStation owners suddenly have to deal with the prospect of games and series that they might have been excited for no longer being available. And that, in itself, is a far greater pull than Microsoft releasing another Forza Motorsport or Gears game.",
    "Now, I\u2019m not saying that people will start trading in their PS5 consoles en masse, but what the Xbox Series S could become is the perfect companion console to Sony\u2019s machine. Much like how in every Xbox 360 and PS3 household you\u2019d often find a Wii, the Xbox Series S has the potential to reach an audience that simply wouldn\u2019t pay $499 / \u00a3449 / AU$749 for a box that does practically the same thing as the PS5 they already own.",
    "I\u2019ve seen a number of people picking up an Xbox Series S to act their \u201cBethesda box\u201d, which is testament to how beloved series like Fallout, Skyrim, Doom, Wolfenstein and The Evil Within are. And when they also know that they\u2019re getting all of Microsoft\u2019s first-party output, big third-party games like Outriders and more as part of their subscription, it\u2019s hardly surprising that Xbox Series S has entered the equation.",
    "The console suddenly isn\u2019t just a cheap entry point into next-gen and the Xbox ecosystem: it\u2019s an avenue for PlayStation (and potentially Nintendo Switch) fans to ensure they can still play Bethesda\u2019s upcoming games without making another sizable investment. As a consequence, they\u2019ll also be exposed to countless Xbox games that they may have ignored, and the incredible value proposition that is Xbox Game Pass.",
    "That should worry Sony \u2013 not because they\u2019re likely to lose out on the sale of a PS5, but because the prospect of paying $70 / \u00a370 for a game when compared to $10 / \u00a38 a month is a hard one to justify. It\u2019ll also attract more people to the already 18 million Xbox Game Pass subscribers that Microsoft is so keen to build as opposed to shifting Xbox Series X consoles.",
    "Perhaps this was Microsoft\u2019s plan all along?"
