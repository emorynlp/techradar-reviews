  "article": [
    "In a bid to combat poor quality and unrelated search results, Google has launched a new notification system that will advise users to \u201ccheck back later\u201d when more information from reliable sources becomes available.",
    "Google said it has trained its systems to discover when a topic is breaking and evolving rapidly but trustworthy sources are yet to publish materials on the subject.",
    "With the launch of the new About This Result panel, Google users will be equipped with more information about the sources likely to provide trustworthy insight into a particular topic searched online.",
    "The panel is set to aid users to make more informed decisions about the websites they visit, especially when it comes to selecting the website that is the most useful and relevant to their search.",
    "Since last year, Google has been running similar notices that inform users when the search engine has not been able to find anything that matches their search correctly.",
    "The notices will be rolled out in English in the US to begin with, with Google planning to expand into other territories and languages over the coming months, although the company did not provide any further specifics.",
    "\u201cAccessing timely, relevant and reliable information is increasingly important in our current environment,\u201d said Google in a blog post.",
    "\u201cWhile Google Search will always be there with the most useful results we can provide, sometimes the reliable information you\u2019re searching for just isn\u2019t online yet.\""
