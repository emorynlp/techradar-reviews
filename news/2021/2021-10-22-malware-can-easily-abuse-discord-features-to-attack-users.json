  "article": [
    "Cybersecurity experts have successfully demonstrated that the features of gaming-centric messaging platform Discord can easily be abused for malicious purposes.",
    "Researchers from Check Point Research (CPR) have spotted \u201cearly signs\u201d of malicious actors interested in exploiting some of Discord\u2019s most useful features to target users of the platform.",
    "\u201cThe most prominent sign is a multi-functional malware available to anyone on Github. This malware has the capability to take screenshots, download and execute additional files, and perform keylogging \u2013 all by using the core features of Discord,\u201d write CPR researchers Idan Shechter & Omer Ventura.",
    "Discord claims to have 19 million active servers per week that facilitate communication between its 150 millions active users, making it an attractive target for threat actors.",
    "As they analyzed the malware, which is written in Python, CPR researchers realized that the root of the problem is the Discord API that doesn\u2019t require any type of confirmation or approval.",
    "Since the API is open for everyone to use, threat actors can use it to program bots that can turn the platform\u2019s features for malicious purposes like malware development, botnet setups, C2 communication and malicious file hosting.",
    "Talking of malicious file hosting, a Sophos research claimed that in Q2 2021 it detected 17,000 unique malware URLs in the Discord content delivery network.",
    "\u201cBecause Discord messages are encrypted, users can\u2019t easily tell if malware is attached to their communications,\u201d says Saryu Nayyar, CEO of security vendor Gurucul.",
    "The problem however doesn\u2019t have an easy solution, and the CPR researchers believe that preventing Discord malware can\u2019t be done without harming the Discord community.",
    "\u201cAll too often, developers emphasize functionality over security, and this is an example of an exploitation that probably could have been addressed with a better software design. But the Discord platform itself has to be able to collect and analyze data in real time to look for and remediate unusual activity,\u201d believes Nayyar.",
    "While the CPR researchers suggest that it\u2019s up to the users\u2019 actions to keep their devices safe, Doug Britton, CEO of cybersecurity talent acquisition firm Haystack Solutions believes that it\u2019s time Discord does some introspection.",
    "\u201cDiscord is an amazing product but it needs to take a deep look at the trade off between open functionality and security. Relying on users to recognize malicious intent is not a sustainable solution and becoming a RAT gateway is bad for business,\u201d opines Britton.",
