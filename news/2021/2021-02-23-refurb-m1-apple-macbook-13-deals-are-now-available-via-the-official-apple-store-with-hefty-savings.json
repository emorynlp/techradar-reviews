    "If you're an avid Apple MacBook deals hunter, an incredibly compelling option has just dropped over at the official Apple store - the first-ever offerings for officially refurbished M1 Apple MacBook Pro 13's.",
    "Retailing for just $1,099 in the US and \u00a31,099 in the UK respectively, these refurbished MacBook deals are the cheapest prices yet for the latest M1 MacBook Pro 13 specifically. For perspective, this is currently a full $200 / \u00a3200 cheaper than the MSRP on new MacBook Pro 13's at Apple, so it's not an insignificant saving for those who don't mind going refurbished.",
    "If you would like to compare these refurb prices to brand new MacBook Pro deals, currently the cheapest prices we've found are at Amazon ($1,219) and Amazon UK (\u00a31,189). We've rounded up a full list of the best prices we've found on refurbished Apple MacBook Pro's just down below - with options for our readers outside the US and UK too.",
    "Refurbished products, in general, tend to have a bit of an unfair rep - especially though sold via trusted vendors like the Apple store. Most of the time the products are simply returns rather than actually defective products, so you're most likely going to receive a 'like new' item rather than a beaten-up old machine. Apple itself also rigorously tests its items before reselling and offers a full year of warranty with all MacBooks too, so the likelihood of receiving a defective product is pretty much non-existent.",
    "For more Apple refurb goodness, see our main page on the best refurbished iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch deals this week. If you'd like to do a bit more research on these excellent ultrabooks, head on over to our best MacBook deals page for an overview of the entire range - or check out even more cheap MacBook Pro deals."
