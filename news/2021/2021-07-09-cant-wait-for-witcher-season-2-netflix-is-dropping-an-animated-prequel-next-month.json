    "While WitcherCon hasn\u2019t brought us the news of The Witcher 4 we\u2019ve been dreaming of, it has given us something to look forward to \u2013 The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf.",
    "Announced by Netflix, Nightmare of the Wolf is an animated prequel film to The Witcher series on Netflix that follows Geralt\u2019s mentor Vesemir.",
    "The animation will be handled by Studio Mir, the Korean studio that animated The Legend of Korra, and looks slightly reminiscent of Netflix\u2019s other video game-based anime, Castlevania.",
    "The new show will hit Netflix on August 23, well before the arrival of The Witcher Season 2 that\u2019s coming in December of this year.",
    "Despite reaching critical levels of fame in the mid-Aughts when CD Projekt Red started putting out The Witcher video games, the series \u2013 written by Polish fantasy author Andrzej Sapkowski \u2013 has been around for well over 30 years.",
    "Between the novels and the games we know that Vesemir is the oldest living Witcher at the time Geralt is alive and acts as the fencing instructor at Kaer Morhen, and was both a father figure to Geralt and his hunting partner.",
    "The books delve pretty deep into Vesemir\u2019s past illuminating how Vesemir came to Kaer Morhen and survived a pogrom that killed many of his brothers.",
    "Nightmare of the Wolf could draw from years of backstories either of Vesemir\u2019s arrival at Kaer Morhen or the pogrom, or how Vesemir trained Geralt. Basically, there\u2019s a lot of great source material to choose from and we\u2019ll get to learn more about one of the series\u2019 best characters ahead of Season 2 of Geralt and Ciri\u2019s story."
