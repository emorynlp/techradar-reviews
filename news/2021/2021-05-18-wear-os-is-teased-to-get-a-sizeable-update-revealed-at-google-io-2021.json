  "article": [
    "New Wear OS perks will be unveiled at Google IO 2021, according to an official tweet, which could be anything from extra features to a redesign that could be coming to the operating system later this year.",
    "Google didn\u2019t hint at what\u2019s in store in its tweet by the Wear OS team, only that \u2018the time has come\u2019. That\u2019s a cute pun befitting Google\u2019s tame \u2018dad joke\u2019 humor, and could just be a simple announcement prefacing some new Wear OS perks.",
    "Given how rare Wear OS is updated, this is a big deal for folks toting smartwatches that aren\u2019t sold by Apple or Samsung. Some early scheduling details suggested an update could be coming at Google IO 2021, though it could just be Google pushing third-party app programmers to build more Tile interactions.",
    "The tweet\u2019s \u2018the time has come\u2019 message could also refer to the Google Pixel Watch, which recent leaks and rumors suggest could be announced soon. Google IO 2021 would obviously be a great stage to debut the wearable, though we\u2019ve only recently seen evidence that the device exists in the form of renders.",
    "But it could also refer to a rumored Wear OS-powered Fitbit: Google acquired the fitness wearable company in January and the company quietly started pumping more resources into the operating system in the months since, suggesting Google may introduce a new product under the Fitbit name running Wear OS. This is all conjecture, of course, and with only a day until Google IO 2021, there\u2019s little wait until the company reveals its plans.",
