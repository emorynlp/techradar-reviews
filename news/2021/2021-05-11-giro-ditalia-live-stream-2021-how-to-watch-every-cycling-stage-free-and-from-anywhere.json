    "The Giro d'Italia - in equal parts beautiful and gruelling - is underway with the first Grand Tour of the season pushing the globe's elite riders to their limits. The race for the iconic maglia rosa is on, so join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Giro d'Italia live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online from anywhere - including for FREE in some countries! We also have info on this year's Giro stage times.",
    "Nearly 3,500km of mountains, hills, sprints, ITTs and preposterously good views make up the 2021 Giro d'Italia route, which will see the riders climb a total of 47,000 metres. There are nine mountainous stages, the first four of those falling on consecutive days from Stage 6 to Stage 9.",
    "There are also gruelling summit finishes on the infamous Monte Zoncolan (Stage 14) and Sega di Ala (Stage 17), which is the riders' cruel reward for conquering Passo di San Valentino on the same stage.",
    "Tao Geoghegan Hart was the surprise winner of the pink jersey last year, but the youngster isn't defending his title this time around.",
    "Simon Yates has unfinished business here after his agonising collapse in 2018, but as he knows better than most, anything can happen in a Grand Tour. Egan Bernal is another man to watch, as are the exciting Joao Almeida and Remco Evenepoel.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a 2021 Giro d'Italia live stream from anywhere, as well as the countries where you can watch absolutely free.",
    "You can watch a FREE Giro d'Italia live stream in a few different places. In Australia, for instance, SBS Viceland is providing free coverage of the race.",
    "Or you could dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book, because anyone in Italy can watch for free on Rai Sport, and cycling fans in the UK can get the race on Welsh-language channel S4C.",
    "If you're a resident of Australia, Italy or the UK and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "As discussed above, if you're desperate to watch the Giro d'Italia but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
