    "The Google Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 6 Pro have launched, and they have pretty attractive list prices. But if you\u2019re looking across carriers and at online retailers, you might see different pricetags. Here\u2019s why the price of Google Pixel 6 deals is all over the place \u2013 and what you\u2019ll be paying.",
    "Google set a baseline price for each of its phones at the starting 128GB of storage level: $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999 for the Pixel 6, and $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,299 for the Pixel 6 Pro. Interestingly, the latter\u2019s price doesn\u2019t seem to vary much on the market \u2013 it\u2019s the Pixel 6 that\u2019s showing different pricetags among carriers and retailers.",
    "The long and short of it: Google has released different versions of the Pixel 6 which vary between the model sold in the company\u2019s online store and those provided by carriers that work with their own networks. What\u2019s different? 5G capability \u2013 and support for more bands means higher prices.",
    "For instance, the version of the Pixel 6 sold by Google itself only supports sub-6 5G (2.4G/5GHz/6GHz bands) for that $599 price, and the Pixel 6 model T-Mobile sells also comes in at that $599 level with sub-6 5G only.",
    "The other two US mega-carriers, Verizon and AT&T, both confirmed to TechRadar that the Pixel 6 models they sell connect to their respective sub-6 and mmWave networks. These versions are pricier as a result: The Verizon Pixel 6 starts at $699, while AT&T\u2019s Pixel 6 pricetag is $739.",
    "These pricetags are all broken down by installment agreements and can be hard to parse, but the prices can be defrayed, as each provider (even Google) offers different trade-in deals \u2013 Verizon, for instance, is offering up to $700 off either Pixel model if the buyer trades in their current phone. There are some caveats (older phones grant less trade-in value, and these deals require users to sign up for 5G-enabled plans), but it\u2019s still some method to save money on a brand-new phone.",
    "To preempt one worry \u2013 yes, every version of the Pixel 6 has the same specs, cameras and features. The only difference is in 5G capability and cost.",
    "The confusion started when mobile analyst Anshel Sag tweeted about an official Google support post that laid out several Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro models with varying 5G capabilities, along with which countries they\u2019d be available in. Most confusing were multiple US versions that implied the Pixel 6 would be mmWave-only \u2013 the models sold by AT&T and Verizon.",
    "Both AT&T and Verizon confirmed to TechRadar that their Pixel 6 versions work with mmWave and sub-6 5G, so it may be a case of launch day confusion or errors in the support post.",
    "Regardless, the confusion over the versions and the differences in price are worth exploring to understand which version you'll want to buy from different carriers and providers."
