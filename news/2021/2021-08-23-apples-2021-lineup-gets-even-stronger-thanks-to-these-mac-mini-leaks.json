    "Yet another Apple device could be launching later this year, with new leaks hinting that an updated Mac mini could arrive in just a few months. This means it might be revealed alongside several new devices like the iPhone 13, the Apple Watch Series 7, new Airpods, and more in a near-complete 2021 refresh of Apple\u2019s entire product range.",
    "In the latest Power On newsletter update, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman suggests that the M1X Mac mini could launch \u201cin the next few months\u201d. Many have taken that to mean that Apple could have a massive announcement event planned for September (when we expect the iPhone 13 to be unveiled) or could have another conference penciled in for later in 2021.",
    "What\u2019s more, the Mac mini leaks indicate that it might be a much more powerful device than previous models of the compact computer have been. That\u2019s because it will run on Apple\u2019s new and improved M1X chip, which is also rumored to be powering updates to the MacBook Pro line.",
    "Hopefully, this performance upgrade won\u2019t come at too much of a cost though, as the Mac mini is typically a more budget-friendly device compared to Apple\u2019s other devices. Right now we don\u2019t know anything for sure, but the leaks have us wondering how good the rumored Mac mini could be?",
    "Those who bought the 2020 revision of the Mac mini last year may be disappointed to learn an even better version is expected so soon, but for those that can afford to upgrade (or are still stuck with the 2018 and older models) will the rumored 2021 device be worth the price of admission?",
    "Right now it\u2019s tough to say as we know so little about it, but we can make some guesses based on the rumors circulating online. Leaks have indicated that the 2021 Mac mini will come with a few upgrades; most notably the M1X chip but also the addition of two new Thunderbolt ports (to give it four in total).",
    "The chip is rumored to have double the performance cores of the M1 (rising from four to eight), which should give it a substantial processing power boost over its predecessor. We\u2019ve also heard that the integrated graphics might even be able to go toe-to-toe with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 mobile graphics card found in high-end gaming laptops. We\u2019ll have to try it out for ourselves, but that could mean Apple\u2019s PCs could become a much better option for gamers.",
    "Regardless of how great the performance boost of the M1X really is over the M1, we\u2019re fairly confident we\u2019ll see the Mac mini get a price increase because of it. The 2020 Mac mini sold for $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,099 (for the model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage); we imagine an upgraded version could cost a fair bit more, probably around the $900 / \u00a3900 mark. If this is the case, the Mac mini could quickly lose its status as the budget-friendly Apple PC.",
    "We\u2019ll be sure to keep our eyes out for any more Mac mini 2021 rumors, and if it\u2019s launched later this year, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know what we think of it in our review. Until then be sure to keep checking back to keep up to date with the latest info."
