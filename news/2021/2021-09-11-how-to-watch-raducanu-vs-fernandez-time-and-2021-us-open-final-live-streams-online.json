    "Despite it being just her fourth tour-level tournament, Brit Emma Raducanu's incredible run in New York has seen her become the first British woman to reach a major final since Virginia Wade won Wimbledon in 1977, with the 18-year-old yet to lose a set on her route to this showdown.",
    "Currently ranked 73rd in the world, Fernandez's passage to tonight's clash has been arguably even more impressive, with the left-handed 19-year-old from Montreal claiming victories against four-times major winner and US champion Naomi Osaka, three-times Grand Slam winner Kerber and fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals.",
    "It really is a match no tennis fan will want to miss, so read on for your guide to live stream Raducanu vs Fernandez at the US Open from wherever you are in the world.",
    "If you're abroad during the US Open, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred tennis live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",

    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to the Channel 4 website or app"
