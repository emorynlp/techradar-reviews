  "article": [
    "The Steam Deck offers the possibility of replacing its storage, at least in theory \u2013 although Valve warns against making such a move \u2013 and even the base model with an eMMC drive may allow for an M.2 SSD upgrade. That said, there are a lot of other caveats around this even aside from Valve\u2019s aforementioned advice.",
    "This all stems from a Reddit post from someone who directly emailed Gabe Newell at Valve asking if the portable PC would have a user-replaceable SSD, and Valve\u2019s President responded that the Steam Deck features a 2230 M.2 slot.",
    "Obviously we need to be cautious around info floating down from Reddit, but it does appear that the official spec of the Steam Deck has been updated following this info spilling out. That spec now notes: \u201cAll models use socketed 2230 m.2 modules (not intended for end-user replacement).\u201d",
    "So \u2018all models\u2019 means the entry-level device, too, and this raises the prospect of upgrading the cheapest version\u2019s smaller 64GB eMMC drive with something more capacious. Of course, the presumption is that this eMMC storage is on a board inserted in the M.2 slot, given that all models apparently use \u2018socketed modules\u2019 (meaning the eMMC isn\u2019t soldered directly to the motherboard, with the M.2 socket empty \u2013 although even if that is the case, an M.2 upgrade could still be feasible).",
    "When it comes to any potential upgrade, though, the problem is the disclaimer from Valve noting that the system drive is \u201cnot intended for end-user replacement\u201d, which presumably means that the M.2 socket is buried inside the device in a way that would entail taking it all apart in a warranty-voiding manner (running the risk of breaking the Steam Deck in the process, with no recourse).",
    "Aside from that danger, there could be other stumbling blocks for those who\u2019ve heard this news and therefore might be thinking about buying the cheapest Steam Deck model with a view to subsequently upgrading the drive.",
    "Firstly, 2230 form-factor M.2 SSDs are thin on the ground and not cheap, and as Tom\u2019s Hardware, which spotted all this, observes, there may be parameters like heat levels with the drives used in the Steam Deck which a replacement may not adhere to \u2013 and it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how that might become problematic.",
    "On the software side, as well, there\u2019s the whole issue of the OS being installed on the supplied drive, and how to get that across to the new SSD. No one will really know how these kind of issues will play out until the Steam Deck arrives, and folks start trying to mod the device (and the inevitable teardowns emerge).",
    "From what we can gather here, though, your average owner will want to steer clear of trying any drive upgrade tricks for all the aforementioned reasons, if an upgrade is even viable in the first place."
