    "With remote and hybrid working becoming more widespread in recent months, the use of mobile devices such as smartphones for business purposes has become more popular than ever.",
    "Allowing us to work and collaborate on the go, wherever you may be, smartphones are now a vital part of the working set-up for employees everywhere.",
    "Yet smartphones often get forgotten when it comes to security, despite being powerful computing products that are constantly connected to the Internet, and a direct link to valuable or confidential business data. So when it comes to protecting your work mobile devices, what do you need to know?",
    "As we've mentioned, smartphones often get left behind when it comes to security, but they're a central part of our work and personal lives, so deserve to stay protected just as much as PCs or laptops do.",
    "Ensuring you have the latest security protection for your mobile devices is a key step for business users, as criminals will often target items such as smartphones, printers, and even internet routers to try and find weak links and entry routes into your home or business network.",
    "Fortunately, Bitdefender Total Security has everything you need to secure all your devices, working across multiple software versions, including Windows, macOS, Android and iOS. With up to 15 devices covered per subscription household, you can make sure all your mobile devices stay protected.",
    "It's all very well and good getting mobile security set up - but having the right multi-layered protection is what will truly keep you and your devices safe from the latest threats.",
    "Using mobile browsers can often expose your devices to threats that you might not be aware of as you would on a PC, with hackers pushing fraud and phishing attacks on unsuspecting victims.",
    "Bitdefender Total Security\u2019s anti-phishing system scans webpages and warns you when you come across fraudulent pages, even on mobile devices. The service actively filters all traffic - not just the pages you intentionally browse - and offers real-time protection against all online dangers and fraudulent pages to make sure you stay protected.",
    "If you are exposed to any online attacks or threats, it's often best to try and react fast to mitigate any possible effects quickly - particularly if valuable business data is on the line.",
    "Keeping track of all your passwords and login details can be tricky, especially if you aren't using a password manager, and all it takes is for one account to be compromised for many of your others to also be hit - especially if you re-use the same login details across multiple accounts.",
    "With Bitdefender Total Security, you can check straight from your iPhone or Android smartphone whether any of your online accounts have been involved in any data breaches. The platform's Account Privacy service also notifies you if and when any of your sensitive data is at risk, and lets you take action depending on its status.",
    "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, has become a vital work tool for many of us in recent times, allowing users to disguise your internet connection to make it seem to appear from a different country or region, meaning no one, not even your ISP, should be able to track your internet surfing or snoop on your location.",
    "But VPNs aren't just for computers - they work equally well on mobile devices too, allowing you to access location-specific content or a workplace internet connection to get the files you need.",
    "Bitdefender Total Security includes an improved Secure VPN service that offers complete online privacy - and with a 200MB/day free allowance of encrypted traffic for your Android and iOS devices, you can carry out tasks such as checking emails, online collaboration and other sensitive business tasks safely."
