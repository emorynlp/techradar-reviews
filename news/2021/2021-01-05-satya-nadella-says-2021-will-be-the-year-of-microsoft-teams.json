  "article": [
    "Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has great ambitions for his company\u2019s video conferencing software Microsoft Teams in 2021, hoping to build on last year\u2019s success. The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic led to a huge surge in popularity for the likes of Teams, Zoom, Cisco\u2019s Webex, and other similar digital tools.",
    "Now, in an interview with the Financial Times, Nadella has outlined his vision for turning Teams into a \u201cdigital platform as significant as the internet browser.\u201d Ultimately, collaboration tools like Teams could serve as the glue that holds the digital work environment together, offering meetings, chat applications, and other programs through a single, unified interface.",
    "Nadella\u2019s hopes for Teams would probably not be quite so ambitious if not for the coronavirus pandemic, which forced many businesses to adopt digital collaboration tools in order to remain functioning while social distancing measures were implemented. By the end of September, for example, the number of daily active Teams users reached 115 million, a rise of more than 100 million compared to the year previous.",
    "Microsoft moved fast to fix bugs and make improvements to Teams throughout the last year, making use of the vast amounts of feedback the company received as its user figures surged. For example, Microsoft added a Large Gallery view to facilitate bigger meetings and streamlined the call experience.",
    "However, Microsoft knows that it will need to keep iterating if Teams is to fight off stiff competition from a host of other video conferencing tools. Many of the app\u2019s rivals also added new features throughout 2020, while Salesforce\u2019s acquisition of Slack at the tail-end of last year could provide further competition in the digital collaboration space.",
    "Microsoft has begun offering Teams as a free add-on to its Office software, making it a natural choice for businesses that already pay for the productivity suite. Of course, what the world of work will look like exactly in the coming years is difficult to say. Although the pandemic has shifted workplace trends markedly, how the office will look once the pandemic recedes is anyone\u2019s guess.",
