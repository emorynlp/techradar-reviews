  "article": [
    "Spoilers for the first two episodes of Hawkeye follow. You've been warned.",
    "One of the reasons for the success and longevity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is its ability to shapeshift between genres. Over the last decade and a bit, the franchise has dabbled in space opera, political thrillers, comedy and more.",
    "But Hawkeye episode 2 takes the MCU somewhere it\u2019s never been before \u2013 for a decent chunk of its running time it could pass for a John Hughes holiday movie. Quinjets, Trains and Automobiles, anyone?",
    "As Clint Barton tries to tie up loose ends in New York and make it home in time to see his kids for Christmas, the first act puts the focus on his odd couple relationship with Kate Bishop. Double acts have been a core component of Marvel\u2019s previous Disney Plus shows \u2013 from Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and Sylvie in Loki \u2013 and the Hawkeye take on the formula has similar potential. The show even throws a cute dog, aka Lucky the Pizza Dog, into the mix for good measure.",
    "From the moment they meet, Clint\u2019s scene-it-all-before cynicism meshes perfectly with Kate\u2019s unstoppable enthusiasm",
    "\u201cSome people have actually called me the world\u2019s greatest archer,\u201d Kate tells the world\u2019s actual greatest archer.",
    "\u201cYeah, are you one of those people?\u201d comes the wonderfully barbed reply.",
    "She\u2019s found her idol, someone she believes can teach her to be the hero she longs to be, while he\u2019s run into a rookie too inexperienced to be anything but a hindrance. She\u2019s so caught up in the excitement of the moment that she\u2019s asking her favorite Avenger to autograph her bow, while he\u2019s asking if there\u2019s any way the Ronin suit could lead a bad guy to the Bishop residence.",
    "It turns out the answer is yes, as the so-called Tracksuit Mafia \u2013 a fun but sartorially inelegant addition to Marvel\u2019s rogue\u2019s gallery \u2013 arrive uninvited on Kate\u2019s doorstep with an express delivery of Molotov cocktails. Kate and Clint are soon on the run, hiding out in Kate\u2019s aunt\u2019s apartment, as his efforts to keep his new companion safe fall on deaf ears \u2013 she just has to go to work.",
    "While Hawkeye hasn\u2019t always been well served by the MCU \u2013 he spent most of the first Avengers movie possessed by Loki, for starters \u2013 this show is threatening to provide him with the sort of character overhaul that Thor: Ragnarok gave the god of thunder. Armed with extra screen time, his world-weariness is becoming an asset, and away from limelight-hogging wise crackers like Tony Stark, he\u2019s really coming into his own \u2013 he gets to be the human face of the Avengers in a way we\u2019ve never really got to see before.",
    "And throughout the scenes he shares with Kate, you can see the advantages of hiring a director with a comedy background. Banter and snark have always been integral to the MCU mix, but Saturday Night Live veteran Rhys Thomas makes sure the humor never feels forced. Whether it\u2019s Clint is questioning Kate\u2019s abilities, or she\u2019s pointing out the flaws in his minimal marketing plan for the Hawkeye brand, you feel you could spend hours in their company. Indeed, the chemistry works so well that it\u2019s a shame when the story pulls them apart, the episode going off the boil almost as soon as they separate to follow their own paths.",
    "Clint\u2019s mission to recover his Ronin suit from a LARPing (Live Action Role-Play) meet-up isn\u2019t nearly as funny as it should be \u2013 Hawkeye half-heartedly dressing up as a knight for a half-hearted duel with the new owner of the outfit is one of those ideas that probably looked better on paper than on screen.",
    "Kate, meanwhile, reluctantly goes for dinner with her mom and her new fianc\u00e9, Jack \u2013 a man who has a questionable penchant for DIY psychology, and may or may not be connected with the death of his uncle, Armand Duquesne. The family scenes lack the flow of the Kate/Hawkeye moments, with Tony Dalton playing Jack so broadly you suspect he can\u2019t be anything but a bad guy \u2013 he even has a moustache to twirl next time he brandishes his sword.",
    "So it\u2019s good news for the series \u2013 if not for Clint \u2013 when the final scene contrives to get the lead duo back in the same room. While it\u2019s debatable whether a college student would be able to track an Avenger\u2019s phone \u2013 if his phone number is classified, surely his GPS is inaccessible too? \u2013 Kate\u2019s clumsy entrance-via-skylight is a wonderfully inept way to scupper Hawkeye\u2019s carefully crafted plan to get to the heart of the Tracksuit Mafia. With five days to go until Christmas, it looks like getting home in time to carve that turkey isn\u2019t going to be as easy as it first seemed\u2026",
    "After a fun season opener, this follow-up struggles to deliver on its potential. As a comedy it works fine, with Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld instantly hitting a groove as he latest double-act to emerge from the reliable MCU conveyor-belt.",
    "As soon as they\u2019re apart, however, the story starts to flag. The plot is also in serious need of a villain slightly scarier than the played-for-laughs Tracksuit Mafia to really shake things up. Maybe the big reveal of Echo \u2013 soon to be seen in a Disney Plus TV show of her own \u2013 will be the catalyst that restores the show\u2019s momentum.",
    "New episodes of Hawkeye stream on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
