    "COVID-19 didn\u2019t change the workplace as much as you might think.",
    "The transition to distributed work was inevitable, and businesses were looking at making the shift long before the pandemic. The virus only moved up the timeline.",
    "The reality is that even then, we were living in a connected world. The quality of a business\u2019s network was foundational to its success. And the Internet of Things was gradually reshaping both the role of technology in the workplace and our relationship to it.",
    "Businesses of all sizes use sensor technology to collect valuable data from customers and staff alike, analyzing that data for potential opportunities and improvements through cloud software. Organizations support greater collaboration and productivity through digital tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. And leadership has long considered how remote staff could securely access the systems and resources necessary to work from anywhere.",
    "Most companies were, in other words, already digitizing the workplace, perhaps without even realizing what that meant.",
    "And in doing so, many made an exciting discovery.

    "On the other, your IT department is simply underequipped \u2014 and likely too understaffed \u2014 to make this happen.",
    "The good news is that you don\u2019t need to deal with any of this on your own. Aruba is here to help you take your business to the big leagues, without breaking your budget, meaning you can ensure your infrastructure works for you, rather than against you.",
