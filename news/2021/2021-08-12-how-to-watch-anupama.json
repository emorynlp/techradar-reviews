    "Following the trials and tribulations of a perfect housewife and her less than perfect day-to-day experiences, the Indian serial drama Anupama launched in mid-2020 with huge and immediate success. Now hundreds of episodes in, if you haven't got in on the action yet, there's plenty to catch up on.",
    "As one of the most-viewed Indian TV show in the world, and with similar successes worldwide, it's no wonder countless people are wondering how to watch Anupama - and where it's possible for free. So here we'll explain exactly how to make that a reality.",
    "Anupama has now become a daily part of hundreds of thousands of people's lives since its launch last year, and it seems we're universally captivated by the title character. A wife, mother, daughter and daughter-in-law all at once, Anupama (Rupali Ganguly) resonates with just about anyone who has lived in an Indian family home, and we can't get enough.",
    "Consistently underestimated by husband Vanraj (Sudhanshu Pandey) but always supported by son Samar (Paras Kalnawat), Anupama's character goes against the unfortunately common belief that women are destined only to keep a home, and we always root for her while she tries to break out of her busy routine to find work and betterment.",
    "However, it's not always easy. Antagonist Kavya (Madalsa Sharma) manipulates Vanraj and, of course, things don't usually go as Anupama expects them to \u2013 but, even with a family to look after and hurdles to overcome, she makes it through with talent and grace.",
    "Below, we'll explain exactly how to keep up with Anupama and her family \u2013 here's how to watch Anupama FREE, wherever you are in the world.",
    "If you're in India, it's super simple to watch Anupama for free, but if you're anywhere else in the world you'll find that your access to Hotstar is blocked, even if you pay for it. That means if you're outside India, you won't be able to stay up to date with Anupama.",
    "Luckily, downloading a VPN provides a simple solution. This nifty bit of kit changes your IP address, allowing you to connect to your favourite on-demand services and watch all its premium content regardless of where you\u2019re streaming from."
