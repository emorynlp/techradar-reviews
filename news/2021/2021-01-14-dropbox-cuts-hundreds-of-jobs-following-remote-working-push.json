    "Cloud storage firm Dropbox has announced significant job cuts in order to protect the company\u2019s long-term future. In total, its global workforce will be reduced by approximately 11%, equivalent to 315 members of staff.",
    "Dropbox confirmed that its decision to enable more remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that fewer resources are required to support the company\u2019s in-office environments.",
    "In order to prepare the business for a post-pandemic world, the firm stated that it needed to pull back from initiatives that do not align with its long-term strategic goals.",
    "\u201cOver the past year, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the importance of running a tight ship and getting the company ready for the next stage of growth,\u201d Dropbox CEO Drew Houston explained in a company blog post.",
    "\u201cThis will require relentless focus on initiatives that align tightly with our strategic priorities, and having the discipline to pull back from those that don\u2019t. Unfortunately, this means that we\u2019re reducing the size of some of our teams. I realize this is incredibly hard on the Dropboxers and their families who are impacted, and I take full responsibility for this decision. This is one of the toughest decisions I\u2019ve had to make in my 14 years as CEO.\u201d",
    "Dropbox shares fell following the job cut announcement but the firm has had a decent 12 months in general.",
    "As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it has seen an increase in users and posted a third quarter net income of $32.7 million, a 14% increase year-on-year. Nevertheless, many digital platforms face an uncertain future as they try to predict how the world of work will adapt once the effects of the pandemic subside.",
    "The Dropbox chief executive also revealed a list of measures to help employees affected by the job cuts, including severance and healthcare packages. In addition, it was also confirmed that the chief operating officer Olivia Nottebohm would be stepping down.",
