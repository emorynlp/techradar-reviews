    "SWOT analysis is a simple strategic planning tool that organizations can use to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their company or project - and, ultimately, form a strong business plan.",
    "SWOT stands for strengths (S), weaknesses (W), opportunities (O), and threats (T). It\u2019s one of the most commonly used tools when making decisions or analyzing a component of a business. You can use the SWOT framework to guide any type of business decision, such as repositioning your brand, launching a new product, or entering a new market.",
    "A SWOT analysis is often done in a matrix or table, divided into four categories, with a box for each of the four SWOT components. Brainstorming alone or with colleagues, make a list in each box of the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as they apply to your company or current project. Generally, strengths and weaknesses relate to internal factors within your organization while opportunities and threats are external factors. While it\u2019s not essential to differentiate, internal versus external factors can help you see which factors you have control over and which are out of your hands.",
    "By doing a SWOT analysis, you can put all of your thoughts, concerns, and ideas into a written framework.",
    "This project management tool was first developed by American management consultant Albert Humphrey in the 1960s but it\u2019s still commonly used today.",
    "A SWOT analysis is often done by someone within the company who makes strategic decisions, such as a CEO, entrepreneur, manager, or director. However, getting input from others can make the SWOT more valuable, so it doesn\u2019t need to be an exercise handled by just one individual. Think about forming a working group and inviting several members of staff for a brainstorming session. By involving staff from multiple departments, you\u2019ll get more diverse viewpoints and your analysis will carry more weight.",
    "Because it\u2019s an effective and easy-to-use tool, consider developing a SWOT analysis template that you can share with your employees for them to use as needed. That way, anyone in the business can use it when they need to solve problems, make decisions, or weigh up options.",
    "The SWOT analysis framework is designed so that it applies to any industry, so it can be used by any organization or business, including Fortune 500 companies, not-for-profits, small businesses, or universities.",
    "There are many reasons to consider using a SWOT analysis tool whenever you need to make a strategic decision. You can use it to gather your thoughts and put them all on paper, making it easier to visualize what direction you should take. This helps you collect all of your ideas, thoughts, and concerns and turn them into something orderly and tangible.",
    "It\u2019s recommended to use a SWOT analysis when you\u2019re trying to take advantage of upcoming opportunities, avoid unnecessary risks, improve your use of resources, and to better understand your market positioning. If you\u2019re ever unsure about a business decision and need some time to think things through, a SWOT analysis can help provide clarity and guidance.",
    "Also, it\u2019s a simple, basic tool that can be used anywhere, by anyone\u2014no expensive software or resources needed. Because it can be done quickly and costs nothing, one main benefit of SWOT analysis is that it\u2019s low risk but high return. Keep it as a tool in your decision-making arsenal that you can call on whenever needed.",
    "While SWOT analysis is useful for any business, large or small, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect decision-making tool. Here are a few pros and cons to consider when deciding if a SWOT analysis is right for your business.",
    "While anyone can do a great SWOT analysis without experience, it helps to know a few tips. Here are a few suggestions to help make your SWOT analysis more effective.",
    "First, go into the exercise with honesty - it\u2019ll work best if you\u2019re willing to look at the reality of your business, even if that means confronting some harsh truths. Also, be specific: ask yourself what you want to achieve with the help of your SWOT analysis. Clear goals and objectives will make the exercise work better.",
    "You\u2019ll also want to prioritize your information. Each business is sure to have plenty of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, but which ones are most important, urgent, and likely to impact your profits? These are the ones you should focus on for the purpose of your SWOT analysis. Your analysis should be made using real data, not assumptions or predictions. When it comes to threats, keep in mind that some are out of your control - think about your competitors and how their actions could impact you.",
    "A final tip: don\u2019t feel like you need to do this exercise alone. Your SWOT analysis and brainstorming session will often be more effective with several people in the room, giving you varied perspectives.",
