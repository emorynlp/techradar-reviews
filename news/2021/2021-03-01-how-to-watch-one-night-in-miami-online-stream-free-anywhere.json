    "That night, instead of celebrating, he met up with civil rights icon Malcolm X, King of Soul Sam Cooke and one of the greatest running backs of all-time, Jim Brown, in a motel room in Miami, for an evening of conversation.",
    "The four icons were friends and campaigners for racial equality, but didn't always see eye-to-eye on the matter, with Cooke in particular given a rough ride by Malcolm X. Although the foursome's conversation that night remained private, it preceded some of the most significant cultural moments in modern American history.",
    "Within weeks of the meeting, Ali renounced the name Cassius Clay, calling it a \"slave name\" and becoming Cassius X, then Muhammed Ali. It's as Cassius X that he joined the Nation of Islam, being welcomed in by Elijah Muhammad, who Malcolm X would turn his back on just weeks later.",
    "And within a year, Sam Cooke and Malcolm X were murdered.",
