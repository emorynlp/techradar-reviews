Harley, having broken up with the Joker, sets out to prove that she\u2019s a worthy villain in her own right. Her adventures along the way include her teaming up with several other DC characters, such as Poison Ivy and Clayface. There are also appearances from Batman and Mister J himself, the Joker. The show has received acclaim for its fast-paced shenanigans, insightful take on the character, and impressive voice cast.",
