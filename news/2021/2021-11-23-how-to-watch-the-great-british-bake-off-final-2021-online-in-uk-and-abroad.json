    "It'll be a close call as we return to the tent one final time for the 2021 GBBO final, and our final three bakers will need prepare to take some whisks to secure that win. But will it be Chigs, Crystelle, or Giuseppe who take the crown? Keep reading to make sure you know how to watch The Great British Bake Off Final 2021 online (or The Great British Baking Show if you're in the US) - and for free - no matter where you are.",
    "Starting with a dozen amateur bakers, Noel, Matt, Paul, and Prue have whittled it down to our three finalists, with just one more Signature, Technical, and Showstopper bake in it before this series is all done and crusted for another series.",
    "It's down to: Chigs, a newbie to the world of baking, taking up the hobby during lockdown last year; quadrilingual Crystelle, who brings interesting flavours from her heritage and travels to every one of her bakes; and Giuseppe, a Bristol-based Italian engineer who uses precision to build his delightful confectionary.",
    "While many were outraged to see Bake-Off favourite J\u00fcrgen exit the tent in last week's semi-final, it's fair to say the competition is exceptionally close, with a fair share of Star Baker accolades dusted across our finalists, as well as Paul Hollywood handshakes.",
    "With a lot at cake (sorry, not sorry), here's how to watch The Great British Bake Off Final 2021 online whether you're in the UK or abroad.",
    "We've detailed how you can watch The Great British Bake Off Final 2021 online, but bear in mind that if you're abroad at any point during this season's baking antics, you won't be able to stream from abroad or access All4.",
    "Don't chance missing a baking catastrophe thanks to geo-restrictions, though. While these restrictions may prevent you from accessing certain services and content, you can get around geo-blocks by using a VPN or Virtual Private Network. It's completely legal, very affordable, and easy to use - and it also encrypts your browsing, offering protection against cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to watch The Great British Bake Off from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location (a server in the UK in this case)",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's stream - head to All 4 and start watching The Great British Bake Off Final as if you were back at home"
