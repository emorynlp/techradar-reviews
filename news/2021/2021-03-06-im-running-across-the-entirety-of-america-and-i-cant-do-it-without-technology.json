    "In the mid-20th century, countless people travelled down US Route 66, travelling from east to west in pursuit of new fortunes. And almost exactly 95 years after the route number was designated, I\u2019m stepping foot upon the road too, albeit in a very different way.",
    "I won\u2019t give you a full history lesson here, but for the uninitiated, Route 66 started in Chicago, and travelled through eight states to end in Los Angeles nearly 4,000km or 2,500 miles down the road - it was most used during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, by people seeking their fortunes out west. It was in use from 1926 to 1985, but you can\u2019t physically travel the entirety of the road any more, as many segments have been closed - I\u2019m not travelling the thing physically, though.",
    "I\u2019m actually travelling the length of Route 66 virtually, in a series of chunks over the course of two years.",
    "You could probably class me as an amateur runner - I\u2019m certainly not a beginner, with a few half-marathons under my belt, and I go on short 8km or 13km trips a few times a week. But \u2018a few short trips per week\u2019 won\u2019t get me far on Route 66, and to manage the whole route in two years, my stamina - and knowledge of tech - is going to be tested.",
    "My decision to run Route 66 wasn\u2019t exactly a random decision. It\u2019s actually one of many challenges run by website End to End, which has other challenges too like ascending the height of Everest.",
    "The way it works, is that every time I go on a run (or walk, or cycle - you have three different modes of travel you can use), I\u2019ll log my distance on the site (using a printscreen from whatever wearable or workout-tracking app I\u2019m using as proof). Then, I\u2019ll get to see on a map of the US to see how far I am along the route.",
    "This map follows the historical Route 66, so whenever I want, I can log in and see how far I\u2019ve got (and jump into street view too). At time of writing I\u2019m on a gray road leading out of Chicago, still near the start of the route, but over time I\u2019ll venture through eight states until reaching the Santa Monica terminus.",
    "The challenge runs for two years after signing up - I\u2019ve got until February 27 2023 to reach Santa Monica Pier - which is quite a tight turn-around given the total distance.",
    "The distance End to End cites for the challenge is 2,278 miles which converts to 3,666km - I\u2019ve been using the latter measurement, simply because the wearables I test for TechRadar do. That converts to about 23.73 miles or 38.19km per week, or to break it down even further, 3.39 miles or 5.46km every single day.",
    "When looking at the overall length of Route 66, it\u2019s very easy to consider it totally traversable, but when you think about traveling 5-and-a-half kilometres every single day, it becomes a little more daunting. There aren\u2019t many rest days available there! I wish I\u2019d done that maths before excitedly signing up, but one afternoon with all my cocky post-run energy, I decided just to sign up to the longest run-route I could find.",
    "So now I\u2019ve got to run roughly three times further per week than I used to, and keep this pace going for 24 months. Fun!",
    "And why am I not running the physical Route 66? Sadly, I don\u2019t live in the US, which rather rules it out, though given how beautiful some stretches of the track look, I really wish I could. Otherwise the first thing I\u2019d do would be, as Chuck Berry sang, to get my kicks on Route 66.",
    "Luckily, I\u2019m quite tech\u2019d up, which will (hopefully) be super useful for my two-year venture. I frequently test smartwatches and fitness trackers, and what I don\u2019t get loaned for review purposes, I can buy thanks to TechRadar\u2019s myriad guides on the best tech for various purposes.",
    "There\u2019s no way I - or anyone else for that matter - would be able to do such a challenge without tech (well, other than going on the actual Route 66, of course). Thanks to smartwatches, fitness trackers, or just smartphone apps, anyone can easily track how far they run, which is vital for logging the journey on the End to End website.",
    "I'm crossing my fingers that these trackers are accurate too - while a smartwatch being 1% inaccurate for a short run might seem inconsequential, over 4,000km that\u2019s a whopping 40km difference - extra distance I really don\u2019t want to run!",
    "But tech is more important than that: smartwatches can help us when we\u2019re out and about to keep tabs on our health; headphones can help us keep pace with music or distract from long runs with podcasts; smartphones can capture the scenic places visited and provide on-the-fly mapping information.",
    "I\u2019m hoping my use of tech makes this challenge easier and safer, and hopefully it\u2019ll also get me to appreciate all the gadgets we use every day.",
    "This article isn\u2019t going to be the first documenting my trans-American expedition - I\u2019m going to be writing fortnightly columns detailing my observations, on subjects from wearables to wireless headphones, photography to foodology and more.",
    "Hopefully my observations will be interesting to fellow amateur runners, and I also expect it\u2019ll make me better at testing all the fitness tech I use - but there\u2019s another, more personal (or is that cynical?) reason.",
    "I\u2019m prone to signing up to big ventures, either in spirit (like convincing myself that I\u2019m going to learn banjo) or in person (like signing up for this Route 66 run), then chickening out at the first sign of hardship (having to pay money for a banjo, realising banjo isn\u2019t as cool as I think it is).",
    "If I\u2019m documenting my running challenge for a regular TechRadar column, though, I\u2019m much less likely to give up halfway through - in fact, it\u2019s literally my job to keep going (I\u2019ll tell myself that, at least).",
    "This is the first of many posts, but when more are written, they\u2019ll be shared here, so you can easily find them and learn from, or laugh at, my pursuits."
