    "Pok\u00e9mon Go developer Niantic has hinted at the future of the mega-popular mobile game, suggesting that \"exciting things are in the works.\"",
    "In an exclusive interview with TechRadar, lead product manager for augmented reality (AR) at Niantic, Kjell Bronder, described the company\u2019s ambition to reach the multiplayer potential of the mobile game first established by its launch trailer back in 2016.",
    "\u201cIf you look at that original Pok\u00e9mon Go trailer,\u201d Bronder said, \u201cyou'll see that there's a lot of stuff in there we still want to do.\u201d This coincides with the launch of Niantic\u2019s new developer platform, Niantic Lightship, which aims to bring a host of new AR capabilities to market \u2013 suggesting Pok\u00e9mon Go could be set for a major update very soon.",
    "In the interview, Bronder described the new functionalities made possible by the company\u2019s latest technology, among them real-time mapping, semantic segmentation and a more robust multiplayer experience.",
    "The former aims to more accurately superimpose virtual objects onto the real world using smartphone cameras, essentially adding physics to virtual objects. \u201cTo better augment reality, objects have to act naturally or behave as you would expect, so real-time mapping allows software to better understand your environment,\u201d said Bronder.",
    "In the same vein, semantic segmentation allows virtual objects to look, feel and move in realistic ways. Niantic says Lightship can automatically segment different natural outdoor objects in a scene, enabling AR content to interact with specific surfaces. It\u2019s not hard to imagine the above concept video being applied to virtual Pok\u00e9balls bouncing around real-life urban spaces, and it\u2019s a feature we could see introduced into the game in the near future.",
    "A second Niantic source added that the goal is to keep the Pok\u00e9mon Go universe \u201calive and vibrant\u201d \u2013 which somewhat douses the flames on rumors of an outright sequel \u2013 but that the developer intends to add the \u201camazing multiplayer battles\u201d debuted in the game\u2019s original concept video.",
    "That focus on multiplayer is perhaps the most exciting addition we expect to see added to Pok\u00e9mon Go in future updates.",
    "With Niantic\u2019s new Lightship technology, the game may soon be capable of allowing eight players to share the same AR experience, with peer-to-peer messaging features introduced to better cultivate a sense of community among users.",
    "\u201cThere's nothing that's going to bring a virtual object to life more than if multiple people are seeing the same thing at the same time,\u201d Bronder said in the interview. \u201cBut you have to actually understand the pose of all the different devices that are looking at that same scene. You're overlaying on top of the real world, so it's more important than ever that you have real-time communication to keep all of the different objects in sync.\u201d",
    "In the above concept video, Niantic demonstrates software which allows individual users to throw and catch virtual objects with one another \u2013 again, a feature that seems primed to work well with the real-time visual exchange of Pok\u00e9balls.",
    "Could we potentially see the explosive Pok\u00e9mon duels fictionalized in the game\u2019s early trailers become a reality, then? It certainly seems a possibility, especially if these concept clips represent ready-to-go technology.",
    "In any case, with the launch of its new developer platform \u2013 now in the private beta stage \u2013 it\u2019s safe to expect some major Pok\u00e9mon Go updates are on the way soon. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to do,\u201d Bronder added, \"and we're working on more than a dozen games.\u201d",
    "Let\u2019s hope a new version of Pok\u00e9mon Go is among them."
