    "While Apple has announced the iPhone 13, iPad (2021), iPad mini (2021), Apple Watch Series 7 and more, it also confirmed that watchOS 8 is landing on September 20.",
    "That\u2019s not all, you\u2019ll also be able to grab iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and tvOS 15 on the same day, so even if you\u2019re not planning on pre-ordering any of Apple\u2019s new hardware, you\u2019ll at least be able to enjoy some new software.",
    "With the new Apple Watch featuring a whole new design, watchOS 8 is a more refined release this time, building on past features while redesigning others.",
    "While it's a small on features this year for the Apple Watch, it's more on refining existing ones while introducing new watch faces, such as fitness updates for cycling, Portrait Mode and a new Mindful app to replace the Breathe app.",
    "To make sure your device is ready to update to these latest versions, make sure that your iPhone is connected to your Apple Watch by checking in Settings > Bluetooth, and that it's already updated to iOS 15.",
    "Once watchOS 8 is available to download, go to the Watch app > General > Software Update and it should be ready to download and install to your Apple Watch."
