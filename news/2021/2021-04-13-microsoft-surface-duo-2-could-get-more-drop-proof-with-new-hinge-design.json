  "summary": "Impact-resistant hinge could be a very useful improvement",
  "article": [
    "Microsoft\u2019s Surface Duo 2 could be a more robust device with a redesigned hinge, when (or indeed if) the rumored device eventually arrives.",
    "That\u2019s one possible theory going by a patent for an impact-resistant hinge that could be destined for the purported dual-screen sequel, filed by Microsoft and published on April 8, as spotted by German tech site Windows United.",
    "The patent (for an unspecified foldable) describes \u201cbumpers (e.g., grommets) including an impact resistant member \u2026 affixed to the first and/or second portions [screens] near the hinge to absorb any impact between the portion(s) and the hinge.\u201d",
    "In other words, should the dual-screen device be dropped, the idea is that this more robust hinge will better absorb any impact, and be less likely to result in damage to either of the display portions.",
    "As ever, the patent goes into great detail describing different variations in the way that the impact-resistant member might be realized, or connected to the hinge. There\u2019s no guarantee that any of these ideas will ever see the light of day, though, if research and testing doesn\u2019t pan out as Microsoft would like.",
    "The original Surface Duo hinge is already well-liked, mind you, and we enthused about the solidity and slick feel it gives the device, but still \u2013 there are doubtless ways it might be improved, with additional durability seeming like a useful avenue to explore.",
    "The Surface Duo 2 itself remains just a rumor, of course, and might never come out. Although we\u2019ve been hearing a fair bit about it lately, including the possibility of a launch later this year (keep your heap of preferred condiments handy). There\u2019s been some leakage around potential features, such as 5G support and improvements to the camera.",
