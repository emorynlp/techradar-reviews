    "What to know what time the Falcon and Winter Soldier finale is landing on Disney Plus? You can watch episode 9 of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, the Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes-fronted spin-off, on Friday, April 23. Expect a big finale, too, as the Flag Smashers plan a fresh assault on the Global Repatriation Council \u2013 and Sam hopefully takes up the Captain America shield on a permanent basis.",
    "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier episode 6 should bring disgraced government-endorsed Captain America John Walker back into the story, too \u2013 episode 5's mid-credits sequence teased Walker forging his own shield, meaning we could see him take on the US Agent persona from the Marvel comics in this next episode.",

    "Now, they're facing threats both new and old, including the Flag Smashers, Bucky's old enemy from Captain America: Civil War \u2013 Helmut Zemo \u2013 and a new Captain America. Hey, nobody said it would be easy for them despite their return.",
