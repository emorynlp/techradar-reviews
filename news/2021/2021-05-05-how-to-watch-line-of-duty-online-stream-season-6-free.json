  "article": [
    "It's official, season six is all over. AC-12 has done its work, rounded up the bent coppers and wrapped everything up in a neat police tape bow. But that doesn't mean it is too late to watch it! We detail below how you can watch Line of Duty season 6 online, and enjoy all seven episodes free in the UK and stream them from anywhere in the world.",
    "Whether you're all up to date and simply want to rewatch all of the season six madness, you're tuning in from the start or you're in a country where episodes are still going live, we've got everything you need to know about Arnott, Hastings, Kate and a host of new faces.",
    "Amongst those new faces is eager detective constable Chloe Bishop who is trying to prove herself to her somewhat dysfunctional anti-corruption teammates. This season puts the focus on Jo Davidson, a seasoned detective on a murder case over a controversial journalist.",
    "The events of season five means the dynamic is a little awkward, but our favourite bent copper-catching trio Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), DI Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) and DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) are back on the case - but even they're struggling to know what to make of DCI Davidson.",
    "Jo has been handed the reins for the investigation into the murder of Gail Vella, an investigative journalist. It's a high-profile case that has left detectives scratching their heads for a year, but when new information about a potential suspect comes to light, Jo's bizarre conduct makes it appear as if she doesn't intend to bring Vella's killer to justice after all.",
    "Is Jo up to no good, or she actually on the right side of the line? We've explained how to watch all of Line of Duty season 6 online from anywhere \u2013 and completely FREE on the BBC for those located in the UK.",
    "For anyone abroad right now wanting to watch Line of Duty, you\u2019ll likely either be flat-out unable to watch series 6 due to annoying regional restrictions, or have to sign up to another regional streaming provider.",
    "Fortunately, there\u2019s a simple solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream Line of Duty online no matter where you are. The simple bit of software changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home."
