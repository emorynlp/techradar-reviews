    "With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 (along with their predecessors) Samsung already has more foldable phones on the market than other companies, but it looks like this might just be the beginning, with new models and whole new form factors possibly in the works.",
    "The company has launched a site highlighting various different uses for flexible OLED screens, and as well as the designs we\u2019ve seen so far, the site also shows a \u2018Slidable Flex\u2019 design, which appears to be a flat display that can be extended by pulling the edges, and a \u2018Rollable Flex\u2019 screen which can unfurl from a tube.",
    "Then there\u2019s also the \u2018Flex Note\u2019, which is less interesting as it\u2019s basically just the Galaxy Z Fold design turned on its side, for more of a laptop-like look.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung hasn\u2019t confirmed it\u2019s working on phones with any of these designs \u2013 they\u2019re simply possible use cases of its flexible OLED screen tech. Still, the fact that they\u2019ve been shown here suggests the company might at least be considering them.",
    "Then again, the word \u2018phone\u2019 isn\u2019t actually used alongside any of these displays, so they could just as well be used in TVs, laptops, or other gadgets. So don\u2019t get your hopes up about seeing a rollable Samsung phone anytime soon, but don\u2019t count it out either.",
    "Samsung isn\u2019t the only company exploring rollable phones, as we\u2019ve also seen rollable phone concepts from the likes of TCL, while we even went hands on with the rollable Oppo X 2021.",
    "LG reportedly even came very close to putting one (dubbed the LG Rollable) on sale, before abruptly exiting the smartphone market.",
    "So it seems that rollable phones could be the next step in smartphone design, and by the looks of things Samsung might have some competition in the space, though when we\u2019ll actually be able to buy such a phone still isn\u2019t entirely clear."
