  "article": [
    "In a bid to tempt users over to its network, Verizon is now offering up to a whopping $1,000 for those making the switch from another carrier - easily the best Verizon deal of this type yet.",
    "Eligible when you buy a select device on a new unlimited line, the carrier will now give you up to $1,000 with a prepaid MasterCard to help you pay off your bill with a maximum sum that's literally double what's normally offered. You can also get this saving for each new line you switch over too, meaning it's possible to bundle in a ton of savings in total.",
    "Bear in mind this Verizon switching deal only applies to eligible unlimited plans and with select device purchases only. If you're planning on bringing your own device the current maximum saving is $500 by comparison. Eligible devices include the iPhone 13 series, the Google Pixel 6 series, the Galaxy S21 series, and a few others too. You can see this weekend's best Verizon deals just below if you'd like to see current trade-in rates.",
    "Our fingers are crossed that this switching promotion stays in place for this year's upcoming Verizon Black Friday deals. If it does, there could not only be fantastic trade-in and other deals to consider, but some nice further incentives to consider Verizon over rival carriers.",
    "Note: several devices are currently facing rather lengthy backorder queues right now due to demand - you can still place an order and secure a deal, however.",
    "Want to see more? Head on over to our main weekly Verizon deals roundup. If you'd like to read about the upcoming sales events, check out our guide to this year's Black Friday deals."
