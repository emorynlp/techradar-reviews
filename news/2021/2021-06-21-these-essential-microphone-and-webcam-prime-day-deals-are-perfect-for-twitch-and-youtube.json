    "While the gaming PC or laptop hardware required for streaming can be fairly demanding (there therefore expensive), your accessories don't need to cost a small fortune. This may seem surprising given how many streamers are seen sporting some outrageously pricey equipment, but you really don't need to be dropping stacks of cash when you get started. Many streamers choose to avoid using a gaming headset entirely in favor of some powerful headphones or wireless earbuds. This is usually because using a dedicated USB microphone will grant you far better results than anything on a headset, but that doesn't mean the quality of gaming headsets is by any means terrible \u2013 many streamers start their careers using a headset before investing in better equipment. And of course, let's not forget other important bits of kit, such as RGB lighting. We would say we're joking, but the truth is, 'set dressing' and making you look your best is just as important to some folks given you're broadcasting to a live audience.",
