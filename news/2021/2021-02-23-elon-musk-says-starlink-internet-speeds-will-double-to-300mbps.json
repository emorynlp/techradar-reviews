    "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has promised that the company\u2019s satellite-based internet service Starlink will see a huge boost to its speeds \u201clater this year,\u201d \u2013 encouraging news for anyone who\u2019s put down a deposit on a Starlink beta kit after the company recently opened pre-orders to the public.",
    "Musk made the claim in a tweet, replying to a user who posted their internet speeds following initial setup of the dish and router, saying: \u201cSpeed will double to ~300Mb/s & latency will drop to ~20ms later this year.\u201d",
    "Starlink recently expanded its beta testing program, inviting members of the public to put down a $99 deposit on a kit that includes the dish antenna and router.",
    "The user Musk was replying to had mentioned earlier in the same thread that their original speed test clocked in at 77Mbps with a latency of 44ms. They later ran a test which saw the speed increase to 130Mbps, with the caveat that they were standing next to the router when performing it.",
    "Currently, Starlink\u2019s website promises internet speeds of around 50 to 150Mbps, which is in line with the Twitter user\u2019s speed tests. Musk\u2019s comments also echo claims on the website that speeds are set to \u201cimprove dramatically\u201d as the Starlink network grows.",
    "However, let\u2019s keep in mind that this is Elon Musk we\u2019re talking about, who has made more eccentric claims in the past, like making the Tesla Roadster a hover car, and saying he\u2019s 70% sure he\u2019ll be moving to Mars.",
    "That said, Musk\u2019s comments on the improvements to Starlink internet speeds are grounded in reality \u2013 300Mbps isn\u2019t unheard of \u2013 but given his track record of eccentricities it\u2019s worth taking his predictions with a grain of salt.",
    "Replying to another tweet asking about Starlink\u2019s coverage map, he said: \u201cMost of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then it\u2019s about densifying coverage.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s a lofty goal, sure, and in the same Twitter thread Musk went on to talk about how cellular internet is better for densely populated areas, while Starlink was better suited to places with low to medium population densities \u2013 so villages or rural areas that can\u2019t access fast and reliable internet via mast-based or cabled networks.",
    "While some were initially skeptical about Musk\u2019s plans for a space-based internet service, Starlink has shown that it isn\u2019t just smoke and mirrors. SpaceX has been hard at work on the project, and it accounts for roughly a quarter of all satellites currently in orbit. The end goal is to have a total of 12,000 satellites providing cheap, high-speed internet with planet-wide coverage.",
    "Starlink\u2019s achievements so far are laid out in its Application for ETC Designation. In it, the company states that over 10,000 users are already benefiting from Starlink\u2019s public beta program, enjoying speeds above the expected baseline.",
    "If you\u2019re keen to try out Starlink for yourself, you can put down a $99 deposit at SpaceX\u2019s website for the antenna and router kit \u2013 the full price is $499. The kits are available on a \u201cfirst come, first served basis\u201d to a limited number of people in each coverage area. This means that depending on where you live, if your order is accepted you could be waiting until mid-to-late 2021 or 2022 to get your kit.",
    "It remains to be seen if Starlink can deliver on these promised speed improvements, but we'd love to see Musk making good on his promise to bring better internet access to areas that are currently poorly served."
