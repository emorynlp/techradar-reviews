    "We\u2019ve already seen a few images of the possible iPhone 13 Pro design, but now we\u2019re getting our first look at what\u2019s apparently the \u2018finalized version\u2019, meaning this should be exactly what the phone looks like when it ships in September.",
    "That\u2019s according to LeaksApplePro, who shared a few unofficial renders of this apparently final model. Tthey added that some things could still be changed during mass production, but that they don\u2019t think this is likely.",
    "In any case, the design shown here looks similar to what we\u2019ve seen in previous leaks, albeit possibly with a slightly smaller camera bump. LeaksApplePro claims that the notch has been heavily reduced, as rumored, and that the stainless steel frame will be less prone to picking up fingerprints than on the iPhone 12 Pro.",
    "They also claim that the camera bump is getting larger but flatter, and that the camera sensors are increasing in size too.",
    "While we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt, given that we\u2019re seeing roughly the same design in every recent leak it\u2019s likely that this is broadly accurate, suggesting that not much will visually be changing from the iPhone 12 range.",
    "Indeed, most leaks so far paint the upcoming models more as \u2018S\u2019 phones than big upgrades, so there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll actually land as the iPhone 12S range. We\u2019ll likely find out for sure in September, as that\u2019s probably when the new phones will land.",
