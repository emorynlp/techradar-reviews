    "Last month Apple couldn\u2019t keep its new Beats Studio Buds a secret \u2013 and now, Samsung is having the same problem with the next Samsung Galaxy Buds 2.",
    "Over the weekend, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2\u2019s price leaked \u2013 pointing to a EUR 180 and EUR 200 price range (around $225 / \u00a3160 / AU$300) \u2013 and now-prominent leaker Evan Blass has posted three 360-degree GIFs of the buds on Twitter. (Update: The tweets have since been taken down removing the GIFs.)",
    "What the tweets showed, importantly, was that the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 will come in four colors: black, white, purple and green.",
    "The inside of the case will match whatever color you\u2019ve chosen, but no matter which hue you choose, the outside will still be plain white.",
    "In terms of new design features, the Galaxy Buds 2 look like they have two sets of microphones on the outside and a proximity sensor on the inside for automatic play/pause. The exterior microphones indicate that the next earbuds will offer true active noise cancellation instead of active noise reduction found on the original Samsung Galaxy Buds \u2013 however, we can\u2019t confirm that to be the case just based on yesterday's GIFs.",
    "As of right now, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 are looking like proper AirPods Pro rivals \u2013 especially if they indeed offer active noise cancellation. The price point aligns with what Apple charges for its true wireless earbuds, and they\u2019re a bit more\u2026 er, standard-looking than the bean-shaped Samsung Galaxy Buds Live that dropped last year.",
    "Where Apple may still hold the advantage over Samsung is in its use of Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos, something we\u2019ve yet to see on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds. Samsung has usually combated Apple on the sound quality front by using its proprietary Samsung Scalable Codec that offers higher bitrate streaming over Bluetooth than the standard SBC codec, but that might not be enough now that Apple and Sony have moved into the spatial audio space.",
    "It\u2019s also unclear what\u2019s going to happen to Samsung\u2019s other earbuds when the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 come out. As of right now, it looks like they\u2019ll sit on top of the lineup above the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus and the original Galaxy Buds \u2013 but that\u2019s a lot of true wireless earbuds to have under one roof.",
    "Of course, we\u2019ll find out all the details on the buds at the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event that will take place on August 11 at 10 am ET / 7 am PT / 3 pm GMT."
