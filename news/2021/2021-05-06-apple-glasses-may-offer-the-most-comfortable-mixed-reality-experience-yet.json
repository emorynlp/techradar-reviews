    "Apple\u2019s rumored augmented reality (AR) project, the Apple Glasses, may benefit from a comfort-enhancing feature that will set them apart from other mixed reality displays on the market \u2013 the ability to automatically adjust brightness.",
    "A recent company patent, as spotted by AppleInsider, details an \"electronic device with [an] adaptive display\u201d that uses \"control circuitry\" to gather physiological attributes from the user\u2019s eyes and adjust display brightness accordingly.",
    "While it\u2019s not entirely clear what \"control circuitry\" refers to here, Apple\u2019s proposal does detail an ambient light sensor capable of detecting measurements such as \u201cblink rate, pupil size and eye openness\u201d.",
    "It\u2019s also unclear whether this technology refers to Apple\u2019s AR or VR project \u2013 the company reportedly has both in the works \u2013 with \u201celectronic device\u201d clarified only as a \u201chead-mounted device\u201d in the patent. With the latter expected to arrive first, though, it\u2019s a safe bet to assume the Apple Glasses will also benefit from the feature.",
    "In any case, given the frustrating degree of eye adjustment demanded of any user of any mixed reality headset available right now \u2013 Apple calls it \u201cdazzle and discomfort\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s likely that both devices will come equipped with the ability to automatically adjust brightness.",
    "While the patent is primarily concerned with how the \"dynamic range of a head-mounted display may be perceived as insufficient depending on the adaptation state of the user's eyes\" \u2013 in other words, improving comfort \u2013 the technology could also represent an innovative power-saving method.",
    "That same ambient light sensor \u2013 while used primarily to track and change light levels \u2013 could double as a way to dim certain areas of the mixed reality experience not in sight of the user, thus sparing power.",
    "Official details regarding Apple\u2019s mixed reality projects are few and far between, with most reports conflating AR and VR and therefore making it difficult to determine which features are rumored for which device.",
    "There have been reports exclusive to the Apple Glasses, though, with one of the most exciting referring to a device \u2013 called Apple Glass \u2013 capable of displaying information on both lenses, controlled via user gestures both on and in front of the frames.",
    "We\u2019ve also heard mutterings that the AR glasses could arrive with LiDAR tracking \u2013 of the sort used in autonomous vehicle development \u2013 and up to six lenses, though it\u2019s unclear whether this refers to optical glass or camera lenses.",
    "As for their release date, don\u2019t expect to see the Apple Glasses any time before 2023. The latest reports suggest the project remains in the early stages of development, and will almost certainly be preceded by an Apple VR headset that could arrive as early as next year.",
    "We do know for sure, however, that Tim Cook and co. are working on a lineup of products designed to \u201cblow you away\u201d over the next few years \u2013 so it seems a sure bet to expect Apple will offer an exciting answer to the mixed reality question.",
