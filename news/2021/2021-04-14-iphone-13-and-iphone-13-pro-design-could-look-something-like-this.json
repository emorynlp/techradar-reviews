    "It\u2019s unlikely we will see the iPhone 13 unveiled at the now officially announced Apple Spring Loaded event, and we currently expect Apple\u2019s next smartphone to debut in September this year.",
    "While the phones may be a while away, renders based on leaked information are already showing us what the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro could look like.",
    "The images have been shared by 91Mobiles and MySmartPrice, and while they aren\u2019t official renders they are based on rumored information from those website\u2019s sources. The biggest change we can see so far is the fact the notch looks smaller than on previous devices.",
    "It\u2019s worth taking these images with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s likely the official design of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro will probably look slightly different, but if you\u2019ve been struggling to visualize what the notch and camera layouts might look like these should help.",
    "The renders give us an idea of what the shell might look like, though there are a few rumored details that are missing. The front display will reportedly feature a 120Hz refresh rate, though this may only be on the iPhone 13 Pro.",
    "One Apple patent has previously suggested we could even see rates as high as 240Hz on a future iPhone.",
    "Similarly, while we see what the cameras may look like, we don\u2019t get a feel for what they\u2019re capable of from the renders. The iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s ultra-wide camera could be bumped up to a f/1.8, six-element lens and could feature a telephoto lens that can achieve up to 2.5x optical zoom too.",
    "As for the internals, we could see some versions of the iPhone 13 come with 1TB of storage, as well as your usual battery life and performance upgrades from the previous iPhone 12. Finally, if you were already sad to see the headphone port removed, you could see a portless iPhone 13 released - where the only way to charge it would wirelessly."
