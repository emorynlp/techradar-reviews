    "Smart rings are a convenient, unobtrusive way to track all kinds of health metrics, including heart rate, temperature and activity levels \u2013 so why are so many of us still sticking with chunky smartwatches and cumbersome fitness trackers? To find out, TechRadar spoke to Harpreet Singh Rai, CEO of Oura Health, which has sold more than 500,000 rings to date and recently took part in a study to detect signs of Covid-19 several days before a person tests positive for the virus.",
    "Oura Health began in Finland in 2014, and announced its first-generation smart ring on Kickstarter at the end of 2015. Rai wasn\u2019t one of the founders \u2013 in fact, he was working on Wall Street at the time \u2013 but a chance meeting in a grocery store led to him taking the helm.",
    "Rai studied mechanical engineering at university, working on projects including an accelerometer and a neural probe, but after graduating he moved into investment banking to help clear his student debt. The decision was good for his financial situation, but terrible for his health. \u201cI gained 50lb in my first year,\u201d he says, \u201cand honestly, the hours were brutal. For the first time in my life, I wasn\u2019t sleeping well and I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d",
    "It took such a toll that he eventually switched to a different role in investment banking, which gave him a much better work life balance. The change was profound. He soon lost the excess weight, and started learning more about his own body \u2013 particularly how it was affected by sleep.",
    "\u201cI started reading some of the most fascinating things, like how all your muscle repair actually happens in your sleep, and all your memories are formed,\u201d he says. \u201cLiterally, in REM sleep, your brain replays memories from the previous day at three times the speed to help you learn. And there are even things like natural killer T-cells that fight off cancer in your sleep.\u201d",
    "It was something he\u2019d never paid attention to before, and that newfound curiosity, combined with his background in mechanical engineering, really piqued his interest in the Oura ring. \u201cI tried the product, and it was the first one where I thought the data actually felt right,\u201d he says.",
    "He\u2019d only been wearing the ring for two or three weeks, when he happened to bump into one of the company\u2019s Finnish co-founders in a New York branch of Whole Foods. \u201cHe was like, \u2018That\u2019s the first Oura ring I\u2019ve seen outside the office!\u2019\u201d Rai recalls.",
    "The two spent most of the following day together, discussing the company\u2019s future. \u201cThey were trying to raise money, and having a bit of a hard time. I\u2019d spent 10 years on Wall Street, and I\u2019d worked at a hedge fund investing in companies \u2013 mainly public companies, but some privates in the tech space too, and I decided to invest and help them raise their series A. I joined the board, and then about three months after, they asked me to join full-time as president to help grow the business.\u201d",
    "Shortly after, the board and founders asked him to take charge as CEO \u2013 and things have accelerated from there.",
    "So why choose a ring rather than a watch? As Rai explains, heart rate data from the finger tends to be more accurate than that from the wrist. \u201cBlood vessels on the finger are closer to the surface, and the pulse signal is about 100 times stronger than on the wrist \u2013 and that\u2019s probably the part that most customers don\u2019t know,\u201d Rai says.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s the same reason why every heart rate monitor and SPO2 in hospitals measures from the finger. And those are wired. It\u2019s not a power thing \u2013 it\u2019s just the quality of that signal. The signal-to-noise ratio.\u201d",
    "Measuring from the finger also means you can measure heart rate continuously without using a lot of power. \u201cA lot of wrist-based wearables don\u2019t [measure continuously] \u2013 they sample, then sampling turns off and they extrapolate the data,\u201d Rai says. \u201cYou know, if an Apple Watch ran in workout mode sampling at 60Hz, it would probably die in about three to six hours. We sample at 250Hz continuously all through the night, and we do that for almost six nights in a row without the battery having issues.",
    "\u201cI think the quality of the data manifests itself in the research,\u201d he says, \u201cWe just published a sleep staging paper for our new algorithm developments that shows we\u2019re more accurate than any other wearable out there, including our previous generations, and including Fitbit and Garmin.\u201d",
    "Oura has partnered with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) to put that data to use in a study to determine whether data from a wearable sensor can show that a person is developing Covid-19, even if their symptoms are subtle.",
    "\u201cThe data that UCSF published looks astounding \u2013 for 70% of the people analyzed who were positive, you could see significant changes in their data three days in advance. For the remaining cohort, 14% was basically one to two days in advance, and 10% the same day.\u201d",
    "So if a smart ring gives superior data, why aren\u2019t there more of them? According to Rai, there are three main reasons \u2013 one of which is simply the difficulty of getting components that will fit. You can\u2019t simply buy sensor modules from a supplier as you can if you\u2019re building a watch.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re Fitbit, Apple, Samsung, Garmin or Whoop, you typically end up buying those modules for certain features on the hardware side,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to make a heart rate sensor, you talk to Xiaomi, maybe Maxim on the component side. They normally have modules established, with firmware already working.\u201d",
    "Rai already knew all these companies, and had invested in similar ones during his time at the hedge fund. He therefore also knew their limitations.",
    "\u201cWhen you buy modules from these companies, they often come in building blocks of a certain size and power consumption, and if you want to do anything outside of that \u2013 something that needs, let\u2019s say, smaller space \u2013 you\u2019ll have to assemble the components one by one, and make your own modules to bring those features. And that takes a lot of time. That\u2019s the challenge.\u201d",
    "The second difficulty is the manufacturing side. \u201cThere\u2019s more space for a watch,\u201d Rai says. \u201cYou know, you can get screwdrivers and things like that, and they\u2019re really tiny, but it\u2019s much harder on a ring. You have to make your own manufacturing process \u2013 it\u2019s not like there are ready-made manufacturing processes off the shelf.\u201d",
    "Finally, Rai says, there\u2019s the difficulty of persuading customers that a ring has more value than a watch \u2013 it\u2019s not just a different form factor.",
    "\u201cI think some of the earlier smart ring companies didn\u2019t necessarily have as much of a product-market fit,\u201d he explains. \u201cI think Ringly was one pretty early on, and I think that the idea of just phone notifications would have probably done way better. I think it was just a little too early for its time. I think Motiv was another player that just went out of business, but I think they had a lot of manufacturing issues that led to poor signal quality and high return rates.\u201d",
    "There as also several smart ring brands working on NFC for payments, but again Rai says there are hurdles when it comes to adoption. \u201cIt\u2019s been slower than they want, but in Europe it\u2019s nice to see that actually accelerating much better. In Japan too, but I think a single-purpose hardware device is probably a smaller audience right now. Hopefully things can grow in the future, though.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s still early days for smart rings, but there\u2019s a chance that the competition could soon heat up. Earlier this year, Fitbit registered a patent suggesting that it may be developing \u201ca ring for optically measuring biometric data\u201d \u2013 specifically focusing on blood oxygen levels. That certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee that a Fitbit Ring is in the horizon, but it would make a lot of sense if the company wants to improve the quality of its data.",
    "It will have a tough job catching up with Oura though. We\u2019re currently testing the ring ourselves, and early signs are very promising \u2013 the overall experience is polished, and the data is impressive \u2013 particularly when it comes to measuring sleep stages throughout the night. We\u2019ll bring you a full review very soon."
