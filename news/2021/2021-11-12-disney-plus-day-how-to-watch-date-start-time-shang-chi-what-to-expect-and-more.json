    "Disney Plus Day has landed and the streaming platform\u2019s second anniversary celebrations on Friday, November 12 brought with them plenty of birthday treats for fans.",
    "With Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and National Geographic \u2013 not to mention Disney\u2019s own properties \u2013 falling under the Disney Plus Day banner, this was always going to be an event with plenty to talk about.",
    "Highlights included first looks at upcoming Marvel TV shows Moon Knight, She-Hulk and Ms Marvel, news of a follow-up to the hit X-Men TV cartoon from the \u201990s, and a behind-the-scenes video from the Obi-Wan Kenobi TV show.",
    "We were also gifted a first-look image from the eagerly anticipated Hocus Pocus 2, trailers for Big Hero 6 spin-off Baymax, and news of a new live-action Spiderwick Chronicles adaptation. Beatles fans also got to see a new clip from Peter Jackson\u2019s documentary, Get Back.",
    "With the streamer also making some high profile releases for Disney Plus Day \u2013 including Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings and a new Boba Fett documentary \u2013 this was also going to be a day long remembered. Here\u2019s everything that happened\u2026",
    "If Disney Plus Day has whetted your appetite for a piece of the streaming action, you\u2019re in luck. From now until November 14, Disney is offering a one-month subscription for just $1.99/\u00a31.99. Given that it usually costs $7.99/\u00a37.99 per month, and with all of the content available on the platform, this is a major bargain that you won\u2019t want to miss out on.",
    "Here\u2019s all the the big trailers and reveals from Disney Plus Day, featuring Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and more.",
    "The Marvel offering initially seemed pretty disappointing, as She-Hulk, Moon Knight, Ironheart, Secret Invasion and What If...? season 2 \u2013 shows that had already been confirmed \u2013 all got logos and \"Coming Soon\u201d date stamps. Ms Marvel \u2013 which was given a new launch window just ahead of Disney Plus Day \u2013 did slightly better, with a more defined \"Summer 2022\u201d slot.",
    "It was also good news to see Hawkeye spin-off Echo and WandaVision follow-up Agatha: House of Harkness getting official confirmation. (They're both \u201ccoming soon\u201d, too \u2013 and yes, it was Agatha all along.)",
    "But there was an extra treat for Disney Plus subscribers in the form of the Marvel Studios Disney Plus Day Special. You have to work your way through old clips from WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki and What If...?, but stick with it and you get an extended sequence from Hawkeye, plus first looks at Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Ms Marvel and Secret Wars.",
    "Marvel Studios is also getting stuck into animation, with new wallcrawler cartoon Spider-Man: Freshman Year, I am Groot (Baby Groot! What's not to like?) and Marvel Zombies (an undead reimagining of the MCU). And obviously they're all \"coming soon\" too.",
    "And if this is what we think it is, it could be very exciting indeed. The X-Men cartoon that ran from 1992-1997 was something of a classic, a serialised epic that arguably helped pave the for the explosion of Marvel movies in the 21st century. That certainly looks like the Wolverine from back in the day, and the X-Men \u201997 title fits with the timeline... The mutants return in 2023, so while we wait for the X-Men to make their MCU debuts, this could fill the gap nicely.",
    "It's also worth noting that changes are afoot on the Disney Plus app, where the artwork has been updated to champion newer heroes rather than the old guard:",
    "Hold onto your lightsabers... There's now a preview for the Obi-Wan Kenobi TV show available on Disney Plus!",
    "We knew this one was coming but this teaser for Under the Helmet: The Legacy of Boba Fett should get you pretty excited for the new Disney Plus documentary.",
    "Cars is someway from being the best franchise in the impressive Pixar back catalogue, but it\u2018s always been ludicrously popular with a younger fanbase. So it's no real surprise that Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are returning to voice Lightning McQueen and Mater, respectively, in Cars on the Road, a new Disney Plus series. It's leaving the garage in 2022.",
    "We're much more excited bout Win of Lose, a new animated series coming in Fall 2023. The story of a middle school softball coach and his team \u2013 each episode follows a different character in the run up to a big championship game \u2013 it\u2019ll be Pixar's first TV series based on original characters. Here's some first-look art:",
    "Pixar chief creative officer (and Inside Out/Soul director) Pete Docter also presents a Pixar Disney Plus Day special, featuring a tour of the animation studio and some chat about upcoming projects \u2013 including documentaries on 2022 movie releases Turning Red and Lightyear.",
    "It wasn't announced via Disney Plus Day channels, but Deadline has reported that a new Predator movie is coming in 2022. Titled Prey and directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane's Dan Trachtenberg, it's a prequel set in the world of the Comanche Nation 300 years ago. It's coming to Hulu in the US, so don't be surprised to see it on Disney Plus's Star in the UK.",
    "2003 Steve Martin vehicle Cheaper By The Dozen is getting a reboot, starring Gabrielle Union and Zach Braff. \"It's an update on the classic comedy centered around a multiracial blended family of 12, navigating a hectic homelife while managing their family business,\u201d says Union. It's due on Disney Plus in March 2022.",
    "We knew Enchanted sequel Disenchanted was incoming in 2022 \u2013 Disney Plus Day confirms it's coming to Disney Plus in Fall 2022. Here's stars Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey.",
    "Peter Jackson's hotly anticipated three-part documentary about the final days of the Beatles, Get Back, is coming to Disney Plus on November 25. See the Fab Four in action in this new clip.",
    "Aria Brooks, Michelle Federer, Rueby Wood, Lis Kudrow and Joshua Bassett star in new original musical movie Better Late Than Never, coming Spring 2022.",
    "And it's time for some bona fide Disney magic... Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are back for some witchy business in the eagerly anticipated Hocus Pocus 2. It's now in production and coming Fall 2022.",
    "Not a word of a lie \u2013 a live-action version of Pinocchio, directed by Back to the Future's Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo and Luke Evans, is coming to Disney Plus in Fall 2022.",
    "Cinderella gets a modern retelling in Sneakerella \u2013 Disney claim it has \"heart and sole\". You can find out if the pun was worth the effort on February 18, and you can try out the trailer for size below:",
    "2016\u2018s Zootopia (titled Zootropolis in the UK) was great fun \u2013 and a hit at the box office \u2013 so it's no surprise that Disney is going back to its mammalian civilisation. Zootopia+ is a new TV series set in the same world, coming to Disney Plus in 2022. This promo art suggests the sloths are returning which is all we needed to know...",
    "Another incoming TV series from Disney Animation is Tiana, a follow-up to New Orleans-set 2009 movie The Princess and the Frog. This first look concept art hints at a rare return to traditional 2D animation for the studio.",
    "The first announcement of Disney Plus Day took us back in time to prehistoric times... The Ice Age movies came under the Disney umbrella after its multi-billion-dollar 20th Century Fox purchase. Now Disney Plus Day unveils new movie The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild (starring Simon Pegg) streaming from January 28.",
    "Baymax is back! The cutest robot ever created \u2013 and co-star of Big Hero 6 \u2013 is getting his own original TV series in summer 2022. Here's a first trailer.",
    "There's a new Diary of a Wimpy Kid streaming on Disney Plus from December 3! Not to be confused with the live-action 2010 movie, this animated take has got a poster \u2013 and it's also been confused there'll be a sequel called Rodrick Rules. Here's writer/producer Jeff Kinney to talk about the movie:",
    "Ch, ch, ch, Chip n Dale: Rescue Rangers. Disney's long-standing chipmunk heroes are back in an all-new TV movie on Disney Plus. John Mulaney and Andy Samberg are voicing the critters and they \u2013 or Disney's marketing people \u2013 say it's not a reboot, it's a comeback...",
    "Willow, a sequel TV series to the 1988 fantasy movie, is confirmed for a 2022 launch on Disney Plus. Returning star Warwick Davis introduces his co-stars in the video below \u2013 but how many of them are old enough to remember original movie?",
    "Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi\u2019s literal fairy tales The Spiderwick Chronicles were turned into a movie back in 2008. Now Disney Plus is turning them into a live-action series. The books have a passionate fanbase, so this could be big.",
    "Sing it loud! High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: Season 3 (undoubtedly the biggest mouthful of a series on Disney Plus Day) has been confirmed for 2022.",
    "And a reboot of The Proud Family subtitled Louder and Prouder \u2013 and starring Lizzo, Tiffany Haddish, Gabrielle Union and Cedric the Entertainer \u2013 is coming to Disney Plus in February 2022.",
    "National Geographic is wheeling out the big names for its documentaries. Will Smith is teaming up with Black Swan director Doug Liman for Welcome To Earth, due December 8.",
    "You can also see Thor as you've never seen him before. Chris Hemsworth teams up with National Geographic for Limitless with Chris Hemsworth \u2013 looks like the god of thunder is pushing himself to the limit. We'll find out how far he goes in 2022.",
    "National Geographic is also celebrating America's wide open spaces in America the Beautiful, coming in 2022.",
    "And just in case you've missed anything coming to the platform in the near future, Disney Plus have assembled this handy reminder:",
    "Disney Plus Day took place on Friday, November 12.",
    "Unlike Netflix\u2019s Tudum and Warner Bros\u2019 DC Fandome events, Disney Plus Day wasn't live streamed. Instead, fans were invited to keep up with reveals via Disney's official social media channels. Any announcements will be made exclusively on Disney Plus US, Disney Plus UK, and Disney Plus Hotstar Twitter accounts, as well as the company's Disney Plus Facebook and Instagram pages. You can also follow the official Disney Plus TikTok channel to check out unique short-form content centered around Disney Plus Day.",
    "An event like Disney Plus Day wouldn\u2019t be complete without new content to check out.",
    "After it was released exclusively in theaters in September, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now available to all Disney Plus subscribers at no extra cost.",
    "It\u2019s also one of 13 Marvel films that are available to stream in IMAX Enhanced mode for the first time, too. This expanded 1:90:1 aspect ratio means you\u2019ll be able to see 26% more of the supported films than ever before. Avengers: Endgame, Iron Man and Black Panther are among those set to benefit from the new feature.",
    "Other highlights include Dopesick, a drama series centered on the US opioid epidemic, Frozen spin-off series Olaf Presents, a Boba Fett documentary that focuses on the beloved Star Wars bounty hunter, who's getting his own TV show in December, and Jungle Cruise arriving on the platform as part of the standard DIsney Plus subscription package.",
    "Check out the full list of productions, as well as new launches including Home Sweet Home Alone, below:",
    "This Instagram teaser offers up a few hints:",
    "As for the MCU, we\u2019d love to see teasers for productions due to land early next year.",
    "We haven\u2019t seen anything of Doctor Strange 2 yet, which saw its release date recently put back to May 8, 2022. There\u2019s no better opportunity for Marvel, though, to tease us with a first-look than during Disney Plus Day. Providing any of it is ready to show off, that is.",
    "Meanwhile, we may finally get our first look at Ms. Marvel \u2013 though it's looking increasingly unlikely We had hoped that an official launch date would be revealed, too, but a recent Disney earnings call revealed that the show won't be released until sometime between July and September 2022. Still, we're fairly confident we might see something, even if we don't get a concrete release date.",
    "Finally, we could be treated to news on The Bob\u2019s Burgers movie, the live-action Peter Pan film, and Marvel\u2019s She-Hulk and Moon Knight shows.",
    "We don\u2019t expect to see all of the above during Disney Plus Day, but there\u2019s plenty that the Walt Disney Company could show off. If the relevant studios only show half of what we\u2019ve listed, it\u2019ll make for a pleasing presentation.",
    "And as a bit of fun, Disney Plus has also introduced some new Text-to-Speech voices on TikTok, featuring classic characters including C-3PO and Rocket Raccoon."
