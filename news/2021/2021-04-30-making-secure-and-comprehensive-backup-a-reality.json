    "Recent research has found that in the first quarter of this year, UK firms were hit by over 172,000 cyberattacks each on average \u2013 the equivalent of nearly 2,000 per day and one intrusion attempt every 45 seconds. Yet another study found that more than one-third of small- and medium-sized businesses don\u2019t have an incident response plan in place for responding to data breaches and cyberattacks, suggesting that many businesses are suffering heavily from the effects of these relentless threats.",
    "With so many to prevent, it\u2019s inevitable that some will slip through even the most sophisticated cybersecurity measures. To ensure that any successful attacks can be resolved quickly and to keep an organization up and running, four technology experts from Commvault share the crucial facts and advice about data backups and disaster recovery.",
    "John Day, Sales Engineering Leader, acknowledges the drastic impact the pandemic has had on the way we view and use our data.",
    "\u201cBusinesses are experiencing the data explosion impact of remote working, and the data sprawl that this has brought to their environments. This coupled with the knee jerk reactions that businesses were forced to undertake to tackle a world hit by the pandemic, has taken its toll. The acceleration of collaboration technology, cloud adoption, and SaaS offerings with elasticity, is top of mind, and due to the uncertain times, meant that organizations were forced to act first and revise later. This approach was necessary for businesses to minimize the impact, and in some cases, was needed for survival, but as you can imagine this has left a wake of fragmented data, and dispersed technologies that need to be protected for compliance as well as business continuity.",
    "\u201cDisaster recovery (DR) of critical applications and the need to rapidly recover from cyber threats, should both be a top focus for organizations. Companies need reliable and resilient applications and services that provide rapid recovery solutions to mitigate these threats. As mentioned above, the impact of the data sprawl effect has multiplied the threat factors, compounding the problem for many organizations. So having a solution that can not only protect your data, but also recover it quickly if needed, is paramount.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic truly provided the opportunity,\u201d emphasizes Kate Mollett, Regional Director for Africa, \u201cwhether you wanted it or not \u2013 to test your organization\u2019s data protection, business continuity and DR plans. An opportunity to ensure that your systems and security posture is rigid enough to provide the security and governance required to be compliant and manage data loss and cyber risk, but equally agile enough to allow users to connect from wherever, whenever and on any device.",
    "\u201cPhysically being connected to the corporate network and having automated backups of endpoints and devices is no longer possible. Most likely elements of your workloads are also in the cloud. Are they being backed up? Have you checked? Is the platform 24/7 available or the data? What is the shared responsibility model between your cloud service provider and you \u2013 you are after all the custodian of your organization\u2019s data. You now also have to rely on the end user community and ensure that they have the right endpoint protection, that they are connecting via secure networks and most importantly that they are cyber security vigilant and alert to hacking, ransomware and phishing attacks.\u201d",
    "\u201cLast year alone, nearly 60% of enterprises were hit with a ransomware attack, and 73% of cyber attacks resulted in data being encrypted and held for ransom,\u201d explains Ronnie Kaftal, Senior Sales Engineer. \u201c2020 saw a continued uptick in ransomware attacks with threat actors taking advantage of economic and workplace disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.\u201d",
    "Kate Mollett adds: \u201cThe risk of some form of cyber-attack is more likely than ever. It is not a question of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 you will be the victim of a cyber-attack or multiple cyber-attacks. Assume the worst and plan for the worst. The difference between surviving or succumbing to an attack is an organization\u2019s ability to react, respond and recover quickly from a cyber-attack, and to do that you need intelligent and robust data protection and data management solutions. The threat surface continues to expand and evolve. The IP behind these cyber-attacks is super sophisticated. And the target, or the threat to data is unfortunately the end user, who remains the unsuspecting weakest link in an organization\u2019s security posture. You need to educate and continuously communicate with your user community about cyber security and what to do when compromised.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhile it\u2019s inherent in our human nature to hope for the best, in a business context, the smartest approach is to plan for the worst,\u201d advises Mark Jow, EMEA VP, Sales Engineering. \u201cBusinesses must always operate with the assumption that their data is under constant threat \u2013 because it is. So whether the threat is from hardware failure, human error, data breach, ransomware attack, or natural disaster. Having a plan in place which is underpinned with the right technology solutions, skills and processes will ensure that if any crisis occurs, you can get your data back quickly with minimal disruption.",
    "\u201cThe recent OVH data center fire has also demonstrated why it\u2019s so crucial to know where the responsibility for backing up and recovering your data lies. The Chief Executive at OVH recommended that customers 'activate [their] disaster recovery plan' \u2013 but how many of these customers may have assumed this was the responsibility of OVH? While we can't be certain, what we do know is that with our increasing reliance on information technology, combined with the fact that disasters are inevitable, backing up your data is no longer an option or advisable, it\u2019s an imperative and vital ingredient in ensuring your business stays in business when a crisis hits.\u201d",
    "John Day concludes with some essential guidance for every company: \u201cBusinesses should back up their data by starting in reverse. Effective backup really starts with the recovery requirements and aligning to the business needs for continued service. Ensuring you have the right recovery solution that aligns to the criticality of the application and data, whilst balancing the cost to the business, as well as the simplicity of operations. For example, with Office 365, protecting email and information held in collaboration tools, using a SaaS solution enables customers rapid deployment of protection capabilities, without the overhead of building and maintaining traditional, self-created data protection services.\u201d"
