    "Anthony Mackie has signed on to lead a TV adaptation of the classic PlayStation video game series, Twisted Metal.",
    "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier star will also serve as executive producer on the series, which is being co-developed by Sony Pictures TV and PlayStation Production. As per THR, the show will be pitched to potential buyers in the near future.",
    "In the games, Twisted Metal is essentially a demolition derby that encourages players to use ballistic projectiles, machine guns, mines and other types of weapons to defeat their opponents in vehicular combat.",
    "The first Twisted Metal title launched on the original PlayStation back in 1995, and was followed by eight more mainline games spanning the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 until 2012.",
    "Mackie will play John Doe in the TV adaptation, a milkman with no memory of his past tasked with delivering a mysterious package (not milk, presumably) across a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Mad Max-style.",
    "Cobra Kai writer Michael Jonathan Smith will pen the script, while also executive producing alongside Mackie and Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Given the latter\u2019s involvement \u2013 coupled with the game series\u2019 tongue-in-cheek subject matter \u2013 we\u2019d anticipate a TV show bearing tonal similarities to the movies featuring the Merc With A Mouth.",
    "A few years ago, this news might have had our heads in our hands. After all, video game adaptations have been notoriously uninspired throughout the years (looking at you, Hitman).",
    "But recent history has seen the tide change on live-action takes on beloved digital IP. To everyone\u2019s surprise, 2019\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu was actually pretty great, and this year\u2019s Mortal Kombat, too, was a massive hit on HBO Max.",
    "Then there\u2019s the popularity of Netflix\u2019s The Witcher series \u2013 which itself spawned an anime spin-off and upcoming prequel series \u2013 and the in-development Borderlands movie and The Last of Us TV show.",
    "The point being, in today\u2019s creative climate, video game adaptations aren\u2019t the taboo subject they once were, and there\u2019s every chance that Twisted Metal may actually be a well-made, entertaining ride.",
    "Of course, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll have to wait a while until it hits screens, and we still don\u2019t know whether it\u2019ll land on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max or another major streamer.",
    "In the meantime, though, we\u2019ll boot up the original PlayStation and take Sweet Tooth\u2019s ice cream truck for a spin."
