    "Are you trying to choose between the Apple AirPods and the AirPods Pro? We understand why you\u2019re drawn to the Apple headphones, but there are some things you need to know. The wireless earbuds may look similar, but there are lots of differences between these two models.",
    "The original Apple AirPods are instantly recognizable and very popular, but the AirPods Pro a represent a culmination of years\u2019 worth of work on true wireless tech, which means they\u2019re a higher-end version of the Apple earbuds \u2013 and they have a higher price tag to match.",
    "Not only are the AirPods Pro exceptionally easy to get up-and-running, they\u2019re also far more comfortable and come with a range of cool features, including adaptive EQ, active noise cancellation, and support for Spatial Audio. That's why they made our round-up of the best true wireless earbuds of 2021.",
    "It might seem like we\u2019re suggesting the AirPods Pro are always the better choice. But there\u2019s more to consider. They\u2019re way more expensive than the standard AirPods, and that\u2019s led a lot of people to wonder if it\u2019s worth upgrading to the AirPods Pro, or if they should simply stick to the cheaper AirPods that were updated in 2019.",
    "The choice will be different for everyone. But, to help you understand which AirPods model is right for you, we\u2019ve broken down the key differences below.",
    "Before we get into the differences between the AirPods and the AirPods Pro, it's worth mentioning that both earbud models are due for some upgrades when iOS 15 launches in September, including integration with Apple's Find My app.",
    "The AirPods Pro are also getting Conversation Boost, which is designed to help you hear face-to-face conversations more clearly, and the ability to announce notifications with Siri.",
    "[Update: If choosing between the Apple AirPods and the AirPods Pro wasn't hard enough, you've now got a new pair of AirPods to consider.",
    "The Apple AirPods 3 are finally here, and they're very impressive. The highly-anticipated new buds include support for Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking (like the AirPods Pro and the AirPods Max), adaptive EQ, and a longer battery life than their predecessors.]",
    "Probably the most noticeable difference is that the AirPods Pro actually use active noise cancellation rather than relying only on passive noise reduction from the eartips.",
    "The level of noise cancellation on the Pro can be customized, and can even be set to Transparency Mode to allow you to hear what\u2019s happening around you without taking off the headphones. There\u2019s basically no drawbacks to having it.",
    "The regular AirPods, unfortunately, don\u2019t offer any level of active noise cancellation, and only offer a noise reduction effect by their tight seal.",
    "If you\u2019re planning on taking your Apple earbuds to the gym, you should probably pick up the more expensive AirPods Pro as they\u2019re water-resistant IPX4 \u2013 i.e. sweat- and water-resistant \u2013 compared to the non-water-resistant AirPods.",
    "Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you should take your new high-end AirPods Pro in the pool with you \u2013 if they fall out or stay submerged too long they'll get ruined. If you\u2019re looking for something you can take into the pool with you, you'll need a pair of swimming headphones.",
    "In terms of finding the right fit, the AirPods Pro will offer more customization than the one-size-fits-all Apple AirPods: inside the box you\u2019ll find a number of eartips and if you\u2019re not sure which to use, Apple will even help you find the correct fit with a quick audio test and can tailor the sound to suit your ear structure.",
    "Because the eartips on the AirPods are plastic, you're stuck with them \u2013 although some people do find them more comfortable than silicone eartips, which have to be pushed into your ear.",
    "If you\u2019ve ever felt uncomfortable when wearing a pair of in-ear headphones, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a small, annoying-but-not-life-threatening pressure build-up inside your ear. To combat that, the AirPods Pro uses a very small pressure valve to reduce the pressure inside your ear \u2013 a feature Apple borrowed from the Powerbeats Pro.",
    "It\u2019s a small perk of the Pro series of headphones, but one worth considering, especially if you\u2019re sensitive to pressure build-up.",
    "Also inside the earbuds themselves are internal microphones that can measure volume. These are absolutely crucial for effective noise cancellation but, as an added bonus, can also be used for features like Adaptive EQ that optimizes sound quality for your physiology.",
    "How does it work? According to Apple, the AirPods Pro \u201cautomatically tunes the low- and mid-frequencies\u201d by using a custom high dynamic range amplifier that \u201cproduces pure, incredibly clear sound while also extending battery life.\u201d Nifty!",
    "While you won\u2019t find a massive difference in audio performance between the two AirPods, many folks have noticed a slightly wider soundstage (how clearly you can hear individual instruments) and a slight uptick in overall clarity when using the AirPods Pro. That\u2019s likely because the AirPods Pro have a slightly larger frequency range and a slightly larger chamber that allows for the sound to expand more.",
    "OK, so this is really more of an aesthetic difference than a functional one, but the AirPods Pro are a bit shorter and stouter than the regular AirPods. The iconic tips of the headphones don\u2019t reach as far down your ear with the Pro, but they will cover up more of your ear due to their larger housing.",
    "Both have a somewhat futuristic look to them, however, which some find unappealing \u2013 and some love. Either way, both models are unmistakably 'Apple'.",
    "Finally, a category where the regular AirPods stand a chance: At $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399, the AirPods Pro are significantly more expensive than the regular AirPods ($159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249) that come with a standard case.",
    "If you want to swap out the regular case for the wireless charging case, the price of the regular AirPods jumps to $199 / \u00a3199 / AU$319, putting it within arm's reach of the AirPods Pro.",
    "These prices regularly dip, however \u2013 particularly for the regular AirPods. You can check out the best AirPods and AirPods Pro deals we've found in your region below:",
    "The noise-cancelling AirPods Pro got an upgrade with iOS 14, which allowed for Spatial Audio.",
    "The feature works in 5.1, 7.1, and Dolby Atmos, which positions sound all around you within a virtual sphere \u2013 that means that if you're watching a Dolby Atmos film that shows a plane flying overheard, it will sound as though the plane is really passing above you.",
    "As well as allowing for clever virtual Dolby Atmos, the AirPods Pro can track the motion of your head and your device, to ensure that the audio always appear to originate from the correct position.",
    "We\u2019ve focused on the differences so far, but really the two true wireless earbuds have tons in common, too.",
    "For one, they\u2019re both true wireless earbuds with similarly sized cases and a battery life of around 3.5 hours per charge, and over 24 hours with the battery case. T",
    "hey also have a fairly similar sound quality with only minor differences in the soundstage / clarity. They both use the new Apple H1 Wireless chip that enables hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d functionality, and work seamlessly with iOS.",
    "If you\u2019re bothered by outside noises while at work or while you\u2019re commuting, need water-resistance for the gym or are sensitive to pressure build-up in your ears, it\u2019s probably worth paying a bit more for the Apple AirPods Pro.",
    "But if your chief concerns are sound quality or battery life, you can save yourself a ton of money by sticking with the basic AirPods.",
    "Of course, we suggest you read both our Apple AirPods Pro review and our Apple AirPods (2019) review to learn even more about them, but hopefully you know a bit more now than you did five minutes ago."
