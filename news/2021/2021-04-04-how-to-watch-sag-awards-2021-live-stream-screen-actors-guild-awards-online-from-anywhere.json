    "If you like your awards ceremonies short and sweet, the 2021 Screen Actors Guild Awards couldn't fit the brief any better. The 27th SAG Awards show has been streamlined to the extreme, and will be a rapid-fire, 60-minute virtual celebration of the finest film and TV performances of the past year, with winners set to be named across 15 categories. Follow our guide below as we explain how to watch the SAG Awards 2021 online and live stream the Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony wherever you are in the world.",
    "Yes, the SAG Awards have gone completely virtual this year, meaning there's no red carpet, no venue, no host - something the A-listers probably don't mind so much - and it's entirely pre-recorded!",
    "Gaffes and blunders will, therefore, be in short supply, but on the positive side it means we'll rattle through the awards (and acceptance speeches) at lightning speed.",
    "Riz Ahmed, Daveed Diggs, Viola Davis, Lily Collins and many more of the nominees will also be presenting awards, plus sharing their own funny, touching and deeply personal stories about how they got into acting.",
    "And better still, most of the favorites, including The Crown, The Queen's Gambit, and I May Destroy You, are available to stream right now!",
    "It's a must-watch for film and TV buffs, so read on as we explain how to watch Screen Actors Guild Awards 2021 action online tonight - live stream the SAG Awards ceremony from anywhere.",
    "Unfortunately, if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for streamers all over the world, but there's an easy solution."
