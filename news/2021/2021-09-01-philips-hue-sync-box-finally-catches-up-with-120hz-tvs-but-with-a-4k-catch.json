    "The Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box is a wonderful bit of home entertainment kit, offering a connector between your smart TV, smart lights, and various media devices and consoles \u2013 but it\u2019s only now that it\u2019s getting support for 120Hz passthrough to help display those PS5 games and Xbox Series X games in the highest refresh rate possible.",
    "While the Sync Box formerly was only able to support 60Hz images from connected consoles and 4K Blu-ray players, that figure is going up to 120Hz in an upcoming software update, so that any Sync Box owner can benefit from the upgrade. The update is set to come \u201cFall 2021\u201d \u2013 so likely September or October this year \u2013 and comes amid a number of Philips Hue upgrades including Spotify integration with color-changing smart bulbs.",
    "But 120Hz is increasingly the desirable refresh rate for high-end gamers with a PS5 or Xbox Series X console \u2013 and while relatively few games support 120Hz, it\u2019s a good spec to have for the titles that do, ensuring smooth images far beyond what was possible on earlier consoles.",
    "There are, however, a few limitations to this 120Hz upgrade. We\u2019re told that \u201cUsers will be able to update their sync box to be compatible with the newest game consoles\u2019 120Hz support, ensuring competitive players to be on top of the game with the highest refresh rate. The sync box is able to support 120Hz with an image resolution of 1080p and 1440p. Alternatively, if the highest image resolution is preferred, the current sync box also continues to support a 4K image resolution up to a refresh rate of 60Hz.\u201d",
    "So, the option is between 120Hz gameplay at 1080p/1440p, or 60Hz at 4K resolution. That means you won\u2019t get the maximum 4K/120Hz performance possible on the latest game consoles and 120Hz 4K TVs, given the Sync Box doesn\u2019t support the HDMI 2.1 input specification to allow for it.",
    "We expect this software update is something of a halfway house, improving the support available before Philips is ready to release a new hardware iteration with HDMI 2.1 ports built in. The current Sync Box was released in October 2019, so it\u2019s very possible we could see another version shortly \u2013 within the next year, that is \u2013 though we\u2019re asking Philips for clarification on this point, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the hardware took a little longer than that still.",
    "If you\u2019re after that HDMI 2.1 spec, then, it\u2019s probably best to make sure your console-connected Sync Box isn\u2019t reducing the capabilities of your HDMI 2.1 TV.",
