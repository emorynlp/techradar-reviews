    "Ime Archibong, Head of New Product Experimentation at Meta (n\u00e9e Facebook), says designing truly innovative products in the tech sector is all about failing, but doing so quickly.",
    "Speaking at Slush 2021 in Helsinki, Archibong set out his philosophy for nurturing startups and small product teams in-house at Meta, which has been his job for the last two and a half years.",
    "\u201cFor most startups, the first idea you come up with isn\u2019t likely to be the one that grows. The average experience is one of a lot of pivots, a lot of tries and a lot of failures,\u201d he said, in conversation with CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo.",
    "\u201cAt Meta, we\u2019ve tried to create a space where people can fail, fast. The iterative approach to experimentation begets innovation; you have to be comfortable just putting something out there. And it\u2019s not about how often you\u2019re right, but rather when you\u2019re right, how right are you?\u201d",
    "Later in the chat, Archibong compared his role at Meta to that of a gardener, who \u201ccreates the fertile ground for entrepreneurs to build their ideas and plant their seeds\u201d at the company.",
    "\u201cA key part of my role is to be a great listener. Then it\u2019s about asking how I can empower these entrepreneurial teams, get out of their way, and give them the psychological safety to fail multiple times within a company that has a high bar for success,\u201d he said.",
    "In the coming years, Meta will inevitably focus on what the metaverse will look like and the VR and AR hardware needed to bring it to fruition. But Archibong says the company\u2019s focus will be far from narrow, especially when it comes to geography.",
    "Asked why he was in attendance at Slush, so far from Silicon Valley, Archibong explained he strongly believes the next era of innovation will come not from the US, but rather from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d regions that have been \u201coverlooked\u201d in the past.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m very bullish on the African continent, Latin America and Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe barriers to entry are getting exponentially lower and cheaper; anyone with a design mindset can be successful - you don\u2019t even need programming skills these days.\u201d",
    "\u201cIn that environment, there\u2019s going to be new, innovative ideas happening in corners of the world you can\u2019t see from Silicon Valley.\u201d"
