  "article": [
    "The latest Sony State of Play spotlighted the upcoming Deathloop from Arkane Studios, but it also showcased nine indie games coming to PS4, PS5, and PSVR \u2013 and most of those are launching by the end of 2021.",
    "Several of these are launching soon, including some bigger titles we\u2019d seen before at prior State of Play presentations. The the team-based hack-and-slash Tribes of Midgard, launching on July 27, will have seasons angled around particular Norse gods and mythology, with 10-player sessions, two modes to play in, and eight character classes to choose.",
    "Others won't come until next year \u2013 like Sifu, the mysterious beat-em-up we saw at a previous State of Play, which has a revised release date of early 2022.",
    "We also got a look at a new PSVR title: VR game Moss\u2019s lovable mouse Quill is back in Moss II, which promises even more Zelda-like puzzle and combat action. Moss: Book II doesn\u2019t have a release date yet, but it\u2019s confirmed that the title is in development.",
    "The rest of the games were either new or hadn\u2019t been seen much before. For action multiplayer fans, we saw Arcadegeddon by studio Illfonic, a sort of neon Fortnite-esque shooter that\u2019s available in early access today with a full release in 2022, while Hunter\u2019s Arena: Legends by Mantisco, a Dynasty Warriors-style 3D MOBA with players dropping solo or in 3-person squads to 30-player matches, arrives next month (August) on PS4 and PS5.",
    "Other titles looked more stylized, like Jett: The Far Shore, by studios Superbrothers and Pine Scented with music by Scientific, an exploration-based game with players zooming around landscapes in their eponymous jet vehicles, coming in 2021 to PS4 and PS5. Fist: Forged in Shadow Torch is a side-scrolling action platformer putting players in the shoes (paws?) of a mecha arm-wielding rabbit, which arrives on 7 September 2021 for PS4 and PS5.",
    "A licensed game based on the Demon Slayer franchise, Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles, is coming to PS4 and PS5 on 15 October 2021. And Sega\u2019s Lost Judgment, a sort of Yakuza-meets-Shenmue third-person adventure with plenty of zany minigames, is headed to PS4 and PS5 on 24 September 2021."
