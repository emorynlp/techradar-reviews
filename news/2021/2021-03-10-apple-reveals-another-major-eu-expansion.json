  "article": [
    "Apple is to build Europe\u2019s largest R&D facility for mobile wireless semiconductors and software technology in Munich as part of a $1 billion investment in Germany.",
    "The Bavarian city is already Apple\u2019s largest European engineering hub with more than 1,500 engineers working on power management design, application processors and other wireless technologies that power Apple\u2019s custom chips.",
    "The Cupertino-based company now wants to build on this foundation with the establishment of the a \u2018state of the art\u2019 Apple European Silicon Design Center that will house Apple\u2019s cellular unit. The focus will be on 5G and other wireless technologies \u2013 including modems.",
    "Apple has moved to design more of its components itself in recent years in order to gain more control over cost, development and timelines. This allows the firm to differentiate against Android manufacturers who source from a pool of suppliers.",
    "The firm has made its own processors for the iPhone and iPad since 2010, while in 2017, it announced it planned to stop including UK chip manufacturer Imagination Technologies\u2019 graphics technology in favour of an alternative developed in-house.",
    "However, developing a modem chip is a complicated and expensive exercise that has necessitated long-term planning. Apple has set up shop in San Diego, home of Qualcomm, in a bid to attract engineers to the endeavour, while it also bought Intel\u2019s 5G modem business back in 2019.",
    "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited for everything our Munich engineering teams will discover \u2014 from exploring the new frontiers of 5G technology, to a new generation of technologies that bring power, speed, and connectivity to the world,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple CEO.",
    "\u201cMunich has been a home to Apple for four decades, and we\u2019re grateful to this community and to Germany for being a part of our journey.\u201d",
    "Hundreds of new jobs will be created at the 30,000 square metre facility in central Munich, which is due to open in 2022, bringing Apple\u2019s total workforce in Germany to above 4,000."
