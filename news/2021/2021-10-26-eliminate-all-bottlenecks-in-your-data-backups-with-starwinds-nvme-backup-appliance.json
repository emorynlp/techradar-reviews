    "StarWind has been building IT infrastructure appliances for over 10 years for ROBO, SMB, and EDGE IT operations. It focuses on designing affordable systems that aren\u2019t just powerful but easy to use, install and operate without needing to invest heavily in IT hardware or staff.",
    "StarWind\u2019s latest system is designed to help companies eliminate the bottlenecks common in backing up and restoring critical data. Its Backup Appliance (BA) leverages the advantages of NVMe memory to significantly speed up the process of backing up your information.",
    "Traditional backup infrastructure is often built on outdated HDDs and requires significant time to perform a backup, meaning you often have to schedule backups to happen during downtime and wait for them to finish before continuing with development.",
    "It\u2019s not uncommon for organizations to invest heavily in performance infrastructure, but leave backup equipment as an afterthought, with slow, outdated backup servers causing bottlenecks and overlapping with production processes.",
    "StarWind has harnessed the power of components typically reserved for production and brought them into its backup appliance, helping you remove those bottlenecks and meet the strictest RTPO standards.",
    "By using NVMe storage instead of traditional HDDs, StarWind BA also allows you to perform near-to-instant restores of data, even during critical events.",
    "StarWind BA is also fully compatible with Veeam B&R V10 and V11 as well as with Veeam Instant VM Recovery so your backup infrastructure is as good as your production one, if not better.",
    "This revolutionary storage system is incredibly easy to set up and use, coming fully pre-configured to your specific requirements. Itcan be easily accessed and operated through a Web UI giving you single-pane-of-glass management of your data.",
    "The power efficiency of the NVMe architecture means that the BA solution is also kind to the environment. It has a substantially smaller ecological footprint due to the increased power efficiency, meaning that you\u2019re generating less heat and consuming less power with each unit you have.",
    "StarWind\u2019s technology comes highly rated from within the IT industry, with IT Central Station awarding its Hyperconverged Appliance (HCA) the number three spot in the SDS category and StarWind Virtual SAN (VSAN) receiving the number one spot in the same category in the IT Central Station Peer Awards in 2021. The company also recently scored 4.8 out of 5 stars in Gartner\u2019s \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d HCI report for 2021 and was included in the Magic Quadrant for the third year in a row.",
    "Your backup solution is only as good as the support it has, and StarWind backs up its BA with proactive premium customer support service that monitors the health of the systems 24/7/365, included by default with every system. StarWind ProActive Support functions to prevent issues from happening while also rapidly responding in case you need them.",
    "If you\u2019ve been fighting slow backup speeds and data bottlenecks within your IT backup solution, schedule a demo with StarWind today to see the true power and efficiency of NVMe storage for yourself."
