    "The 2021 PGA Tour season is now under way following an extraordinary year of golf that saw the Ryder Cup cancelled, Augusta played in November, and Bryson DeChambeau transform himself into a walking advertisement for creatine. Read on as we explain how to find a quality PGA Tour live stream and watch golf online wherever you are in the world this week.",
    "The end of last year's campaign saw Dustin Johnson win both the PGA 2020 Tour Championship after excelling throughout the FedExCup Playoffs - stopped from a clean sweep of all three events only by a miraculous Jon Rahm putt - and then triumphed at Augusta in The Masters to earn his first Green Jacket.",
    "Prior to that, the newly beefed up DeChambeau claimed a six shot victory at the US Open, finishing as the only player under par at notoriously difficult Winged Foot.",
    "The Mad Scientist therefore entered the Masters as a resounding favorite - but it was DJ who enjoyed the spoils at the year's final major, carding an impressive score of -20 that wasn't to be beaten by Bryson, Rory, Tiger, or anyone else for that matter.",
    "Read on as our guide explains how to find a PGA Tour live stream and watch golf online from anywhere in the world, each and every week for the 2020/21 season.",
    "There are loads of easy ways to watch PGA Tour golf in 2021 including in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and almost anywhere else in the world. Scroll down for a full breakdown of options, but the first thing you should know is that anyone away from their home country can still tune into the action as usual by using one of the best VPNs.",
    "These services will allow you to get around any geo-blocking and and let you watch the same legal, high-quality golf live stream you would at home. Best of all, they only take a few minutes to set-up.",
    "Use a VPN to get a PGA golf live stream from anywhere",
    "The new PGA Tour season has gotten off to a spectacular start, headlined of course by Bryson DeChambeau's dominant win at the US Open back in September and then Dustin Johnson's maiden Augusta victory in November.",
    "Outside of the majors, October produced some highly memorable moments on the regular circuit, and of the non-majors, the relocated Zozo Championship at Sherwood produced a memorable finish that saw Patrick Cantlay win by a single shot over Justin Thomas.",
    "Elsewhere, Sergio Garcia rolled back the years to win at the Sanderson Farms Championship, while arguably the most dramatic tournament so far was the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, where Scotland's Martin Laird won a dramatic three-man playoff to claim the title.",
    "The 2021 action has sizzled early on in warmer climes, too, with big guns like Brooks Koepka claiming the Phoenix Open, Patrick Reed winning the Farmers Insurance Open, and rising star Daniel Berger taking home the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The only real bad news for fans of the game is Tiger's continued absence through injury, with the first WGC event of the season in Mexico failing to see the star return - his early-2021 car accident making it difficult to give a firm Tiger Woods injury update once again.",
    "That depends on who you ask - and how you measure success in golf. But in most people's eyes (and the eyes of the PGA), the answer is Dustin Johnson.",
    "Johnson was in superb form from the moment PGA Tour action resumed back in June and looked unbeatable towards the end of the season, winning two out of three events in the 2020 FedExCup Playoffs including the Tour Championship - making him the official winner of the 2019/20 PGA Tour. In fact, only a miraculous 66-foot Jon Rahm putt stopped him from making it a clean sweep and he's still world no. 1 as we look ahead to Augusta.",
    "However, if you measure success by major victories, then Collin Morikawa's maiden victory at the PGA Championship certainly deserves a mention - as does Bryson DeChambeau's win at Winged Foot in the 2020 US Open - even though it technically took place after the start of the 2020/21 season."
