  "category": "phones",

  "summary": "45W of charging power",
  "article": [
    "In many ways the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will probably be a lower end phone than the rest of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range, but when it comes to charging speed it looks like this upcoming handset could have all of them \u2013 including the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra \u2013 beat.",
    "That\u2019s the indication we get from an FCC (Federal Communications Commission) listing for a phone believed to be the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. Rather than a name, the model number SM-G990U is listed, but that\u2019s been linked to the S21 FE in the past.",
    "The listing mentions support for both a 25W charger (which is the most the rest of the S21 range can muster) and a 45W one, which Samsung previously supported with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, but hasn\u2019t given much love to lately.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no guarantee either of these chargers will come in the box, and indeed MyFixGuide, which found the listing, suggests they won\u2019t \u2013 though it\u2019s not clear where it got that information. Still, given that the rest of the Galaxy S21 range doesn\u2019t ship with chargers, we\u2019d think that would likely be the case here too.",
    "But 45W \u2013 even if you have to buy the charger separately \u2013 would be a big win for the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, as Samsung\u2019s phones have started trailing rival devices when it comes to charging speeds. The OnePlus 9 for example supports 65W charging, and the Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra can get all the way up to 120W.",
    "The rest of this FCC listing is less illuminating, but it includes a few additional details. The Snapdragon 888 chipset is mentioned for one \u2013 that\u2019s the same one as you\u2019ll find in the rest of the range (at least in the US) and was always likely to be included.",
    "The listing also mentions support for USB-C earphones, which might mean there\u2019s no 3.5mm headphone port. We can\u2019t be certain of that, but the rest of the range lacks a 3.5mm port, so it\u2019s likely to be absent here too.",
    "We can at least be fairly confident that the details in this listing are accurate, as data on the FCC\u2019s database usually is. The phone\u2019s presence there also suggests it\u2019s probably launching soon, which lines up with rumors of an August 3 announcement date \u2013 though we\u2019ve elsewhere heard that it might have been delayed until October.",
