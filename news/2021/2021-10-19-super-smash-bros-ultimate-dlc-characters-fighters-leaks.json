  "article": [
    "Want more Smash Bros Ultimate DLC? We don't blame you \u2013 Super Smash Bros Ultimate is the biggest, and possibly the best, Smash Bros fighting game to grace our Nintendo consoles.",
    "But if you've fought every single Smash Bros Ultimate character to exhaustion, don't worry \u2013 there's a number of add-in fighters beyond the base roster, from fan-favorites like Banjo-Kazooie and Persona 5's Joker to fighting game crowd pleasers like Tekken's Kazuya Mishima and Fatal Fury's Terry Bogard.",
    "The latest and last Smash Bros Ultimate DLC character is Sora, the face of the Kingdom Hearts games developed by Square Enix in collaboration with Disney. It's not what everyone on the TechRadar team wanted, but it's a certainly a fitting sendoff for the game, given its penchant for the impossible, and the fact that Sora has been highly requested since the days of Smash Bros. for Wii U.",
    "That's the end of the pipeline though, with Smash Bros Ultimate DLC being completely done now \u2013 until we see a Smash Bros Ultimate sequel, that is, which will undoubtedly play host to a fresh roster of guest fighters. We're still a bit upset about Cuphead being relegated to a Mii Fighter, but there's been plenty to excite players in Fighters Pass 1 and 2, and there's a peace in it finally being over.",
    "You can check out all the currently available Smash Bros Ultimate DLC fighters below.",
    "The real draw of Smash Bros DLC is in the fighters. Nintendo has unveiled all five fighters for the first Fighters Pass, and all but one for Fighters Pass Vol 2. We've listed them all below from the latest (Sora) to the first (Piranha Plant). We'll be sure to add information on incoming fighters as and when they're released too.",
    "Sora (available now)",
    "Sora! From Kingdom Hearts! The Disney-Square Enix collab is technically a swordsman, but the swinging key he uses in battle is still a nice break from, you know, actual swords.",
    "In the final Smash Bros DLC presentation, Sakurai stated that \"Sora's controls are relatively straightforward,\" and that he \"excels at airborne fighting\" while having a large jump and recovery distance. \"He's quite floaty,\" Sakurai adds, making him easy to push around the stage as a player \u2013 and as an enemy, with Sora prone to being knocked away.",
    "Sora represents a fitting end to Smash Bros Ultimate DLC, we feel. Considered an impossible character given the amount of legal red tape involved, we're shocked to see him finally arrive in the game. Still, Ultimate has had a habit of making the impossible a reality, and in this sense, Sora and Kingdom Hearts are arguably the greatest prize of all.",
    "Kazuya (available now)",
    "During Nintendo's E3 2021 presentation, we learned that the Tekken mainstay Kazuya was joining the fight. Smash Bros. director Sakurai also confirmed that Kazuya will retain several iconic moves from the Tekken games, including the Sternum Smash, Jumping Sobat, Dragon Uppercut, Tombstone Crusher, Gates of Hell and Demon God Fist. Just try not to get in his way when the demon side comes out...",
    "Pyra and Mythra (available now)",
    "Pyra and Mythra are the next two characters coming to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in 2021. The two sword-wielding characters made their appearance during the February Nintendo Direct event and will be arriving in March. You'll be able to switch between the characters freely \u2013 similar to how Zelda and Shiek used to work \u2013 and each will have their own set of skills.",
    "Sephiroth (available now)",
    "\"Now, I shall bring Smash despair.\" What an entrance. But we'd expect nothing less from Sephiroth, the iconic Final Fantasy villain, who acted as the antagonist in Final Fantasy 7 (and the Final Fantasy 7 remake). His air of doom, single black wing, and incredibly long sword \u2013 great for poking fighters off the end of a stage, we imagine \u2013 should make this fallen angel a welcome addition to the roster. Face him off with Cloud for a real tense fight-off with your friends.",
    "Steve / Alex / Zombie / Enderman (available to download)",
    "We can't blame Nintendo for this Minecraft collab, given the immense popularity of the blocky crafting game. What's surprising, though, is you can play as any of Steve, Alexa, Zombie, or Enderman, making for some juicy variety in just one DLC download \u2013 with the ability to craft blocks to obstruct enemies, blow up TNT, or just wave around a sword like the rest of the fighters.",
    "Min Min (available to download)",
    "ARMS' first fighter comes to Smash Bros on June 29 in the form of Min Min. You'll control her arms with the A and B buttons, according to the new in-depth look at the fighter. 18 tracks from ARMS are to be added with the fighter, too, offering the game a major presence in Smash Bros.",
    "Her Final Smash attack, too, features the entire ARMS roster.",
    "Byleth (available for download)",
    "Byleth is the lead character from 2019's Fire Emblem: Three Houses, a recent entry in the Fire Emblem military tactics game.",
    "You'll be able to choose male or female version of the character \u2013 both named Byleth \u2013 which is refreshing, and something we'd love to see for more fighters on the roster. There'll also be a choice of weapons to wield and strike with using your various different attacks, including a lance, axe, bow, and sword.",
    "A curious choice, given how many Fire Emblem characters are already in the game \u2013 Marth, Roy, Ike, Robin, Lucina, and Corrin \u2013 but it will no doubt please some fans out there.",
    "Terry Bogard (available for download)",
    "You know, Terry! From Fatal Fury? The 1991 fighting game on the Neo Geo console? Ok, this one might be a bit lesser-know than some of the DLC fighters on this list, but this character from the classic 90s Fatal Fury franchise fits right in with the best of them.",
    "The Terry fighter finally become available in November, a couple of months after its Nintendo Direct announcement. You can check out the character's moveset in this official video, too \u2013 and it's clear he's got a pretty good uppercut.",
    "Hero (available for download)",
    "All the fans of the Dragon Quest franchise got a real treat at this year's E3: confirmation of not one but four Dragon Quest heroes in one DLC pack. Acting as skins of each other, with the largest number of moves of any fighter in the game \u2013 thanks to a wide variety of attack, evasion, and effect spells \u2013 it's a lively addition that effectively gives you four new characters to play with.",
    "There's an announcement trailer (above) and more in-depth video stream (below) that goes into Hero's various moves and abilities.",
    "Each Hero will have an MP meter \u2013 yes, just like the game \u2013 which uses up mana every time you cast a spell: be it to heal yourself, throw yourself up in the air, turn yourself into metal, or otherwise. Definitely a fighter for the more strategic players out there, as there's a lot of options to play with. You can even cast Kacrackle!",
    "Banjo-Kazooie (available for download)",
    "Damn straight. After years of clamoring for Rare's iconic bird and bear duo to join the Smash Bros series, Banzo-Kazooie is finally here. While Rare is now a subsidiary of Microsoft, the beloved developer was previously closely tied with Nintendo, and it's heart-warming to see one of its most famous creations welcomed back into the family.",
    "It looks like Kazooie will be able to help out with jumps and ranged attacks, with Banjo using fists and items for more close-range attacks. Here's hoping we finally get to hit Mario over the head with a banjo, just like we always dreamed.",
    "Joker (available for download)",
    "No, not that Joker. Nintendo teased the trickster from Atlus\u2019 paranormal RPG Persona 5 shortly after Ultimate\u2019s launch, with a nifty animated teaser you can see below. Smash Bros' version of Joker keeps the graphic art style of its source material, with some stylish slides and jumps, handguns, and some supernatural forces to help you win the battle...",
    "Persona 5 is a PS3 / PS4 exclusive, though, making Joker's appearance on a Nintendo console all the more intriguing \u2013 and fuelling speculation that Persona 5 could be coming to Nintendo Switch.",
    "Piranha Plant (available for download)",
    "A potted plant may not seem like the best fit for an action-packed fighting game, but Piranha Plant is a classic Mario nemesis going back decades \u2013 Nintendo certainly likes to play by its own rules. You can see some of Piranha Plant's moves in the video below, including a monstrous Final Smash featuring Petey Piranha.",
    "Players who bought Super Smash Bros Ultimate by the end of January 2019 had a chance to download the fighter early, but Piranha Plant is now available on the Switch eShop for $4.49 (\u00a34.49 / AU$7.80).",
    "Technically you don\u2019t just get a new fighter with each DLC pack. The new fighters (Piranha Plant excluded) each come in a bundle called a \u2018Challenger Pack\u2019, which throw in a new stage and thematic soundtracks alongside the new character. You can buy each of the five Challenger's Packs individually for $5.99 (\u00a35.39 / AU$7.80).",
    "Alternatively you can buy an all-inclusive Fighters Pass for $24.99 (\u00a322.49 / AU$32.50), which nets you each pack as it arrives, as well as a Mii Fighter outfit based on Xenoblade 2's Rex. Fighters Pass does not include Piranha Plant, though."
