    "Amazon Echo Show 10 deals landed for the first time at this week, with a fantastic $50 discount on the latest smart display dropping it down to its lowest ever price. While that $199.99 sales price is already excellent, though, you can also pick up a free Food Network Kitchen subscription or a Ring smart bulb on top.",
    "The latest and most powerful Echo Show yet was released towards the end of February, which means this offer is coming in a little earlier than many may have expected. Amazon's previous time frames would suggest at least another month before the first major Echo Show 10 deals arrived, but we're not complaining.",
    "The Alexa-enabled smart display was already carrying a hefty price tag and any cash skimmed off that MSRP is bringing these top of the range features closer to reality for most.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Amazon Echo deals in your region.",
    "The new Amazon Echo Show 10 has changed things up a bit. The larger 10.1-inch display now sits atop a cylindrical base which allows it to swivel to either follow your movement as you're watching something, or pan across the room when you're checking in for home security.",
    "That means you'll be able to freely move around the room when cooking along with a recipe or video calling and always remain in frame. This can, of course, be switched off for privacy reasons, and the camera can also be shuttered as well.",
    "Aside from its headline upgrades, though, you'll also find directional speakers, excellent smart home controls (with Zigbee devices now supported as well), and all the latest Alexa skills and features as well.",
    "If you want to weight Alexa against Google, check out the latest Google Home deals. However, we're also rounding up all the latest smart home device sales available right now and a wide range of the cheapest robot vacuum deals as well."
