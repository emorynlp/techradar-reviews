    "Amazon has told some merchants that make use of its e-commerce services that antitrust proposals in the US Congress could prove detrimental to their businesses.",
    "Back in June, the US House Committee on the Judiciary signed off on legislation that will allow companies, including Amazon, to make the choice between running a platform and competing on it.",
    "While the antitrust bills have gained bipartisan support, the fear for e-commerce outlets selling via Amazon\u2019s marketplace is that the move could produce a serious challenge to the power of internet retailers and other big online tech firms.",
    "According to media reports, discussions have taken place between Amazon staff and merchants, the details of which have been posted online by e-commerce advice blog EcomCrew. Amazon has confirmed that the post is genuine.",
    "In an email message, one of the Public Policy managers at Amazon noted: \u201cWe are concerned that [legislation] could potentially have significant negative effects on small and medium-sized businesses like yours that sell in our store.\u201d",
    "The proposed legislation, called \u2018A Stronger Online Economy: Opportunity, Innovation, Choice\u2019, could be used to clip the wings of online tech companies, including Amazon. Crucially, one aspect of the legislation called \u2018The Ending Platform Monopolies Act\u2019 could prove problematic for the likes of Amazon and Apple.",
    "Both could be affected, as the new rules would clamp down on companies that offer own-brand products. Apple is well-known for its own products on the App Store, while Amazon has a huge range of its own private-label goods on offer, also under its own brand, with an estimated 150,000 products for sale via its e-commerce platform.",
    "If passed, the legislation could force private-label brands to separate their products from the parent company. Ultimately, the move is seen as being positive for third-party sellers as it would level the playing field and create a more equal arena for selling goods online. However, Amazon is arguing that the proposed legislation could mean third-party sellers won't be able to sell through the platform.",
    "In a statement, the online retailer said: \u201cMore than a half million American small- and medium-sized businesses make a living via Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and without access to Amazon\u2019s customers, it will be much harder for these third-party sellers to create awareness for their business and earn a comparable income. Removing the selection of these sellers from Amazon\u2019s store would also create less price competition for products, and likely end up increasing prices for consumers.\u201d",
