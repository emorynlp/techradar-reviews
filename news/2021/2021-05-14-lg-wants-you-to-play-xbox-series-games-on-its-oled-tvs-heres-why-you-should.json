  "summary": "LG OLED gaming TVs are getting some help from Dolby Vision",
  "article": [
    "It looks like LG OLED TVs may become even better gaming TVs in the near future, after LG confirmed that Dolby Vision gaming at 4K/120fps was \u201cin testing\u201d for the Xbox Series X.",
    "The potential of Dolby Vision \u2013 a dynamic HDR format that helps to calibrate a TV\u2019s picture with shot-by-shot metadata \u2013 is long proven, though it\u2019s still a new player in the world of gaming.",
    "That\u2019s all changing in 2021, it seems, after TV reviewer and host of HDTVTest, Vincent Teoh, confirmed the news from LG, tweeting that \u201cmore details about models will be shared soon\u201d \u2013 though the electronics maker will likely prioritize 2021 OLED TVs like the LG C1 and LG G1 Gallery Series. (It\u2019s worth noting that the entry-level LG A1 doesn\u2019t come with HDMI 2.1, so likely won\u2019t carry the same kind of support as its more premium siblings.)",
    "It\u2019s an important feather for LG\u2019s cap, cementing its place as a seller of quality gaming TVs \u2013 even if there may be some disquiet if the support doesn\u2019t come to 2020 models like the LG CX. It\u2019s made all the more exciting by Xbox\u2019s latest announcement on Dolby Vision gaming, too, with it now coming to the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S for all Xbox Insiders \u2013 having finished an initial round of alpha testing for the technology, with the rest of the Xbox Series player base set to get the feature later in 2021.",
    "That means Dolby Vision is coming, and you\u2019ll no doubt want to get your head around what it is, and what difference it makes, by the time it comes to your favorite Xbox Series X games.",
    "Right now, Dolby Vision is only supported on Xbox console streaming apps, like Netflix and Disney Plus \u2013 though its arrival in games can only elevate the experience on offer, for gaming TVs that are able to take advantage of the format. (You won\u2019t get it on PS5, and Sony has eschewed support for both Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos audio.)",
    "Our senior gaming writer, Adam Vjestica, wrote earlier in the year that, \u201cLike Dolby Atmos, we\u2019ve found that games that offer native support for the technology provide far more impressive results than those that simply use it as pass-through, though the benefits are still apparent. We expect that some games will specifically be designed with Dolby Vision in mind in the future, but it\u2019s unclear whether the HDR format will simply be applied by the console to every title as is the case right now.",
    "\u201cDolby claims that Dolby Vision will make games look more realistic and lifelike compared to HDR10 as it can produce 40x brighter highlights, 10x deeper black levels and up to 12-bit color depth. It should also adjust HDR visuals on a frame-by-frame basis using dynamic data, which will provide a more refined picture.\u201d",
    "Since the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X in late 2020, TV makers have quickly been getting into gear to accommodate demand for the new console\u2019s upgraded capabilities.",
    "The most important one to pay attention to is HDMI 2.1 support, given that it allows for 4K gameplay at a smooth 120Hz \u2013 or, if you have an 8K TV, 8K gameplay at 60Hz. While there aren\u2019t a huge number of games that support the former as of yet (or any that support the latter), that is slowly changing, with a handful of PS5 games that support 120fps and a mountain of Xbox Series X games letting you push your new consoles and gaming TVs to their limits.",
    "You\u2019ll find widespread HDMI 2.1 support on LG TVs, new Samsung TVs, Panasonic TVs and Sony TVs, albeit largely on high-end sets. VRR (variable refresh rate) is a key HDMI 2.1 technology, but one that isn\u2019t always bundled in, so make sure you\u2019re getting that to ensure smooth gameplay too. Currently, only Xbox consoles support VRR while PS5 does not.",
    "LG\u2019s OLED TVs are great choices for new gaming TVs, with sub-1ms response times, incredible contrast and color, and even a Game Optimizer overlay (new for 2021 on its webOS smart platform) for quickly swapping between picture modes, VRR, and the like. Support for Nvidia G-Sync is a great addition for those keen to use an LG TV as monitor for their gaming PC, though our computing editor Bill Thomas points out that it\u2019s quite limiting for those whose PC doesn\u2019t sport a Nvidia GPU.",
    "Those fearing burn-in on OLED TVs needn\u2019t fear these days either, with screen shift technologies that subtly move the image onscreen to prevent singular pixels outputting at the same intensity for long periods of time \u2013 a potential danger with games, specifically, given they often utilize reticles and HUDs that stay in the same place. Philips, too, is now utilizing anti-burn-in tech that helps to detect logos or static content and reduce the intensity of light in those areas, \"without compromising the output of other parts of the screen\".",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that LG OLEDs only support 10-bit color HDR, whereas Dolby Vision technically supports up to 12 bits \u2013 though the strong HDR contrast credentials of OLED screens means you shouldn\u2019t notice the absence of those additional two bits.",
    "LG TVs don\u2019t feature a huge amount of built-in audio, either, and it may be worth considering a Panasonic or Samsung screen for a gaming TV able to give a real punch to the sound too. The Panasonic JZ2000 packs in side-firing speakers and a total 125W output, while Samsung\u2019s multi-directional OTS audio system is best implemented on its Neo QLED TVs, like the QN95A. In general, those wanting a bright screen at all costs shouldn\u2019t be eyeing up an OLED TV, either \u2013 even if the LG G1 is upping the level of brightness possible on today's OLEDs."
