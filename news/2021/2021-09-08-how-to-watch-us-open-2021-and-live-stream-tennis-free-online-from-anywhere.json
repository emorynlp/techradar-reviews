    "A double dose of history beckons for Novak Djokovic at the 2021 US Open, with the chance to become the most decorated player in the men's game and the first man to win all four grand slam titles in the same calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Can the likes of Daniil Medvedev or Alex Zverev finally step up to stop him?",
    "Naomi Osaka crashed out early in her pursuit to defend her title, and number 1 seed Ash Barty went soon afterwards. As ever, it feels like any of the remaining players could win the title, with Aryna Sabalenka and Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 the highest rank contenders left. But teenage rookies Leylah Fernandez and Emma Raducanu have really impressed so far - could they really go all the way?",
    "It should be a very exciting last few days of action at the the final slam of the year, and here's how you can live stream US Open 2021 tennis from wherever you are in the world.",
    "If you're abroad during the US Open, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred tennis live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a 2021 US Open live stream from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to Amazon Prime Video",
    "Last year's singles winners were Dominic Thiem in the men's and Naomi Osaka in the women's. Osaka, who also lifted the trophy in 2018, is back to defend her title, but Thiem has pulled out of the tournament with a wrist injury.",
    "Other past US Open winners in the women's draw include Sloane Stephens, Bianca Andreescu and Angelique Kerber, but Serena Williams has won the title more times than all of them combined, the first of her six triumphs coming all the way back in 1999.",
    "It's a rather different story on the men's side of the draw, which features just three former champions in Marin \u010cili\u0107, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic.",
    "2021 has seen the tennis calendar return to its former glory, with all four grand slams, as well as the Olympics, being squeezed into seven glorious months.",
    "Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic were victorious at the Australian Open in Melbourne in February; Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 and that man Djokovic again tasted glory at the French Open in June; and Ashleigh Barty and yes, Nole again, took the grand prizes at Wimbledon in July.",
    "At the Olympics, Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev took home gold.",

    "The women's singles final is set to take place on Saturday, September 11, beginning at 4pm ET / 1pm PT. The men's singles final starts at the same time the following day, and brings the tournament to a close.",
    "The first eight days of the tournament are earmarked for Rounds 1-3 and the Round of 16, during which the top seeds will be kept separate from one another.",
    "The quarter-finals stage begins on Tuesday, September 7, and it's from this point onwards that the big guns will face each other and the true contenders will emerge.",
    "Since 1973 there\u2019s been parity in what the winners of the women's singles and the winner of the men's singles each receive.",
    "This year\u2019s champions will receive $2.5 million each \u2013 down from the $3 million the winners each received in 2020.",
    "The men\u2019s and women\u2019s doubles champions will receive $660,000 per pair, as will the mixed doubles champions.",
    "In total there\u2019s a bumper prize pot of $57.5 million in total prize money to be shared amongst competitors taking part in this year\u2019s tournament.",
    "World No. 1 Novak Djokovic is the clear favorite in the men's singles. The Serb has won each of the past three grand slams, including just his second ever French Open triumph, during which he overcame clay master Rafael Nadal.",
    "The women's singles seems to get tougher to call by the year, with numerous grand slam winners in contention. Naomi Osaka and Ashleigh Barty are the favorites, but there's no shortage of serious challengers.",
