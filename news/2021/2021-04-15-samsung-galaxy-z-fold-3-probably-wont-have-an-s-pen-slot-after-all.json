    "The latest in Samsung\u2019s folding phone lineup - expected to be called the Galaxy Z Fold 3 - could be shown off as early as July, though the latest leaks suggest we might be a little disappointed with its S Pen support.",
    "The latest reports from South Korean site Naver say that despite still trying to incorporate the S Pen into the Galaxy Z Fold 3\u2019s design until last month, plans have now been scrapped. Supposedly this was done to make the Galaxy Z Fold 3 more dust and water-resistant, and because the phone just wasn\u2019t big enough to house all of its components and an S Pen.",
    "Instead, Samsung could offer a phone case that can hold both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and S Pen in a similar way to the Galaxy S21 Ultra\u2019s stylus support.",
    "Apart from the fact it will likely fold like a book, we don\u2019t know anything about the Galaxy Z Fold 3 for certain. However, multiple leaks and rumors can give us an idea of what we should expect in July if there is a reveal event.",
    "The most interesting leak is that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 could incorporate an under-display camera, and would be the first Samsung phone to do so. We\u2019ve heard this one a few times and it means that the selfie camera notch would be removed, instead putting the camera behind the display.",
    "This would give you a bit of extra screen space, and a cleaner design at the cost of reduced photo quality.",
    "It\u2019s also been suggested that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will become Samsung\u2019s new productivity-focused flagship. Reports have said that the Galaxy Note line will be discontinued, which explains why Samsung wants to incorporate the S Pen and give the Galaxy Z Fold 3 a less busy display.",
    "Until we know more, we\u2019ll have to take all of this with a pinch of salt. We might soon find out for certain what the Galaxy Z Fold 3 looks like. As we learn more we\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated."
