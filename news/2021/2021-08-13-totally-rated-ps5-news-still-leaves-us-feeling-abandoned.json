  "article": [
    "In this week\u2019s Totally Rated, new details on the PS5 game Abandoned have surfaced. We also look at not one, but two new Samsung Galaxy phones and discuss some surprise reveals for the Sonic 2 movie.",
    "Abandoned continues to fan the flames of speculation as we waited for an app update that never came \u2013 or at least not when it was supposed to.",
    "We did however have two new Samsung phones to look at to keep us occupied \u2013 the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 \u2013 both of which we've been impressed by so far.",
    "Finally, Idris Elba cracked the internet in half when he announced via Twitter that he'd be playing Knuckles in Sonic 2, the upcoming sequel to the video game adaptation done right.",
    "We haven't seen speculation like this for quite some time, but Abandoned \u2013 which definitely isn't a Silent Hill reboot, we promise \u2013 continued to fan the flames this week as developer Blue Box promised to share more details on the game.",
    "Unfortunately, those details continue to elude us as Abandoned's PS5 app update has been delayed due to technical issues. The devs insist the delay is a legitimate one, and that it wasn't intentionally trying to mislead eager fans.",
    "Originally (and still, by many) thought to be a disguised reboot of the Silent Hill series, Abandoned hasn't truly been able to fly over the cuckoo's nest just yet. Various details include ties to legendary developer Hideo Kojima, who had previously worked on the now-notoriously-hard-to-find PT demo \u2013 originally a playable teaser for a Silent Hill reboot.",
    "Speculation continues to run rampant as we patiently wait for the Abandoned PS5 app update, but until then, we're left to drift in purgatory. Kind of like the town of Silent Hill itself.",
    "Shifting from a world of horror and back to reality, then, the TechRadar team reviewed two new Samsung phones: the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3.",
    "TechRadar's US editor-in-chief Matt Swider giving his first impressions on the Galaxy Z Fold 3: \"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 lays the bait for people who normally consider themselves early adopters but held out on last year\u2019s Fold 2. It has awaited upgrades like S Pen support, greater durability and water-resistance in an otherwise familiar-looking smartphone with mostly unchanged cameras.",
    "\"It\u2019s still expensive, but starts at a slightly lower price than its predecessors, meaning those early adopters on the sidelines may finally be tempted to join the foldable phone future.\"",
    "Tom Bedford reviewed the Galaxy Z Flip 3, and had some positive things to say too: \"The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is probably the best clamshell foldable phone out there right now \u2013 not that that says much with the limited competition - though it doesn\u2019t present any major changes to its predecessor.",
    "\"It has a sturdy design and good-looking screen, though the cameras aren\u2019t great and the battery is fairly small. Some slight tweaks and a slightly lower price might win over those who were on the fence about such phones before.\"",
    "Idris Elba cracked the internet in half this week as he announced on Twitter that he'll be voicing Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Knuckles rounds out the series' iconic trio, as Tails is also appearing in the sequel alongside the blue blur.",
    "Elba lending his voice to Knuckles had the TechRadar team wondering what other characters could show up in the sequel, and who would voice them?",
    "While we feel Danny DeVito would've been the ideal fit for Dr. Eggman, other characters do come to mind. Bill Fagerbakke (voice of Spongebob's Patrick Star) would be a shoe-in for Big the Cat. Or for something a bit more star-studded, we can't think of a better fit for Shadow the Hedgehog than Robert Pattinson.",
    "Totally Rated features reviews and opinions of what's hot and what's not in the tech and gaming world.",
    "Bringing together leading titles from across the industry, we hear first hand from those who have reviewed - and rated - the very latest games and products on the market.",
    "New episodes of Totally Rated will roll out every week."
