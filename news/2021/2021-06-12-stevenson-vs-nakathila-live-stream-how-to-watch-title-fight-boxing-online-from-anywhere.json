    "Sensational southpaw Shakur Stevenson has his sights set on his second world title in just his 16th bout, but stood in his way is the powerful but little-known quantity that is Jeremiah Nakathila. With the vacant WBO Junior Lightweight on the line, read on as we explain how to watch a Shakur Stevenson vs Jeremiah Nakathila live stream today and catch all the boxing action online from anywhere in the world.",
    "Nakathila has had to wait a long time for a title fight opportunity, and he'll be doubly keen to make his mark with this being his first fight in the States. The 31-year-old Namibian is far less heralded than Shakur, but he's won all of his last 10 fights by knockout.",

    "Shakur is certainly the favorite here, but it's shaping up as a clash of styles that could really test the undefeated former WBO featherweight champ.",
    "Nakathila is the much heavier hitter of the two men, but Shakur - a pure boxer who's got this far because of his skill and intelligence in the ring - has hinted that he might try going toe-to-toe instead.",
