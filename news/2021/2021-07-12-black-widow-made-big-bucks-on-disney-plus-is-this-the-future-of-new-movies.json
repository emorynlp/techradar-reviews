    "Black Widow's simultaneous launch in theaters on Disney Plus looked to be a massive success over this past weekend. As well as landing $158 million at the worldwide box office, the long-awaited movie starring Scarlett Johansson generated more than $60 million in Premier Access purchases via the streaming service.",
    "It was the highest box office launch since the pandemic began last year. Disney hasn't gotten this detailed with data about money coming in from Disney Plus before \u2013 but the fact it's touting the number at all suggests it considers the launch a success. Getting Black Widow via Premier Access costs $29.99 / \u00a319.99 / AUD $34.99, so that number likely includes a couple of million purchases at least.",
    "According to Deadline, that $60 million figure leans heavily towards people watching in the US.",
    "Right now, this is the only Marvel movie on the calendar to get a simultaneous release via Disney Plus. Next up in the MCU is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which releases exclusively in theaters on September 3.",
    "The move to release Black Widow in theaters and on streaming services was savvy \u2013 with rising Covid-19 cases in countries like the UK, the option to watch from home is most welcome. While we all miss the theatrical experience, flexibility is key right now.",
    "For Marvel movies, though, Disney sounds pretty firm on keeping that exclusive theatrical window. \u201cIf it\u2019s something like a Marvel movie or a Lucas [Star Wars] movie, something that\u2019s going to have a lot of legs playing into a larger mythology, then [going to a theater] is the way that fans tend to prefer to consume those movies,\u201d CEO Bob Chapek said back in May.",
    "Disney is committed to theatrical releases, then, but it also wants to see shorter delays between the day a movie hits cinema screens and is available to stream from home.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like things are going to return to exactly how Disney released films pre-pandemic,\u201d Chapek added, \u201cbut films will be arriving much quicker, and Disney Plus Premier Access may stick around a little longer if consumer habits change and it\u2019s financially successful.\u201d",
    "Well, the launch of Black Widow would appear to suggest it's been successful. If anything is an impetus to change the traditional release model, surely it's seeing these numbers.",
    "Disney has plenty of reasons to back the full return of theaters, though \u2013 in 2019, before theaters around the world closed, it claimed an enormous 38% of the domestic US box office gross.",
    "As Chapek says, the future of Premier Access depends on consumer habits as well as money \u2013 it's genuinely not the same experience to watch a blockbuster at home as it is on the big screen. But for many people, this was a comfortable alternative for Black Widow, and for Disney, selling the movie directly to consumers is no doubt great for its bottom line.",
    "It definitely feels like this model has a future, then, while we wait for the world to return to normal."
