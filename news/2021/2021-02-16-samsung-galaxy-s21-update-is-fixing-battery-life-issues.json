    "The Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus and Galaxy S21 Ultra are impressive phones, but recently they got a little bit less impressive for some users, who reported that the February security patch led to significant battery life issues. Now, though, there\u2019s a new update which might fix the problem.",
    "The new update is firmware version G99xBXXU1AUB6, and many posters on the XDA Developers forum are reporting that it has solved their battery life woes. That said, there are some who claim it hasn\u2019t fixed the problem, so it might not be a solution for everyone.",
    "Still, if you\u2019ve experienced battery life issues with a Samsung Galaxy S21 model then it\u2019s got to be worth a try \u2013 and keeping your phone up to date is generally a good idea in any case.",
    "You can check for this latest update by heading to \u2018Settings\u2019, then the \u2018Software update\u2019 section, then by tapping \u2018Download and install\u2019. Note, however, that since the update is currently rolling out, it might not have reached you yet, so if you don\u2019t see it try again in a day or two.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that the battery life issue only appears to be affecting models of the phones with Exynos chipsets, so if you\u2019re using a Snapdragon version (which you likely will be if you\u2019re in the US), then you shouldn\u2019t notice any battery life changes with this update.",
    "Equally, if you\u2019re using an Exynos phone but haven\u2019t experienced the bug then you also probably won\u2019t see any improvements to battery life \u2013 this purely seems to be a bug fix rather than a more general battery improvement.",
