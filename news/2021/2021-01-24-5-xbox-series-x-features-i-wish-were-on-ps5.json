    "The PS5 has been my go-to gaming machine since it launched in November, but there are some Xbox Series X features that I seriously wish were on Sony\u2019s console. In fact, I\u2019d go as far to say that some of the features that PS5 is missing are actually far more egregious absences than the ones that don't appear on Microsoft\u2019s console.",
    "As I mentioned last time, I\u2019m in no way advocating that the PS5 and Xbox Series X be carbon copies of one another. But when a feature becomes so essential to my console experience, I can\u2019t help but wish it was available on both next-gen systems.",
    "After mulling over five PS5 features I wish were on Xbox Series X, it\u2019s clear that there are innovations on Microsoft\u2019s console that would ultimately make Sony\u2019s system better. So, without further ado, let\u2019s jump in.",
    "If you own a PS5 and game on a monitor, you\u2019ve probably already encountered this frustrating issue. Right now, the PS5 can\u2019t output at 1440p. That means you\u2019re stuck at 1080p resolution, and missing out on 78% more pixels.",
    "Not having 1440p support is a baffling oversight from Sony, particularly as the Xbox Series X is compatible. In fact, all of the Xbox family of consoles support it. When you consider that thousands of gamers prefer to play on a monitor, particularly when it comes to competitive titles or those who stream on console, by not supporting a resolution that is so widely used, Sony is severely limiting the PS5\u2019s appeal.",
    "In an interview with Japanese publication AV Watch (as translated by Eurogamer), PlayStation hardware boss Masayasu Ito and PlayStation platform boss Hideaki Nishino said Sony \u201cwant to prioritize support for TVs\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no technological problem at all\u201d that prevents the PS5 from outputting at 1440p. Ito-san went on to say that the company would respond if there was demand for it\u2026 well, there certainly is, so please add 1440p support soon, Sony.",
    "Sony decided to go its own route for the PS5\u2019s spatial audio, and while I\u2019ve been fairly impressed with the Tempest 3D Audio in games like Demon\u2019s Souls and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, I still wish Sony would support Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X as well.",
    "Yes, you have to pay a premium for either service, but Dolby Atmos is being adopted more and more throughout the entertainment industry, and not having Atmos support is a blow to any cinephile who plans to use the PS5 as their main home entertainment system.",
    "Sony\u2019s Tempest 3D Audio is also extremely limited when it comes to customizing your experience. Both Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X let you create your own equalizer settings and support a variety of presets, while Sony\u2019s 3D Audio only lets you choose between five differing levels, which you\u2019re supposed to match to your ear's comfort.",
    "At the moment, 3D audio is also available via headphones only. Sony has said support is coming for TV speakers and soundbars in the future, but right now, you\u2019re out of luck if you don\u2019t wear a headset when gaming.",
    "I\u2019m not optimistic we\u2019ll see other spatial audio solutions anytime soon on PS5, but more choice for consumers is always a good thing. You hear that, Sony?",
    "Arguably the jewel in Microsoft\u2019s next-gen crown, Quick Resume is a revelation. Being able to suspend and resume multiple games at the same time and switch between them seamlessly is simply awesome, and I\u2019m still surprised whenever I return to a game after a couple of weeks, only to discover I\u2019m exactly where I left off.",
    "Even though PS5 games boot up extremely quickly, and have some nifty shortcuts thanks to Activity Cards, you'll still have to sit through the odd splash screen and navigate through menus whenever you start a new game.",
    "The issue really becomes apparent when playing PS4 games, though. None of them support Activity Cards, and they haven\u2019t been optimized to take advantage of the PS5\u2019s super-fast SSD. Games like Days Gone still have lengthy load times, and if you decide to play something else, it\u2019s an exercise in patience as you wait to play. The Xbox Series X basically all but eliminates this problem, and it would be a serious win if Sony could do something similar.",
    "If you\u2019re a fan of unlocking achievements or collecting trophies, as many gamers are, the PS5 isn\u2019t exactly designed with virtual completionists in mind.",
    "When you bring up the PS5\u2019s command center, there\u2019s no quick shortcut to view trophies like there was on PS4. Instead, you have to scroll to your profile to find your trophy list, which isn\u2019t immediately obvious. A couple of button presses later, and you\u2019re finally where you want to be, but it\u2019s a process that needs to be simplified.",
    "On Xbox Series X, achievements are far more accessible. Simply open the Guide during a game and you can view a full list of what you need to unlock at a glance. I also prefer the vertical scrolling nature of achievements as opposed to Sony\u2019s horizontal layout. When you\u2019re trying to skim through what\u2019s often a long list of accolades, it feels far more cumbersome to sift through them horizontally, so it would be nice to see Sony make some improvements here.",
    "Even after nearly three months, I still forget how to turn off the PS5 correctly. For some reason, unknown to perhaps anyone but Sony\u2019s chief UI designers, the team decided to turn its back on years of ingrained muscle memory and change the way we shut down the PS5. Why?",
    "On PS4, you simply held down the PS Button, and selected whether you wanted to put the console into rest mode. The same is basically true on Xbox Series X. On PS5, however, holding down the PlayStation button now takes you to the home screen, and to turn off the system, you have to tap the PS Button and make one nudge to the left (or 10 to the right) until you reach the power icon. From there, you can choose either Rest Mode or to turn off the system completely.",
    "That means it can potentially take up to 12 button presses instead of two to shut down the PS5 (as I often forget you can even nudge it to the left when in the command center). What the heck, Sony?",
    "Unfortunately, by the time Sony decides to revert this weird decision to something more reasonable, I\u2019ll have undoubtedly got so used to the long-winded way of turning off the PS5 that I\u2019ll have to relearn everything again. Urgh."
