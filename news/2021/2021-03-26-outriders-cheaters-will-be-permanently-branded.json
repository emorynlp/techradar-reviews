    "Outriders is getting medieval with its punishments for cheaters, as the game will permanently brand players who don\u2019t follow the rules. In a recent developer update, the People Can Fly studio behind the game explains that cheating will earn you a \"discreet but visible\" watermark on your screen.",
    "Cheaters will also be forced to matchmake with only other caught cheaters \u2013 similar to what we've seen in Call of Duty: Warzone \u2013 so their ill-gotten gains don\u2019t impact the player base at large. While the branding isn\u2019t likely to change everyone\u2019s attitude, it will give streamers and content creators an extra incentive to play fair \u2013 otherwise, their gameplay will out them as a cheater.",
    "People who cheated in the Outriders demo will be branded when the main game releases; however, it can be removed. People Can Fly explained that to clear the literal mark against your name cheaters \"must DELETE ALL CHARACTERS AND ITEMS ON YOUR ENTIRE ACCOUNT in order to wipe the slate clean.\" The caps lock text should tell you how serious they are.",
    "If you want to avoid being branded as a cheater in Outriders, you\u2019ll need to make sure you don\u2019t break the rules. At the time of writing the following actions are what People Can Fly define as cheating:",
    "It\u2019s great to see People Can Fly taking such a hard stance against cheating from the get go. If its strategies work, we could see them implemented in some of our other favorite multiplayer titles.",
