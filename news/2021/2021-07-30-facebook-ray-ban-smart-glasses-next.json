  "summary": "The smart glasses will retain the iconic Ray-Ban sunglasses look, but initially lack a display",
  "article": [
    "While Facebook\u2019s VR efforts under the Oculus brand are well-known, that isn\u2019t the only head-worn tech in the company\u2019s pipeline. The social media giant is also investing heavily in AR and smart glasses. In this week\u2019s quarterly earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that its first smart glasses will be Facebook\u2019s next hardware release.",
    "\u201cLooking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica,\u201d Zuckerberg said in the call. \u201cThe glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.\u201d",
    "Zuckerberg didn\u2019t specify what those 'neat things' are. But this first pair won\u2019t be the full augmented-reality (AR) glasses that Facebook is also developing. The firm has previously said these first glasses won\u2019t have a built-in display, with functionality closer to Snapchat Spectacles than Microsoft HoloLens or the discontinued Magic Leap One.",
    "In January, Facebook Hardware Chief Andrew Bosworth clarified that the company wasn\u2019t even calling them an AR product, instead preferring the term \u201csmart glasses.\u201d Zuckerberg said his company views these first glasses as a consumer stepping stone towards its \u201cProject Aria\u201d glasses that can overlay 3D digital objects into the world around you.",
    "Facebook didn\u2019t provide an update on the product\u2019s specific release window.",
    "In late 2020, former VR chief Hugo Barra had said that these first smart glasses would arrive in 2021. In January, Facebook reaffirmed that the product was still on track for this year.",
    "Virtual and augmented reality products have been slow to catch on with consumers en masse, but Silicon Valley is still bullish on the tech\u2019s potential.",
    "Facebook has previously said that it ultimately envisions a pair of \u201cmagic glasses\u201d as the holy grail of its AR research efforts. These future specs would appear like regular eyeglasses but create the illusion of digital objects and characters overlaid inside the real world.",
    "Apple is reportedly developing a product that fits that billing, along with a bulkier mixed-reality headset that could launch first. Microsoft also continues to advance its HoloLens initiative, and earlier this year, leaked concept videos showed Samsung\u2019s AR plans.",
    "Facebook bought Oculus in 2014 for $2.3 billion (\u00a31.6b, AUD$3.12b). Although the startup\u2019s founders have long since left the company, Facebook hasn\u2019t let its foot off the gas, continuing to push the tech forward.",
    "This week, Zuckerberg said he sees the virtual \u201cmetaverse\u201d \u2013 a term for a virtual social world viewed through VR and AR products \u2013 as the future of Facebook. \u201cIn the coming years, I expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cIn many ways the metaverse is the ultimate expression of social technology.\u201d",
    "In March, Facebook said its latest model, the Oculus Quest 2, had already outsold every Oculus headset combined."
