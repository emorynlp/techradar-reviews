    "If your vacuum is looking a bit worse for wear or you\u2019re just after something more powerful, don\u2019t buy one just yet. While this might seem like strange advice, Amazon Prime Day is just around the corner and we\u2019re expecting big savings on vacuums and floor care with Prime Day deals.",
    "This year\u2019s Amazon Prime Day starts on Monday June 21 and it\u2019s a great opportunity to grab one of the best vacuum cleaners at a much more affordable price. Last year we saw discounts of 38% off in the US, and 44% in the UK, and we\u2019re expecting to see the same this time around.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for something that requires even less effort on the cleaning front, Prime Day is a great time to save on the best robot vacuums, and while these appliances can be a pretty big investment normally, savings last year were as big as over $100 / \u00a370 / AU$129 off top brands including Eufy.",
    "Some top-rated vacuums will drop to their lowest price ever during Prime Day but it\u2019s likely that some brands will launch new products soon after so the previous models will see hefty discounts.",
    "Vacuum cleaners have come a long way in recent years too, and the suction power new models from big brands such as Shark, iRobot, and Eufy can offer will give your flooring a deeper clean than older models. It\u2019s not just suction power that\u2019s improved either, maneuverability is now a top priority for new vacuum cleaners and many have swivel steering or flexible designs that allow you to reach right underneath furniture.",
    "If you\u2019ve been lugging around a heavy corded vacuum, cordless models now offer battery run times of up to 60 minutes and are designed to be lightweight and easy to navigate around your home. Alternatively, many robot vacuums are now fitted with smart mapping so that they know their way around your home, and the more advanced models can even empty their own dust bin so you don\u2019t have to bother.",
    "Whatever you\u2019re looking for, we\u2019ll be bringing you all the biggest savings on vacuums across Amazon Prime Day."
