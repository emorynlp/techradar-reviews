    "Minecraft has often been called a virtual Lego simulator, and now it\u2019s finally living up to that name thanks to a fan-created texture pack. The MineBricks pack turns most of Minecraft\u2019s blocks, items, and mobs into bricky versions of themselves and even adds a distinctive clicking sound whenever you build or break objects.",
    "We\u2019ve tried the mod out and absolutely love it. We particularly adore the intricate designs given to each block - they aren\u2019t all just one brick but selections of multiple bricks stuck together to make them look more complex and like a real Lego creation.",
    "This isn\u2019t an officially licensed pack though, and while MineBricks never uses the word Lego it\u2019s possible the toy manufacturer might still ask them to take the project down at some point. If that\u2019s the case you might want to head over to the MineBricks page ASAP to ensure you have a copy to keep hold of forever.",
    "Installing fan-made texture packs in Minecraft can be a little tricky if you haven\u2019t done it before. So here\u2019s our quick guide on what you\u2019ll need to do to start playing with Lego-like bricks in Minecraft.",
    "Firstly you\u2019re going to need Minecraft Java Edition on PC, sorry console players you\u2019re out of luck this time. Also, you won\u2019t be able to install the mod if you\u2019re playing on the Windows 10 version of the game either; if you can play cross-platform with non-PC users and access the DLC store, that means you have the Windows 10 version.",
    "Next, you\u2019ll want to head to the official MineBricks page to download the texture pack. If you\u2019re looking to try out the pack without investing in it, you can download either a 128x or 256x resolution version for free. Alternatively for just $2 (around \u00a31.5 / AU$3) you can snag the 512x resolution pack, or splash out for $5 (around \u00a33.5 / AU$7) and score both the 512x and highest quality 1024x versions.",
    "No matter which MineBricks pack you secure, your next step is the same. Unfortunately, the texture pack doesn\u2019t yet support the latest release of Minecraft, so instead you\u2019re going to want to install the older 1.16 version of the game. This means some features will be lost, but you\u2019ll be able to swap back to the more up-to-date version at any time.",
    "To install 1.16 open up the Minecraft Launcher and look for the Installations tab near the top of the window. Here, select New Installation and under Version look for release 1.16. With that option chosen, give the installation a name then hit Create and you should be good to go. Well, almost.",
    "The final step of installing the MineBricks mod is to open up your 1.6 version of Minecraft and before you jump into a game choose options. Here you should then see Resource Packs, and then you\u2019ll want to click Open Resource Packs Folder. Drag and drop the .zip file (there\u2019s no need to extract it) for MineBricks into the resource pack folder, then close it. Back on the Minecraft tab, you should now see a new option to use the mod and you are finally ready to get playing."
