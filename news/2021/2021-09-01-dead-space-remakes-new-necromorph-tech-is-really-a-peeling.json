    "Developer Motive Studio shared new details about the upcoming Dead Space remake in an almost hour-long Twitch stream on August 31, including how the game\u2019s story, combat, and gameplay mechanics have been tweaked for the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC reboot.",
    "One particularly gruesome new mechanic that caught the eye is how you can expose the innards of necromorphs via a new technique called \u2018peeling\u2019 \u2013 which is exactly what it sounds like.",
    "Previously, players could dismember the limbs of encroaching necromorphs using Isaac Clarke\u2019s plasma cutter and various other weaponry. But in the remake, you\u2019ll need to peel back the flesh of Isaac\u2019s sinewy adversaries and expose the bone before you can lop off a leg or flailing arm like some sort of deranged surgeon.",
    "The \u2018dynamic flesh peeling system\u2019 also acts as a damage indicator for when you\u2019re using weapons that don\u2019t revolve around amputation, like the pulse rifle, so it should be more obvious when you\u2019re about to finish off your foe \u2013 handy with ammo being so scarce.",
    "It\u2019s clear that the peeling mechanic will impact how Dead Space plays, then, and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola said it should encourage players to use different weapons to get the job done.",
    "\u201cFor us what is interesting is this opens a whole new layer of shooting and combat loop, where you can have some weapons that are better at carving through the enemies and some that are better at cleaning them and removing their flesh,\u201d said Campos-Oriola.",
    "The Dead Space remake incorporates two quality of life changes from Dead Space 2 as well. Isaac will now have a voice and will speak during conversations with other characters and when appropriate. Changes have also been made to the zero-g simulation sections that make the game feel more realistic and easier to navigate.",
    "\u201cNow you can interact as you fly around, go into tighter corridors and it allows us to revisit some of the old content and introduce new ways to navigate,\u201d Campos-Oriola explained. \u201cIt allows us to create new environments with new challenges to surprise the people who know the game.\u201d",
    "Even though it\u2019s early in development, the Dead Space remake looks like it\u2019s shaping up nicely. By sticking to the core foundation of what made the original so great, Motive Studio appears to be focusing on making careful and considered changes.",
    "This will also be reflected in the remake\u2019s story, which Campos-Oriola said will stay faithful to the original, but will be enriched with new elements and additional content \u2013 none of which will be hidden behind microtransactions (as in Dead Space 3).",
    "While remakes can sometimes be a poisoned chalice due to nostalgia masking many of the game\u2019s flaws, we\u2019ve seen some fantastic revivals in recent years including Resident Evil 2 and the sublime Final Fantasy VII Remake. If Dead Space can come close to matching either of those, we\u2019re in for a treat."
