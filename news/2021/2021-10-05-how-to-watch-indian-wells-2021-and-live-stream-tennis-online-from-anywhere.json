  "article": [
    "Thought the big tennis action was pretty much done for the season? US Open champions Daniil Medvedev and Emma Raducanu headline a star-studded event in the desert, as Indian Wells hosts its first ever autumn tournament (aka the BNP Paribas Open). Serving up 12 days of A-list action, there's a reason many call it the fifth Grand Slam, so read to find out how to watch an Indian Wells live stream from anywhere - including ways to watch the tennis absolutely FREE.",
    "WTA tennis is as ludicrously strong as it is unpredictable right now, and amongst the contenders for the trophy are Leylah Fernandez - whose sensational US Open run was ended in the final by Raducanu - Aryna Sabalenka, former French open champ Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, Elina Svitolina, Maria Sakkari, Ons Jabeur, and 2015 champ Simona Halep.",
    "That list could go on and on, with all of the seeded players more than capable of making a deep run in the tournament. And look out for legend Kim Clijsters, making her first Indian Wells appearance in 10 years.",
    "The ATP competition is shaping up as a next-gen showdown, with Medvedev up against Olympic champion Alexander Zverev, Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini, F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime, French Open runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas, Denis Shapovalov and Jannik Sinner. Oh, and a little Andy Murray flavor for the Union Jack wavers.",
    "With many of the old masters out of the running, everyone's got a shot at the title. Here's how you can live stream Indian Wells 2021 tennis from wherever you are in the world.",
    "If you're abroad during Indian Wells, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred tennis live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a 2021 Indian Wells live stream from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to Amazon Prime Video"
