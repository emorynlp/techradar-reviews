    "A black-and-white television screen switches on. A 1950s era car decorated with a \u201cJust Married\u201d sign drives into the picturesque town of Westview \u2013 a classic piece of Americana. Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff is in a wedding dress, and sitting alongside the Avengers\u2019 resident Synthezoid, Vision, dressed in a suit.",
    "A \u201950s-style theme song tells of a newlywed couple who just moved to town, having left the big city to find a quiet life. They add that she\u2019s a \u201cmagical gal in a small town locale\u201d, while her \u201chubby\u201d is \u201cpart machine\u201d.",
    "Wanda uses her magic powers to put a Sold sign on the real estate agents board, while Vision\u2019s attempt to carry her across the threshold is scuppered when he phases through the door, dropping Wanda to the floor. The couple dance in the front room as on-screen credits say this new WandaVision show stars Wanda Maximoff and Vision.",
    "In the kitchen, Wanda is using her powers to do the dishes, when one \u201cflying saucer\u201d hits Vision \u2013 luckily he has an indestructible head. Wanda uses her magic to repair the plate, and offers Vision a tasty meal \u2013 he points out that he doesn\u2019t eat food, prompting laughter from the studio audience.",
    "Vision asks if there\u2019s something special about today, highlighting a small heart drawn above today\u2019s date \u2013 Wednesday August 23. Neither of them can remember what it means \u2013 despite Vision\u2019s flawless memory. They agree they\u2019re both celebrating\u2026 something. \u201cA special day.\u201d \u201cOf great significance.\u201d",
    "Vision leaves for work, nearly forgetting to change his Synthezoid face into human form. He blows Wanda a kiss.",
    "Wanda is looking at the calendar, trying to work out the significance of the date, when there\u2019s a knock at the front door. It\u2019s Agnes, \u201cyour neighbor to the right \u2013 my right not yours\u201d. She\u2019s welcoming the newcomers to the block \u2013 she\u2019d have been round sooner but her mother-in-law was in town, \u201cso I wasn\u2019t\u201d. Agnes tries to find out all she can about Wanda and Vision.",
    "Wanda tells her there\u2019s a special occasion \u2013 as Agnes does her best to guess, Wanda settles on the idea that it\u2019s their anniversary. \u201cHow many years?\u201d \u201cWell, it feels like we\u2019ve always been together.\u201d Agnes asks what she\u2019s planning, and offers to pick up a magazine full of tips for a killer evening.",
    "As \u2018Yakety Yak\u2019 by the Coasters plays on the radio, Vision carries out calculations at his workplace, Computational Services, Inc. He hands a vast quantity of forms over to his colleague, Norm. Vision asks Norm what it is they do there \u2013 they seemingly don\u2019t make, buy or sell anything\u2026 \u201cAll I know is that since you\u2019ve got here, productivity has gone up 300%,\u201d says Norm. Norm says Vision is like a walking computer. \u201cI\u2019m a regular carbon-based employee made entirely of organic matter!\u201d Vision counters angrily. He says he\u2019s on edge because he can\u2019t remember the importance of the date.",
    "Vision\u2019s boss, Mr Hart, steps out of his office and tells Vision that he and his wife are looking forward to dinner this evening \u2013 that\u2019s the relevance of the heart on the calendar. Hart explains that these dinners are a rite of passage in the company \u2013 one that another colleague, Jones, failed spectacularly because he wore a turtleneck like a \u201cbeatnik\u201d.",
    "Back at the \u201cVision residence\u201d, Agnes is giving advice from Glamorous magazine\u2019s \u201cHusband Issue\u201d. Vision phones home about plans for later on, and Wanda says everything\u2019s under control. Vision says he\u2019s nervous about the evening, that there\u2019s an awful lot riding on it \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t go well it could be \u201cthe end\u201d. It\u2019s a classic sitcom case of crossed wires.",
    "The show cuts to a commercial for the new-and-improved ToastMate 2000 \u2013 manufactured by Stark Industries. \u201cIt\u2019s the go-to for clever housewives,\u201d says the host. The toaster fires up, its indicator light flashing red \u2013 pretty much the only color in the episode. The slogan \u2013 \u201cForget the past, this is your future\u201d \u2013 also feels like it has more relevance than trying to get people to buy bread products.",
    "Back in the show, Vision returns to the house with Mr Hart and his wife. They\u2019re surprised to see all the lights are off. As Vision looks in the kitchen, Wanda wanders down the stairs dressed in an elaborate nightgown \u2013 entirely inappropriate for the occasion. She sneaks up behind Mr Hart and puts her hands over his eyes, asking him to \u201cGuess who!\u201d. Mr Hart is shocked.",
    "Vision improvises and explains this is the traditional Sokovian greeting of hospitality \u2013 he forgot to tell them his wife is European. \u201cWe don\u2019t break bread with Bolsheviks,\u201d says the conservative Mr Hart \u2013 though Mrs Hart is more accepting. Wanda takes Vision into the kitchen, and they try to work out what\u2019s going on. He explains that he\u2019s very grateful for what she\u2019s done, but they really need to prepare a meal for the Harts.",
    "Wanda magics herself into another dress, and calls Agnes in for help \u2013 \u201cwhat kind of housewife would I be if I didn\u2019t have a gourmet meal for four just lying about the place?\u201d Hearing clattering noises from the kitchen, Mrs Hart offers to help. Wanda pushes Agnes out of the house and starts to use her magic in an elaborate culinary ballet. Mrs Hart hears the noise again and opens the serving hatch to see what\u2019s going on. To distract her, Vision starts singing \u2018Yakety Yak\u2019 \u2013 she turns around before she notices Wanda surrounded by flying plates and food. Wanda slams the serving hatch closed.",
    "Vision suggests a sing-song and pulls out his ukulele \u2013 Mr Hart is spectacularly unimpressed. Vision rushes into the kitchen as a pair of lobsters fly out of the window. He takes over meat tenderizing duties, as Wanda entertains the guests. It\u2019s not going well, so Wanda takes one of the tips from Agnes\u2019s magazine and falls into Mr Hart\u2019s arms.",
    "Agnes arrives at the front door with a pineapple for the upside-down cake \u2013 the hosts usher her away quickly. Mr Hart tells Vision he\u2019s very disappointed, that all the chaos in the house suggests he\u2019s not management material after all. Just in time, Wanda gets \u201cbreakfast for dinner\u201d on the table.",
    "Mrs Hart asks lots of questions about the younger couple\u2019s past \u2013 where they\u2019re from, why they came here \u2013 but they\u2019re unable to give her any specifics. Mr Hart gets particularly irate that they can\u2019t answer, and starts choking on his food. Mrs Hart repeatedly tells him to \u201cstop it\u201d \u2013 she\u2019s laughing inappropriately, almost like she\u2019s stuck in a loop \u2013 but he collapses to the floor. Vision helps him by phasing his hand into Mr Hart\u2019s throat, removing the blockage.",
    "The Harts suddenly decide they have to leave, but point out they had a lovely time. Mrs Hart puts her hands over Wanda\u2019s eyes, recreating the \u201cSokovian greeting\u201d. Mr Hart tells Vision he made him proud \u2013 and that they\u2019ll be talking about a promotion first thing on Monday morning. As they leave, Wanda spots one of the missing lobsters in place of a door knocker.",
    "The couple sigh, as Vision restores his natural Synthezoid form. Wanda points out that they are an unusual couple, so they decide that today will be their anniversary and their song will be \u2018Yakety Yak\u2019. Wanda also creates them some wedding rings, and they both say \u201cI do\u201d.",
    "\u201cAnd they lived happily ever after,\u201d says Vision, as they kiss on the sofa. Vision flicks a switch on the remote control, and their \u2018show\u2019 cuts to credits.",
    "The camera pulls out on the screen to reveal someone in more modern setting watching the WandaVision show. They flick another remote control and the screen cuts to a test card saying: \u201cPlease stand by\u201d.",
    "Verdict:",
    "It\u2019s over 18 months since our last trip to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Spider-Man: Far From Home feels a long, long time ago. While it may be a while yet before we see any new MCU action on the big screen, however, WandaVision takes us back in style \u2013 despite being totally different to anything the most successful superhero franchise in history has ever done before.",
    "You know how people said the space opera of Guardians of the Galaxy or the comedy of Thor: Ragnarok were radical departures for the MCU? They\u2019ve got nothing on a show that owes more to \u201950s sitcoms like I Love Lucy than traditional Marvel offerings.",
    "Since the events of Avengers: Endgame, Wanda Maximoff and Vision (the latter, don\u2019t forget, unceremoniously killed by Thanos) have somehow found their way into the domestic \u201cbliss\u201d of American TV suburbia. (Almost) everything is monochrome, the aspect ratio is old-school 4:3, and there\u2019s apparently a studio audience in the couple\u2019s living room, laughing to all their jokes.",
    "It\u2019s a gloriously faithful (and funny) recreation of vintage television, from the corny mother-in-law gags and multi-camera set-ups, to the kitschy, explain-the-plot theme song. Even the visual effects \u2013 the animated stars that signify magic, the crockery that floats as if on strings \u2013 feel wonderfully retro. The actors\u2019 pauses for canned laughter help sell the setting even more.",
    "And yet, somehow, remarkably, WandaVision still feels part of the MCU. While Wanda and Vision are playing roles in the sitcom of their lives, they retain the traits of their original selves \u2013 a magic trick here, a display of robot intelligence there. And there are plenty of hints that they\u2019re part of something much bigger than a comedy show, whether it\u2019s characters asking repeated questions about their past \u2013 we\u2019re certain this goes deeper than traditional nosy neighbor territory \u2013 or electrical appliance adverts imploring: \u201cForget the past, this is your future\u201d.",
    "That red light glowing in an otherwise black-and-white scene simply can\u2019t be an accident. Indeed, WandaVision feels like a paradise of Easter eggs and hidden Marvel references \u2013 though we\u2019ll have to watch more to find out what they all mean. Let the fan theories commence!",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
