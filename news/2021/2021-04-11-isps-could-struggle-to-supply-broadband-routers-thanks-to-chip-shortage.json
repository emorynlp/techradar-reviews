  "article": [
    "Broadband routers could be the latest victim of the global chip shortage affecting the tech industry, with ISPs seeing huge delays when ordering this hardware according to a new report.",
    "Bloomberg\u2019s sources say that some broadband providers are being told they could have to wait for longer than a year \u2013 up to 60 weeks even \u2013 in terms of the lead time for router orders, which is obviously a far from ideal situation.",
    "As you probably guessed, the global pandemic is the catalyst here. Karsten Gewecke, Senior Vice President, Head of EMEA Regional Business Unit at router manufacturer Zyxel, told Bloomberg that it wasn\u2019t just interfering with the component supply chain and manufacturing of the hardware, but also spiking demand for better routers as many more people find themselves working from home. In other words, it\u2019s a double whammy for routers \u2013 less supply, and more demand.",
    "If ISPs are struggling to get enough stock of routers, that could potentially lead to difficulties when it comes to signing up new customers, or replacing faulty hardware.",
    "The report notes that Zyxel supplies some major ISPs including Zen Internet in the UK. Gewecke observes that no broadband provider is yet to run out of routers, but that it\u2019s been a close-run thing \u201cseveral times\u201d, and that \u201cit could still happen\u201d, with the next six months looking shaky for the router supply chain.",
    "It\u2019s a somewhat worrying picture, then, but nothing new for the broader tech industry, which is suffering from the ongoing chip shortage across a number of fronts, including CPUs and graphics cards, plus display panels, with the latter possibly impacting Apple\u2019s iPad, and MacBook production is purportedly being held back, too.",
