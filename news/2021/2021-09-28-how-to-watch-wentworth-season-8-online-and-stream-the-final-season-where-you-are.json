    "The agonizing year-long wait for the final instalment of Australian prison drama, Wentworth, is almost over. Season 8 part 2 (or Wentworth season 9 as some are calling it) is finally here. The last ever 10 episodes of Wentworth are set to hit our screens from next week so keep reading to find out how to watch Wentworth season 8 online from wherever you are.",
    "The Wentworth Correctional Facility-based show - which started with Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) striving to climb the prison hierarchy after she went down for attempted murder - is set to shut its doors and throw away the key after the final 10 episodes air this year.",
    "Creators Lara Radulovich and David Hannam aren't ones to shy away from difficult storylines. They've often been praised for their female-focused storytelling, diversity amongst characters, and exploration of the politics of women in a world without men.",
    "The abrupt ending of season 8 Part 1: Redemption left us with questions that have played on our minds for the last 12 months. What did Lou do in Sheila's True Path Cult? Will we find out the truth about Joan's visions?",
    "If you're ready for one last trip, put on your teal prison uniform and keep reading. We've listed everything you need to know about how to watch Wentworth season 8 online where you are and stream Part 2: The Final Sentence about to kick off.",
    "Going to be out of the country and don't want to miss the final season of Wentworth when it airs? Don't worry, we've got you covered. By using a VPN you can dodge any geo-blocks you might experience when trying to access your usual streaming service from outside of your home country.",
    "A VPN effectively tricks your device into thinking it is in another location by changing your IP address to one in the country you normally live in. That way you can access the streaming service you need to not miss a second of your favorite prison drama whilst you're away.",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Australia, just head to Foxtel Now"
