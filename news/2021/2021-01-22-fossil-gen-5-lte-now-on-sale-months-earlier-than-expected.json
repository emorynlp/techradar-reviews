    "The Fossil Gen 5 LTE was announced not long ago with a \u2018spring\u2019 release date, which we took to mean between around March and June, but it\u2019s actually already now on sale.",
    "Or at least it is in the US, where it\u2019s exclusive to Verizon. If you want to pick it up it will cost you $349 (roughly \u00a3260 / AU$450), or $14.54 per month for 24 months.",
    "At the time of writing there\u2019s no word on if or when the Fossil Gen 5 LTE will land in other countries like the UK and Australia, as it\u2019s so far only been announced for the US, but other Fossil wearables have had wider availability, so the Gen 5 LTE might do so as well.",
    "As the name suggests, the Fossil Gen 5 LTE is similar to the Fossil Gen 5, just with added LTE, meaning you can receive notifications, messages and phone calls on it, even when you\u2019re away from your phone. This is Fossil\u2019s first LTE wearable, so it\u2019s quite a significant upgrade.",
    "The rest of the specs though are much the same as the standard Fossil Gen 5. You get a 1.3-inch screen, a Snapdragon Wear 3100 chipset, 8GB of storage, 1GB of RAM, and a 400mAh battery.",
    "In our review we praised the standard Fossil Gen 5 for its solid battery life, understated design, and speedy operation, so expect the same again here (though using LTE could hit the battery life).",
    "However, we noted that the speaker was subpar and that it didn't have an ECG \u2013 the latter certainly hasn\u2019t been fixed for the Gen 5 LTE, and we\u2019re not aware of any changes to the speaker either, so bear those things in mind before buying it.",
