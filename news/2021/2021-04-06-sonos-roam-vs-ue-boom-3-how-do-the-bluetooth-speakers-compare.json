  "article": [
    "Bluetooth speakers are an essential bit of kit for any music lover who wants to take their tunes on the go \u2013 and the Sonos Roam could be the best one yet, if the issues we experienced during our tests are rectified by the company.",
    "The Sonos Roam stopped working halfway through our tests, which is why we haven\u2019t given it a star rating yet. Until we can confirm that our test unit had an isolated problem, we can't recommend the Sonos Roam. We'll be updating this piece once we've received more information on what caused the fault in our device.",
    "However, its mixture of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and integration with the wider Sonos ecosystem, meant that the Roam impressed us initially, and it could beat one of the best Bluetooth speakers on the planet, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3.",
    "On paper, the UE Boom 3 is a far simpler device, only offering Bluetooth connectivity. However, its rugged design, great app integration, and lower price means that the Sonos will have its work cut out if it wants to knock out the competition.",
    "If the issues we experienced do turn out to be a one-off, we'll have no problem recommending the Sonos Roam as the best portable speaker you can buy today; for now, here\u2019s how the two portable smart speakers compare based on their specs and our tests.",
    "The Sonos Roam will be available to buy on April 20, though it\u2019s available to preorder now from the Sonos website for $169 / \u00a3159 / AU$279.",
    "That makes it the cheapest Sonos speaker we\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 though the UE Boom 3 is cheaper still.",
    "The UE Boom 3 is available to buy for $149.99 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$199.95, which is around $30 more expensive than its predecessor, the UE Boom 2. However, as the speaker launched in 2018, it\u2019s often discounted to prices in the region of $120 / \u00a3100 / AU$150.",
    "Still too pricey? There are plenty of more budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers on the market, including the Anker Soundcore Flare, the UE Wonderboom 2, and the Urbanista Brisbane.",
    "In terms of shape and size, the Sonos Roam and the UE Boom 3 look fairly similar, with slim cylindrical builds and rubberized end caps.",
    "However, only the UE Boom features a wraparound fabric grille for 360-degree music playback. The Sonos Roam\u2019s drilled grille is limited to the front of the speaker, though its shape means you have a little more flexibility as to where you place it \u2013 you have the choice to position it horizontally for stability on uneven ground or vertically for a smaller footprint, with its triangular shape funneling sound upwards.",
    "On the left end of the Sonos Roam (when oriented horizonatlly) is a control panel with tactile buttons for adjusting your music playback, with each end cap coming in a concave shape to protect the Roam from bumps and scrapes.",
    "You can also find control buttons on the top of the UE Boom 3, with an on/off button and a \u2018magic button\u2019, which can be used to pause, play, and skips tracks. You can also use the magic button to directly access your playlists from a select few music providers \u2013 to do this you will need to set this feature up in the accompanying Megaboom app.",
    "Both waterproof speakers come with an IP67 water-and-dust-resistance rating, making them rugged enough to withstand the elements, with the ability to survive for 30 minutes in up to three feet of water.",
    "The UE Boom 3 has an extra feature for when you head to the pool or beach: it can float. It\u2019s certainly the more rugged-looking of the two speakers, coming in a range of colors (with the ability to personalize the finish if you wish), with a fabric grille that\u2019s designed to be super durable, as it was originally engineered for motorcycle jackets and fire equipment.",
    "By comparison, the Sonos Roam looks more like a traditional home speaker \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what the company was going for, aiming to make a portable speaker that looks great in the home as well as outdoors.",
    "Like all Sonos products, the new Roam comes in matte black and white color options, retaining the brand\u2019s minimalist look and penchant for sleek lines.",
    "While we didn't get to test the Sonos Roam as extensively as we would have liked, we're impressed by what we\u2019ve seen so far.",
    "In spite of its small size, the Sonos Roam delivers a powerful sonic performance with remarkably prominent bass. Inside the speaker are two class-H amplifiers, with a high-efficiency motor that Sonos says increases the power and range of the audio output, as well as a custom racetrack mid-woofer, and a tweeter.",
    "You can adjust the Roam\u2019s EQ settings via the Sonos S2 app. Sonos is also reprising its Automatic Trueplay tuning technology for the Sonos Roam, allowing the speaker to adjust its sound output based on its orientation, location, and content.",
    "Meanwhile, audio performance isn\u2019t the UE Boom 3\u2019s strong point. With a maximum volume of 90 decibels, this little speaker certainly packs a punch, and it has two 2-inch drivers and two 4-inch passive radiators for room-filling sound.",
    "However, we found that the mid frequencies sounded recessed, and there was a lack of clarity in the trebles.",
    "Saying that, the bass sounded decent, and the soundstage felt wide and spacious, with good frequency separation. You can also amend the default EQ settings in the dedicated app \u2013 it comes with four different presets \u2018The Standard\u2019, \u2018Cramped Spaces\u2019, \u2018Voices\u2019, and \u2018Bass Jump\u2019. Swapping between these presets didn\u2019t have a huge effect on the audio output, although you can create your own custom equalizer settings with the adjustable tuner. Simply move the sliders up and down on the bass, mid, and treble tuners until you find a sound you\u2019re happy with.",
    "As we mentioned, the UE Boom 3 offers 360-degree sound, so it might be better placed in the middle of a circle of friends than the Sonos Roam.",
    "Connectivity is where the Sonos Roam and the UE Boom 3 differ most dramatically. While the UE Boom is solely a Bluetooth speaker, the Sonos Roam comes with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so you can use it on the move and at home as part of a wider multi-room Sonos system.",
    "Let\u2019s look at the UE Boom 3 first.",
    "While Ultimate Ears doesn\u2019t specify which Bluetooth version it uses, the UE Boom 3 has a wireless range of up to 150ft / 45m, and can pair with up to eight devices, with the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously.",
    "You can pair two UE Boom 3 speakers for stereo sound, and up to 150 (no, reall7) Ultimate Ears speakers in mono. We found the connectivity to be very good when we tested the Boom 3, with no significant pairing or dropout issues.",
    "The Sonos Roam, on the other hand, comes with Bluetooth 5 and Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) connectivity, with the ability to pair two Roams for stereo sound, and it can be integrated into a Sonos speaker system over Wi-Fi.",
    "Automatic Switching between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi means the Sonos Roam will automatically connect to your Wi-Fi network when in range, and re-pair with your phone when you\u2019re out and about. Unfortunately, we were unable to test this due to the issues we encountered with the Sonos Roam.",
    "Another feature introduced with the Sonos Roam is Sound Swap, which allows you to \u2018throw\u2019 the music from your Sonos Roam to the nearest Sonos speaker available, using ultrasonic frequencies to communicate with each other. All you have to do is hold down the play button on the top of the Roam, and it works incredibly well.",
    "The Roam works with lots of connected audio sources, online or stored on a local network. If you want to fire up a playlist on Spotify using Spotify Connect, that\u2019s just as simple in-app as playing something you\u2019ve ripped to a networked storage device yourself. Just fire up the Sonos app, and once set up and connected to the internet, all your sources appear over Wi-Fi.",
    "The Sonos Roam also comes with the Alexa and Google Assistant voice assistants built-in, allowing it to double up as a smart speaker. This means you can control music playback with your voice, and use it to set reminders, control smart home devices, or access your calendar.",
    "So, the Sonos Roam has far more flexibility when it comes to connectivity than the UE Boom 3 \u2013 though if you\u2019re looking for a simple Bluetooth speaker, the Boom 3 might be the way to go.",
    "The UE Boom 3 offers an impressive 15 hours of playback from a single charge, coming with a micro-USB to USB-A cable in the box. You\u2019ll have to provide your own USB-wall adaptor, though.",
    "You can buy a dedicated charging dock for an additional $40 / \u00a335 / AU$50, which is handy if you want to keep the UE Boom in a particular area of your home.",
    "Meanwhile, the Sonos Roam has a claimed battery life of 10 hours, coming with USB-A to USB-C connector in the box \u2013 again, you\u2019ll need your own adaptor.",
    "It works with any Qi-certified wireless charging devices, but Sonos does sell its own charging base with magnets to hold the speaker in place, which is available to buy for $49 / \u00a344 / AU$79.",
    "Additionally, Sonos says that the Roam can last up to 10 days in sleep mode \u2013 it\u2019ll automatically go into sleep mode when you stop playing music.",
    "Whether you should buy the Sonos Roam or the UE Boom 3 comes down to what you\u2019re looking for from a portable speaker.",
    "Do you need an extremely rugged speaker you can chuck in your bag, float in the pool, and use for 360-degree sound? The UE Boom may be for you, and if you can get it at a discount, it\u2019s much cheaper than the Sonos Roam, too.",
    "However, if you want a speaker that can really bridge the gap between indoors and outdoors with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, already have other Sonos speakers at home, and you want to be able to control your smart home devices, the Sonos Roam is probably your best bet.",
    "It\u2019s important to stress that we haven\u2019t tested the Sonos Roam yet though, so we\u2019re going off the specs and Sonos\u2019 claims alone in our assessment. Still, those specs are very impressive, and if it\u2019s anything like its predecessor, the Sonos Move, the latest Sonos speaker will sound great to boot.",
    "Our advice? Hang on until we're able to confirm whether the problems we experienced with the Sonos Roam were a one-off, when when we\u2019ll be able to give you a deep dive into the audio performance of the portable speaker, and see if all those smart features are desirable \u2013 or indeed, over-complicated \u2013 in a Bluetooth speaker.",
    "With the Roam going on sale on April 20, Sonos has time to try to rectify these issues if they weren\u2019t isolated to our model. For what it's worth, a Sonos spokesperson told TechRadar that, \"the Roam\u2019s hardware and sound experience are final for what customers will experience when the product becomes available on April 20\".",
    "\"We are fine tuning Roam\u2019s software experience with a few improvements that will roll out before the product becomes available to customers.\"",
    "With every other aspect of the speaker working so well \u2013 the sound, the design, the new connectivity features \u2013 we\u2019re hoping that the issues we encountered were a one-off, or if not, that they\u2019re easily fixed. If so, the Sonos Roam could easily take the crown as the best portable speaker you can buy in 2021."
