  "article": [
    "Are 8K Blu-ray movies on the way? With the 8K resolution standard gaining steam and appearing in more televisions every year \u2013 Samsung, LG and Sony all supporting the technology to varying degrees \u2013 the true cinephiles out there may be wondering whether their 4K Blu-ray player could soon be upgraded with an 8K iteration.",
    "Disc players remain a beloved part of many home theater systems, offering high-quality viewing of TV shows, documentaries and films without buffering or internet connectivity issues found when streaming over Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, and the like. Blu-ray players do seem to be on their way out, though, with Samsung leaving the Blu-ray business shortly after industry titan Oppo did the same.",
    "But could 8K Blu-rays revive the hardware, or are the AI processing solutions currently used on 8K TVs going to replace the need for disc-based viewing for good?",
    "There are a lot of factors to consider here, including the increased size of 8K video content, mastering processes for filmmakers, and the business proposition of putting 8K on disc for home use \u2013 all meaning that 8K Blu-rays are looking possible, but still somewhat unlikely in the current climate. Here\u2019s why.",
    "8K packs in four times as many pixels as 4K resolution does, with 33 million pixels to the latter\u2019s eight million. There\u2019s a lot more potential detail there, and while there isn\u2019t too much \u2018native\u2019 8K content about \u2013 that is, video that\u2019s filmed with an 8K camera \u2013 modern upscaling techniques are making even low-quality sources look crisp and detailed with the right screens and processors.",
    "It\u2019s still an awkward situation for anyone with an 8K TV, given the only place really offering 8K streams is YouTube, and not for very much content at all. But the general paucity of 8K screens \u2013 compared to their 4K TV counterparts, that is \u2013 means that production companies aren\u2019t rushing to offer content mastered for 8K displays.",
    "One could argue that the increased detail of 8K makes an even stronger case for having an offline media player and disc sources, given the massive uptick in internet download speeds and data transfer needed to stream 8K resolution video second by second \u2013 around 50mb/s for stable quality.",
    "That\u2019s not to mention the amount of time needed to do a dedicated download of an 8K movie \u2013 similarly to the long wait times for downloading massive PC games like Warzone or Red Dead Redemption 2. As 8K content becomes more widespread, this problem will only increase.",
    "There\u2019s definitely a use case for 8K Blu-ray discs, then \u2013 but what are the obstacles to this happening?",
    "We spoke to Keith Doughty at QuVIS, a technology company specializing in large-scale data transfer and compression, and which designed the first 2K, 4K, and 3D digital cinema recorders \u2013 having collaborated with the likes of Pixar and Sony in the onward march of cinematic technologies over the years.",
    "QuVIS\u2019s own video compression technology is able to discard non-visible wavelengths from 8K video content before compression, bringing down file sizes and meaning that even large 8K films can be fit onto Blu-ray discs. Doughty tells us that \u201cThere's a whole lot in the blue wavelength range that is outside of human acuity. So we don't process that, and remove all the noise, and only process what remains, which is visible to us. And that's why we can compress this data down to such low levels.\u201d",
    "Because of this, Doughty is adamant that 8K Blu-rays are possible, and that the technology is already here \u2013 even if the industry doesn\u2019t end up pursuing it.",
    "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to determine is if distribution of 8K Blu-rays is worthwhile pursuing,\u201d says Doughty. \u201cAnd it's a huge challenge. Could you put [an 8K movie] on a Blu-ray disc and send it out? Maybe \u2013 but I don\u2019t know that this is going to be the savior of Blu-ray. For us, we\u2019re just saying that we can do it.\u201d",
    "We\u2019re told that QuVIS\u2019s proprietary software could run on a dedicated player supporting 8K \u2013 such as the new PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles, which have yet to make much use of their 8K capability \u2013 as well as Windows, Mac, and Linux, for those with 8K monitors. There aren\u2019t any firm plans in place as such, but the technology is there if it becomes viable from a market standpoint.",
    "And how much could an 8K Blu-ray disc cost? \u201cIt's going to be up to the rights holder as to what they decide that it's worth,\u201d says Doughty. \u201cI\u2019d spend 50 bucks on it. Would I spend more? Maybe.\u201d",
    "Considering the usual $30 / \u00a330 price point of a 4K Blu-ray \u2013 already pretty expensive compared to HD DVDs or digital rentals \u2013 that\u2019s almost twice as much money being asked of consumers.",
    "Our guide to the best 4K Blu-ray players, too, shows a mix of price points from $350 / \u00a3350 to $850 / \u00a3850 \u2013 and any dedicated 8K hardware to plug into an 8K TV is certainly going to cost more than current 4K models. For a niche market (cinephiles) within another niche market (8K TV owners), the audience may simply not be there.",
    "Writing for Forbes, TV pundit John Archer says as much: \u201cOne 8K source that likely won\u2019t happen, though, is 8K Blu-ray. The required data capacities of 8K discs would have to be huge, representing a substantial technical challenge. Also, even if 8K discs were possible, I\u2019m not convinced (sadly, given that I personally remain a fan of physical media) that studios will see sufficient return on any 8K disc investment as more and more people turn to streaming for their movie needs.\u201d",
    "It's worth noting that 8K movies are already being filmed with 8K cameras \u2013 they\u2019re just rarely being \u2018mastered\u2019 for 8K screens.",
    "Filmmakers will tend to capture high-resolution footage, and then master at a lower resolution to match the screens it\u2019ll likely be viewed on \u2013 giving themselves plenty of visual data to work with in recording, and leeway to crop and frame shots effectively, while minimizing the amount of data needed for the mastering process.",
    "Post production specialist Dan Durran cites director David Fincher, saying that \"Fincher reframes every shot. So Mindhunter, House of Cards, he reframes the shot as he wants your eyes going to what he wants you to see. He's able to use the whole 8K frame, cropping whatever he needs, to give a 4K image. He only has that flexibility when working with such high resolution\" (via Home Cinema Choice).",
    "Our Camera Editor Mark Wilson seconds this, saying that, even with 12K cameras, \u201cthe majority of producers are downsizing that to 6K, and really mastering at 6K or 4K, primarily because of the amount of data that they're required to move with 8K.\"",
    "We\u2019re also told by QuVIS that \u201ca limited number of media titles exist at quality levels needed to fully exploit and showcase 8K products,\u201d with an estimate of between 100 and 1000 such titles that are largely \u201cmade for IMAX\u201d documentaries.",
    "There isn\u2019t much 8K film out there yet, then, but the tools exist for it to increase, especially if the right distribution channels are created.",
    "As ever, 8K may simply be too ahead of the curve. QuVIS admits that the \u201c4K media market\u201d is still \u201cunder-addressed,\u201d meaning that a huge push towards 8K Blu-ray players and disc is unlikely to happen in the near future.",
    "By the time there is a solid use case for such dedicated hardware, average streaming speeds and compression technologies may have improved even further, rendering 8K discs somewhat redundant. In a world of capable 8K upscaling, too, we may not even need 8K mastering, if a 4K mastered movie can be transformed into believable 8K quality.",
    "All this means that 8K Blu-ray players are unlikely \u2013 but at least now you know why."
