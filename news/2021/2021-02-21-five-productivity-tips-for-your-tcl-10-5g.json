    "If you just got your hands on the TCL 10 5G, you\u2019ve got a lot of potential in your hands. Even though this phone costs just $399, it\u2019s packing powerful internals and can support a broad range of 5G signals for some impressive networking. If you\u2019re looking to take full advantage of all this phone can do for productivity, we\u2019ve got some tips to help you get started making the most of the TCL 10 5G.",
    "Get a handle on your 5G signal",
    "Here in the US, the TCL 10 5G isn\u2019t supporting just any old 5G. While the device can connect to Sub6 5G networks for a more stable connection and stronger signal in most places, it\u2019s also capable of latching onto Verizon\u2019s ultra-fast mmWave (Ultra-Wideband) connection.",
    "You won\u2019t find this mmWave signal just anywhere, but when you do, you can see your mobile data speeds cruise past 1Gbps. So, it\u2019s worth making note of locations where you\u2019re able to pick up this extra speedy connection (just look for the 5G UW symbol in your status bar). Then, when you need to download or upload large files or bunches of files (perhaps backing up all the 4K video you captured on the phone), you can save time with the transfer by doing it when you\u2019re in an area with mmWave coverage.",
    "5G Hotspot is your friend",
    "Your TCL 10 5G\u2019s new 5G connection doesn\u2019t have to be just for your phone, either. The bandwidth you can get from a 5G is more than you\u2019ll likely need for typical phone applications, but you can get extra productive by sharing that connection with more devices. Turning on your phone\u2019s wireless hotspot will let you turn your laptop into an even more capable, portable workstation. Just make sure you don\u2019t burn through your hotspot data allotment if you have one, because 5G will let you use that data extra quickly.",
    "Take advantage of that microSD slot",
    "The TCL 10 5G comes with a healthy dose of storage at 128GB, but you can ensure you\u2019re getting the most from it by using the phone\u2019s available microSD card slot. The built-in storage will provide faster performance, making it a better fit for your apps and bandwidth-intensive activities like recording 4K video. For things like files, downloaded videos, and photos, you can opt for microSD storage. This will let you keep room on the built-in drive for the applications that actually depend on its speed.",
    "Reading mode is your friend",
    "The TCL 10 5G has a big, bright screen with exciting features for watching content thanks to TCL\u2019s know-how in TV technology, but it also has readers covered. The phone supports a special reading mode. If you\u2019re reading long articles or digging into ebooks on the phone, Reading Mode will set the display to render monochromatically for a more book-like experience. You can also set the phone to automatically activate Reading Mode for certain apps to save you the effort.",
    "Know when to tag in a bigger screen",
    "The TCL 10 5G may have a substantial screen, but if you need a larger picture to make out extra detail or share what you\u2019re looking at with others, you might need an even bigger display. Fortunately, this phone is ready for that with its screencast feature. You can mirror your phone\u2019s display onto a TV or projector that supports Wi-Fi Display. So, if you need to make a presentation or collaborate on something, your TCL 10 5G can handle it without you needing to fuss around with cables and computers.",
    "With all these tips in mind, you're ready to get the most out of your new 5G smartphone, whether you're in the office, on the go, or relaxing at home."
