  "article": [
    "Update: Disney Plus is coming back as an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate perk. After the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account initially teased something in an unsubtle fashion, it's now been confirmed that any Xbox Game Pass Ultimate users who aren't currently subscribed to Disney Plus can grab a free 30-day trial of the service.",
    "Original Story: It looks like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers might receive a new perk that involves Disney Plus.",
    "The Xbox Game Pass Twitter account teased that a new Xbox Game Pass Ultimate perk is on the way, but instead of dropping a big announcement video, it decided to go with something more \u201cLowkey\u201d.",
    "It doesn\u2019t take a detective to figure out that the account is cheekily referring to the Loki TV series, which is coming to Disney Plus on June 9. There\u2019s a strong chance that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will receive some sort of Disney Plus freebie or exclusive offer, but what it could be remains to be seen.",
    "This wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Microsoft has offered Disney Plus as a perk to subscribers. A one-month free trial has been previously offered for new Disney Plus subscribers, but we\u2019re hoping to see something more substantial this time around.",
    "With news that Sony is trialling its PlayStation Plus Video Pass, which adds a library of TV shows and movies for subscribers to watch for free, it would make sense for Microsoft to hit back with a tempting offer of its own.",
    "While we\u2019d be surprised if it happened, it would be a big win for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate if Disney Plus was included as part of the service, even if it\u2019s for a limited time. Disney Plus has continued to rise in popularity due to its Star Wars and Marvel exclusive shows like The Mandalorian and WandaVision, and it would make Xbox Game Pass Ultimate an even more tempting proposition for new users.",
    "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft\u2019s premium tier subscription service and gives users access to Xbox Game Pass on console and PC. It also includes EA Play, Xbox Cloud Streaming and access to Xbox Live Gold.",
    "With E3 2021 only days away (the show begins on June 12), we\u2019re expecting to hear more Xbox Game Pass announcements soon."
