    "Apple\u2019s Spring Loaded event is almost upon us, and as it draws near more leaks are popping up to hint at what we could see announced. Alongside a new iPad Pro and iMac for 2021, Apple might unveil a premium podcast service.",
    "According to Peter Kafka from Recode Media, the long-rumored \u2018Apple Podcasts Plus\u2019 could join the likes of Apple Music and Apple TV Plus as the latest paid subscription service from the tech giant. There\u2019s no telling what could be included but we\u2019d expect to see exclusive and advert-free versions of shows from various creators in an attempt to better rival Spotify.",
    "Hopefully, none of our favorite podcasts choose to gate themselves off behind the Apple paywall, though we won\u2019t know anything for certain until it\u2019s announced \u2013 be that tomorrow or at a later event. If you want to find out what is announced at Apple Spring Loaded we\u2019ll be live blogging all the biggest news from the event as it happens \u2013 here\u2019s how you can watch along yourself.",
    "It\u2019s hard to say for certain, but if Apple is launching a premium podcast service we expect it will be the company\u2019s latest move to compete with the likes of Spotify. If Apple can secure exclusive content from some big podcasting names they might be able to claw back a few victories after Spotify snagged huge exclusive deals with the likes of Joe Rogan.",
    "And while we don\u2019t yet know what Apple will offer its collaborators, it could be a win-win for podcast creators. Not only might they be given a large cash incentive to stream exclusively through Apple Podcasts, but they could also be given a production budget boost for a new exclusive show for the premium service.",
    "All of this is only speculation \u2013 and there's a decent chance people won't want to pay for yet another premium subscription service \u2013 but an Apple Podcasts Plus service has the potential to revolutionize the podcasting space. If Apple comes out swinging at Spring Loaded, it might pull ahead in the podcasting race."
