    "One of the best PS5 features can now be experienced on PC for the very first time if you own Sony\u2019s clever DualSense controller and a copy of Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition.",
    "A recent patch for the game enabled support for the DualSense controller\u2019s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers if you\u2019re playing the game in wired mode, which creates resistance when firing weapons and helps add an extra layer of immersion for players to enjoy.",
    "Twitter user mrdomino_ shared a video of the DualSense controller in action, which shows how the adaptive triggers react when firing a gun in the game.",
    "The DualSense adaptive triggers are arguably one of the most appealing aspects of the PS5, with games like Astro\u2019s Playroom showing to great effect how compelling the PS5 DualSense can be when fully utilized. The controller\u2019s haptic feedback is also a fantastic addition to Sony\u2019s new pad, and convincingly mimics the sensation of rainfall in Returnal.",
    "Support for the PS5 DualSense controller was added to Steam in November 2020 but has been fairly limited until now. While it remains to be seen how many PC developers will take the time to add native support for the PS5 controller, we hope that more games will add adaptive trigger and haptic feedback functionality as it\u2019s still just as satisfying to experience, even six months after the PS5\u2019s release.",
    "More PlayStation games have made their way to PC in recent months, with Days Gone the latest Sony exclusive to get a fully-fledged port.",
    "However, while we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more PS4 games make the transition, it remains to be seen whether PS5 games like Demon\u2019s Souls or Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will get the same treatment."
