    "For some of us, Prime Day Deals are something of a necessary evil. We need to buy things and money's pretty much always tight, so we really don't have the option of passing up a good deal when we see one, especially when it comes to the best gaming laptops out there which start out expensive and just starts to soar as the specs go up.",
    "So when you come across a hell of a good deal like this Asus Tuf Dash F15 with RTX 3060 for just $1,499, you really do kind of have to jump on it while you can. And instead of trawling Amazon's endless array of deals today, you can grab this awesome deal over at Newegg instead and save yourself $500.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "This Asus Tuf Dash F15 gaming laptop comes with an RTX 3060 6GB GPU as well as an Intel Core i7-11370H processor, 40GB RAM, and a full HD (1920 x 1080p) display with 144Hz refresh rate to help your games look sharp and fluid.",
    "It doesn't come with a webcam, though, so if you're looking for a laptop that could be used for both work and play, this would strictly be a gaming machine unless you plugged in separate webcam. Honestly, for the price, that's not really a biggie \u2013 you're saving $500 off the retail price, you can pick up one of the best webcams out there and still come out ahead.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Asus Tuf Dash F15 gaming laptop from around the web right here, with offers available in your region.",
    "TechRadar is rounding up all the top deals over the Prime Day sales period, and we\u2019ve put all the best Prime Day deals in an easy-to-navigate article to help you find the bargains you\u2019re looking for."
