    "Microsoft\u2019s launch of Windows 11 has got off to a rocky start, as the company has had to remove its PC Health Check app, which instead of telling people if their PCs can run the upcoming software, has been giving confusing and incorrect information.",
    "It\u2019s led to people with PCs and laptops that should be more than capable of running Windows 11 instead being told that their machines are not compatible. Even worse, the app was not giving enough details about why the PCs were deemed incompatible with Windows 11.",
    "This has dampened many people\u2019s excitement about Windows 11, and now Microsoft has \u2018temporarily\u2019 removed the app, and will release it again later this year.",
    "In a blog post announcing the decision, Microsoft explains that \u201cwe acknowledge that it was not fully prepared to share the level of detail or accuracy you expected from us on why a Windows 10 PC doesn\u2019t meet upgrade requirements.\u201d",
    "It also promises that the PC Health Check app will be updated to \u201cprovide more clarity, and committing to more technical detail on the principles behind our decisions.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s not a great start, to be honest, as with a major operating system launch like Windows 11, you\u2019d want Microsoft\u2019s operation to be as slick as possible, especially when its current operating system, Windows 10, still suffers from bugs and problems. If it can\u2019t get a simple app right, it does not bode well for an entire OS.",
    "At least Microsoft is listening to feedback, however, and this will hopefully be a minor blip which won\u2019t affect the hype surrounding Windows 11.",
    "Until Microsoft puts the PC Health Check app back online, there is a third party app that can help you check if your PC can upgrade to Windows 11.",
