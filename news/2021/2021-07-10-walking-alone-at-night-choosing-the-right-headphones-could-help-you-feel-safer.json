    "If I\u2019m walking anywhere alone at night there\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting headphones in. I don\u2019t want to make myself appear in any way more vulnerable than I may already feel,\u201d says Ellie, 28.",
    "As a tall man who\u2019s never had to think about the safety implications of choosing headphones, I\u2019m not the prime candidate to be writing a piece on women walking home alone at night.",
    "Initially, I thought I may have a sliver of insight into the sense of powerlessness women experience that might make me suited to explore this issue. I'm a gay man and have been heckled a fair bit when holding a partner\u2019s hand in public \u2013 especially in the early 2000s \u2013 so I seldom do it, even to this day. But it\u2019s not the same.",
    "That is why for the most part in this piece, you'll be hearing accounts directly from women, compared to the experiences of men \u2013 although it goes without saying that people of any age, gender and sexual orientation can find themselves in dangerous situations when out alone after dark",
    "As part of my research, I asked 15 men and 15 women about their headphone use, specifically at night in London. After just a couple of conversations, it became clear: an infrequent and fleeting thought for me \u2013 \u2018Will I be safe walking home tonight?\u2019 \u2013 is an overriding daily consideration for women. This impacts what they wear, how they get from A to B, and how they listen to music.",
    "None of this is news, but there is a link between a category of headphones with an open-fit design and safety. That\u2019s where I can at least feed in. Last month, as Huawei launched the FreeBuds 4, its latest premium open-fit earbuds, I was left thinking \u2013 open-fit buds are hardly being launched these days. It\u2019s been more than two years since Apple updated its open-fit AirPods, and it\u2019s little wonder from an audio quality point of view.",
    "Open-fit earbuds mean no sound-seal in your ear and less effective noise isolation than rivals with silicone or memory foam eartips; in other words, you can hear what\u2019s going on around you.",
    "So, what\u2019s the point? Aren\u2019t headphones about immersion? Even if you do want to be aware of your surroundings, many closed-fit headphones include something called awareness or transparency mode. This allows the headphones to pick up the sounds of your environment using inbuilt microphones, mixing them back in with your music.",
    "For me, awareness mode is useful, but still feels like a clumsy workaround that ruins your music. The only solution that balances decent sound and audible environmental sound are open-fit buds like the AirPods and FreeBuds 3 and 4.",
    "Over the last year I\u2019ve been pretty much exclusively using the FreeBuds 3. This is in spite of also having a pair of the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM4, which are worlds apart when it comes to sound quality, and a couple of sets of in-ear buds from OPPO and Samsung, which feature better sound isolation. For me, it\u2019s mainly down to voice call quality, road safety, and politeness \u2013 being able to communicate with cashiers, for example.",
    "For most of the men I spoke to, sound quality was paramount. Emile, 40, said, \u201cI'm not concerned about headphones and my safety in terms of being mugged or attacked while out and about. I wear good quality in-ear buds, which are more convenient than over-ear headphones, and I usually have noise-cancelling turned on wherever I am.\u201d",
    "Another shared minor safety concerns: \u201cI alternate between over-the-ear headphones and wireless in-ears. I very rarely have safety as my main concern \u2013 big headphones act as both my entertainment and a way to show people I don't want to be talked to. I only pause the music or turn the volume all the way down if I see a situation I'm not comfortable with,\u201d explained Sohaib, 36.",
    "This notion of headphones as a means of keeping passers-by at bay was a common theme in both men and women. Matt, 36, said that he \u201cmight put his AirPods into awareness mode if I felt threatened in any way\u201d.",
    "\u201cI tend to keep them in so people won\u2019t stop and talk to me. Safety isn\u2019t a primary consideration when it comes to wearing headphones. More so convenience, which is why I prefer wireless over wired alternatives\u201d, he continued.",
    "As familiar as these responses were to me, they were at odds with virtually all of the women who were asked the same questions. Whether it involved a conscious sacrifice in quality in favor of a better sense of their surroundings, opting to only use one earbud to keep an ear free, or categorically not wearing headphones outdoors, 14 out of the 15 women who shared their attitudes towards headphones and safety had very different perspectives to all the male respondents.",
    "Heather, 37, said: \u201cI walk with either no headphones or only one earbud in. I'll also try to hide the earbud with my hair so people can't see I'm listening to anything. Cables are the worst because they are pretty visible, and I wouldn't even think about noise-cancelling over-ear alternatives when walking alone.\u201d",
    "Only using one earbud was one of the more popular ways of staying aware, even amongst a respondent who prioritizes the quality of her listening experience: \u201cI am a musician, so I hate listening to music with only one headphone in,\u201d says Mara, 25.",
    "\u201cBut, if I'm walking at night, I have to. The noise-cancelling AirPods Pro are so helpful to block out the noisy underground when I travel, but I\u2019d have to be super aware while using them \u2013 always looking around and being on high alert in case someone is following me.\u201d",
    "This willingness to compromise on audio quality in favor of safety was another recurring theme, even amongst an avid podcast listener and production professional. \u201cI had a wonderful pair of noise-cancelling headphones that I loved and used until they finally stopped working, exhausted, and despite my love for them, I decided against a new pair,\u201d says Charlotte, 35.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve grown more mindful of the need to be aware of my surroundings, not only late at night, but on public transport, walking through quiet residential streets, and when running in parks,\u201d she explains.",
    "\u201cI now use in-ear wireless headphones, and as soon as I\u2019m out onto the street I use one earbud only when listening to music. It\u2019s largely due to fear of being assaulted, but on the milder end of the scale, it\u2019s about being startled when approached. I really miss the immersive quality that noise-cancelling headphones provide but it\u2019s just not worth the risk.\u201d",
    "The difference between the responses from men and women cannot be overstated. While the first thing I do when walking home from the station is plug in my earbuds, Rachel, who lives a few hundred yards from my apartment told me: \u201cI don't listen to music on the way home from a night out at all. I don't have wireless earbuds or wear a backpack so there would be a cable going down into a pocket and I\u2019m not okay with that signpost that I\u2019m listening to music.\u201d",
    "\u201cReally, it\u2019s for awareness as I wouldn't be able to hear footsteps behind me with headphones on\u201d, she explained. \u201cI need to have my wits about me.\u201d",
    "Safety isn\u2019t just a primary concern when looking at late-night walks. As touched on in an earlier response, the need to be safe when exercising is also a factor. Laetitia, 39, said it was her main safety concern: \u201cWhen I run through a woodland area even for 30 seconds, especially at dawn, fear drives me to turn the music to silent, which I tell myself is total paranoia.\u201d",
    "\u201cHowever, I know it\u2019s not paranoid at all, which is the sad fact of it,\u201d she adds.",
    "For many, the idea of not using headphones, or changing how you use them to stay safe won\u2019t come as any surprise. In 2018, after a string of sex attacks near the Cricklewood area of London, a member of the Metropolitan Police gave advice to women which included: \"... don't use earphones or handheld devices\u201d when walking home at night.",
    "This message was shared once again in the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard, who was believed to be wearing Bluetooth headphones at the time she was abducted. These calls led to a debate on whether recommendations of this nature constitute victim-blaming, or whether they\u2019re a safety necessity.",
    "Subverting the general consensus of \u2018no headphones at night\u2019 amongst women, two standout responses actually referenced intentionally wearing headphones as a means of fending off unwanted attention from men. \u201cI actively do wear them so men know I can\u2019t hear their catcalls/advances, even if I\u2019m not playing music, so I\u2019m aware of my surroundings,\u201d says Chantelle, 28. \u201cSometimes if I feel unsafe I will pretend I\u2019m having a conversation with someone I\u2019m going to meet who is \u2018just around the corner.\u201d",
    "Nicole, 27, said: \u201cSometimes when someone says something to me or makes me feel uncomfortable, I use the fact that I\u2019m wearing headphones as a way to pretend I haven\u2019t heard what they\u2019ve said, and keep on walking, when in fact they\u2019re muted.\u201d",
    "The question for anyone concerned about safety when using headphones is, what options are there for someone looking for high-quality audio matched with environmental awareness? The obvious choice \u2013 you could opt for the Apple AirPods if you want an open-fit bud.",
    "The sound quality from Apple\u2019s open-fit buds is fine, however, if you want noise-cancelling with an open-fit design to drown out the din of a train or plane while still staying aware of other peripheral noise, Huawei is leading the charge with its FreeBuds 3 and FreeBuds 4.",
    "In fact, Huawei is the only earbud-maker that\u2019s delivering the kind of quality you\u2019d expect from today\u2019s best headphones matched with this style of bud. There are other lower-cost alternatives from OnePlus, for example, but the OnePlus Buds' quality is sorely lacking, especially when it comes to voice calls.",
    "Another boon for the Huawei FreeBuds is that they are also available in black, which makes them less conspicuous and easier to conceal with long hair or a hood, and you can use them one at a time, with each bud sporting a microphone for voice calls.",
    "I wish this article didn\u2019t exist, and, like the men I spoke to while researching it, I will probably keep using my headphones and earbuds in exactly the same way I have been for years, day or night. If, however, you can relate more to the women featured in this piece and are looking for a new pair of buds, hopefully, you feel more confident in picking up a pair that balance peripheral sound awareness, decent quality, discreet looks, and one-bud-at-a-time functionality for those times you do feel comfortable using them in public."
