  "article": [
    "If you\u2019re wondering when it might become easier to buy one of the latest Nvidia RTX 3000 or AMD RX 6000 graphics cards, the answer is \u2013 sadly \u2013 not any time soon.",
    "We\u2019ve recently heard from both AMD and Nvidia on this topic, with the news from the latter coming via a conference call with Nvidia\u2019s CFO Colette Kress by Seeking Alpha.",
    "Kress stressed that there had been strong demand for Ampere GPUs and supply remains tight, and then observed: \u201cWe expect the overall channel inventories, meaning the inventories that are with our AIC partners [graphics card makers] as well as in our e-tail and retail channels will likely remain lean throughout Q1.\u201d",
    "The bad news here is that doesn\u2019t mean Q1 as in January through to March, but Nvidia\u2019s fiscal Q1 which comes to a close at the end of April. In other words, stock is likely to remain constrained through to April, or possibly even May by the sound of things.",
    "Whatever the case, the last we heard from Nvidia was that stock levels would recover somewhat either in February or March, and it seems like that estimation \u2013 which was also from Kress back in November 2020 \u2013 has now been pushed back further.",
    "Kress added: \u201cOur overall capacity has not been able to keep up with that overall strong demand that we have seen. We\u2019ve seen in terms of constraints, constraints really from the overall global surge of compute and the overall capacity, capacity that may be necessary for assembly and test and/or sub trades as well. But again, we remain focused on this and working each day to improve our overall supply situation.\u201d",
    "As an aside, Kress also confirmed that as far as the adoption of RTX graphics cards goes (RTX 2000 and 3000 models), around 10% of Nvidia GPU owners have made the leap to an RTX card.",
    "Okay, so if Nvidia Ampere stock is going to remain lean for the foreseeable, what about AMD? The news from team red sounds a bit more positive, but sadly, prospects of an inventory recovery still seem rather wobbly.",
    "The Verge (which also spotted the above report) notes that the good news is that AMD is going to continue to sell its own RX 6800, 6800 XT and 6900 XT reference boards \u2013 rather than wind up production and leave it to third-party graphics card manufacturers to supply gamers with these high-end Big Navi GPUs (as would normally happen a while after launch).",
    "This is because third-party cards are having their asking prices seriously inflated by retailers \u2013 due to those stock problems, of course, and the big demand \u2013 so AMD is promising to keep its own boards pegged at their recommended retail pricing. Graphics card manufacturers are also being encouraged to stick to those prices, too.",
    "So yes, that\u2019s definitely a positive move on the fairness front, although as The Verge notes, exactly how many GPUs AMD will be able to supply is another question \u2013 the firm said that it would make these reference cards available \u201cto as many gamers as possible,\u201d which sounds rather noncommittal.",
    "Furthermore, in an interview with Anandtech, AMD\u2019s chief executive Lisa Su was questioned about stock shortages around not just Big Navi GPUs, but also Ryzen 5000 CPUs.",
    "Su noted: \u201cThis is the result of a demand focused environment, rather than manufacturing issues. There is tightness in the supply chain due to demand, and that invariably puts pressure on our consumer, PC, and gaming product lines. As it relates to our semiconductor production, we\u2019re putting in additional capacity to meet this unexpected demand. It will take time to catch up, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d",
    "She added: \u201cWe are shipping lots of parts, and volumes in all segments are increasing, and that will happen through 2021. There will be tightness in the first half of the year, but alongside consumers we also ship to OEM partners. There is some real-time prioritization between end-user and OEM, but we understand that consumers want more and it\u2019s very high on our priority list to meet this high demand.\u201d",
    "Still, the noises about \u2018tightness\u2019 of supply in the first half of the year are bound to make folks nervous about exactly when we might see a meaningful uptick in the stock of Big Navi GPUs (or indeed top-end Ryzen 5000 silicon).",
    "Meantime, if you\u2019re on the hunt for an Nvidia graphics card, we\u2019ve got some handy where to buy guides for the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, articles that are worth keeping an eye on as we regularly update them to flag up when stock arrives. Similarly, on the AMD front, keep tabs on our guides for buying the RX 6800, RX 6800 XT, and RX 6900 XT."
