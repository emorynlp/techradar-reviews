    "Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick spoke on the concept of a $70 / \u00a370 / AU$92 price tag for video games at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, saying that customers are \u201cready\u201d for it.",
    "In context, Zelnick talked about the $70 price applied to NBA 2K21, saying: \u201cour view was that we're offering an array of extraordinary experiences, lots of replayability, and the last time there was a frontline price increase in the US was 2005, 2006, so we think consumers were ready for it.\u201d",
    "Whether or not Take-Two actually plans to roll out the $10 price hike on its other games remains to be seen, with Zelnick adding that RRPs were decided on \u201ca title-by-title basis.\u201d As such, it\u2019s possible that the $70 price tag could only come into effect for the biggest releases in the publisher\u2019s repertoire.",
    "Zelnick insisted during the same speech that Take-Two plans to \u201cdeliver more value than what we charge,\u201d but will they really? NBA 2K21 proved to be a controversial release, with heaps of microtransactions and intrusive in-game ads - two features that are largely reserved for free-to-play mobile apps that have nonetheless seeped into the triple-A gaming space.",
    "Take-Two is likely operating from a position of much confidence, as NBA 2K21 went on to sell over eight million copies. Given its success, it\u2019s a safe bet that any future Rockstar Games (a Take-Two subsidiary) developed projects will sit pretty at $70 at launch. We\u2019re looking at you, Grand Theft Auto 6.",
    "Zelnick\u2019s comments could be a signal for a growing trend in the gaming industry. If a big-budget triple-A release sells well at $70, then we could see publishers other than Take-Two looking to capitalize on making the $10 increase more of a standard rather than the exception.",
    "It\u2019s a controversial change, for sure, and we\u2019re not entirely sure consumers are \u201cready\u201d to pay $70 for their games so much as they might instead feel like they don\u2019t have a choice in the matter.",
    "On the other hand, the price hike might prove to be a boon for subscription services like Xbox Game Pass, where NBA 2K21 is available among a smorgasbord of other games, as an alternative for those who are happy to wait until a game becomes part of Microsoft's catalog of titles.",
    "Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s enough of a backlash to make Take-Two reconsider, but since when has that ever stopped it - or any big-name publisher for that matter - from squeezing as much money from its consumers as is humanly possible?"
