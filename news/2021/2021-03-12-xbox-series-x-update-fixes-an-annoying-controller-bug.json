    "The latest update for Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles is out now, and with it comes a swathe of handy features, but absent from the release notes was a fix for a controller disconnection bug that\u2019s plagued Xbox Series X consoles since launch.",
    "Team Xbox\u2019s Jason Ronald highlighted the fix in a tweet, stating that \u201cmany\u201d of the controller disconnect issues reported by users have now been addressed, which might be a relief for players who took to the enormous Microsoft support thread to share their controller issues.",
    "Microsoft had been aware of the disconnecting controller issues as far back as January, and in a statement to The Verge, assured that a fix was due \u201cin a future update.\u201d Better late than never, we suppose?",
    "It\u2019s unclear if the Xbox Series X controller disconnect fixes apply to everyone having issues on the console, but if you\u2019re among the unlucky ones who had their new console experience tampered by the bug, it might be worth checking to see if the update has fixed things for you.",
    "The latest Xbox update also introduced Auto HDR and FPS Boost toggles for backwards compatible games, giving players the option to improve image quality or performance for applicable games, adding yet more reasons to return to your old library.",
    "It\u2019s good to hear that Microsoft finally has something of a solution for the Xbox Series X disconnecting controller issues. With Jason Ronald saying that only \u201cmany\u201d controller issues were fixed, we wonder if more fixes will be rolling out in future updates for further tweaks and optimizations."
