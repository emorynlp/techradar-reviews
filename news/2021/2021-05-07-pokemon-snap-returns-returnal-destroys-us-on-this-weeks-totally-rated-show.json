  "article": [
    "In this week\u2019s episode of Totally Rated, New Pok\u00e9mon Snap harkens to an N64 classic, Android Central and T3 test the ultimate gaming desk and on PS5, Returnal\u2019s difficulty casts us into the depths of space.",
    "You might be able to catch \u2018em all, but can you snap \u2018em all, too? That\u2019s the question posited by New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, a new Nintendo Switch release and the long-awaited sequel to the N64 classic.",
    "With so many fans of the Pok\u00e9mon universe out there, the hype for this re-release is pretty high, as Sara Gitkos from iMore explains; \u201cIf you are a fan of relaxing games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Pok\u00e9mon, this low-key photography sim should be right up your alley.\u201d",
    "If you\u2019re a longtime Pok\u00e9mon fan, then, New Pok\u00e9mon Snap should offer you plenty to enjoy. Others, meanwhile, might find this safari a little dated, as TechRadar\u2019s Adam Vjestica explains; \u201cNew Pok\u00e9mon Snap feels antiquated by today\u2019s standards.",
    "\u201cYour enjoyment of the game will ultimately come down to whether you enjoy taking hundreds of pictures of virtual creatures, as you slowly chug along predetermined paths multiple times in the hopes of spotting something new.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019ll probably pass muster with Pok\u00e9mon-loving kids, who will delight in seeing Pikachu scamper across the screen for perhaps the very first time.",
    "\u201cBut for anyone aged 10 or above, this eclectic safari park isn\u2019t worth the price of admission.\u201d",
    "Whether you prefer gaming or office chairs, what\u2019s certain is that you still need a quality desk for your PC setup. In this case, Secretlab\u2019s Magnus desk didn\u2019t disappoint.",
    "T3 and Windows Central got their hands on SecretLab\u2019s new Magnus desk and Robert Jones of T3, was a fan: \u201cSecretLab has already covered itself in glory with its elite-tier gaming chairs, and the Magnus sees the firm triumphantly expand its offering in a genuinely pioneering and exciting way.",
    "\u201cThis gaming desk exudes premium in every detail, and its all-metal construction imbues it with a quality no other rival can match.",
    "\u201cThrow in simply superb cable management features, a smart selection of magnetised accessories, and a thoroughly thought through setup procedure, and the end result is the ultimate gaming table for PC and console gamers.\u201d",
    "Daniel Thorpe-Lancaster of Windows Central was quick to join praising the desk\u2019s construction, but believes that you should take a raincheck if you\u2019re after something bigger: \u201cFor anyone who is already a fan of Secretlab's gaming seats, you're likely to love the Magnus desk.",
    "\u201cEven if you haven't tried one of the company's chairs before, the Magnus desk makes a great, low-profile space to get work done and dive into game night.",
    "\u201cIf you want something other than black, need a much larger desk, or prefer the variety of standing desks out there, then you may be better served elsewhere.\u201d",
    "Back over to gaming, this time on the PS5, Housemarque\u2019s sci-fi roguelike shooter Returnal has been impressing and frustrating us in equal measure.",
    "Vic Hood of TechRadar gave the release a thumbs up: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to deny that Housemarque has done something different with Returnal, blending a roguelike with a blockbuster third-person shooter \u2013 and creating an arcade bullet hell that\u2019s different to anything we\u2019ve seen from Sony before.",
    "\u201cReturnal is a PS5 exclusive that emphatically meets the standards of what we\u2019ve been crying out for from the new console, and it\u2019s a fantastic showcase for what this new hardware is actually capable of.\u201d",
    "While Returnal\u2019s high level of difficulty will be a deterrent for some, Ben Tyrer of GamesRadar explains that it ultimately doesn\u2019t take anything away from the core experience: \u201cReturnal can be messy, tough, and perhaps a little too uncompromising for a $70 game.",
    "\u201cAnd yet, despite the moments of pad-clenching exasperation, it remains a moreish experience even after you\u2019ve plumbed its depths.\u201d",
    "Totally Rated features reviews and opinions of what's hot and what's not in the tech and gaming world.",
    "Bringing together leading titles from across the industry, we hear first hand from those who have reviewed - and rated - the very latest games and products on the market.",
    "New episodes of Totally Rated will roll out every Thursday."
