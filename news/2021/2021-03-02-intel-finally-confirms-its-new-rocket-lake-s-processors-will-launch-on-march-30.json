  "article": [
    "Intel has now officially confirmed that its Rocket Lake-S processors will go on sale on March 30, 2021, following news that a German retailer had been selling the processors early.",
    "As we previously reported, Mindfactory.de appeared to break the street date of Intel\u2019s 11th generation processors, allowing people to get hold of them before Intel had even announced most of them.",
    "This led to people posting benchmark results of the upcoming processors as well, and it now seems like that has prompted Intel to confirm to Andreas Schilling, editor of the hardwareluxx.de website, that its lineup will launch on March 30.",
    "Not only have Mindfactory.de\u2019s early sales forced Intel to reveal more about its upcoming processors, Wccftech also recently published what appears to be the entire launch lineup of processors.",
    "The specs, which cover 10 processors in the Core i7 and Core i9 range, are certainly impressive, so even if Intel\u2019s surprise has been spoiled, if these leaks are accurate, then we\u2019ve got some great processors to look forward to.",
    "And it\u2019s now official that we won\u2019t have long to get hold of them.",
