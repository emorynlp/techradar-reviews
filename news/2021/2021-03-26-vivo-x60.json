    "Months after its China launch, the Vivo X60 has seen a global unveiling, so we can be pretty certain the X60 and its Pro sibling will be on sale around the world pretty soon.",
    "There are two new phones: the Vivo X60 and Vivo X60 Pro, and the key difference between the two is the design - the former has a flat display, but the latter's screen curves at the edges.",
    "There are technically three Vivo X60 phones, as there's a Vivo X60 Pro Plus, but that's exclusive to India and China, so you won't be able to buy it.",
    "We've collected all the information on the Vivo X60 so you know how this smartphone compares to its rivals.",
    "After being launched in China in December 2020 and globally in March 2021, the Vivo X60 and X60 Pro are likely going on sale soon, but we don't know exactly when.",
    "We have the prices in India and China, and they're about the same. You can see conversions of the prices below, though they might not be exact for the final release.",
    "The Vivo X60 comes in three version: there's one with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for about $540, \u00a3400, AU$700, an 8GB/256GB model for roughly $580, \u00a3430, AU$760, and finally a 12GB / 256GB version for around $610, \u00a3450, AU$780.",
    "There's only one Vivo X60 Pro model, with memory the same as the priciest standard version, and it costs roughly $690, \u00a3510, AU$910.",
    "The Vivo X60 looks very similar to the Vivo X51, its predecessor, particularly on the back with a nearly-indentical rectangular camera bump dominated by the large main snapper. The Vivo X60 Pro is slightly different in this regard, with an extra rear lens extending the block.",
    "The main design difference is on the front, as the front-facing camera, which is a 'punch-hole' cut-out in the front screen, isn't on the top-left of the screen but the top center.",
    "Vivo states the X60 is the thinnest 5G phone ever, at least at time of release, with a body only 7.36mm thick. That is indeed pretty thin.",
    "The Vivo X60 comes in three colors: black, white and a two-tone blue, and the Vivo X60 Pro is available in all those shades save white.",
    "The screen here is 6.56 inches across, and it uses AMOLED technology like many top-end devices. The resolution is FHD+, and the display also has a 120Hz refresh rate.",
    "The main difference between the Vivo X60 and X60 Pro is this display, as on the Pro the edges curve to give a more premium feel.",
    "The Vivo X60 has three rear cameras: a 48MP f/1.48 main, 13MP ultra-wide and 13MP 'portrait' (2x zoom) snapper. The X60 Pro has the same with an additional 8MP periscope snapper with 5x optical zoom.",
    "The lenses for the phones were made in partnership with Zeiss, a photography company which also works with Nokia on its smartphone cameras.",
    "The main camera has a unique feature for smartphones - well, one that's unique to Vivo phones, at least - in that it's got an in-built gimbal for image stabilization. We saw this first in the Vivo X51 and the X60 uses a second-gen version of the feature, and it lets the sensor physically move to counteract shaking hands when you're taking a photo or video.",
    "There are plenty of videography modes here, as Vivo made sure to show off in the X60 launch. There's a 21:9 mode for filming in that cinematic aspect ratio as well as a 'Movie Texture Filter' which presumably replicates the look of anamorphic lenses used in shooting movies. There's also a subtitle mode and stereo audio recording.",
    "Both the Vivo X60 and X60 Pro use the Snapdragon 870 chipset, which is fairly premium but not the most top-end processor out there.",
    "The chipset enables 5G connectivity, so both phones use the next generation of mobile network.",
    "One of the biggest new announcements at the Vivo X60 launch was that of OriginOS, a brand-new operating system for these and future Vivo phones. Past handsets from the company have used FunTouchOS, but OriginOS is a brand new thing from the company.",
    "OriginOS seems to have a really customizable home-screen, as the demo showed normal apps being turned into widgets and spread across multiple blocks in the home page grid.",
    "The Vivo X60 has a 4,300mAh battery, but that goes down to 4,200mAh for the Pro model.",
    "When we get the phones in for testing, we'll see how long these power packs last, but given the capacity and screen size, we'd estimate roughly a day each.",
    "There's 33W wired charging for both models, and it doesn't seem that wireless charging is a thing here."
