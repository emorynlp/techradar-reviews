  "article": [
    "The upcoming Borderlands movie has officially finished filming, and we\u2019ve now got our first look at all of its main characters in costume \u2013 Claptrap and all.",
    "Lionsgate, the studio behind the video game adaptation, released a set image of Claptrap \u2013 the series\u2019 overenthusiastic robot assistant \u2013 holding a clapperboard reading \u201cthat\u2019s a wrap.\u201d",
    "The announcement was soon followed by a tweet from actor Jamie Lee-Curtis, who is playing Dr. Patricia Tannis in the movie, which revealed silhouettes of all five main characters set to appear in the hotly anticipated project.",
    "While we\u2019ve previously reported on Cate Blanchett\u2019s appearance as Lilith, this marks the first time we\u2019ve been given any sort of glimpse at what Kevin Hart\u2019s Roland, Ariana Greenblatt\u2019s Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu\u2019s Krieg and, of course, Curtis\u2019 Tannis might look like in the movie.",
    "Given the shadowy nature of the snaps, there\u2019s not a whole lot of concrete detail to be drawn from them, but it\u2019s abundantly clear that each character will remain \u2013 appearance-wise, at least \u2013 faithful to their video game counterparts.",
    "Thanks to the image shared by Lionsgate, though, we now know how Jack Black\u2019s Claptrap will appear in the Borderlands movie \u2013 and, well, he seems almost identical to his in-game character model. Check it out in the tweet below.",
    "In a recent interview with Collider, Kevin Hart hinted that the movie \"looks like the game\", and if Claptrap's appearance is anything to go by, we may be in for an ultra-faithful portrayal of the iconic cel-shaded world of Pandora.",
    "Given that filming has now wrapped after three months in Hungary, we\u2019re anticipating the post-production process on the Borderlands movie will get underway very soon \u2013 meaning a 2022 release date may be a possibility. There\u2019s been no official word from the studio yet, though.",
    "The project is being helmed by Hostel director Eli Roth, with Craig Mazin, writer of HBO\u2019s Chernobyl, behind its script. Mazin is also currently working on The Last of Us TV show with Neil Druckmann, so he\u2019s no stranger to the challenges posed by adapting such revered source material.",
    "As with its release date, we\u2019re still not 100% sure on which games (if any) the Borderlands movie will draw from, though judging by the characters confirmed to appear, we\u2019re anticipating some sort of re-telling of the first game in the series, published by 2K Games on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC back in 2009.",
    "That means we expect to see, in some form, the likes of Roland and Lilith battling the Atlas Corporation for possession of otherwordly (and probably shiny) treasures.",
    "We know other characters like Moxxi, Sir Hammerlock and Marcus will also be appearing, too \u2013 so there\u2019s every chance the Borderlands movie will capture the energy of the game\u2019s beloved looter-shooter experience.",
