    "One of Netflix\u2019s most popular original series, Lupin, has been renewed for a third season.",
    "The announcement came on Twitter alongside a trailer, with Netflix confirming \u201cPart Deux\u201d of the French crime drama will arrive on June 11, before returning again for \u201cPart Trois\u201d at a later date. Our guess is this will likely follow in 2022.",
    "Lupin's first season followed Omar Sy as Assane Diop, a man whose life is turned upside down after his father is accused of a crime he didn\u2019t commit by a wealthy family. In true revenge-thriller fashion, Assane \u2013 under the alias 'Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, Gentleman Burglar' \u2013 stages a heist to avenge his family.",
    "The series \u2013 whose titular character is inspired by Maurice Leblanc\u2019s early 1900s novels \u2013 drew huge audience figures for its debut, five-episode season, which premiered on the streamer back in January of this year. Lupin was watched by 70 million households in the first month of its release, becoming the most-viewed non-English series on Netflix.",
    "The upcoming episodes don\u2019t strictly represent a second season, in the traditional sense, but rather a direct continuation of the events of the first five episodes \u2013 hence Netflix marketing them as \u201cPart Deux\u201d.",
    "As with shows like The Walking Dead, then, Lupin\u2019s final episode (five) \u2013 which ended the \u201cDans L'Ombre D'Ars\u00e8ne\u201d (\u201cIn the Shadow of Ars\u00e8ne\u201d) story arc \u2013 acts as more of a mid-season finale than proper narrative conclusion.",
    "It\u2019s not hard to understand Lupin\u2019s evidently global appeal.",
    "The show, which was written by British showrunner George Kay, bears all the hallmarks of a Sherlock Holmes thriller while also sporting the slick Hollywood trappings of a heist movie \u2013 think Ocean\u2019s Eleven meets The Da Vinci Code.",
    "Given its initial release in January, too, Lupin coincided with national lockdowns across the world and capitalized on the viewing opportunity presented by couch-bound audiences in search of some good, old-fashioned escapism.",
    "Will Lupin\u2019s second (and third) parts maintain the same level of interest? There\u2019s certainly enough here to keep audiences engaged for a while longer, but with Netflix shows continuing to increase in numbers and quality, Lupin will have to stage a pretty daring heist to steal that same level of attention."
