    "Well, queens, it's been emotional - but tonight one of the UK huns is about to be crowned winner of RuPaul's Drag Race season 2. They've served many a look, lip synced for their lives, and completed Snatch Game. But who will be crowned the UK's Drag Race queen? You'll have to head to the mainstage and watch RuPaul's Drag Race UK season 2 finale to find out.",
    "Michelle Visage and Mama Ru returned to ol' Blighty, joined by fellow judges Alan Carr and Graham Norton to find the queen with the most extraordinary Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent. In 2019 that bold and brassy Liverpudlian The Vivienne dusted the runway, beating Baga Chipz and Divina De Campo to first place.",
    "Down to Lawrence Chaney, Bimini Bon Boulash, and Tayce, which lip-sync assassin will hear the words \u201cyou\u2019re a winner baby\u201d from Ru this year?",
    "So, racers\u2026start your engines! (don't worry, it\u2019s an \u2018essential journey\u2019) and we'll detail how to watch RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK season 2 finale online from anywhere now.",
    "2021 has started strong \u2013 well, at least for RuPaul fans. But if you happen to be out of the country for the final episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK season 2 and want to watch online, geo-blocks will prevent you from streaming this British spin on the award-winning franchise.",
    "The best VPN - otherwise known as a virtual private network - however, offers a simple solution. This piece of software alters your IP address to that of another country, so that you can gain access to your preferred IPTV service, and watch episodes live or on-demand just like you would at home.",
    "WOW Present Plus is the self-dubbed \"official streamer of all things drag\" and comes to us from World of Wonder, the production company behind RuPaul's Drag Race.",
    "As such, it has an impressive catalogue of RuPaul shows - including the latest season 13 episodes - available to stream all over the world including in markets like India, South Africa, the UAE and many other countries. A full list of what's available and where can be found here.",
    "It's a pretty niche offering but if drag shows are your thing, you'll find it also hosts the likes of UNHhhh, Untucked, and Transformations - all for the ultra-affordable price of just $3.99 a month. Best of all, there's a FREE 7-day trial on offer so you can sashay on over and check it out for yourself."
