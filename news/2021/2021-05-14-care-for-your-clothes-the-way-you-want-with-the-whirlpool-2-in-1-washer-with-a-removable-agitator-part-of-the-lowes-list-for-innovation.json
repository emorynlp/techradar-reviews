    "Having earned Lowe\u2019s List of Innovation 2021 badge, Whirlpool is changing the laundry game with an industry-first 2 in 1 washing machine with a removable agitator. This top-loading washing machine gives you the choice with every load between an agitator or impeller, allowing you to wash bulky items and get the best clean on clothes all in the same machine. Also equipped with many of Whirlpool\u2019s most popular features, you can truly have the best of both worlds for your laundry.",
    "While many consumers have a preference, and a rather strong one at that, for agitator washers or impeller washers, many don\u2019t understand how the two work and why both could be useful in getting the most out of their laundry.",
    "Put simply, an agitator works to break up tough stains as it twists and wrings out clothes during the cycle. An impeller, on the other hand, uses the clothes rubbing against each other to clean, uses considerably less water, and is gentler on clothes. Having an impeller also frees up more space in the washer for your big, bulky items, like comforters, pillows, and dog beds, while preventing blankets and sheets from getting tangled on the agitator.",
    "Virtually everyone doing laundry is going to have both items best suited for an agitator and items that would fare better with an impeller, which is why the market is saturated with both types of washers. But what if you could have both?",
    "Up until now, consumers have had to choose between an agitator or an impeller. However, this new 2 in 1 washer from Whirlpool means you don\u2019t have to choose. You can keep the agitator in for your kid\u2019s grass and dirt-stained baseball uniforms, and then easily remove the agitator, uncovering the impeller, which will wash your bedding without getting tangled or off balance. Your jeans can benefit from the agitator, while your delicates benefit from the gentle impeller wash.",
    "The Whirlpool\u00ae 2 in 1 washer also comes with some of the brand\u2019s most popular innovations, such as:",
    "The Whirlpool\u00ae Top Load Washer with 2 in 1 Removable Agitator can be purchased exclusively from Lowe\u2019s. It\u2019s available in Chrome Shadow or white and can hold 5.2 cu ft with the Agitator, and 5.3 cu ft with impeller.
