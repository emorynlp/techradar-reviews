    "The latest episode of The Grand Tour Presents has finally got a release date \u2013 and a full-length trailer, too.",
    "The trusty trio of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond will all return to Amazon Prime Video for more vehicular antics on 30 July. This time around, they\u2019ll be embarking on an adventure through the Scottish Highlands.",
    "Called Lochdown \u2013 get it? \u2013 the special was filmed in 2020 amid the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which limited the show\u2019s ability to shoot abroad. It will mark the third special in The Grand Tour\u2019s fourth season, following the release of A Massive Hunt in December 2020.",
    "From what we can tell, the hosts will be driving classic American cars from Edinburgh to the Hebrides, so expect a Route 66-style road trip. In the trailer, James May says it \u201cpromises to be the most beautiful drive [they\u2019ve] ever done.\u201d",
    "May also told BT earlier this year that the show\u2019s producers deemed it \"better to film in the UK and deliver regularly than promise the earth and not deliver anything,\u201d which explains the decision to limit this latest episode\u2019s adventure to within British borders.",
    "Still, a domestic setting doesn\u2019t mean a familiar one, especially given Amazon Prime\u2019s global audience. \"If you're watching The Grand Tour from Sri Lanka, Scotland is as exotic and beautiful as Sri Lanka is from Scotland, so there's always going to be a large part of the audience which finds anywhere in the world fascinating,\" May added.",
    "As for The Grand Tour\u2019s intended release schedule, the global pandemic put an engine-breaking spanner in the works.",
    "Original plans to film in Russia \u2013 for a special following A Massive Hunt \u2013 were put on hold last year, and still remain so in 2021. The team have been spotted filming in Wales, though, as well as in parts of England like Warwickshire, so it figures that production has re-oriented towards successive episodes shot in the UK.",
    "Those reports match up with further comments made by May earlier this year: \u201cIn the short term, we might have to reduce our travel ambitions, and we\u2019ll have a better chance of [filming]. The Grand Tour may become a little more domestic. But it will still be us three which is the important thing. And cars.\"",
    "Hopefully we'll get a more regular release schedule, then, especially given the year-long gap between episodes one and two of the show's fourth season. Could we see another UK-based special also drop in 2021 following Lochdown\u2019s July 30 arrival date? We're not that optimistic, but we doubt we'll have to wait another year to see the results of that project materialize.",
    "Until then, though, there\u2019s plenty of content from the presenting trio to enjoy elsewhere. You can watch Richard Hammond attempt to survive on a desert island in The Great Escapists, James May try his hand at cooking in James May: Oh Cook! and Jeremy Clarkson farming in... Jeremy Clarkson's Farm.",
    "Amazon Prime Video has variety on its side, at least."
