    "But one TechRadar writer argues that this doesn\u2019t make the slightest bit of difference to the company\u2019s appeal. After all, there\u2019s a reason Apple is the most successful business in history...",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "\u201cIt may have cost $7.5 billion dollars to make me realize it, but Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series S suddenly makes sense. Almost to the point where I\u2019d consider it a genuine threat to Sony\u2019s PS5.\u201d",
    "Our Senior Gaming Writer is having second thoughts about the supposed runt of the next-gen litter...",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "The Apple Watch 5 is pretty good. The Amazon Halo is pretty good, too. So why not rock both? Well, if you don\u2019t mind looking like Inspector Gadget, there are big advantages to sporting two wearables that have different approaches to tracking activity.",
    "Here, we break down why dual-wielding wearables isn\u2019t the crazy idea it might initially seem.",

    "Read more\u2026",
    "When the new AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT dropped on March 18, it crashed websites and promptly flew off the virtual shelves within an hour of being listed. Months are flying by, and the 'great GPU drought' feels endless.",
    "So why are new GPUs being released when so many gamers can't get their hands on any of the ranges that were released months ago? We take a look at what\u2019s really going on.",
