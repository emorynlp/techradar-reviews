    "Founded in 1997, Silicon Valley Web Hosting has primarily focused on providing bare metal dedicated server hosting for high-performance websites.",

    "The expectation overall is that its customers will experience performance improvements as part of HostPapa's capital investment plan in infrastructure.",

    "\u201cSilicon Valley Web Hosting has always focused on providing fast and reliable hosting solutions for its customers, whether they\u2019re running personal blogs or large ecommerce websites, and prides itself on great personal support,\u201d noted Denetron\u2019s Managing Member, Daniel Ballenger.",
