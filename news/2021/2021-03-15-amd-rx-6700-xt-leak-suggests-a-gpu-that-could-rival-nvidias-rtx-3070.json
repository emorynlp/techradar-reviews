  "article": [
    "AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6700 XT, the new GPU which goes on sale in a few days\u2019 time on March 18, has been spotted in another leaked benchmark, with the 3DMark result of a third-party card (from Sapphire) hinting at a competent rival for Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3070 \u2013 with caveats.",
    "And we don\u2019t just mean the normal caveats around any leak, which should always be regarded with a good deal of skepticism for obvious reasons. The 3DMark results highlighted by VideoCardz \u2013 purportedly of the Sapphire RX 6700 XT Nitro+ \u2013 come from China, or Bilibili to be precise, not always the most reliable source, so certainly bear that in mind.",
    "Assuming this leak is genuine, the grabs provided (as VideoCardz notes, no pictures of the card are shared \u2013 or any specs of the Sapphire Nitro+) show a Time Spy Extreme score of 6,685, and Fire Strike Extreme and Ultra scores of 17,435 and 8,568 respectively. In Port Royal the 6700 XT racks up a tally of 5,891.",
    "The leaker\u2019s claim is that the RX 6700 XT does actually outdo the RTX 3070 very slightly \u2013 by around 5% \u2013 under 3DMark\u2019s DX11 benchmark (Fire Strike), but struggles to match the 3070 in DX12 (Time Spy), and ray tracing (Port Royal) performance is heavily in favor of Nvidia.",
    "As mentioned, we don\u2019t know what speed the Sapphire RX 6700 XT Nitro+ is clocked at, or how much higher the card manufacturer might have pushed things compared to AMD\u2019s reference design \u2013 which already runs with very fast clocks.",
    "However, VideoCardz also made an interesting point in citing a comparison with the review of Sapphire\u2019s 6800 XT Nitro+ from Wccftech, which paired that GPU with the same processor as the Bilibili leaker used in their benchmarking, namely the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X.",
    "So, even if the rigs weren\u2019t identical, they provide something of a similar reference point, using the same Nitro+ models from Sapphire. Comparing 3DMark scores across that old review and current leak, the 6800 XT proves to be just over 50% faster than the 6700 XT, though the former GPU has 80% more cores \u2013 showing just how ramped clock speeds are with the RX 6700 XT Nitro+.",
    "It\u2019s worth underlining that we should be careful about reading too much into all this, and into any single benchmark, and indeed bear in mind that we don\u2019t know the state of the graphics driver used either (the full release version could provide an uplift for the 6700 XT, naturally).",
    "Still, this isn\u2019t the first spilled 6700 XT benchmarking we\u2019ve seen of late. We can also consider the Ashes of the Singularity leak which just popped up, showing the incoming graphics card to be 32% quicker than its predecessor, AMD\u2019s 5700 XT, a promising result. And certainly more positive than the previous Geekbench leak which painted a gloomier picture of 6700 XT performance (although that\u2019s not a gaming benchmark, of course).",
    "AMD is positioning the 6700 XT to take on the RTX 3070 (at 1440p) in the benchmark presentations it provided with the graphics card\u2019s reveal, and the game leaks we\u2019re seeing back this up to some extent \u2013 at least if you\u2019re not considering ray tracing (or DLSS, another area in which AMD is trying to keep up with Nvidia). Notably, AMD\u2019s official benchmarks didn\u2019t include any ray tracing comparisons, as you may recall.",
    "As ever, we\u2019ll only really know the full story when we get to test the RX 6700 XT ourselves. Although the reality is no matter how the final verdict falls for comparisons between the 6700 XT and the RTX 3070 or Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3060 models, AMD\u2019s new GPU will fly off the shelves regardless. Because as we\u2019ve seen at the moment, it\u2019s not really a case of what graphics card should you buy, but rather, what graphics card can you buy \u2013 if you\u2019re really lucky.",
    "There\u2019s no denying that any available 6700 XT stock will doubtless disappear in the blink of an eye anyway\u2026"
