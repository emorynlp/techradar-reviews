  "article": [
    "AMD could have Ryzen 7000 processors waiting in the wings, according to the latest from the rumor mill \u2013 but we\u2019re not so sure, and this leak, which comes from HP (once again), is likely to be a listing error of some kind.",
    "The full story here is that as @momomo_us highlighted on Twitter (via Wccftech), HP has put up a product listing for future all-in-one PCs which will use either Intel\u2019s incoming Alder Lake chips, or the \u201cAMD Ryzen 7000\u201d series.",
    "Obviously that\u2019s pretty odd, because as likely won\u2019t have escaped your attention, AMD\u2019s current processors are Ryzen 5000 models, so logically the next in line is the Ryzen 6000 range \u2013 and here the company appears to be looking to skip straight to Ryzen 7000.",
    "Why would this happen? That\u2019s unclear, but the argument, or at least suggestion, is that AMD might just have APUs from the Ryzen 7000 family ready to roll (the 24-inch and 27-inch all-in-ones or AIOs are \u2018coming soon\u2019 according to the listing).",
    "As these are AIOs, they would be running an APU (CPU plus graphics) \u2013 presumably \u2018Rembrandt\u2019 based on Zen 3+ in theory \u2013 rather than actual Zen 4 desktop chips (\u2018Vermeer\u2019). Zen 4 is still a long way out, of course, as next-gen desktop CPUs won\u2019t be here until the end of 2022. (Before that, we\u2019ll get a refresh of current Ryzen processors making use of 3D V-Cache tech early next year).",
    "Not only does it seem plain unlikely that AMD would skip Ryzen 6000, there are other reasons why this particular leak seems seriously iffy, and more likely to be a listing mistake than anything else.",
    "HP\u2019s other product listings for desktop computers and AIOs refer to Ryzen 5 processors, and Ryzen 9, so it seems like the possibility here is that the listing should read \u2018Ryzen 7\u2019, and someone has accidentally labeled it as \u2018Ryzen 7000\u2019.",
    "That possibility is backed up by the fact that there is another mistake in the listing, as the SSD is called an \u2018SSE\u2019, and if that level of carelessness is anything to go by, it\u2019s easy to imagine another error happening. Even though this sort of thing really shouldn\u2019t get through on a big company\u2019s official website.",
    "We can\u2019t totally rule out the possibility that there is a grain of truth here, though. HP does have a history of leaking hardware before it\u2019s released, and it\u2019s not unthinkable for AMD to skip to Ryzen 7000 somehow \u2013 that just really doesn\u2019t seem likely, and we\u2019re not buying it."
