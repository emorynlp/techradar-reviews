    "Two new Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive in the second half of 2021 \u2013 slightly later than originally planned.",
    "According to a Nikkei Asia report, Apple has rescheduled its plans to begin mass producing two new MacBook laptops in the latter half of the year, whereas previously it was thought they might arrive some time in Q2 2021.",
    "Even though the report refers to a delay, it nonetheless corroborates previous comments made by respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who suggested we\u2019d almost certainly see two new MacBook Pro models at some point in 2021.",
    "We\u2019ve previously reported on the upgrades expected of Apple\u2019s next MacBook Pro iterations, with the focus likely to be on aesthetic changes to their design and port types.",
    "For example, we anticipate the return of the HDMI port and SD card reader in the upcoming devices, features which have been omitted in favor of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 connections since 2015.",
    "We\u2019re also expecting the new MacBooks to come equipped with an improved Apple Silicon chipset, which rumors suggest might be called the M1X. A recent leak shows an Apple M1X with 12 cores, an increase over its predecessor\u2019s 8, which will reportedly arrive in the form of 8 high-performance \u2018Firestorm\u2019 cores coupled with 4 efficient \u2018Ice Storm' cores.",
    "The CPU will allegedly see an even more impressive upgrade in the graphics department. The leaked benchmarks, which are said to come from a \u201cpre-sample\u201d of the M1X, suggests the processor will feature a 16-core GPU with 256 execution units.",
    "What\u2019s more, it\u2019s likely the new MacBook Pros will play host to the return of the \u200cMagSafe\u200c charging connector.",
    "Rumors indicate that the returning \u200cMagSafe\u200c port will be a standalone charging port used instead of USB-C, with the new port located next to the existing USB-C ports.",
    "The design of the new \u200cMagSafe\u200c connector will allegedly be similar to the design of the previous \u200cMagSafe\u200c connector used on Macs, and will allow for faster charging speeds than are possible with USB-C \u2013 a technology it seems Apple is unwilling to entirely embrace. As with all rumored information, don't take any of this as gospel. We can't confirm any details until they come directly from Apple or the product hits the shelves, but it certainly bodes well for Mac fans if these leaks prove accurate.",
