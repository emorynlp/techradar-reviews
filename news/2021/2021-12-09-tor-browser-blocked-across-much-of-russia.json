    "Russia seems to have finally started its crackdown on the anonymous browsing software Tor.",
    "First reported by Bleeping Computer, and confirmed by the Tor Project itself, its main website, torproject.org, is now being actively blocked by some of Russia\u2019s main internet service providers.",
    "The block was kicked off on December 1 by Rostelecom, one of the country\u2019s largest ISPs, and was followed up by MTS, and Tele 2 (also major ISPs in the country) a day later. At first, the block was disregarded as an error due to the country\u2019s experimentation with Runet (an internet network limited to Russia\u2019s territory, only). It\u2019s now obvious that it wasn\u2019t an accident.",
    "Instead, the ISPs seem to be enforcing orders sent out by Roskomnadzor (Russia\u2019s main communications watchdog). According to Bleeping Computer, together with Tor, additional six VPN services were also blocked.",
    "With Tor, users automatically encrypt and reroute their browsing, using a network of Tor (The Onion Router) nodes. It allows them to remain anonymous while browsing, and helps them share information without being exposed. Tor is often used to access censored content, as well.",
    "Confirming the news in a blog post, the Tor project said there are ways to counter the block, and urged its users to assist by running Tor \u201cbridges\u201d.",
    "\"Russia is the country with the second-largest number of Tor users, with more than 300,000 daily users or 15% of all Tor users. As it seems this situation could quickly escalate to a country-wide Tor block, it\u2019s urgent that we respond to this censorship! We need your help NOW to keep Russians connected to Tor!\" reads the blog.",
    "Russia is hardly new to internet censorship, as since 2012, the Roskomnadzor keeps a \u201cSingle register\u201d, essentially a blacklist of censored sites and content.",
    "Started as a list of narcotics-related sites, as well as those advocating suicide or spreading child pornography, this has since expanded to include sites the government deemed \u201cextremist\u201d. Some organizations in the country argue the list has been abused numerous times in the past, to silence the political opposition\u2019s voice in the digital realm."
