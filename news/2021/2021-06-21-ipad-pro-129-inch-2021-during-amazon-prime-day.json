    "There are always decent Prime Day deals on Apple devices, but this year's Apple Prime Day deals are perhaps more impressive than they were in past years.",
    "We've already mentioned the amazing deal on an iPad Air (2020) on Amazon. You'll save $79 on the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi ($519.99) or 64GB Cellular ($649.99). These are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the iPad Air (2020).",
    "Perhaps the more interesting deal is on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which was only recently released. You can save $100, the best deal yet on Apple's signature tablet. This is on the 256GB model in silver.",
    "It's the best Apple iPad money can buy, and while it may be an expensive choice it's the absolute best tablet that you'll be able to buy at the moment so it may be worth a look.",
