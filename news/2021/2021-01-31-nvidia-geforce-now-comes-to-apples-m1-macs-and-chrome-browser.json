  "article": [
    "Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now game streaming service has brought in official support for Google\u2019s Chrome web browser, and updated the macOS app to support the new Macs with Apple\u2019s own M1 processor.",
    "Chrome support means you\u2019ll be able to hop in and enjoy game streaming right there and then on any device with the browser, but in the release notes, as spotted by XDA Developers (via Tom\u2019s Hardware), Nvidia clarifies that only Windows and macOS systems are officially supported with Google\u2019s browser.",
    "That leaves Linux gamers in the lurch, potentially, although these users can always give it a shot, as Nvidia notes: \u201cOther platforms may work, but are unsupported.\u201d Still, that situation is obviously better than nothing.",
    "Of course, Chromebook support (meaning Chrome OS, rather than the Chrome browser) was already brought in last year (check out our guide on how to use GeForce Now on a Chromebook).",
    "Nvidia elaborates: \u201cWe have also added an easy way for you to create bookmarks and shortcuts to help you launch your favorite games faster. Simply click on a game to open the game details options, and select +SHORTCUT to open a dialog to create a game shortcut on your desktop.\u201d",
    "The latest update (GeForce Now version 2.0.27) also introduces support for Apple\u2019s Macs powered by the ARM-based M1 chip, which is delivered via the official macOS app. So that\u2019s very handy for anyone who has bought one of these new machines.",
    "Note that some folks have been running GeForce Now in Chrome on Windows systems previously, but unofficially \u2013 and the official launch represents a fully optimized incarnation. That\u2019s good news in terms of responsiveness, and avoiding lag with your game streaming, of course.",
    "Tom\u2019s gave GeForce Now a spin on Chrome with a Windows 10 machine, and found it runs slickly, giving you an experience pretty close to that of the native app. Some settings are missing, though, including the ability to drop the frame-rate (to 30 fps) and the option that compensates for \u2018poor network conditions\u2019.",
    "For those kind of reasons, it is worth using the native GeForce Now application if you can, but the option to simply fire up Chrome and just jump straight in is obviously a useful one to have."
