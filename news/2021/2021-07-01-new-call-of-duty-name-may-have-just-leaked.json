    "We know that Activision and Sledgehammer Games are working on a new Call of Duty game for 2021 \u2013 but so far, details have been few and far between. Now, though, we may have had a hint at the game\u2019s title.",
    "According to a listing spotted by notable leaker Tom Henderson on Battle.net, the next entry in the popular first-person shooter franchise could be called Call of Duty: Slipstream.",
    "The logo associated with the listing doesn\u2019t reveal all that much in the way of the game\u2019s premise, but the name and typeface suggest it might be aerial-themed. Could that mean a return to World War 2, following Black Ops Cold War\u2019s 1980\u2019s setting?",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Call of Duty: Slipstream may simply refer to a codename or testing phase of the upcoming game, rather than an official title, but given that existing reports have already pointed towards a return to a Second World War setting, it follows that this title could be accurate.",
    "Those same reports have, however, suggested the new game will be called Call of Duty WW2: Vanguard, with other rumors claiming it\u2019ll take place in an \u201calternate timeline\u201d where World War 2 never ended.",
    "In any case, this is the best indicator of the game\u2019s title so far \u2013 so there\u2019s a good chance the next Call of Duty will be called one of either Call of Duty: Slipstream or Call of Duty WW2: Vanguard.",
    "If the former turns out to be accurate, along with the logo spotted by Henderson, we could be in for a heightened focus on aerial combat in the upcoming game, given its obvious Top Gun-esque styling.",
    "Activision president Dan Alegre recently revealed that the next Call of Duty would be \u201cbuilt for [a] next-generation experience\u201d on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and if the game does indeed take us to the skies, it would provide a great showcase for the power of these next-gen systems.",
    "120fps, ray-tracing and the extra functionality afforded by the PS5\u2019s DualSense controller could all represent ways to better immerse players in the realism of air combat, so we\u2019re excited to see how the next Call of Duty improves on its predecessor, which released for last-gen consoles, too.",
    "Alegre also confirmed that the game is on track for its customary Fall 2021 release (which is October/November, for our non-American readers) \u2013 so we may not have to wait too long to find out.",
