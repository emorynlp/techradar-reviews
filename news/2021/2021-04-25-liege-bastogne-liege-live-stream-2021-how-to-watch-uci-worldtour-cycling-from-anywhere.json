    "The Ardennes classics concludes with the Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge, known fondly as \"La Doyenne\" (The Old Lady), as it's the oldest of the Monuments. What it lacks in youth it more than makes up for in nastiness, with the route packed with relentless climbs that include the Col du Rosier, La Redoute, the Cote des Forges and the Roche-au-Faucons. Join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online wherever you are right now.",
    "The start list for the 2021 Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge features a multitude of past winners, most notably four-time champ Alejandro Valverde (Movistar), Dan Martin (Israel Start-Up Nation), Jakob Fuglsang (Astana - Premier Tech), Wout Poels (Bahrain - Victorious) and Philippe Gilbert (Lotto Soudal), who plans to retire at the end of next season.",
    "Last year's race was won by Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d, who'll once again be riding for Team Jumbo-Visma. It was a thrilling affair, which ended with a catalog of embarrassing errors from - of all people - the newly crowned world champion, Julian Alaphilippe.",
    "After nearly causing a collision, he started celebrating too early and was just pipped to the finish line by Rogli\u010d. To add insult to injury, Alaphilippe was then relegated to fifth place by race officials.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge live stream from anywhere in the world today.",
    "You can watch a FREE Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge live stream in loads of countries. In Australia, for instance, SBS Viceland is providing free coverage of the race.",
    "Or you could dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book, because anyone in Italy can watch for free on Rai Sport, cycling fans in France can get the race on France 3, and fans in Spain can watch on Teledeporte.",
    "If you're a resident of Australia, Italy, France or Spain and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "As discussed above, if you're desperate to watch the Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
