    "It\u2019s noticeably lighter and in mass production right now, meaning if you\u2019re still waiting on buying a PS5, the newly-released CFI-1100 version of the PlayStation 5 is likely the one you\u2019re going to end up with.",
    "But is it better than the original?",
    "That\u2019s a point that\u2019s still up for debate. Multiple teardowns of the new revision, now shipping to customers, have appeared on the web (notably from the excellent Digital Foundry and Austin Evans), which paint a confusing picture of the new PS5, and raise questions about its ability to stay cool.",
    "What\u2019s going on under the hood? As well as the new easy-to-twist screw for the stand, there\u2019s also a revised Wi-Fi module that, so far at least, doesn\u2019t appear to offer much of a difference in terms of performance.",
    "But the big change is a 300g weight reduction. The majority of that (277g) comes from a new lightweight cooler design, down from 1639g on the original PS5 to 1368g on the new CFI-1100 version. Here\u2019s where things start to get interesting. The new heat sink reduces the number of heat pipes from six down to four, and uses less copper in its construction \u2013 a material known for its excellent thermal performance \u2013 in favor of aluminium. There\u2019s also a new fan with more blades in it.",
    "It appears to be a more affordable cooling component for Sony to make, then \u2013 but the power draw from the internals appears to be the same, according to Digital Foundry. But you wouldn\u2019t expect a smaller heatsink constructed with materials with poorer thermal conductivity to run cooler, so what\u2019s the thinking here?",
    "It\u2019s possible that Sony was overly cautious in its initial construction of the PS5. To have a successful console launch, you not only need to get machines into players\u2019 hands, but also ensure that they work reliably.",
    "Once a device goes mass market, there\u2019s no telling how people are going to use them \u2013 a PlayStation could be stacked in a media center, or left next to other hot components and devices, not to mention simply being used in hot or humid climates. Sony\u2019s engineers have likely tested units in all sorts of stressful conditions, but it\u2019s still near impossible to account for all the variations in set up and lifestyle that real-world users will have. As such, the original PS5 design may have had more cooling than was necessary, and with a few months\u2019 worth of real-world user data to draw upon, Sony\u2019s been able to confidently slim down the console and reduce its manufacturing costs.",
    "However\u2026 isn\u2019t it better to be safe than sorry? There will be some who will have more trust in the older design\u2019s heavier cooler construction, which could potentially make the earlier models (with the CFI-1000 number) sought after in the future.",
    "Regardless, you\u2019d assume that the older models are now being phased out in favor of this revision, as Sony announced it\u2019s now making a profit on the disc version of the console, so stay eagle-eyed when buying if you have a preference."
