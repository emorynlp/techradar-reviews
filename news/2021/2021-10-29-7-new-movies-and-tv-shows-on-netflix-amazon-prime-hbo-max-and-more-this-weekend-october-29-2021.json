  "article": [
    "It\u2019s almost Halloween, folks! That must surely mean we\u2019re in for a slew of new horror movies this weekend, right? Wrong. In our pick of this week\u2019s biggest streaming additions, there\u2019s only one major horror movie to note \u2013 yet another Paranormal Activity flick \u2013 in amongst a decidedly eclectic mix of sequels, series and quirky new animations.",
    "But horror fans needn\u2019t fear. Interestingly, many of this year\u2019s scary movies dropped on streamers a couple of weekends ago (or are arriving after Halloween itself), so there\u2019s still plenty of blood and gore to sink your teeth into.",
    "Below, then, we\u2019ve rounded up the seven biggest movies and TV shows arriving on streaming services this weekend \u2013 with picks from the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and HBO Max.",
    "In this prequel to Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead, small-town bank teller Dieter (Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer, reprising his role) is recruited into a crew of Interpol's most wanted criminals in order to heist a sequence of legendary, impossible-to-crack safes across Europe.",
    "Schweigh\u00f6fer inherited the directing chair from Snyder in this one, and is joined in the cast by the likes of Natalie Emmanuel, Guz Khan and Stuart Martin. Don\u2019t expect too much of its predecessor\u2019s uber violent style, but Army of Thieves nonetheless sounds like an enjoyable, easy-to-watch mix of Money Heist and The Suicide Squad.",
    "Criticism has so far been kind, so Schweigh\u00f6fer\u2019s debut seems a safe pick for a good time this weekend.",
    "Now available to stream on Netflix",
    "In a rare case of a movie\u2019s release being brought forward (from a planned March 2022 date), Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin heads to Paramount Plus today as an \u201cunexpected reimagining of the beloved horror franchise,\u201d according to ViacomCBS\u2019 streaming bosses.",
    "A reimagining? Maybe. But unexpected? We don\u2019t reckon so. Expect more of the series\u2019 customary handheld horror, which should pack enough jump scares to pique the interest of returning fans.",
    "UK audiences, though, will have to wait until this one lands in theaters. Our advice? Watch any of the previous six movies for an equivalent experience.",
    "Now available to stream on Paramount Plus in the US",
    "A new adult animated comedy series that supposedly targets the \u201cpulsing heart of hypebeast culture,\u201d Fairfax lands on Prime Video this weekend to add some cartoon satire to your entertainment routine.",
    "The show follows the \u201cnever-ending quest for clout\u201d of four middle school best friends on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, and stars the likes of Billy Porter, Zoey Deutch, Rob Delaney, Ben Schwartz and John Leguizamo.",
    "Its humor seems pretty on-the-nose, but given our fondness for Netflix\u2019s Neo Yokio \u2013 a similarly satirical skewering of today\u2019s young people \u2013 we\u2019re willing to give Fairfax a shot.",
    "Now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video",
    "Star Trek: Prodigy was originally ordered as a Nickelodeon series, but finds its way to Paramount Plus this weekend as the first animated Star Trek series aimed exclusively at younger audiences \u2013 as well as Trekkies everywhere.",
    "It follows a motley crew of young aliens aboard the U.S.S. Protostar, who must learn to work together as they make their way towards the Alpha Quadrant. Jason Mantzoukas, Jameela Jamil, Jason Alexander and Daveed Diggs are among the show\u2019s extensive voice cast.",
    "Star Trek: Prodigy is only available to stream on Paramount Plus right now, but UK viewers will be able to catch it on \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Nickelodeon later in the year.",
    "Now available to stream on Paramount Plus in the US",
    "Hot on the coattails of Foundation and Invasion, Apple\u2019s latest drama series takes the action away from space and towards a very different type of star.",
    "Swagger is set in the world of youth basketball and is inspired by the childhood of NBA ace Kevin Durant, who serves as a producer alongside series creator Reggie Rock Bythewood. The ensemble cast features O'Shea Jackson Jr., Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis and newcomer Isaiah Hill.",
    "Sports-based shows aren\u2019t all that common nowadays, but given Apple\u2019s success with soccer drama Ted Lasso, we\u2019d say this one is absolutely worth a look.",
    "Now available to stream on Apple TV Plus",
    "Doctor Who returns for the thirteenth (!) season since its 2005 revival this Saturday, marking the final bow of both Jodie Whittaker and head writer Chris Chibnall before ex-showrunner Russell T Davies takes back the reins in 2022.",
    "For only the second time in the programme's history \u2013 and the first since 1986 \u2013 this latest season will tell one complete story across its entirety, rather than comprising self-contained episodes.",
    "Mandip Gill and John Bishop both return as the Doctor\u2019s travelling companions, so expect more of the show\u2019s customary space-hopping hijinks.",
    "Now available to stream on BBC iPlayer",
    "The second season of Sam Boyd\u2019s romantic comedy series lands on HBO Max this weekend, this time stepping back from Anna Kendrick\u2019s Darby to instead focus on William Jackson Harper's character, Marcus Watkins.",
    "Kendrick will appear again \u2013 though not in a lead capacity \u2013 alongside the likes of Jessica Williams, Chris Powell, Punkie Johnson and Ego Nwodim. The anthology is made up of 10 episodes, streaming in three weekly batches, with the first three episodes available to watch now.",
    "UK viewers: season 1 aired on BBC One a few months after streaming in the US, so we expect season 2 to do the same.",
    "Now available to stream on HBO Max in the US"
