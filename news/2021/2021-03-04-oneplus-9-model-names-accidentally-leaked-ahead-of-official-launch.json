    "We know that Chinese mobile giant OnePlus is planning on officially unveiling its latest range of smartphones sometime in March \u2013 but until now, we didn\u2019t know for sure what they\u2019d be called.",
    "While we\u2019ve already reported on several leaks regarding what we believe to be the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro models, we had expected the rumored third phone in the upcoming lineup to be dubbed the OnePlus 9 Lite, before further leaks suggested it might actually be called the OnePlus 9E or OnePlus 9R.",
    "Now, though, we\u2019ve got a clearer picture of what to expect \u2013 the company\u2019s latest devices will almost certainly be called the OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9E.",
    "The information (which is still not strictly a confirmation, mind) comes from a listing spotted on the website of smartphone case-maker Spigen, which detailed three new devices from the Chinese company alongside its pre-existing models.",
    "We checked to see if the case options for the OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9E are still live on the site, but it looks as though the company (whether that\u2019s OnePlus or Spigen) stepped in to put a pin in the premature reveal.",
    "Again, while still unconfirmed, we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of what to expect from the upcoming range of OnePlus devices.",
    "We expect the OnePlus 9 and Pro models to come equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage on board, slightly outmuscling their more affordable sibling, the OnePlus 9E, which we anticipate will be powered by a Snapdragon 690 processor.",
    "The OnePlus 9E is also expected to feature a 6.5-inch Full HD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate. That's a slightly lower spec than the rumored 120Hz variable refresh rate we expect to see from the premium models in the lineup (and a smaller display than the 6.78-inch size expected from the Pro version), but still a bright and capable screen nonetheless.",
    "As for their cameras, we think the OnePlus 9 will boast a 48MP main camera (outputting 12MP images) alongside a 48MP ultra-wide unit and an unknown third camera, while the 9 Pro may have four rear snappers. Being a cheaper version, we expect the 9E to come with a 64MP main sensor and 8MP ultra-wide camera, though it\u2019s unclear whether these will form a dual-camera setup \u2013 that\u2019s still mighty impressive for a supposedly-affordable smartphone, though.",
    "When it comes to price, there\u2019s very little concrete information, though we can make some assumptions based on the cost of the previous OnePlus 8 device, released in 2020.",
    "We expect the new flagship OnePlus model to cost at least $699 / \u00a3599 (around AU$1,100), given that the OnePlus 8 started at that price and rose to $799 / \u00a3699 (around $1,372) for more RAM and storage. For the 9E, then, we\u2019d anticipate a price in the region of $599 / \u00a3499 (around AU$900) but it's unclear exactly how much it will cost. The 9 Pro, of course, will likely cost more than both models.",
