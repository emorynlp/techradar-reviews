  "article": [
    "I\u2019ve really missed watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt perform. It\u2019s a thought that regularly crossed my mind throughout Mr. Corman, a comedy-drama Apple TV Plus show created, directed by and starring the multi-talented actor.",
    "A couple of supporting roles in Netflix productions, plus portraying the main character in action-thriller flick 7500, aside, Gordon-Levitt has been conspicuous in his absence in recent years.",
    "With Mr. Corman \u2013 his first major TV role since 3rd Rock from the Sun ended in 2001 \u2013 Gordon-Levitt offers a welcome reminder of his multifaceted artistry in an emotionally engaging, musical-inspired and at-times dark comedy drama that subliminally coerces viewers to reflect on their own lives.",
    "Mr. Corman stars Gordon-Levitt as Josh Corman, a 30-something failed musician-turned-fifth grade teacher who struggles to find happiness and purpose in a world that, in Josh\u2019s view, severely lacks both.",
    "On the surface, Mr. Corman appears to be a TV series that we\u2019ve seen and heard countless times before. Josh is an unhappy soul whose sadness is self-inflicted and, throughout the course of the series, he\u2019ll come to terms with his issues and learn to appreciate life again, right?",
    "In a way, yes \u2013 but what sets Mr. Corman apart from similar tales of self-discovery is that it feels real through its relatable protagonist.",
    "Instantaneously, audiences will resonate with Josh through his myriad of problems. He has dysfunctional relationships with his family and friends, failed to turn his rock star dreams into a reality, and struggles to find connections in a world through his negative outlook on life.",
    "At times, Josh comes across as a dislikable, tiresome and selfish individual with a loser\u2019s attitude \u2013 but you can\u2019t help but root or feel sorry for him. Gordon-Levitt\u2019s natural charisma helps in this regard but, as we find out why Josh is the way he is (and how he comes to suffer from anxiety and loneliness), it\u2019s difficult not to want him to turn over a new leaf and find some semblance of inner peace and success.",
    "That isn\u2019t to say that Mr. Corman is inherently dramatic or gloomy throughout. The show is funny through its awkwardness, particularly as Josh navigates the pitfalls of adult life \u2013 dealing with his fifth graders\u2019 parents, dating and one-night stands, and watching those around him achieve success while he doesn\u2019t. Its cringe humor is reminiscent of Curb Your Enthusiasm or The Office and, while it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to either, Mr. Corman has its moments. A scene involving a homemade weighted blanket and an episode centered around a Halloween party are genuine laugh-out-loud moments, providing light relief to events that precede or follow them.",
    "The inclusion of daydream-like sequences in Mr. Corman, too, is a welcome change of pace to watching Josh as he frequently sabotages his own attempts at happiness.",
    "Akin to magazine clipping collages seen in art student scrapbooks \u2013 hybridized with animation to bring them to life \u2013 Mr. Corman\u2019s fantasy settings are an aesthetic delight. Often acting as the backdrop to events that precede their arrival, every escapism-inspired scene is visually bold, colorful and imaginative.",
    "One such sequence is superhero, comic book and video game-esque in its style and creativity (a clever use of genres and industries that have seen notable upticks in interest over the past decade), while another acts as the stage to a musical number \u2013 a callback to Josh\u2019s primary passion in life \u2013 performed by the titular character and his mom.",
    "There\u2019s even a whole episode that explores how Josh\u2019s life might have played out if he\u2019d made different decisions throughout it. It\u2019s like the 1998 rom-com flick Sliding Doors, if Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Helen had a door for every life decision she made. Regardless, these hallucination-style sequences make for compelling contrasts to the mundane and muted palettes of Josh\u2019s real world.",
    "A TV show\u2019s plot and visuals are all well and good, but what of Mr. Corman\u2019s cast, and Gordon-Levitt\u2019s performance in particular?",
    "Gordon-Levitt is on top form here. Delivering a humorously deadpan, powerfully emotional portrayal of someone who feels trapped despite life\u2019s seemingly infinite offerings, the actor pulls from previously stellar performances, including 500 Days of Summer and Don Jon, to bring Josh to life in relatable fashion. Not only that, but it feels like Gordon-Levitt is drawing on his own life experiences to play the role, too. It\u2019s a personal project that he is heavily involved in, so it would be unsurprising if his own life wasn\u2019t intertwined with Josh\u2019s.",
    "Not to be overshadowed, though, Mr. Corman\u2019s supporting cast ably backs Gordon-Levitt up. Ted Lasso\u2019s Juno Temple, Shadowlands\u2019 Debra Winger and Narcos\u2019 Arturo Castro shine as Josh\u2019s ex-girlfriend, mother and roommate respectively, with the trio regularly challenging Josh\u2019s beliefs and worldview.",
    "It\u2019s the episode-stealing performance of Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings, The Matrix) as Josh\u2019s deadbeat father, though, that\u2019s the highlight of the series\u2019 guest stars. Gordon-Levitt and Weaving\u2019s rapport is a sight to behold \u2013 and you can really feel how fractious their relationship is and why Josh, like his dad, is simply drifting through life.",
    "With so much ingenuity and emotion, and a plethora of relatable characters, it\u2019s a bit of a shame that Mr. Corman\u2019s ending feels slightly off key.",
    "Without diving into spoilers, it\u2019s a semi-satisfying conclusion that seems like it could have had a bit more of an impact. The show\u2019s finale leaves things open enough for a second season if one is forthcoming \u2013 but the lack of a definitive ending doesn\u2019t provide much closure if this is the end of our journey with Josh.",
    "Mr. Corman is another excellent entry in Apple TV Plus\u2019 growing back catalog. It\u2019s a touching and amusing show that will take you on a journey of introspection and urge you to question if you\u2019re happy with your own lot in life.",
    "It\u2019s a pleasant surprise to see Gordon-Levitt revisit his TV roots and, alongside Apple and US indie entertainment publisher A24, craft an entertaining and emotive tale with compelling characters that examines life\u2019s complexities and how we deal with them.",
    "If we\u2019ve learned anything about Apple TV Plus, it\u2019s that we shouldn\u2019t dismiss its show lineup as there are plenty of hidden gems within (we\u2019re looking at you, Ted Lasso). Mr. Corman certainly deserves a chance and, based on its accessible story, believable characters, fantasy-fuelled escapism and dark humor, it\u2019s well worth a weekend binge watch once it\u2019s fully released.",
    "Mr. Corman\u2019s first two episodes will launch exclusively on Apple TV Plus on Friday, August 6 with future episodes released weekly."
