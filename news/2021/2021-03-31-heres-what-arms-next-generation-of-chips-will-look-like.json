  "summary": "Armv9 is the company\u2019s response to key computing trends",
  "article": [
    "The next iteration of Arm chips will be based on the Armv9 architecture announced yesterday, replacing the decade old Armv8.",
    "Arm is well-known for developing the architecture that it then licenses to other companies, which then build products around the chips. Arm chips power several devices including popular single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi.",
    "Armv9 brings in a number of major enhancements over its predecessor particularly around security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), signal processing and performance.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re going to deliver more performance, we will improve the security capabilities [ \u2026 ] and we will enhance the workload capabilities because of the shift that we see in compute that\u2019s taking place,\u201d said Ian Smythe, Arm\u2019s VP of Marketing for its client business in an interview with TechCrunch.",
    "Arm argues that the new architecture comes in response to the evolving computing needs in the post-pandemic world. With the prevalence of digital-first and contactless environments, Armv9 lends itself to use cases that call for greater automation.",
    "\u201cThe new capabilities in Armv9 will accelerate the move from general-purpose to more specialized compute across every application as AI, the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G gain momentum globally,\u201d the company said.",
    "In a blog post, Arm\u2019s CEO Simon Segars, Chief Executive Officer, explains that Armv9 addresses computing\u2019s greatest challenge, namely security. Armv9 introduces the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) for confidential computing with dynamically created Realms that will help protect sensitive data from the rest of the system.",
    "Arm is also betting big on the proliferation of AI workloads. The new architecture includes Scalable Vector Extensions 2 (SVE2), the next iteration of the technology it developed in collaboration with Fujitsu, for greater machine learning performance.",
    "\u201cThe launch of the Armv9 architecture signals a new era for our company; a globally-pervasive platform driving secure AI-driven computing that will enable our ecosystem of more than 1,000 partners well into the 2030s. Armv9 will be at the forefront of the next 300 billion Arm-based chips,\u201d notes Segars.",
