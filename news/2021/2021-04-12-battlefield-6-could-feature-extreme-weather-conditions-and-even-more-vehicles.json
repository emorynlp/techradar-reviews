  "article": [
    "A new Battlefield 6 (now confirmed to be Battlefield 2042) leak suggests the upcoming first-person shooter will feature extreme weather conditions and that the game\u2019s first reveal trailer will revolve around a desert island.",
    "It\u2019s a given that Battlefield 6 will feature some brand new locations, but we might have some more information to go on if a popular Call of Duty insider on Twitter is to be believed.",
    "Tom Henderson, who has been sharing Call of Duty leaks for over eight years, shared a rough sketch of what the game\u2019s new map will look like. Previous leakers have suggested one of the new Battlefield 6 maps will take place in Kazakhstan, however, this map appears to be different.",
    "The game\u2019s trailer will also reportedly showcase Battlefield 6\u2019s new extreme weather conditions, including a tornado that will have a big impact on gameplay.",
    "A fan made a more realistic looking concept of how the rumored Battlefield 6 map could look, using the information Henderson provided, too.",
    "The Battlefield series is known for its vehicular combat, and it seems like there will be more than ever in Battlefield 6. Henderson says that there are between six and eight Osprey Vehicles in the air at one time, hinting that the game\u2019s scale will be notably larger than before.",
    "Battlefield 6 could also feature 128-player maps, a Battle Royale mode and a more modern-setting. EA\u2019s chief studios officer Laura Miele has previously said, \u201cWe are creating epic battles at a scale and fidelity unlike anything you\u2019ve experienced before,\u201d which has naturally got fans of the series excited.",
    "EA has previously promised that Battlefield 6 will be revealed in \u201cSpring 2021\u201d (between March and May), with many tipping the game to be revealed in May. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said that the PS5 and Xbox Series X will help make \u201cthe team deliver on a true next-gen vision for the franchise\u201d and that Battlefield 6 will feature maps \u201cwith unprecedented scale.\u201d",
    "While we\u2019re certainly taking the latest Battlefield 6 leak with a pinch of salt, we wouldn\u2019t be too surprised to see weather play more of a role if the leak is true. For a game that focuses more on realism than Call of Duty, having dynamic weather would certainly up the ante during firefights, and could dramatically change how the game plays. A tornado would certainly be an interesting proposition, but we\u2019ll have to wait for an official announcement before we get our hopes up.",
