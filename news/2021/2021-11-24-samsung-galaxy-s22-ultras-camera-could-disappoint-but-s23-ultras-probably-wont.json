    "We\u2019ve heard a number of times that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will have more or less the same camera specs as the Galaxy S21 Ultra, and now we\u2019re hearing that yet again \u2013 but with additional details this time.",
    "According to @UniverseIce (a leaker with a solid track record), the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will have an improved version of the 108MP main sensor we saw in the Galaxy S21 Ultra, and exactly the same 12MP ultra-wide sensor.",
    "Where things could change a bit (beyond the unnamed improvements in the main sensor) is with the zoom lenses, as these will apparently both use new sensors \u2013 but they don\u2019t sound too different to the old ones.",
    "Apparently the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will have a 10MP 1/3.52\" Sony sensor with an f/4.9 aperture, offering 10x optical zoom, along with another sensor that sounds similar, except with an f/2.4 aperture and offering 3x optical zoom.",
    "The megapixel counts and apertures here are the same as on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but the pixel and sensor sizes slightly differ, with the Galaxy S21 Ultra\u2019s zoom lenses having 1/3.24\" sensors and 1.22\u00b5m pixels.",
    "So presumably these changes will lead to some improvements, but it doesn\u2019t sound like there will be any drastic differences if this leak is right. However, we could see much bigger upgrades on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, as the same source claims that Samsung will equip a phone with a 200MP sensor in 2023.",
    "Samsung isn\u2019t the only big-name brand that might be sticking similar snappers on its 2022 flagships, as the OnePlus 10 Pro is also rumored to have similar cameras to the OnePlus 9 Pro, so 2022 might not be a year of big camera improvements.",
    "That said, @UniverseIce claims that Motorola will launch a phone with a 200MP camera in the first half of the year, followed by Xiaomi in the second half, so while megapixels aren\u2019t everything, these could be the brands to watch in 2022.",
    "Apple could also bring some upgrades for the iPhone 14 range \u2013 though nothing like a 200MP snapper. Instead, sources suggest that the main sensor on the Pro models might get bumped up from 12MP to 48MP.",
    "2023 could be a much bigger year for smartphone cameras though if Samsung really does move to 200MP, as it\u2019s also rumored that Apple might finally equip an iPhone with a periscope snapper, allowing for long-distance optical zoom.",
