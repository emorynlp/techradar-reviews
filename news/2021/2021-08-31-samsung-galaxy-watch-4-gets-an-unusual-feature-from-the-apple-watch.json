    "The Apple Watch 6 might have its biggest rivals yet in the form of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, and beyond all of them being high-end smartwatches, they also all have an unusual feature in common.",
    "We\u2019re talking about Walkie-Talkie \u2013 a feature that the Apple Watch range has had for a while, and which lets you talk to a friend via the watch, in a walkie-talkie style. Now, you can also get an identically named feature for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 range.",
    "We say you can get it because it doesn\u2019t appear to come pre-installed, but owners can download it from the Google Play Store.",
    "It works in a similar way to the Apple Watch implementation too. Once you and at least one other person have the app, you can create a channel on your Galaxy Watch and have instant voice conversations (no calling required) as if you were using a real walkie-talkie.",
    "We\u2019re not sure how many people would actually want to talk to their friends and family via their wrist, but it\u2019s there if you want it, and gives the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 range one more way that it can match the Apple Watch range.",
    "Samsung\u2019s Walkie-Talkie app only works on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, so owners of older Samsung Galaxy Watch models won\u2019t be able to access it. Beyond that, users also need a Samsung account, though they\u2019re likely to have one of these if they own a Galaxy Watch anyway, and signing up for one isn\u2019t hard.",
    "Still, being limited to two wearables that probably won\u2019t be anywhere near as widespread as the Apple Watch makes what\u2019s already a niche feature even less useful than Apple\u2019s take on it.",
    "That said, it could be worse. As far as we can tell you don\u2019t need a Samsung phone to use Walkie-Talkie, which isn\u2019t something we can say for the likes of the ECG and blood pressure monitor features.",
    "Those are exclusive to Samsung handset owners, but the Walkie-Talkie looks like it should work for owners of any Android phone, especially as it can work independently of the phone (though Samsung suggests that you have your phone connected to the watch the first time you use this feature).",
    "iPhone users will still be out of luck, as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 range isn\u2019t compatible with iOS at all, but then they already have access to the Apple Watch range and its near identical feature.",
