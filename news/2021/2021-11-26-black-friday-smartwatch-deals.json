  "article": [
    "Black Friday is here, and we've likely seen the biggest discounts you'll find over the deals season through to Cyber Monday. We've seen deals on the Samsung Galaxy Watch series, Apple Watch devices, Fitbit smartwatches any many others.",
    "The best smartwatches also seem to be in good supply too - even the Apple Watch 6, despite that having been discontinued. So there shouldn't be too much danger of stock shortages over the Black Friday period.",
    "The exception to all this is the Apple Watch 7, with analysts suggesting this could be in short supply for a while. This is a wearable that probably won't be heavily discounted either given how new it is, so you might want to buy one of these sooner rather than later.",
    "Below you'll find the best current smartwatch deals money can buy from a variety of manufacturers for all different purposes.",
    "Based on previous Black Fridays - and in particular Black Friday 2020 - we predict that we might see the following:",
    "There are a huge number of smartwatches to choose from and deciding on the best fit for you can be tricky, especially as many of them have superficially similar specs.",
    "With that in mind, here are a few tips to make sure you get a good model \u2013 and don\u2019t overpay for it.",
    "1. Check out our best smartwatches guide",
    "At TechRadar we\u2019ve tested almost every smartwatch on the market, and with that knowledge we\u2019ve created a best smartwatch guide, highlighting the very best options. Or if money is tight then take a look at our best cheap smartwatch guide.",
    "Everything on those pages comes highly recommended, and you can see at a glance what we like about each model too.",
    "2. Check if a deal is really a deal",
    "If you see a smartwatch at a seemingly reduced price, it\u2019s worth double checking how much of a deal it really is, by comparing to the prices elsewhere, or using a browser extension like The Camelizer to see how the current price compares to previous prices the wearable has been listed at.",
    "Sometimes retailers can do tricky things like listing the price as a reduction from a starting price that the watch hasn\u2019t sold at for a long time, so not all deals are as good as they look.",
    "On Black Friday we\u2019ll be highlighting all the best deals too, so keep an eye on this page and the rest of TechRadar for genuine bargains too.",
    "3. Keep an eye on older models",
    "Recent smartwatches might be new and exciting, but the biggest Black Friday discounts will usually be found on older models \u2013 especially if a new version has since been released.",
    "So rather than the Apple Watch 7 for example, consider buying an Apple Watch 6 \u2013 you\u2019ll likely find it for a lot less money, and won\u2019t miss out on too many features.",
    "The Apple Watch SE is the best smartwatch money can buy right now (not counting the Apple Watch 7, which we haven't yet put through a full review), and it's also a top mid-range choice, being cheaper than Apple's new numbered wearable.",
    "That said, it's only of any use if you have an iPhone, so if not just scroll down for an alternative option. For those who do have an iPhone, you get a surprisingly premium experience with the Apple Watch SE, including good specs and a great design.",
    "It didn't get big discounts last year, only dropping by $20 in the US, with no notable deals in the UK or Australia. That said, it's now a year older, so we wouldn't be surprised if there are some much better Black Friday offers for it this year.",
    "Read the full Apple Watch SE review",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is our top premium smartwatch pick. It only came out recently so we're not expecting big discounts yet, but you might be able to save at least a bit of cash on Black Friday, and this wearable is worth the money.",
    "That said, iPhone users are out of luck here, and to get the most out of it you need a Samsung phone. Still, with an ECG, body composition monitoring and all sorts of other health and fitness tools, this goes beyond most smartwatches for telling you what's going on with your body.",
    "It also looks stylish, and unlike previous Samsung smartwatches this one runs Wear OS, so you can access a wide range of apps to use with it.",
    "Read the full Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 review",
    "The Apple Watch 6 is no longer the top spec Apple Watch, with the Apple Watch 7 taking that crown. But Apple's latest wearable could be in short supply and is unlikely to get discounted much if at all, whereas last year's model could see heavy reductions as retailers look to shift their stock.",
    "This is still a top smartwatch, with an always-on display and sleep tracking making for nice additions over the previous model.",
    "While the battery life could be better you're not missing out on a ton by choosing this over the newer model, and it could end up being a whole lot cheaper.",
    "Read the full Apple Watch 6 review",
    "You've missed out on these deals from last year - but that doesn't mean they aren't worth checking out. That's because they can give you a hint at what deals we might see on smartwatches in Black Friday.",
    "Expect discounts that are at least as good as these on the selection of devices below, but also keep an eye on how these offers compare to deals you see before Black Friday lands. That way you can decide if it's worth waiting for the day itself, or snagging an early offer while you can.",
    "You might want to check out Apple Watch vs Garmin comparison.",
    "TechRadar is scouring every retailer and rounding up all the top deals over the Black Friday period, and we\u2019ve put all the best Black Friday deals and Cyber Monday deals in easy-to-navigate articles to help you find the bargains you\u2019re looking for."
