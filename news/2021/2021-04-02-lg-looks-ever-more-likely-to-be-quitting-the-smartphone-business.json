    "Things don\u2019t look good for LG\u2019s smartphone business. There have been rumors of its demise for months now, and \u201cindustry sources\u201d now claim the decision to stop making phones has been made.",
    "These sources \u2013 speaking to The Korea Times \u2013 said \u201cLG has considered various options such as a sale, split sales or pulling out of the smartphone business, but decided recently to pull out of the business.\"",
    "The official announcement that LG\u2019s pulling out of the smartphone business will apparently come at the company\u2019s board meeting on Monday (April 5) \u2013 which is something we\u2019d previously heard from another source.",
    "Not so long ago the company had denied claims that it might be quitting smartphones, but in a comment to The Korea Times it sounded a lot less certain, with an LG official saying \u201call we can say is that every possibility is open. Although we cannot confirm that right now, we will announce the specific direction of our mobile communications business.\"",
    "While we can\u2019t be sure of anything until we hear it direct from LG, we should know one way or another on Monday, but at the moment things certainly don\u2019t sound promising.",
    "LG has struggled to compete in the smartphone industry in recent years, but it used to be a significant player, and even now it\u2019s responsible for some of the most interesting and innovative phones, such as the LG Wing 5G, and the LG Rollable \u2013 the latter of which might never now be released.",
    "If LG does make any sort of announcement about this on Monday, TechRadar will be sure to cover it, so head back here then to find out whether you can expect any more LG phones.",
