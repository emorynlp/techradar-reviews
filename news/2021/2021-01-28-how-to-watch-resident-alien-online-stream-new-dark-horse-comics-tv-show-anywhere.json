    "Alan Tudyk plays an alien playing a doctor in Resident Alien, a new sci-fi dramedy based on the Dark Horse comic book series of the same name. It follows the exploits of Captain Hah Re, an alien who has crash-landed in a small town in rural Colorado and taken on the appearance of a doctor, only to be roped into a murder investigation. What could possibly go wrong? Here's how to watch Resident Alien online from anywhere in this world.",
    "Most of us could do with some sort of an escape right now, but not Hah Re. All he wants is to be able to complete his evil mission and get back home, but he's stuck in Patience, which is about the worst place he could be stuck in, Area 51 aside.",
    "Until he finds a way out of here, he'll just have to blend in with the locals, and he'll do so as Dr Harry Vanderspeigle. Though he may look the part, learning how to behave like a person and interact with other people prove challenging to say the least, and it doesn't help that everything Hah Re knows about humans came from watching Law & Order reruns.",
    "Suffice to say, he doesn't always get it right, from his handling of dead bodies, living ones, and lingerie, and as he's forced to interact with more and more of the locals, they begin to suspect the worst, and the last thing he needs is an alien-hunting General on his case. Read on as we explain how to watch Resident Alien online, and stream the new show from anywhere.",
    "If you're outside of your country of residence over the holidays, then geo-blocking restrictions will prevent you from streaming Resident Alien online today.",
    "Fortunately, there\u2019s a simple solution. By downloading a VPN \u2013 short for Virtual Private Network \u2013 you can alter your IP address to that of your country back home, and so stream TV content that would otherwise be inaccessible."
