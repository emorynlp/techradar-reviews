    "Fortnite Season 6 has just dropped with a new Battle Pass that brings gaming icon Lara Croft, soccer player Neymar Jr., and several other Fortnite skins to the island. Neymar\u2019s hasn\u2019t been officially unveiled yet, but we know that his outfit will incorporate a wolf-like design.",
    "After the non-stop collabs from Season 5 \u2013 which brought Terminator, Kratos and The Mandalorian \u2013 none of these new characters seem out of place. Lara will join a steadily growing cast of gaming icons and Neymar isn\u2019t the first celebrity in the game \u2013 Marshmello, Travis Scott, and several Fortnite streamers already have skins.",
    "Lara Croft can be unlocked now, with variants inspired by her modern and classic designs able to be earned, though Neymar will likely not be arriving in-game for over a month.",
    "If you want to get the Lara Croft skin as soon as you can, you\u2019ll first need to buy the Battle Pass. You can buy it for either 950 V-Bucks ($7.99 / \u00a36.49 / AU$ 11.95) or you can join Fortnite Crew, earning the Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks and an exclusive skin for $11.99 (\u00a39.99 / AU$15.99)",
    "With that done you just have to reach level 15, either by completing challenges and earning in-game XP or by purchasing levels. Levels can be bought for 150 V-Bucks each or in a one-time bundle of 25 that costs 1,850.",
    "If you want to play as the soccer icon, you\u2019ll have to wait a while. We don\u2019t have an official confirmation but Neymar looks set to be Season 6\u2019s secret skin \u2013 a Battle Pass unlock which is kept hidden for a few weeks. We think this because Neymar isn\u2019t included as one of the 100 Battle Pass tiers but is teased in promotional images for the pass.",
    "Once you\u2019ve bought the Battle Pass, you\u2019ll see a section that says the secret skin will unlock in 43 days at the time of writing. That\u2019s April 28 \u2013 a Wednesday \u2013 which is usually when Fortnite updates release.",
    "When the Neymar skin releases you\u2019ll likely have to complete some challenges to earn the reward as well as other in-game cosmetics. Though what those challenges are is yet to be seen."
