    "Nvidia has launched its Cambridge-1 supercomputer, reportedly the most powerful supercomputer in the UK, in a bid to bolster the country\u2019s world-leading life sciences industry.",
    "The supercomputer represents $100 million worth of investment by Nvidia, and has been made available to external researchers in the UK healthcare industry.",
    "\u201cCambridge-1 will empower world-leading researchers in business and academia with the ability to perform their life\u2019s work on the UK\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, unlocking clues to disease and treatments at a scale and speed previously impossible in the UK,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.",
    "An NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD supercomputing cluster, the Cambridge-1 ranks at number 41 on the Top 500 supercomputers list and is fully powered by renewable energy.",
    "Nvidia claims it has poured all its artificial intelligence (AI) and simulation expertise into the supercomputer, and hopes it will enable healthcare researchers in their efforts to fight Covid-19.",
    "The company leans on a report by Frontier Economics that says Cambridge-1 has the potential to create an estimated value of \u00a3600 million (about $825 million) over the next decade.",
    "\u201cThis is an Nvidia industrial supercomputer owned and operated by Nvidia, and it\u2019s the first one that we\u2019re opening up to public use,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at Nvidia speaking to VentureBeat.",
    "Nvidia complimented the supercomputers\u2019 launch by announcing a handful of healthcare projects with various research institutes and companies, such as AstraZeneca, GSK, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London and Oxford Nanopore Technologies."
