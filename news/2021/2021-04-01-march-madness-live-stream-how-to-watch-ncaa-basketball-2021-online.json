    "After two years of waiting, the 2021 March Madness (or NCAA Division I Men's Basketball if your prefer) hasn't failed to deliver. It's been full of shocks and surprises and we have no idea how the Final Four showdowns will play out. Read on as we explain how to watch a March Madness live stream for every game - Final Four and Championship Game - wherever you are in the world.",
    "You won't need us to remind you that last year marked the first ever cancellation of March Madness, as the annual NCAA basketball institution found itself an early victim of the global Covid-19 sports shutdown. So it's with a big smile that we welcomed Spring collegiate hoops action back to the fray in 2021 - and maybe just a bit of guilt at how long we spent perfecting our bracket this week!",
    "2021's tourney has already been one unlike any other in the competition's illustrious history, featuring no defending champs and with every last game being played in Indiana. Couple that with some of the topsy-turvy results we've seen, and it makes the remaining 3 games even more unmissable.",
    "Newer powerhouse schools like Gonzaga and Baylor entered the tournament among the favorites - and so far they've lived up to their billing. But the biggest story is probably the way that underdogs UCLA Bruins have come all the way to the Final Four. Can their Cinderella story really continue?",
    "Follow our guide below for where to watch a March Madness live stream and catch all the NCAA hoops action online from anywhere - including some great ways to watch March Madness free online in certain countries, if you draw up the right play. You can see every game, all the way up to the Championship Game on April 5.",
    "March Madness 2021 - Final Four matches",
    "Baylor vs Houston - 5.14pm ET / 2.14 PT Saturday",
    "Gonzaga vs UCLA - 8.34pm ET / 5.34pm PT Saturday",
    "If you're currently abroad or there's no official broadcast option in your country, then you\u2019ll need to use a VPN to dial in to a location that does let you watch March Madness online in the same way you would at home.",
    "A VPN is perfect for this, as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in your country of residence, where you usual streaming services and subscriptions are based. You may be surprised by how easy it easy to get stared using one, too.",
    "In some countries, you may be baffled by the fact that NCAA college basketball is just as popular as the NBA among some fans. If you want to know what all the fuss is about or are just a US expat living abroad that's desperate to root for their school, then ESPN Player is the way to watch a March Madness live stream in many countries around the world.",
    "It's available in the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, coming in at the very reasonable price of \u00a39.99/\u20ac11.99 for the next month (or \u00a369.99/\u20ac79.99 for a whole year).",
    "That gets you live and on-demand coverage of every single March Madness 2021 game, as well as access to other live sports events, ESPN originals and ESPN Films. The service also supports both desktop and mobile, so you\u2019ll never miss any of the action, no matter where you.",
    "Best of all, anyone in one of the service's covered countries can try a FREE 7-day ESPN Player trial to see if they like it or not - one of the few legitimate ways to watch NCAA March Madness free online this month.",
    "The 67 games in all on the 2021 March Madness schedule are set to rain down on Covid-secure grand stages like the Lucas Oil Stadium...Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Indiana Farmers Coliseum, and Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. Hold up a sec while we catch our breath...",
    "And we're back. All of these prestige venues are located in the Hoosier State, where an NCAA midwestern microbubble is being concocted for the safety of everyone involved - and perhaps to evoke some nostalgia among the players, reminding the next-generation of NBA stars what it was like shooting ball before they hit the big-time."
