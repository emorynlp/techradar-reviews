    "Retro games consoles are really in right now. It seems that we all want to spend serious money on next-gen consoles, as well as enjoying the vintage games we couldn\u2019t get enough of when we were kids \u2013 along with the consoles we played them on. Because, sure, you can find some retro games on modern-day devices, but it just doesn\u2019t feel quite the same.",
    "The good news is, many of your favorite retro consoles are constantly being revamped and re-released. The latest news from October 2020 is that the next retro games console to get a modern revamp could be the Sega Dreamcast Mini.",
    "Did your heart just skip a beat hearing \u2018Dreamcast\u2019? You\u2019re not alone. Sega has already made one of the best retro games consoles to date in the Sega Genesis Mini, which means our hopes are high that we might soon go misty-eyed over Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi all over again. Although we should warn you that the Sega Dreamcast Mini news is nothing more than a rumor for now.",
    "With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the best retro games console you can buy today. Unless you're one a very young millennial or part of gen-z, your childhood gaming dreams are probably already catered for with the line-up of retro consoles that we\u2019ve included in our guide below.",
    "All you have to do is plug a SNES Classic Mini or Sega Genesis Mini into your TV \u2013 or whichever your favorite console was \u2013 pass the second controller to a friend and you can teleport back to the mid-90s when the world made much more sense.",
    "These revivals aren\u2019t ranked \u2013 because who can put a ranking on nostalgia? But we have included the pros and cons of each option. Below you\u2019ll find our top picks of the best retro console revivals that you can play right now.",
    "Following the massive success of the NES Classic Mini, Nintendo returned to the 90s in a more compact form with the SNES Classic Mini.",
    "The box plugs into your TV via HDMI and comes with 21 pre-loaded games (one of which is the unreleased Star Fox 2!) as well as two mini controllers that will allow you to take advantage of multiplayer.",
    "The drawback of Nintendo's retro consoles is that once you've exhausted the fairly limited library you won't be able to play anything else. The console doesn't accept the original cartridges, nor does it let you download more content.",
    "That said, it'll take you a little while to get through all of the titles included on the SNES Classic Mini allowing you to get your nostalgia hit.",

    "Everyone remembers the Sega Genesis (or the Mega Drive as it was known outside North America) acting as a competitor to Nintendo's SNES. The console was home to such classics as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Earthworm Jim.",
    "It works much like the resurrection of its old rival the SNES. All 42 classic games come preinstalled. And while there's a cute moving cartridge flap, it won't take any of your old carts. It'd need to be twice the size.",
    "Some of our favourites on this retro console include Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy and the punishing Ghouls 'n Ghosts. The first two Sonic the Hedgehog games are on there too, of course.",
    "Also unlike the original Mega Drive, the console supports wireless controllers so you don't have to worry about the mess of controller cables that used to plague console gamers.",

    "If you want an even more retro hit, the NES Classic Edition was the first rereleased console from Nintendo and it came with 30 games onboard. Those games included The Legend of Zelda, Mario Bros and Castlevania.",
    "The bad news is that once you've exhausted that library you won't be able to play anything else - the console doesn't accept the original cartridges, nor does it let you download more content.",
    "You may struggle to now be able to find the NES Classic Edition. At the time of writing, it was difficult to find the retro console brand new from any major retailers in the US or UK.",
    "That said, you may still be able to pick it up second hand and try out the retro experience for yourself.",

    "Most retro games consoles ultimately end up as ornaments in your house, to be taken down and played a couple of times a year. The SNK Neo Geo Mini is the best of the lot for that job. It's a micro arcade cabinet, and the baked-in controls are perfect for super quick-fire play.",
    "We also can't help but reminisce about how much these games use to cost \u2014 $200-$300 a pop. Now we get 40 for under $100.",
    "Faves include King of Monsters 2, Metal Slug and the entire King of Fighters series. Sure, they feel a bit fiddly on a 3.5-inch screen playing with a miniature joystick and buttons. But most of us don't buy a retro games console to play through these oldie titles for hours at a time.",
    "The SNK Neo Geo Mini isn't great for that job either. While you can plug in a larger controller and hook up your TV, the image over HDMI is muddy compared to that of the SNES Classic Mini.",

    "The PlayStation Classic console is certainly fun, but it missed a trick. Sony could have followed in Nintendo\u2019s footsteps by releasing a populist's retro console, one that had the undisputed best games of the era like Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy 8 and 9 or Tomb Raider. But that's not the PlayStation Classic.",
    "It doesn\u2019t include the majority of the console\u2019s greatest hits and instead opts for some cult classics like Persona and Jumping Flash among a few well-received titles. Using Sony\u2019s retro console is therefore a lot less like walking down memory lane, an experience we had with the SNES Classic and NES Classic Mini, and a lot more like a sample platter of what the PlayStation had to offer 20-some-odd years ago.",
    "Of course, some people might develop a real attachment to games like Destruction Derby, Ridge Racer Type 4 and Intelligent Qube - and if that's you, the PlayStation Classic is going to be everything you've ever wanted in a retro console.",
    "If not, however, then you'll be disappointed with the game selection, unimpressed by the lackluster interface and forced to watch, often in horror, as late '90s FMVs are brought to life like Frankenstein's Monster on your 4K or 1080p TV.",

    "The ZX Spectrum was one of the first mainstream home computers to come out when it was released in the UK in 1982. It was to the UK what the Commodore 64 was in the US, a trojan horse for getting computers into homes, and a device that would inspire a generation of coders.",
    "Yes, its keyboard was a bit of a mushy rubber mess, but with a software library that contained classics such as the original Elite, Football Manager, and Manic Miner, you can't exactly fault the little console that could.",
    "The Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega looks nothing like the original console. Rather than having a full QWERTY keyboard, the console is instead packed completely into a controller which has 1,000 games built-in.",
    "The device was available for \u00a399.99 (around $130), but it's not quite difficult to find so you may struggle more to pick this up than other consoles in this list."
