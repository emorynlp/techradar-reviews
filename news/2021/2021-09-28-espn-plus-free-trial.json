    "Since its launch way back in April 2018, it's no surprise ESPN Plus has become the go-to for many sporting fans. The place to live stream the likes of UFC, MLB, and MLS as events and games happen, there's also a whole library of exclusives, inclduing the 30 for 30 documentaries.",
    "For those who want to give ESPN Plus a whirl with an ESPN Plus free trial, at launch, new customers were able to benefit from a 7-day free trial of the sporting streaming service without dropping a dollar.",
    "Keep reading and we'll explain whether you can still make the most of a free trial, as well as the cheapest way to subscribe to ESPN Plus, including the ESPN Plus bundle. Keep reading to find out more.",
    "From the platform\u2019s launch in 2018 until June 2020, if you headed to the ESPN Plus website you would have found a seven-day free trial giving streamers still on the fence the chance to see whether the service was for them.",
    "It gave users a full week to dip their toes in and watch live coverage of baseball, NFL football, hockey, PGA Tour Golf, and out-of-market MLS matches, plus top drawer shows like Detail with host Kobe Bryant and Draft Academy.",
    "But with ESPN's owner Disney's growing dominance within the streaming realm, alongside the company's bargain-tastic Disney Plus bundle - alternatively known as the ESPN Plus bundle - which offers ESPN Plus, Display Plus and Hulu altogether for a heavily discounted monthly fee, the generous freebie trial was sadly withdrawn last summer.",
    "Since dropping the ESPN Plus free trial, there's been little in the way of discounts or offers available from ESPN Plus directly or any partnering cable providers. As of September 2021, ESPN Plus did increase its rates slightly, costing $6.99 monthly or $69.99 for its annual plan.",
    "There is one significant remaining money-saving option that involves ESPN Plus, however.",
    "With ESPN jointly owned by Disney, the entertainment giant is offering a ESPN Plus bundle that lets you get ESPN Plus, Disney Plus and Hulu for a flexible monthly sum of just $13.99. You can sign up for the great value bundle by heading to Disney Plus's website here.",
    "This means that alongside all the tasty sports content that ESPN Plus offers, you'll also be able to delve into a vault of Classic Disney Animations, Pixar movies, and documentaries from National Geographic plus the entire Marvel and Star Wars library, including Disney Plus exclusives like Loki. On top of that, get access to Hulu's films, TV shows and top notch originals like The Handmaid's Tale and Little Fires Everywhere.",
    "Subscribed to separately, you'd be looking at a fee of $20.97 a month, or $24.97 if you opted for Hulu without ads, making the $13.99 monthly asking price for the bundle one of the best value streaming offers currently out there.",
    "ESPN Plus can be best described as a supplementary streaming service on top of ESPN cable TV offering, that gives you access to extra shows, behind-the-scenes content and, most importantly, an ad-free environment to watch the content you already love.",
    "The service gives you access to every out-of-market MLS match, alongside one NHL and MLB game per day during their respective regular seasons. You\u2019ll also be able to watch live sporting events like golf's PGA Tour, top-tier boxing matches and a wealth of international soccer.",
    "But perhaps the biggest draw for many will be the fact UFC on ESPN Plus. ESPN Plus has the right to live stream all UFC events in the US. Every Fight Night and numbered PPV event is now shown on ESPN Plus - although the latter requires PPV-spends, of course.",
    "In addition to all the live sport on offer, ESPN Plus also hosts plenty of exclusive original programming too, with must-see programmes like The Fantasy Show and sports analysis series Detail alongside a wealth of additional 30 for 30 documentaries,",
    "On top of this its also a goldmine for on-demand MMA content, including Dana White\u2019s Contender Series, UFC Destined, and Ariel & The Bad Guy, plus classic fights and replays."
