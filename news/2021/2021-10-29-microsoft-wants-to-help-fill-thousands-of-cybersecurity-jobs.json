    "Software giant Microsoft has announced the launch of a national campaign to help train 250,000 people to boost the cybersecurity industry in the US.",
    "Announcing the news in a blog post, Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith said the four-year campaign looks to help fill a quarter-million jobs by the middle of the decade, with the nation\u2019s public community colleges playing a key role.",
    "For its initial commitment, Microsoft will create a free cybersecurity curriculum available to all of the nation\u2019s public community colleges. It will also provide training for new and existing faculty at 150 community colleges, and provide scholarships and supplemental resources to some 25,000 students.",
    "According to Smith, cybersecurity is a growing problem in the States, and could very well become a matter of national security.",
    "\u201cForeign governments have tampered with the software supply chain, targeted on-premise servers, and hacked into sensitive government files,\u201d he explains. \u201cCriminal ransomware groups have attacked schools, penetrated hospitals, and shut down a critical national pipeline.\u201d",
    "At the same time, the skills gap is only growing larger, making the problem that much more difficult to solve.",
    "\u201cFor almost every two cybersecurity jobs in the United States today, a third job is sitting empty because of a shortage of skilled people,\u201d he continues. \u201cCurrently there are 464,200 open jobs in the United States that require cybersecurity skills. They account for 6% of all open jobs in the country.\u201d",
    "All in all, more than one out of every 20 open jobs in America today is a job that requires cybersecurity skills.",
    "To solve this problem, everyone needs to be involved, Microsoft believes, including nonprofits, tech industry giants, colleges, and universities. That\u2019s why Smith believes community colleges will play a key role in tackling this growing problem: he believes they are diverse, flexible, affordable, effective, and present throughout the country.",
    "\u201cWe need to mobilize America\u2019s community colleges and enlist them in the cybersecurity battle,\u201d he concluded.",
