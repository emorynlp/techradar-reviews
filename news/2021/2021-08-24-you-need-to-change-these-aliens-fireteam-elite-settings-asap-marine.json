    "Aliens: Fireteam Elite has now landed on consoles and PC, but before you go mowing down waves of xenomorphs with your squad mates, all guns blazing, there\u2019s a few things you should know.",
    "The default game settings for Aliens: Fireteam Elite are\u2026 kind of strange. Every time you notch up a kill, a comically-sized \u2018X\u2019 will appear over your now deceased foes, transforming what\u2019s generally supposed to be a tense, gritty experience into something more akin to a cheap and cheerful arcade game.",
    "The scurrying masses of Aliens are also needlessly highlighted with a bold colorful outline, which kind of defeats the point of the game\u2019s dark, atmospheric corridors if every threat is lit up like a Christmas tree.",
    "In a game where the threat of being pounced on at any given opportunity is part of its appeal, you\u2019ll want to turn these two settings off, unless you\u2019re really struggling with visibility or knowing when you\u2019ve achieved a kill. Here\u2019s how to make Aliens: Fireteam Elite better, and a little bit scarier.",
    "Go into Settings, and then navigate to Gameplay. In here, you\u2019ll want to turn off \u2018Kill Confirmation Floater\u2019 to remove the huge \u2018X\u2019 mark that appears. To stop the game from highlighting enemies, you\u2019ll want to turn off \u2018Outline Targets on Casual\u2019 and \u2018Outline Targets on Standard\u2019.",
    "These two simple changes make Aliens: Fireteam Elite an infinitely more enjoyable experience, to the point where we\u2019re surprised they\u2019re left on by default.",
    "If you\u2019re on the fence about Aliens: Fireteam Elite, we believe that it \u201cnails the adrenaline rush of facing an overwhelming xenomorph hive\u201d. So, if you\u2019re a fan of the film and have a couple of friends who are willing to help you cull a seemingly endless Alien threat, we\u2019d recommend giving it a go. Just remember to adjust these settings before you do."
