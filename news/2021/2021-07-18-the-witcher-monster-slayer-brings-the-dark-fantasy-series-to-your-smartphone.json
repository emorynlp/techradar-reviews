    "The Witcher began as a dark fantasy book series before exploding in popularity with the eponymous video games, and the franchise has reached new audiences with the Netflix TV show. Naturally, the time seems ripe for a mobile game to land big with fans \u2013 so get ready for a game inspired by\u2026Pok\u00e9mon Go?",
    "Yes, The Witcher: Monster Slayer, a new game developed by Poland-based studio Spokko set for a global launch on July 21, is a location-based mobile game that overlays your surroundings with fantastical environments chock full of monsters and quests. Similar to game developer Niantic\u2019s hit Pok\u00e9mon Go, you\u2019ll have to wander around IRL to encounter challenging enemies, harvest items, and explore the story.",
    "The game is a bit of a blend of Pok\u00e9mon Go and Elder Scrolls: Blades \u2013 instead of capturing monsters, you\u2019ll swipe your finger to slash them with your sword, though you\u2019ll probably want to prepare with oils, potions, bombs, and magic suited for each foe, just like in the main games. But Monster Slayer has something unique that fits its rich literary, interactive, and cinematic origins: story.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy on mobile to make a story-driven game, and it\u2019s even tougher to make a location-based game, but that creates many, many opportunities,\u201d said The Witcher: Monster Slayer Quest Designer and Story Lead Przemek Tarczy\u0144ski to TechRadar in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody else ever tried it, at least at such scale or with such success.\u201d",
    "Monster Slayer will have a progression of quests that tell a story fitting the dark, dangerous world of the Witcher. Players will, of course, play one of the titular magic-enhanced warriors, and follow both a main storyline told through 2D-animated cinematics and dialogue between characters using the game\u2019s 3D engine. While the game\u2019s developers didn\u2019t want to spoil the details, they hinted at an epic story worthy of the franchise.",
    "But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll also stumble upon some familiar Witcher quests requiring some monster-killing dirty work, like getting asked to chase down a villager abducted by Nekkars, Tarczy\u0144ski told us \u2013 you\u2019ll just have to run down the baddies in the real world this time.",
    "And along the way, don\u2019t be surprised if you run into some familiar faces from the franchise, but a heads up: Monster Slayer is set 200 years before the games and show begin, so don\u2019t expect to run into Gerald, Yennefer, Ciri, Dandelion (Jaskier to the Netflix watchers) or others who wouldn\u2019t fit such a timeline.",
    "Starting the game earlier gives the team plenty of design space to tell new stories, especially since, in that era of the Witcher universe, there are far more of the monster hunters roaming around (slanderous propaganda turns the public against Witchers and their numbers are whittled down until few remain in Geralt\u2019s time).",
    "\u201cWe found that this experience of being a Witcher and building your own story in that universe is something fresh,\u201d said Witcher: Monster Slayer Executive Producer Mateusz Janczewski. \u201cThis will be a game about millions of Witchers in the world, and we thought that would be something sexy that we thought would be cool for the players.\u201d",
    "The Witcher: Monster Slayer is a free-to-play mobile game, which means players can run through the game without spending any money \u2013 but if they want, they\u2019ll be able to purchase extra resources to make equipment as well as combat items (like oils, potions, and bombs). Quests and story content won\u2019t cost anything extra and will be available to all players at launch.",
    "The game\u2019s story will be told in quests found out in the world \u2013 at launch, six main quests and six hidden quests \u2013 which players have to physically approach to engage with. While the Monster Slayer team agrees this is a tricky issue, especially for players who have limited mobility (some monsters and items will randomly spawn around players, but quests seem to be some distance away), the developers believe this is a core appeal of the game. Folks can play the Witcher 3 at home, but to experience Monster Slayer, they need to venture into the world \u2013 and that can result in some serendipitous IRL experiences.",
    "\u201cFor example, it can be that the [quest objective] is on the other side of the river and you need to find a bridge and it won\u2019t be so close as you thought, and maybe you will need to visit the part of your city that you never visited,\u201d Tarczy\u0144ski said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a LARP more than an RPG.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s something else unique that could make Monster Slayer \u201cone of the most hardcore RPG experiences ever,\u201d as Tarczy\u0144ski puts it: the game is constantly saving your progress. If you make a decision in the story, it\u2019s locked in forever (unless you want to start over with a new character), since you can\u2019t just load up an old save file. As he puts it, \u201cIf you make a choice, you have to live with the consequences.\u201d",
    "Those effects may not be felt immediately, but could have ramifications down the line: Monster Slayer will add more story quests with Seasons, which are expected to come twice a year. Seasons will add more content and fill out what\u2019s happening in a world set 200 years before that of the main games.",
    "In theory, Monster Slayer\u2019s story could catch up to the plot of the main games, Janczewski noted, but that\u2019s a long timeline to fill before the mobile game catches up: \u201cAt some point, because we\u2019re doing the service game with free-to-play, maybe at some point we\u2019ll be able to get to the point when Geralt is alive, you know? You never know what happened.\u201d",
    "In our time with an early build of The Witcher: Monster Slayer, it does feel like a game steeped in the world of the games, show, and books. We hacked and slashed our way through familiar enemies and prepared for fights with oils and potions specifically tuned for monster groups. We drew signs on the screen to cast magic (a \u2018V\u2019 to spew fire with Igni, for instance, matching its glyph). We picked herbs off the ground to toss in a cauldron.",
    "Monster Slayer clearly owes a lot to location-based games like Inverse and Pokemon Go, overlaying a map of my area with monsters, items, and other places of interest. It\u2019s honestly more fun to hack apart enemies than it was to catch Pokemon, but don\u2019t expect complex combat - the fun will mostly be in feeling like there\u2019s more going on in your neighborhood of a grim, supernatural variety.",
    "Truth be told, we haven\u2019t experienced the quests that the Spokko devs have singled out as the most unique parts of the game. Perhaps a lot of players won\u2019t, as they\u2019ll still enjoy a casual game that doesn\u2019t ask too much of their time - just a few minutes here and there as I pull up the game while out on a walk. The Monster Slayer devs know this:",
    "\u201cPerhaps on a daily basis, you\u2019re not going to play the quests, but when you have the weekend and you\u2019ve got an hour, then you can start the adventure and dive into it,\u201d Janczewski said.",
    "Likewise, I didn\u2019t experience the real world\u2019s impact on the game: rain or other weather will change the kinds of monsters that appear, though I did see that different foes pop up after dark. There are even quests that change whether you complete them overnight, though the devs were coy about what would be different while wandering around at the witching hour.",
    "But it\u2019s a new game that costs nothing to try and evokes the sense that more is happening in our world. For fans of the franchise as well as mobile gamers looking for something to liven up their outdoor adventures - and find reasons to get out of the house - The Witcher: Monster Slayer will have plenty to offer, especially as we all wait for the second season of Netflix's Witcher show."
