  "article": [
    "The closing credits for Star Wars: Visions describe the show as \u201cinspired by Star Wars created by George Lucas\u201d. The line elegantly distils the essence of this new animated Disney Plus anthology series, because unlike most other Star Wars movies and TV shows released during the Disney era, its stories aren\u2019t restricted by the existing canon of a galaxy far, far away.",
    "Instead, Lucasfilm has given a selection of top Japanese anime studios the freedom to reinvent the mythology of that famous universe how they see fit. The nine short films that comprise Visions are riffs on a theme of Star Wars, delivered in a variety of anime styles \u2013 ranging from dark and moody monochrome, to cute Chibi versions of Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt.",
    "\u201cWe always knew we wanted to find a way to connect Star Wars to the storytellers in animation in Japan,\u201d explains Star Wars: Visions executive producer James Waugh. \u201cIt was a matter of [finding] the best approach to allow those creators to do what they do best. That meant allowing them to explore all their imaginative potential in a way that didn't have the expectations of the core [Star Wars] saga story.",
    "\u201c[Lucasfilm president] Kathy Kennedy was actually the person who really championed this,\u201d he continues. \u201cShe'd worked with [Studio Ghibli legend] Hayao Miyazaki, and she loved the work coming out of Japan. So we very quickly started taking meetings with different studios that we liked \u2013 we found unbelievable Star Wars fans, incredible passion, enthusiasm and great ideas.\u201d",
    "One of the other big reasons for Visions\u2019 existence is the arrival of Disney Plus, which has given Lucasfilm a platform to try out more experimental Star Wars projects that may not reach orbit on other networks and streamers.",
    "\u201cThe world very quickly evolved when Disney Plus became an option,\u201d Waugh explains. \u201cIt became this incredible robust space to be able to tell new stories. Then we got to a place of thinking, \u2018There\u2019s so many great, unexpected stories and perspectives on Star Wars \u2013 where do we start?\u2019 That\u2019s when we realized the power of Disney Plus allows us to break traditional form, and we decided to do something more anthological, and to really showcase the entire spectrum of tones and styles going on in Japan.\u201d",
    "Freed from the constraints of existing mythology, Star Wars: Visions reveals aspects of that famous galaxy we\u2019ve never seen before. While the lightsabers, Stormtroopers and Star Destroyers look familiar, they\u2019re also reflected through an all-new prism, with exciting new reinterpretations of very familiar iconography. But, with the envelope being pushed by the creative teams, was there ever a moment when Lucasfilm felt the need to hold them back?",
    "\u201cI think, in general the misnomer is that we're usually not [open to new ideas] in some sense,\u201d Waugh counters. \u201cAnd I think, no matter what kind of storytelling we're doing, we're always trying to find a way to make sure a creator can realize their vision. With these Visions in particular, there was an opportunity to use the form of animation to do things we just haven\u2019t done in live-action.\u201d",
    "That freedom to experiment allows \u2018The Ninth Jedi\u2019 \u2013 one of the standout episodes of the anthology \u2013 to put an entirely new spin on the color-scheme of a Jedi\u2019s lightsaber. \u201cWe definitely had an internal conversation of, \u2018Look, this isn\u2019t normally what we do, but it really works with the logic of the story,\u2019\u201d says Waugh. \u201cAlso, the inherent values of Star Wars are so baked into that short that we went with it.\u201d",
    "And while musicians have always been a part of the Star Wars universe \u2013 from Figrin D\u2019an and the Modal Nodes in A New Hope to the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi \u2013 \u2018Tatooine Rhapsody\u2019 breaks convention by putting rock group Star Waver (quite literally) on center stage.",
    "\u201c\u2018Tatooine Rhapsody\u2019 was one of the first pitches we got, and it definitely was a testing ground moment for us,\u201d Waugh admits. \u201c\u2018Can we do a space opera? Is this too far?\u2019 But I think that, very quickly, we realized just how cool and unique [it was], and how Visions essentially opens the door for lightsabers that change color and rock operas \u2013 and Pinocchio stories about droids who wish they could become a Jedi one day.\u201d",
    "\u201cStar Wars is a universe and there\u2019s history and storytelling going on all the time,\u201d Waugh adds. \u201cWith Star Wars the opportunity to be able to continue those stories in other spaces is, I think, absolutely there. I personally want to see the band, Star Waver, carry on \u2013 we'll see what happens with that, but I think potential is rife. All those ideas are just so unique \u2013 I hope the enthusiasm is there, because we're really excited about that potential too.\u201d",
    "Another of the most compelling elements of Visions is the way the Japanese influence shines through, both in the soundtrack (both Japanese and English-language dubs are available), and the visuals, where elements of Japan\u2019s culture, architecture and history mesh seamlessly with the iconography of George Lucas\u2019s universe.",
    "\u201cGeorge Lucas was inspired by Akira Kurosawa films and classic Japanese cinema,\u201d says producer Kanako Shirasaki. \u201cNow animators and creators in Japan are heavily influenced by Star Wars, because they watched Star Wars when they were teenagers, or really small with their parents. They have the essence of both, and they\u2019re very excited to explore their visions, drawing influence from Star Wars, while at the same time bringing their Japanese aspect to the shorts.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe sort of dialogue between East and West, culture inspiring culture, has been really amazing to watch,\u201d continues Waugh. \u201cStar Wars is so infused with Kurosawa films and [Japanese film genre] Jidaigeki storytelling that it almost feels that it was coming home in a way.\u201d",
    "As ever in the Star Wars franchise, there\u2019s also the potential for the Star Wars: Visions shorts to spin-off in other directions \u2013 in fact, the story of the mysterious lead character from \u2018The Duel\u2019 will continue in novel Ronin by Emma Mieko Candon (on sale October 12).",
    "\u201cThere's so many interesting droids and characters in every short that you feel you want to learn more about them,\u201d says Shirasaki. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear how fans react when the series is officially released.\u201d",
