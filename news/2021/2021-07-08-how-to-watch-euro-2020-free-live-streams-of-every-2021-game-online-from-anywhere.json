    "We had to wait a year for it, but the 2021 UEFA European Championship sure hasn't disappointed as we head into the massive final between Italy and England. We really have no clue who will be crowned this year's champions, but we do know all the ways you can watch a Euro 2020 live stream. The great news is that every single game is available to see absolutely FREE - and we explain how below.",
    "Five years on from Portugal's astounding victory, the battle to crown the continent's soccer champs has truly delivered on all the anticipation.",
    "Italy were rampant in the group stage, before almost becoming unstuck by Austria and then impressively seeing off Belgium. They squeezed past the Spanish team on penalties to get to the final with a squad that appears to be at the start of a Roberto Mancini-led dynasty.",
    "Dare we say that England look like the most galvanised team at the tournament? Their 4-0 quarter-final thrashing of Ukraine certainly looked like it, before overcoming a whole lot of demons to vanquish the unlucky Danes in a taut semi-final.",
    "Been bitten by the soccer bug? Here's how to live stream Euro 2020 from anywhere - not forgetting how to watch every game of the 2021 European Championship for FREE. We also have key information on the Euro 2020 teams, fixtures, dates, groups and format.",

    "Final: Italy vs England - 9pm CET, 8pm BST (BBC/ITV)",
    "Scroll down for all the ways you can watch Euro 2020 online in a number of countries around the world. But first, you should know that if you're abroad at any point during the tournament, you probably won't be able to watch the footy like you normally would at home.",
    "This is because of geo-blocking, a digital restriction that means certain streaming services are only accessible in the region they're based in. Don't sweat it, though, as you've got the option of using a VPN to tune to your preferred coverage wherever you are.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Euro 2020 from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "We're guessing that if you've made it to this article, you probably don't need us to explain it in to much detail.",
    "But what makes it so special is the way that the European Championship always seems to exceed expectations, producing iconic incidents and shocks galore. Think Van Basten's volley in '88, Denmark winning it all after not even qualifying in '92, the dentist chair and Suker's lob in '96, Trezeguet's golden goal in '00, Greece's '04 immortals, David Villa lighting up '08, Iceland humiliating England in '16.",
    "The European Championship was expanded from 16 teams to 24 for Euro 2016, and the same format is in place for Euro 2020.",
    "The teams are split into six groups of four, which were loosely dictated by each nation's performances in qualifying.",
    "Each team plays the other teams in its group once, and the top two in each group automatically qualify for the knockout stages. However, of the six teams that finish third in their group standings, the four strongest also go through.",
    "The knockout phase begins with the Round of 16, followed by the Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals and, eventually, the Euro 2020 Final on Sunday, July 11 2021.",
    "Even without the injured Eden Hazard, Belgium are amongst the Euro 2020 favorites. In Kevin de Bruyne they have the best midfielder in the world, and numerous top-class options in every position on the pitch. Is this the year their Golden Generation delivers?",
    "Similar things can be said about reigning Euro champions Portugal, and reigning World Cup champions France. Both nations have an embarrassment of talent at their disposal, beyond the superstar names of Kylian Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
    "Spain, Germany and England should also be considered serious contenders, though all three nations have struggled to get the balance of their team right in the lead-up to the tournament.",

    "Euro 2020 is the first European Championship to be held at different venues across the continent, rather than one host nation.",
    "It was a controversial choice that was made before the pandemic, but by some quirk of fate it might pay off, as it could allow fans local to different host cities to attend games without having to travel across borders.",
    "London's Wembley Stadium will host eight games, including both semi-finals and the final. The Euro 2020 venues are as follows:",
    "Portugal did to France at Euro 2016 what Greece did to Portugal in 2004, shocking the tournament hosts with a 1-0 victory in the final.",
    "Not only were Les Bleus heavily favoured before the game, but Portugal lost their talisman and star player Cristiano Ronaldo to injury in the 25th minute.",
    "France dominated the match but Portugal held on to force extra-time, during which they exploded into life, hitting the crossbar and being denied by Hugo Lloris, before substitute Eder, who had until recently been playing for Swansea, curled a daisy-cutter into the bottom corner from 25 yards.",
    "Five years on from Portugal's astounding victory, the battle to crown the continent's soccer champs will commence again today.",
    "The European Championship is a tournament that always seems to exceed expectations, producing iconic incidents and shocks galore.
