  "summary": "New privacy labels disclosure rules offer lots of wriggle room, analysts say",
  "article": [
    "A new analysis of the top twenty VPN apps in the US, UK, Australian, and Canadian iOS App Store editions has revealed that only a mere 12% display accurate privacy labels.",
    "Apple recently introduced privacy labels for its App Store, much like the nutritional labels on packaged food, to give users an insight into the apps\u2019 data collection practices and help users make informed decisions.",
    "According to Apple\u2019s plan, apps that collect personal data are required to self-submit information which the company then uses to award any combination of three labels that tell users whether the collected data is linked to the user or not, and whether it can be used to track them.",
    "Since these labels are based on self-submitted information, Top10VPN decided to investigate their accuracy for mobile VPN apps.",
    "The analysts identified forty nine unique apps that appear in the top twenty iPhone VPN apps displayed in each of the US, UK, Canada and Australia Apple App Stores.",
    "Of these, only six of the apps displayed privacy labels that adhered to Apple\u2019s guidelines.",
    "Meanwhile, over thirty of the apps had inaccurate privacy labels, while nineteen had two or more incorrect labels. Nine apps had no labels at all since they haven\u2019t submitted any details to Apple.",
    "The US version of the App Store was the biggest offender, with nineteen of its top twenty VPN apps bearing inaccurate privacy labels.",
    "The analysis also revealed that fourteen apps failed to disclose that they were collecting the IP address of their users.",
    "\u201cOur investigation not only revealed the disturbing proportion of apps with inaccurate or missing privacy labels but also highlighted further flaws in Apple\u2019s system even beyond the fundamental problem posed by self-certification,\u201d the investigators write in their report.",
    "One of the problems they highlight is the fact that the labels are mandatory only for listed apps that send in a new update. This means many apps continue to be listed without labels since their developers haven\u2019t updated them.",
    "The analysts also argue that Apple\u2019s rules around \u201coptional non-disclosure\u201d of data collection in certain circumstances, offers developers a wide berth to avoid disclosure.",
    "If the investigation by Top10VPN is anything to go by, Apple\u2019s intentions with the privacy labels has been pretty much nullified.",
