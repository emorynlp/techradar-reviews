  "article": [
    "I feel like I shouldn\u2019t care how my tech looks \u2013 it\u2019s the components that actually matter \u2013 but I can\u2019t help being bothered that most running watches are, frankly, pretty ugly. The Garmin Instinct Solar is one of my favorite wearables of all time \u2013 it\u2019s packed with so many sports tracking tools and has such great battery life \u2013 but it\u2019s a chunky beast of a thing. One of its colorways is a pleasing shade of lilac, but you can\u2019t escape the fact it\u2019s built like a tank.",
    "Right now, I use a Garmin Vivoactive 4S for running. I\u2019ve tried and enjoyed a lot of great running watches from various companies, but the Garmin Connect app remains my favorite. It just has so many features, including free training plans and workouts, which you might normally have to pay for separately, and it pools data from all your Garmin devices in one handy, well organized dashboard.",
    "However, I only strap it on when I\u2019m about to head out on a run, or to the gym \u2013 for everyday use, it just feels too chunky and, frankly, inelegant. That\u2019s a problem for a device that\u2019s meant to be worn 24/7 to track your sleep, recovery, stress levels and activity \u2013 not just training sessions.",
    "My everyday timepiece is a little solar-powered Seiko analog watch (a birthday gift from my parents 10 years ago) with a 33mm case and matching two-tone metal bracelet. It\u2019s nothing extraordinary, but it\u2019s grown up, while even high end running watches more closely resemble the turquoise Baby-G I wore to school in the late 90s.",
    "I\u2019m not asking wearable companies to \u2018shrink it and pink it\u2019 \u2013 the tired and pretty insulting marketing theory that if women aren\u2019t buying a particular product, you can simply make it smaller and paint it a rosy hue and they\u2019ll be unable to resist.",
    "I\u2019m not imagining a watch specifically for women either. Neutral colors and metallics are great, provided it's something that looks like something an adult could wear for all occasions. Is this something that you could reasonably wear to job interview, a nice dinner, or a friend's wedding?",
    "Some of the big companies are starting to take notice, and developing fitness trackers designed for people with an aversion to chunky plastic and silicone wearables. A few days ago, Fitbit launched its latest fitness tracker, the Fitbit Luxe. As the name implies, it\u2019s a classy looking device; although its basic shape is very similar to the Fitbit Inspire 2, it has a stainless steel case and buckle rather than plastic and, most interestingly, is available in a special edition version with a gold-toned bracelet designed by a jeweller.",
    "In a similar vein, Garmin recently launched the Garmin Lily \u2013 a fitness tracker designed for and by women, with a particularly thin band (silicone or leather) and a face measuring a mere 34.5mm across that\u2019s backlit with a patterned design that looks attractive even when switched off.",
    "Unfortunately, both of these devices have one major drawback: while they\u2019re great everyday fitness trackers, there\u2019s no on-board GPS, and certainly no advanced training tools like a virtual coach. If you\u2019re a runner who wants to train smarter, you\u2019re trading functionality for style and will need a second device when it's time for a workout.",
    "There are all-purpose smartwatches that may seem to fill this niche \u2013 things like the Apple Watch 6 and Apple Watch SE, or the Amazfit GTS 2 Mini \u2013 but again, these lack the sports-specific tools you\u2019d get from an unpretty Polar or Coros device, and they're not as attractive as the Lily or as slender as the Luxe.",
    "So what would such a watch be like? Well, first of all, GPS would be essential (on-board rather than connected) so routes can be mapped accurately without piggybacking on your phone, plus a dedicated running app for tracking metrics like distance, pace, speed, heart rate and cadence.",
    "Of course, size is a limiting factor; a small face is able to display much less information than the broad display of the Garmin Fenix 6, and on-screen mapping would be downright impractical on a super-small device.",
    "One alternative would be spoken directions, and voice instructions for training plans. Spoken-word training plans would be great too, as would the ability to hear your current pace and distance through wireless headphones with a quick tap, or hear advice from a coach if following a training plan.",
    "Similarly, voice controls would be an excellent feature. They're nothing new for smartwatches, and would be a handy supplement to a little touchscreen and/or physical buttons for performing common tasks.",
    "Some of the data you'd get on a full-scale sports watch may only be visible in the app, such as training load and recovery stats, which might be a little less convenient, but it's not the type of info you'll need while you're mid-workout.",
    "In short, there would certainly be some sacrifices necessary to make a true running watch that's more compact and mature in design, but perhaps the introduction of more fashion-forward fitness trackers in recent months means that such a device might not be too far off."
