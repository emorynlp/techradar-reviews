    "It looks likely that the Sony Xperia 1 III will be announced on April 14, but despite that date fast approaching, we haven\u2019t actually seen much of it yet. Now though, some case renders have given us a close look at the likely design.",
    "Olixar (a case maker) has listed a transparent case for the Sony Xperia 1 III on its site, and the accompanying images show the phone off from a variety of angles, highlighting the phone\u2019s rumored periscope camera, alongside other lenses.",
    "You can also see a tall, flat, likely 21:9 screen with a front-facing camera in a bezel at the top, a 3.5mm headphone port on the top edge, and a shortcut key on the right edge, along with the side-mounted fingerprint scanner and volume rocker.",
    "That key and some camera tweaks aside, it\u2019s a design that looks a lot like the Sony Xperia 1 II, as well as looking near identical to previously leaked images. So this is probably more or less what you can expect from the Sony Xperia 1 III \u2013 especially as there\u2019s a fair chance Olixar had access to the design early, in order to make this case.",
    "And it\u2019s not just the Sony Xperia 1 III that Olixar has shown off, as the company also has a case for the Sony Xperia 10 III, showing a triple-lens camera on the back, a tall, narrow screen on the front with a bezel above it, and a design that\u2019s seemingly identical to the Sony Xperia 10 II. This is a design that we\u2019ve also seen leaked previously.",
    "We would of course take these images with a pinch of salt for now, but one or both of these phones will likely be unveiled on April 14, so we should know how accurate these renders are soon.",
