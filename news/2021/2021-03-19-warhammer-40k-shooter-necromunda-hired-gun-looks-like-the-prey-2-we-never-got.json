    "Don't you just love it when a cool-looking game pops up out of nowhere? That's pretty much what's happened with Necromunda: Hired Gun, which was leaked on Twitter yesterday and officially revealed today.",
    "Developed by Streum On Studio (whose previous titles include E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy), Necromunda: Hired Gun is described in its Xbox Store listing as an \"an indie fast-paced, violent, and thrilling FPS set in the darkest reaches of Warhammer 40,000\u2019s most infamous hive city.\" The location was last seen in last year's Necromunda: Underhive Wars.",
    "A single-player, story-driven game (remember those?), Necromunda: Hired Gun lets you play as a merciless bounty hunter who takes on contracts to \"eliminate the most notorious gangsters and mutants\" in the city \u2013 sounds a bit like Human Head's original version of Prey 2 that was cancelled back in 2014.",
    "You won't be entirely alone on this adventure \u2013 you will also have a trusty cyber-mastiff accompanying you on missions, which can be used to \"sniff out and kill enemies for you\".",
    "Along with a \"sprawling arsenal\" of weapons to upgrade, you will have the option to apply \"a dozen customizable augments\" to your body that will allow you to run on walls, double-jump and more. And, much like last year's brilliant Doom Eternal, you will also have a grappling hook to aid in traversal.",
    "Available to pre-order from today, Necromunda: Hired Gun will release on June 1, 2021 for PS5, Xbox Series X and Series S, PS4, Xbox One and PC. You can check out the game's action-packed trailer below."
