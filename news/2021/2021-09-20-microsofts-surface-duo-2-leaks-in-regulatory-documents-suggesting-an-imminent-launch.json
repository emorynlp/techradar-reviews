  "article": [
    "Microsoft\u2019s Surface September 22 event is right around the corner, and we might just see the Surface Duo 2, the sequel to Microsoft\u2019s first Android phone, at the event, if a recently-released document from the US regulatory agency, the FCC, is anything to go by.",
    "The FCC document was spotted by Windows Central, pointing to recently published certification documents for the Android-based device. These documents were filed by Microsoft then approved and then released by the FCC on September 17. While we mostly expect to see laptops like the Surface Pro 8 at the event, the FCC filing describes a \"portable handset\", along with various mentions of \"flip and flat\u201d features, and that the device has been tested for hearing aid use (required for digital wireless phones). Plus, the firmware number is in the same format as the original Surface Duo.",
    "These documents not only seem to confirm the Surface Duo 2\u2019s existence, but that several features \u2013 including 5G, NFC, ultra-wideband (UWB) support, Wi-Fi 6, and \u201cWireless Power Transfer\u201d support \u2013 have been approved already. In regards to wireless support, it could possibly indicate Qi wireless charging compatibility, though Windows Central suggests it could instead refer to inductive charging for the Surface Pen.",
    "The reason being is the Surface Duo 2 may be too thin to include the Qi coil or deal with all the heat generated from it. Windows Central instead proposes that the documents could be implying a pen charging mechanism similar to the Apple iPad\u2019s inductive charging of its own Apple Pencil.",
    "Though expected through a leak earlier this year, this document doesn\u2019t show the Surface Duo 2 featuring a triple rear camera. However, we won\u2019t know what the device will actually look like until Microsoft actually comes out and reveals it \u2013 which may not even happen."
