    "If you've been patiently waiting for an Atari VCS release date, we finally have an answer, along with how much the retro-inspired system with modern sensibilities will cost.",
    "The Atari VCS is set to launch on June 15, and you can order the base-level model in Onyx for $299.99. You can also pick up an \u2018All-In\u2019 system bundle that comes with two controllers \u2013 the Classic Joystick and the Modern Controller \u2013 for $399.99.",
    "Unlike the base-level model, you have a choice of two color schemes if you opt for the All-In system: either Black Walnut or Onyx. You can also purchase each controller separately for $59.99, if you\u2019d prefer.",
    "The Atari VCS\u2019s design is inspired by the Atari 2600, and although it comes with 100 arcade and Atari 2600 games for owners to enjoy \u2013 including a subscription to Antstream Arcade's huge retro library \u2013 it can also function as a PC. It means the Atari VCS is rather versatile, and could be a rather snazzy multimedia machine. You can even use it for productivity tasks and install either Windows or Linux to turn it into a mini PC.",
    "The Atari VCS\u2019s dashboard is populated by the usual streaming services we\u2019ve become accustomed to, so expect to see the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but you\u2019ll also have access to a built-in Chrome browser and Google\u2019s suite of Workspace apps.",
    "Powering the Atari VCS is an AMD Ryzen processor, and the console is capable of 4K resolution, HDR and targets 60 frames per second. You can also expand the system\u2019s internal storage, and it comes with dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 and USB 3.0 support.",
    "It\u2019s hard to see the Atari VCS appealing to anyone but a niche group of consumers, as it\u2019s unlikely to topple the likes of the PS5, Xbox Series X or Nintendo Switch anytime soon. However, that\u2019s not the console\u2019s intention, as Atari VCS COO Michael Artz previously said he hopes the console could provide consumers something different to PS5 and Xbox Series X, specifically for those \u201cwho may be weary of the iterative nature of the console wars something different to consider.\u201d",
    "The Atari VCS is only available to purchase via GameStop, Best Buy, Micro Center, and the official Atari VCS website. The console isn\u2019t available in Europe, though the company has said it could release the device in more territories if there is demand."
