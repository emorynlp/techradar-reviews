    "If you want a phone that can last then Samsung might have just the handset for you, as it\u2019s unveiled the Samsung Galaxy M12, a phone with a 6,000mAh battery.",
    "What can you do with a 6,000mAh battery? According to Samsung you can browse the internet for up to 24 hours, or watch up to 23 hours of video, or listen to music for up to 110 hours (which is almost five days). So at the very least, this should be one of those rare phones that doesn\u2019t need charging daily.",
    "Elsewhere the Samsung Galaxy M12 is less impressive but still sounds reasonable. It has a 6.5-inch 720 x 1600 LCD screen, up to 6GB of RAM, up to 128GB of storage, and an unnamed 2GHz octa-core chipset.",
    "There\u2019s also a quad-lens camera, with a 48MP f/2.0 main snapper, a 5MP f/2.2 ultra-wide one, a 2MP f/2.4 macro one, and a 2MP f/2.4 depth one. The front-facing camera meanwhile is 8MP, and other features include 15W charging, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm headphone port, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.",
    "So all in all the Samsung Galaxy M12 sounds like a low-end to lower mid-range phone, and it certainly looks like one, with a large bezel below the screen, a notch at the top, and a back that\u2019s described as \u2018metallic\u2019 but looks like it\u2019s probably plastic.",
    "Still, that means it should be affordable, though so far it\u2019s only been launched in Vietnam. It\u2019s not clear yet where else the Samsung Galaxy M12 will land, but we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s more widely available soon. At the very least it looks likely to come to India.",
