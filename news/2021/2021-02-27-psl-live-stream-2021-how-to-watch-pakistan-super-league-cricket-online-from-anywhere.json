Follow our guide to watch a 2021 PSL live stream and catch every match of the new Pakistan Super League cricket season, no matter where you are in the world today - including absolutely free in host nation Pakistan.",
    "As before, six teams are in contention for the PSL Spirit Trophy in 2021, with Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalandars, Islamabad United, Multan Sultans, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators all set to play each other twice this season in T20 action. A win is worth two points, a no-result earns each team one, and the losing side obviously gets nothing.",
    "The top four finishers then qualify for the playoffs, where the top two play in the Qualifier, and the teams that finish in third and fourth meet in the Eliminator. The winner of the Qualifier qualifies for the final, while the loser plays the winner of the Eliminator for the remaining spot.",
    "Because of Covid-19, all 34 games that make up the 2021 Pakistan Super League season are being played at the National Stadium in Karachi and Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore - which may just give the Kings, the Qalanders and the Gladiators something of an advantage.",
    "Some of the star players taking part this year include Pakistan captain Babar Azam (Kings), West Indies star Chris Gayle (Gladiators) and Afghan spin sensation Rashid Khan (Qalanders). Read on as we explain how to get a PSL live stream and watch every Pakistan Super League cricket match online wherever you are in the world right now, starting with the best - a free PSL live stream for anyone in Pakistan!",
    "f you're outside your country of residence - whether that be Pakistan or anywhere else - and try to start streaming PSL cricket via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions."
