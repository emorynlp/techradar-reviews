    "The stage is well and truly set for clay specialist Rafael Nadal to try and surpass Federer's record of 20 grand slam single titles, with - as ever - Men's world No. 1 Novak Djokovic looking like the most likely contender to stop him following his victory at February's Australian Open.",
    "Or will it finally be time for one of the new breed like Alexander Zverev or Stefanos Tsitsipas to step out of the shadows. Those two meet in the other men's semi on Friday.",
    "Iga Swiatek stole the show in the Women's draw last year, but the Polish youngster has fallen early this time around - alongside the likes of Serena, Naomi and Ashleigh (for varying reasons, of course).",
    "That means the race for the Suzanne-Lenglen Cup has been blown wide open. The semi-finals are dominated by Eastern Europe, with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Tamara Zidan\u0161ek and Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 all making it through to their first Grand Slam round of four.

    "Australia - Channel 9 and 9Now streaming service",
    "If you're abroad during the French Open, you'll likely find you're unable to access your domestic tennis coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you swerve around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred Roland Garros live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use - allow us to explain more.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a 2021 French Open live stream from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone."
