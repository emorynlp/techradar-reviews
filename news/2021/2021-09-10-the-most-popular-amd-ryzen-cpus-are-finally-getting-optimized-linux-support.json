    "The latest AMD driver has posted patches to the Linux kernel that\u2019ll enable users to get better per watt performance from their AMD Zen-based CPUs.",
    "According to Phoronix, the drivers currently support processors powered by the Zen 3 microarchitecture, such as the Ryzen 5000 desktop processors, as well as the Epyc server processors.",
    "\u201cWe would like to introduce a new AMD CPU frequency control mechanism as the \"amd-pstate\" driver for modern AMD Zen based CPU series in Linux Kernel,\u201d wrote Rui Huang, senior member of the technical staff at AMD.",
    "The new AMD-PSTATE driver reportedly promises to bring the same level of optimizations to Zen 3 processors that Intel's P-State driver has been delivering for Intel CPUs for a long time.",
    "Unlike the generic ACPI CPUFreq driver, the new AMD-PSTATE uses ACPI Collaborative Processor Performance Controls (CPPC) to help make better performance state decisions to maximise performance with a minimal energy footprint.",
    "According to Phoronix, AMD first introduced an optimized CPPC-based driver back in July 2019, just as the company was about to unveil its Zen 2 microarchitecture.",
    "However, the effort never made it into the kernel, and was eventually abandoned, supposedly because of a \u201clack of resources\u201d at AMD.",
    "While the ACPI CPPC support originated with the Zen 2 processors, the current AMD-PSTATE driver currently limits itself to Zen 3 processors only. However, Phoronix reports that AMD has promised to extend their coverage to cover not just upcoming processors, but also older ones such as those based on Zen 2.",
