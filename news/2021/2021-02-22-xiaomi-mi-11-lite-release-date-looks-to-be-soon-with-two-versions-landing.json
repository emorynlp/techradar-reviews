    "Since the Xiaomi Mi 11 launched we\u2019ve seen a growing number of leaks about a Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite, and now it looks like the phone could be about to land \u2013 in both 4G and 5G versions.",
    "Both 4G and 5G versions of a phone believed to be the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite have now been certified in Singapore. That\u2019s a process they\u2019d need to go through before launching there, and it\u2019s usually something that happens shortly before launch, meaning the Mi 11 Lite might be announced soon.",
    "The certification \u2013 spotted by PriceBaba \u2013 doesn\u2019t reveal much else, but the mention of both 4G and 5G models might have solved one of the mysteries surrounding the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite.",
    "You see, so far two different sources have been behind most of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite leaks, and the details they\u2019ve shared don\u2019t line up, with the most notable difference being that one source claimed the phone would have a Snapdragon 755G chipset, and the other said it would have a Snapdragon 732G chipset.",
    "The 755G is expected to be capable of 5G (though it hasn\u2019t been announced yet), while the 732G is only capable of 4G, so there\u2019s a good chance that the 5G model of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite will get the former, while the 4G model gets the latter. In other words, both sources might be right.",
    "Other leaked specs include an OLED screen, a 64MP main camera and a 5x telephoto zoom camera for the 5G version, while the 4G model of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite might have a triple-lens camera with 64MP, 8MP and 5MP sensors, a Full HD+ LCD screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage.",
    "We\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt for now, but at least the revelation that there\u2019s two models on the way makes these various specs more convincing. Given that both versions have now been certified in some regions too (with the 4G model previously being certified in India), we\u2019ll hopefully get an official look at the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite soon.",
