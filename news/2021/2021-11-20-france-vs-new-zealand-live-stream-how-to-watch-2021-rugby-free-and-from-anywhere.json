    "The All Blacks' tour of the Northern Hemisphere has featured record-breaking points hauls and a brief return to the top of the world rankings, but there's a real danger it could end on a damp note with Les Bleus eyeing up a scalp on home soil. This should be a belter, so read on as our guide explains how to get a France vs New Zealand live stream and watch the Autumn International rugby match online today - including where you can watch absolutely free.",
    "Led by Antoine Dupont, the sensational player of the year in-waiting, France are one of the most exciting teams on the planet right now. And Beauden Barrett's injury status gives them a really good shot at their first victory over the All Blacks since 2009.",
    "Fabien Galthie's men warmed up with wins over humdrum opposition in Argentina and Georgia, but they've had an eye on this one all along. The shiny new dual-playmaker setup with Matthieu Jalibert and Romain Ntamack is still being bedded in, but its first real challenge comes now.",
    "Ireland edged the Kiwis in a thriller of a game last weekend, and today's game presents a real test of character for Ian Foster's men, particularly considering their main man's absence.",
    "It looks like it could go either way on paper, so follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a rugby live stream, including ways that you can watch France vs New Zealand for FREE.",
    "The great news for rugby fans is that there are a few ways to live stream France vs New Zealand for free, depending on where you're based.",
    "In France, the game is being shown on free-to-air channel France 2, which you can also live stream online after registering an account on the platform. Coverage begins at 8.45pm local time, ahead of a 9pm kick-off.",
    "A whole host of services will also let new users tune in via a free trial, including Amazon Prime Video in the UK, Stan Sport in Australia, and DAZN in Canada - more on those below...",
    "If you're abroad right now and try to stream the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to watch rugby from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from France, just head to the France 2 website"
