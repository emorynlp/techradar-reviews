  "article": [
    "How can a camera change the way you see the world? This is the foundational question of photography, but also an increasing number of photo-centric games, including the much-anticipated PS5 and PC road trip adventure Season.",
    "Season is part of a recent wave of games that make photography their cornerstone, rather than a tacked-on bonus mode. Some, such as Umurangi Generation, present the past-time as an urban artform, a tool to reclaim space through documentation. Others, like the classic Japanese horror game Fatal Frame, use the camera as a weapon, one capable of dispelling demonic presences.",
    "But as members of the Season development team told us in an exclusive interview, their game is different. It's a quieter, more contemplative title that rewards careful observation. And its virtual camera, rooted in the meditative charms of film photography, is designed to foster an intimacy between the player and environment.",
    "In Season's reveal trailer, we see a young protagonist cycling around a beautiful Studio Ghibli-esque world. \u201cOur grandparents lived for a thousand years, and our parents had a century to themselves,\u201d she says wistfully. \u201cBut us, we have one season.\u201d",
    "The world, as she knows it, is on the verge of collapse, and in order to make the very most of its last days, she sets off on a bike with the goal of recording its beauty. We catch a glimpse of a sketchbook filled with drawings of a ruinous monument, a tape recorder capturing the delicate sound of a dragonfly\u2019s wings, and, most importantly, a camera directed at a bright-eyed primate.",
    "\u201cEverything in the game is about what photography is about,'' says creative director and writer on Season, Kevin Sullivan. \u201cWhat it means to take a photo, what it says about the photographer, the fact that we can freeze time into images, these incomplete glimpses of the past. It\u2019s so much in line with the themes we\u2019re trying to show the player,\u201d he adds.",
    "Season, developed by Montreal-based studio Scavengers, has been worked on in one capacity or another since 2016, when it was just an idea of Sullivan\u2019s inspired by his travels in south-east Asia. Before anything had even been programmed, he created video essays for the team, and even a functional board game to demonstrate how it might work in practice.",
    "Now that the game\u2019s production is in full swing, its form is a little clearer. There\u2019s a world to explore filled with people to talk to, and of course, a bicycle to get around. At various points you\u2019ll be able to pull out your camera to document your surroundings \u2013 animals, certainly, and panoramic vistas, but architecture and graffiti, all of which impart something special about the place before the \u201cmysterious cataclysm washes everything away.\u201d",
    "In fact, the photography in Season has changed a great deal since its initial 2020 trailer. Camera aficionados may spot a machine that resembles a retro Bolex-style video camera (above), but this has morphed into a more straightforward film camera, says Stephen Tucker, senior VFX artist.",
    "What hasn\u2019t changed, he explains, is an emphasis on \u201colder forms\u201d of documentation. A keen photographer, he mentions his own Polaroid camera, the pleasing artifacts that emerge from using vintage film with an analogue camera and the relative \u201clack of control\u201d if offers. \u201cYou won\u2019t have a zoom range from 10mm to 300mm or something,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're going to have to roughly stand in the place that you need to stand in to take the photo that you want.\u201d The aim ultimately, he says, is to create a device that feels \u201ctextural.\u201d",
    "Tucker isn\u2019t the only photography enthusiast on the Season development team. Sullivan\u2019s father was an aerial photographer, which meant his family\u2019s basement was essentially a gigantic dark room. Then, at college, he started to get interested in the processing of analogue film while working on friends\u2019 Super 16mm and 35mm movie projects.",
    "There\u2019s also Irwin Chiu Hau, 3D programmer on Season, who once worked as a professional photographer at weddings. He has his own collection of DSLRs and now takes landscape and macro photography for pleasure. The latter, essentially extreme close-up photography, feeds directly into Season. \u201cThere's a lot of little things in the world to shoot,\" Chiu Hau says tantalizingly.",
    "But outside of real-world devices, earlier video games have helped shape Season\u2019s in-game camera.",
    "Tucker references the 1980s disposable camera used in the first-person drama 2016 Firewatch. In that game you get to snap the beautiful Wyoming forest and mountains, coated, at various points, in radiant orange sun. Another is 2017\u2019s first-person adventure What Remains of Edith Finch?, which gives players an old-school camera for the duration of a rainy hunting trip. \u201cI love the feel of the cameras in both of those games,\u201d says Tucker.",
    "Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch? arrived before video game photography as an in-game mechanic became really popular. More recently, Sludge Life and the award-winning Umurangi Generation have cast players as photographers in distinct cyberpunk futures. And just a few months ago, cult classic Pok\u00e9mon Snap made its long-awaited return for players excited to pap their favorite made-up critters.",
    "There are also two titles on the horizon which promise to add their own spin to the burgeoning micro-genre. Toem is a cute-looking adventure featuring anthropomorphic characters, while Martha Is Dead (above) takes the camera into altogether spookier territory with its 1940s Italian horror story.",
    "Photography as a mechanic is seemingly in rude health, but none of these games quite offer the stirring, melancholic beauty of Season \u2013 the sense that the present is slipping through our fingers and must be commemorated in some way.",
    "Still, regardless of tone and mood, what each of these games offer is a way of interacting with the world that doesn\u2019t involve blowing it or its inhabitants up.",
    "The camera can be a useful way of structuring gaze \u2013 of giving the simple act of looking a mechanical dimension for players who are keen to always do something.",
    "Perhaps most importantly, it\u2019s an action that\u2019s intuitive for most people thanks to the extent to which smartphones have popularized the pastime. Everyone knows what to do, in other words. \u201cThe moment you take a camera out, you start to compose,\u201d says Chiu Hau, \u201cyou start to frame the subject.\u201d",
    "While photography is increasingly folded into the gameplay of indie titles, for many blockbusters it exists as a discrete 'photo mode', separate to the game itself. All the player needs to do is pause the action at a particularly captivating moment and begin composing their shot.",
    "In popular, eye-catching action titles such as Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, and The Last of Us Part II, there\u2019s almost an entire post-production suite folded into their photo modes, from lighting, focus, to field of view. Often, there are options to change the environment, including the time of day, weather, and even actual props in the shot.",
    "While these tools are newly flexible, they\u2019re part of a tradition that's nearly as old as gaming itself \u2013 that of so-called 'screenshotting', the forebear of modern video game photography.",
    "Throughout the pandemic, Tucker says he\u2019s been enjoying blockbuster video games as a means of vicarious travel, photographing his way through their stories and worlds as if he were on one of his own adventure holidays.",
    "The lush vegetation and striking ruinous environments of The Last of Us Part II have offered a worthy subject, so much so that he's started printing out in-game photos using the Instax Mini Link.",
    "For Sullivan, Season itself has manifested in the real world during the difficult past eighteen months. \u201cI\u2019ve been bike-riding around Montreal and taking pictures in an effort to try and learn more about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s an odd back and forth between the things we do influencing the game and feeling influenced by the game itself \u2013 just in certain pursuits and paying attention. Season feels like it\u2019s bled into my actual life more than I\u2019d anticipated it would when I started.\u201d",
    "Sullivan\u2019s own experiences are precisely what\u2019s appealing about Season and its in-game photography. Players looking for all of the bells and whistles of 'photo modes' may end up disappointed, and will those hoping for all the controls of a modern DSLR.",
    "But those keen to experience the emotional essence of photography \u2013 specifically, the simplicity and immediacy of an analogue camera format \u2013 should be well served. By giving players a tool of the past, Season may provoke an entirely new perspective on the world."
