Read on below we explain how you can watch Judas and the Black Messiah online and stream the movie on HBO Max today.",
    "Hampton was just 21 when he was shot and killed at point-blank range as he slept in his bed, by the FBI and Chicago Police Department, who had targeted him as part of an effort to silence his calls for social change - but to bring him down they needed a mole.",
    "In exchange for cash and being let off the hook for a series of petty crimes, William O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield) agreed to infiltrate the Black Panther Party (BPP) on behalf of the FBI and its chief J. Edgar Hoover, who was willing to use whatever means necessary to snuff out the movement that Hampton had helped to foster.",
    "As well as rising through the ranks of the party O'Neal grew close to Hampton, who was at the time the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the BPP and a founder of the multicultural Rainbow Coalition, which had successfully united a diverse array of oppressed communities across the political spectrum.",
    "However, with the launch of an outrageous disinformation campaign and the help of O'Neal, the FBI - led by agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) - actively encouraged violence between the BPP and other radical organizations, and killed Hampton during an early-morning raid, after he'd been drugged.",
    "They could murder the man, but they couldn't eradicate his legacy. Follow our guide below to watch Judas and the Black Messiah online and stream the HBO Max exclusive right now - it leaves the service on March 14, so don't delay!",
