  "article": [
    "Pok\u00e9mon Unite \u2013 the hit new Pok\u00e9mon spin-off game \u2013 is out now on smartphones and Nintendo Switch consoles, having launched on iOS and Android a couple of months after its Switch debut.",
    "This new MOBA title is unlike pretty much anything we've seen from the Pok\u00e9mon franchise before, offering plenty for both old and new fans to enjoy.",
    "We've rounded up everything you need to know about Pok\u00e9mon Unite, including what it is, how to download it and which Pok\u00e9mon are the best ones for your team.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Unite is a new MOBA starring many of your favorite monsters from the main series games. If you\u2019re used to playing games like League of Legends or DOTA 2 you\u2019ll be familiar with how MOBAs work; if not, here\u2019s a quick rundown of Pok\u00e9mon Unite.",
    "Unite is a 5v5 multiplayer match that\u2019s all about battling. By defeating wild and opposing Pok\u00e9mon you gain points that can be scored by dunking them into your opponent\u2019s goal. Whichever team has scored the most points by the end of the match wins.",
    "While this is a change from the traditional gameplay of the franchise, familiar moves and evolutions make a return (but in a slightly new way). For one, all those type matchups you\u2019ve spent years memorising mean nothing \u2013 Charizard is just as hurt by grass type moves as they are water.",
    "Additionally evolution is not permanent, meaning every match you\u2019ll have to level up you Gabite, Charmander and Fletchling to get them back to their strongest forms.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Unite is now available on iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch. To download the game you\u2019ll need an internet connection and access to the App Store, Google Play Store or Nintendo eShop respectively.",
    "The download comes in at just under 1GB (928MB according to the game\u2019s official website). That isn\u2019t too much space at all, so you almost certainly have space for it on your device.",
    "It\u2019s completely free to download too, so if you\u2019re interested in giving it a try there\u2019s really no reason not to.",
    "Much like other MOBAs, Pok\u00e9mon Unite will have a weekly rotating pool of six free Pok\u00e9mon you can play with in matches, but if you want to be the very best like no one ever was you might want to unlock some permanently so you learn all of their strategies.",
    "When you start Pok\u00e9mon Unite you can earn one Pok\u00e9mon for free out of Charizard, Pikachu, Eldergoss, Snorlax or Talonflame. After that you\u2019ll have to buy Pok\u00e9mon using in-game currency or through free unlock challenges.",
    "By levelling up you can unlock two new buddies. At level two you get Slowbro and at level five you get Venusaur. Beginners can take part in a series of daily quests to unlock Crustle (but only within your first 30 days of starting the game).",
    "If you\u2019re on mobile you can also take part in an event right now to win 32 battles and unlock Zeraora.",
    "Finally, there\u2019s a 14-day Welcome gift event that rewards you for playing every day for two weeks. If you get all the rewards you\u2019ll also unlock Alolan Ninetails, Cinderace, and Greninja.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Unite won\u2019t just give you every Pok\u00e9mon for free as explained above, so before you spend your hard-earned credits you might want to know which Pok\u00e9mon are worth it. Here\u2019s our breakdown of tier lists for each category",
    "Attacker tier list",
    "Unsurprisingly, Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s mascot would appear at the top of its tier list. It\u2019s range lets you deal damage from afar and its variety of attacks make it perfect for crowd control. Cramorant is decent too, you just have to be accurate with your moves and know when to use them.",
    "Venusaur and Greninja sit near the bottom due to their limited usefulness -Venusaur is great near the match\u2019s start and Greninja by the end. Both come with some increased risk, but if you can coordinate with your team, you might have a winning strategy on your side.",
    "Defender tier list",
    "Crustle, Blastoise, and Snorlax are all fairly decent picks that are hard to choose between. Crustle can slow attackers down, Blastoise can pack a punch back and Snorlax can heal up without having to retreat.",
    "Slowbro, while still decent, ends up on the bottom by virtue of not being the other three, but its abilities are still good. If you aren\u2019t interested in playing defender often this free \u2018mon is the only one you need.",
    "Speedster tier list",
    "Gengar can take a little time to power up, but once it has Levitate, Dream Eater and Hex, your opponent is in for a fright. It truly puts the speed in speedster.",
    "Zeraora and Absol are fairly good choices too with good offensive capabilities that make them forces to be reckoned with, especially when they show up to aid an ally.",
    "Supporter tier list",
    "Blissey and Mr Mime offer great support and can stick around for the long haul thanks to their great endurance stats. Mr Mime can be tricky to master, and Blissey won\u2019t be able to fight back on its own, but as long as you stick with an ally you should be fine.",
    "Eldegoss is very well-rounded and a great choice if you\u2019re only playing support because no one else is. You\u2019ll be able to lend a hand in more ways than one if you use its abilities correctly.",
    "All-rounder tier list",
    "For All-rounders, Machamp\u2019s powerful fists make it an ally you\u2019d rather have on your team than against you. Even at lower evolution stages it\u2019s fairly strong and once its unite move unlocks you\u2019ll be able to boosts its stats right up to make it an absolute tank.",
    "Lucario is a close second, aided by the fact they don\u2019t need to evolve, but Garchomp and Charizard are lower because they can take a little longer to reach their full potential - limiting their early match usefulness."
