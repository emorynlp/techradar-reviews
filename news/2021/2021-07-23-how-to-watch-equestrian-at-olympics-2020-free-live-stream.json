    "In the Olympics, some nations consistently outrank others - a prime example of this is Germany in equestrian sport. The gap between Germany and its competitors is simply astronomical. One look at the country\u2019s medals and you\u2019ll see it - 25 gold, 13 silver, and 14 bronze.",

She has participated in the Olympics five times since 1992 and, at 52, she\u2019ll be competing again. But she\u2019ll likely face fierce competition from Great Britain\u2019s Charlotte Dujardin, who bagged gold at the 2016 and 2012 Olympics in the individual dressage event.",
