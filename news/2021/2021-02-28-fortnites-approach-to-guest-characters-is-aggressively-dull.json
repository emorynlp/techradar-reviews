  "article": [
    "There\u2019s no denying the monolithic success of Fortnite Battle Royale. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the mode once considered ancillary to Save the World \u2013 Fortnite\u2019s co-op-centric horde mode that pitted players against waves of zombies \u2013 eclipsed it in no time at all.",
    "In the years since, Fortnite has surpassed other battle royale giants like PUBG to become the undisputed leader in terms of player numbers, revenue and in-game events. It's a shame, then, that its crossover events with other franchises feel woefully tacked on.",
    "In the long term, Epic Games' commitment to guest character inclusion in Fortnite usually ends up being a total misrepresentation of whoever\u2019s in the spotlight at the time. Usually, these boil down to a character skin or two and a brief marketing window, nothing that will shake up Fortnite's status quo.",
    "Fortnite\u2019s history with crossover content dates back almost three years at this point. Its first big collaboration was with Marvel to promote Avengers: Infinity War. In this event, a player lucky enough to find the iconic Infinity Gauntlet could transform into Thanos, the primary villain of the latter Avengers movies.",
    "It was an interesting way for Epic to test the waters on future crossover events. The event was only available for a limited time, and it provided a unique, somewhat refreshing spin on the Fortnite formula in the form of a powerful and player-controlled threat on the map.",
    "Fortnite continued to work with Marvel, offering skins of beloved characters like Iron Man, Captain America and Captain Marvel to name but a few, and these represented perhaps the peak of Fortnite\u2019s crossover potential, as Chapter 2: Season 4 implemented a swathe of map changes alongside unique Marvel-themed items and powers.",
    "It got more interesting when Epic Games went on to throw DC characters into the mix. Aquaman, Batman, The Flash et al are able to join the fray alongside or against Marvel\u2019s best, technically making Fortnite the first official Marvel vs. DC crossover game. There is a problem with that, though, as I\u2019ll get into later.",
    "Things only grew increasingly puzzling from there. Fortnite began to pepper in crossovers and obtainable guest character skins from a plethora of different franchises in the following years. Many felt right at home on Fortnite\u2019s chaotic, ever-changing island map, including Marvel\u2019s own Deadpool, whose manic fourth-wall-breaking charm fit effortlessly into the game\u2019s mayhem.",
    "Others still felt incredibly bizarre. Additions like NFL players, God of War\u2019s Kratos and Street Fighter\u2019s Ryu and Chun-Li all feel remarkably out of place wielding weapons largely based on real-world guns.",
    "I have to admit that if I was a child watching all this crossover chaos unfold, I would be beside myself with joy. Fortnite has intentionally marketed itself as a giant interactive toy box with its scattershot approach to crossovers. There\u2019s something undeniably appealing about watching Stranger Things\u2019 Hopper mow down The Joker with a minigun.",
    "Yet therein lies the issue \u2013 these lovable characters barely do anything that is distinctly associated with them. They act like any other outfit you can obtain in Fortnite, albeit originating from recognizable third-party brands. Some are graced with unique emotes at least, such as Chun-Li\u2019s Lightning Kick and She-Hulk\u2019s transformation. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t see these guest appearances as anything other than a cynical cash grab.",
    "For the sake of comparison, let\u2019s look at another game that heavily features guest characters as paid downloadable content, that being Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. What does Smash do right that Fortnite doesn\u2019t? Well, the key is in how these characters are represented.",
    "Since Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the Wii, the series has had a steady focus on the inclusion of characters outside of Nintendo\u2019s purview. Brawl kicked off the insanity in 2008 with Sonic the Hedgehog and Metal Gear\u2019s Solid Snake.",
    "2018\u2019s Super Smash Bros. Ultimate exploded in terms of guest content. Since that game\u2019s launch, characters like Joker from Persona 5, Steve from Minecraft and Final Fantasy VII\u2019s infamous villain Sephiroth all made playable appearances.",
    "Each of these characters is celebrated in Smash with painstaking attention to detail. Each features moves and abilities recognizable from their games of origin, and they\u2019re always paired with a stage showcasing the game or series they\u2019re from, alongside a suite of music tracks.",
    "Smash, alongside other crossover-happy games like SoulCalibur 6 and Tekken 7 shows how a developer can elevate a game by handling guest content with care. These games speak to something bigger than the individual characters \u2013 they are representing what makes those franchises so special and why people love them to this day.",
    "Meanwhile, Fortnite\u2019s approach to guest characters smacks of throwing wads of cash at whatever\u2019s popular at the moment. Given Fortnite\u2019s insane success, Epic certainly has the financial power to do this. Sadly, the game time and again chooses a flavor-of-the-month junk food approach, just because it can.",
    "I want to see Epic do better with its guest inclusions in Fortnite. It has the resources and manpower to be able to do so. I don\u2019t want to play as Master Chief because \u201coh, hey, that\u2019s Master Chief. I like Master Chief.\u201d I want to play as him because I love Halo as a whole and want to be reminded of what makes that series so good in the first place. If I\u2019m playing as Master Chief, I want movement to feel swift but decidedly heavy. I want to hear those shields pop when I\u2019m low on health, ringing out that iconic warning klaxon.",
    "A 'less is more' approach could work wonders here. Fortnite could really benefit from featuring less crossovers with more content in each one. How cool would it be if Chun-Li could perform her iconic Lightning Kick attack to knock down structures in place of the familiar pickaxe?",
    "How about a Halo themed event period where we can see the iconic ring on the horizon, with Covenant ships frequently flying over the island for an extra layer of fan immersion? To its credit, the actual Halo event did feature a recreation of the classic Blood Gulch map, but it was locked behind Fortnite\u2019s Creative Mode and wasn\u2019t hugely substantial.",
    "If they\u2019d have thrown in event-specific items and weapons like Overshields and Halo\u2019s iconic arsenal, paired with that goosebump-inducing main theme, you\u2019ve got a winner of a collab in my book.",
    "The problem here, of course, is that Fortnite is a very different game compared to the likes of Super Smash Bros. Fortnite operates as a live service \u2013 a game that is being constantly updated with new content.",
    "The quick turnover of Fortnite\u2019s Battle Pass system leaves more substantial events with little room in the spotlight. Instead of giving crossover content more room to breathe, Fortnite is trapped in the perpetual live service cycle, ready to swap out content based on whatever the zeitgeist is.",
    "As such, I\u2019ve grown so very tired of Fortnite\u2019s approach to crossover content, even when it\u2019s representing characters and series I actually love. The bitesize nature of these inclusions feel like they come and go in a flash with little fanfare. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what guest characters are supposed to achieve.",
    "While I\u2019ll always remember Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as the game that let me beat up Sephiroth with Terry Bogard in front of a Minecraft village, I\u2019m worried that Fortnite\u2019s legacy will be buried in a veritable heap of forgettable crossovers that the game could have done so much more with."
