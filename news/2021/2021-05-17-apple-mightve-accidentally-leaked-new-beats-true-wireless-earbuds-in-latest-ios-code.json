  "article": [
    "We could be getting a new pair of Beats true wireless earbuds sometime in the near future \u2013 in fact, we\u2019d say it\u2019s almost definitely going to happen.",
    "How can we be so sure? Information on the previously unannounced Beats Studio Buds appeared today in Apple\u2019s latest beta software for tvOS and iOS. There\u2019s even images of them in three different colors: red, white and black.",
    "The earbuds were spotted by Apple-focused publications MacRumors and 9to5Mac, both of which discovered images and animations for the new models.",
    "According to the information discovered by the outlets, the Beats Studio Buds will support active noise cancellation and will use silicone eartips instead of hard plastic like the Apple AirPods. That said, the Studio Buds won\u2019t feature earhooks like the Powerbeats Pro that was released two years ago and, from what we can see, might utilize the same shorter nozzle that the AirPods Pro uses.",
    "Apple has yet to publicly confirm the existence of the earbuds, but considering a leak of this size it feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before it does.",
    "For a random Monday, Apple\u2019s had a mixed day for news: First, it announced that Apple Music would soon offer lossless audio and hi-res audio format music to subscribers at no extra cost\u2026except, according to Apple itself, it won\u2019t work on the Apple AirPods Max.",
    "That would\u2019ve been enough Apple news to fill an afternoon, but now we\u2019ve discovered the existence of the Beats Studio Buds on top of that.",
    "The good news \u2013 for Apple at least \u2013 is that outside of the images, the animations and some key features of the Beats Studio Buds, we don\u2019t have every detail. Nowhere in the source code did it say how much the earbuds will cost or when they\u2019re due out on store shelves.",
    "Our guess is that they\u2019ll sit somewhere above the Beats Powerbeats Pro in price \u2013 potentially between $200 and $249 (\u00a3140 and \u00a3219 or AU$270 and AU$349) \u2013 and will be available sometime in the next two months. With WWDC 2021 just a few weeks away Apple could make an announcement there \u2013 but we\u2019ll report back if we hear anything beforehand."
