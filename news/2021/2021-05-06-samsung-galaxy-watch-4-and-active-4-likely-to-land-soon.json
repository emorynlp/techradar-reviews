    "We\u2019ve been expecting the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 or the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4 - or perhaps both - to land before too long, and now it looks like we will indeed see both soon.",
    "Tech journalist Nils Ahrensmeier claims that they\u2019re both coming soon, and also revealed the sizes they might be available in. Apparently, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 will come in 42mm and 46mm sizes, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4 will come in 40mm and 42mm sizes.",
    "That would mean both sizes of the Galaxy Watch 4 are 1mm bigger than the options on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, while the smallest Galaxy Watch Active 4 size would be the same as its predecessor, but the largest size would be 2mm smaller.",
    "We would however take this with a pinch of salt, not least because having only 2mm between the two Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4 sizes seems a bit strange.",
    "There are no other details here, aside from model numbers, but it\u2019s worth noting that Ahrensmeier specifically referred to the Galaxy Watch Active 4, rather than the Watch Active 3, adding to the evidence that Samsung will skip the number three for this range to bring it in line with the Galaxy Watch numbering.",
    "Previous leaks suggested that we\u2019d see at least one of these watches between now and the end of June, and that looks ever more likely with this latest leak, but we\u2019re still not sure exactly when Samsung\u2019s next wearables will emerge.",
    "Whenever they land, though, we could be in for a big change from their predecessors, with reports suggesting that one or both of them will run Wear OS rather than Tizen.",
