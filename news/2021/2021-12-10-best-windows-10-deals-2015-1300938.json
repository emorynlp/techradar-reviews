    "If you\u2019re thinking of buying Windows 10, whether it's for that new PC you\u2019re building, a Mac you\u2019d like to install a Windows operating system in, or an older computer you\u2019d like to upgrade, we can help.",
    "Despite Windows 11 now being available, there are still Windows users who remain true to its predecessor, and for good reason. Barely anyone has upgraded to Windows 11, due to its TPM requirements, compatibility issues, and even slowdowns. And, if you\u2019re trying to upgrade from an older OS, getting the best supported version of Windows (which remains Windows 10) will make your computer a lot more secure. After all, if you\u2019re running an older version such as Windows 8, you\u2019re vulnerable to all sorts of security issues. And, now that the deadline for the free update has come and gone, you\u2019ll have to hunt for a good price to make that upgrade.",
    "To make things easy, we\u2019ve collected the best deals out there so you can get Windows 10 without spending too much money. That way, you also get to experience speedier performance, Cortana assistance, and crucial security features.",
    "Whether you just want to upgrade an older computer, are building a new one, or have a nice laptop that needs it, you\u2019ll need to buy a copy of Windows 10. We\u2019re keeping tabs on the latest prices, however, so you can find the best deal available on this version of Microsoft\u2019s OS.",
    "You may still be running your computer on Windows 7 or 8, and if so now's the time to buy Windows 10. This isn't just a performance update, Windows 10 brings new features and security settings to your machine that are crucial to getting your work done in today's operating systems. From the ease of the Cortana assistant to the speed boost you'll notice instantly, upgrading your older system to Windows 10 will be well worth your while.",
    "The perfect version of Windows for home users",
    "Windows 10 Home is the version that most people will need. It's for home use and includes game streaming from Xbox One and other consumer features like Cortana, as well as Windows Hello for logging into your PC via a fingerprint scanner or your face. If Windows 8 was the steepest learning curve imaginable, Windows 10 is like meeting a great friend you once knew again - it's just that they've bought some new clothes of which you really do approve. If you're looking to buy Windows 10 Home today, you'll find some excellent offers to save you some cash below.",
    "Go Pro if you think it's worth paying more for the Pro features",
    "Buy Windows 10 Pro if you need the extra security and management improvements over the Home version above. It includes Hyper-V for virtualization, BitLocker whole disk encryption, enterprise mode IE, Remote Desktop, a version of the Windows Store for your own business and assigned access (which locks a PC to running only one modern application, to use like a kiosk). Network admins can also schedule updates so they don't happen at important times.",
    "Another reason you might want to buy Windows 10 is you want to install the operating system on an Apple Mac computer. You can install Windows 10 on a Mac that is no older than 2015 by using Boot Camp Assistant, Apple's own utility. You will need between 64GB and 128GB of free storage space on your computer, as well as an external USB flash drive with at least 16GB of space in certain instances. Find out more about installing Windows 10 on a Mac via Apple Support. Once installed, you'll be able to switch between Mac OS and Windows 10 when you start up your computer.",
