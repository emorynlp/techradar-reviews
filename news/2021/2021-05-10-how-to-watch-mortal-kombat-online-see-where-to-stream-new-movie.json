    "Whether you're looking to indulge your childhood gaming-addict or just want a no-nonsense martial arts flick to get lost in, the new Mortal Kombat reboot may be just what you're looking for. So \"Get over here\" and discover how to watch Mortal Kombat online from anywhere right now, with HBO Max hosting the movie in the US alongside its theatrical release.",
    "While the previous entry in the Mortal Kombat film franchise was more of a fatality than a flawless victory, WarnerBros is finally ready to unleash its reinvention of the movie series. The latest reimagining has certainly been a long time coming. After the failure of 1997's Mortal Kombat: Annihilation put a stop to the trilogy fans had been promised, it was unclear if we would see another instalment.",
    "With 2021 comes a new beginning though, and not only are we returning to a packed lineup of fighters, but long time fans will also be excited to see the return of Bi-Han, Mortal Kombat's original Sub-Zero.",
    "The 2021 release will see MMA fighter Cole Young (Lewis Tan - Deadpool 2, Iron Fist, Into The Badlands) training under a roster of Mortal Kombat's biggest stars. Sonya Blade (Jessica NcNamee), Liu Kong and Kung Lao all feature here, as the young fighter works to defeat Outworld, led by none other than the elder Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim), aka Bi-Han.",
    "While some have technically been waiting for a third Mortal Kombat movie since 1997, the 2021 release has only seen a slight delay. You can watch Mortal Kombat in theatres and streaming services like HBO Max - discover more below.",
    "Mortal Kombat was released to the world on April 23 2021, but with cinemas operating at various capacities at this time it might not be possible to catch a showing in the theatre. Depending on where you are, then, there are a number of ways to watch Mortal Kombat at launch. Between VOD, HBO affiliated streaming sites, and old fashioned cinema trips, you'll find options for the UK, Australia and Canada below.",
    "Gaming and film fans in the UK have had to wait a fair while, but finally you can watch Mortal Kombat online with a VOD platform like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV Rakuten, Chili or the Sky Store.",
    "Things are similar in Canada - you don't have to find a cinema screen for this one. But you will have to shell out for a VOD rental. We're seeing it listed for a standard $24.99 from the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Google Play and YouTube.",
    "Down Under it's a bleaker scene. While Foxtel usually offers HBO content through both its cable service and Binge streaming site, Mortal Kombat isn't currently getting the same treatment and so Australian fans will be heading out for a good old trip to the cinema.",
    "The first reviews of the film are summarized in our Mortal Kombat first reactions piece here.",
    "We're seeing key poster-seeking quotes like \"gleefully violent\" and \"exactly what fans have been looking\" being bandied around, with less flattering views like \"largely dour reboot\".",
    "Some of the negativity hasn't cooled chat of a sequel however, with Mortal Kombat 2 already being mooted online."
