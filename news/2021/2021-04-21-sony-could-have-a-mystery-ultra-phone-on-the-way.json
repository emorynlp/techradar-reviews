    "Sony only recently announced the Xperia 1 III and Sony Xperia 5 III, but already attention is turning to what might come next, with a leaker suggesting that the company has a \u201cnew U\u201d on the way.",
    "That claim comes from leaker Zackbuks on Weibo (a Chinese social network), and their post has been machine translated, so something may have been lost in translation. Regardless, they appear to be saying that by launching both flagships now, the company can release this \u201cnew U\u201d a few months earlier than it would otherwise.",
    "In other words, Sony will want to give its new flagships room to breathe before launching this mystery phone, but as one of them has launched earlier than in previous years (the Sony Xperia 5 II only landed in September), Sony won\u2019t need to wait until late in the year to launch the \u201cnew U\u201d.",
    "What this mystery phone is though is very unclear. There\u2019s speculation around the net that they could be referring to a new \u2018Ultra\u2019 handset, but if they are, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a top-end one like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Rather, it could be a revival of Sony\u2019s Ultra range, last seen with the mid-range Xperia XA2 Ultra from 2018.",
    "There was, for what it\u2019s worth, also a Sony Xperia U \u2013 but that\u2019s ancient, so it\u2019s very unlikely that Sony is bringing out a successor to it.",
    "A new mid-range Ultra is more likely, but it could be something else altogether. Whatever it is, most sites suggest it will be mid-range or budget, since Zackbuks refers to the Xperia 1 III and 5 III as Sony\u2019s flagships for the year (potentially implying that there won\u2019t be any other high-end phones launched before 2022).",
    "But were that the case, Sony wouldn\u2019t necessarily worry about launching this phone close to its flagships, as they wouldn\u2019t be competing for the same audience. So it\u2019s possible that this upcoming phone actually is a flagship \u2013 and maybe even a super-premium Ultra of the kind we\u2019ve seen from other brands. For now it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess, but we will be watching closely.",
