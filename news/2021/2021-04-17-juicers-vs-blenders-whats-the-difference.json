    "It\u2019s head to head as we compare juicers vs blenders so that you\u2019ve got all the information you need to get the most out of these cooking appliances. If you\u2019re on the lookout for one of the best blenders or need a juicer then you\u2019re in the right place because we\u2019ll be explaining exactly the difference between these two types of machines.",
    "Picking between a juicer and a blender might purely come down to personal preference and the kind of drink you\u2019re trying to make. Blenders can be used to create smoothies, but they\u2019re also good for making dips and sauces. Juicers don\u2019t offer quite as much variety in terms of the drinks you can make with them.",
    "Juicers are available in a few different varieties. A cold press juicer uses force to squeeze the liquid out of whatever you place inside it, whereas a centrifugal juicer uses blades to break down fruits and veggies to create juice in a faster time than a cold press machine.",
    "As you might imagine from the name, the primary function of a juicer is to create juice, and for many, these machines are a must-have kitchen appliance because they allow you to enjoy lots of nutritious food in a quick and easy way. If getting the maximum amount of vitamins is high on your agenda, a cold press juicer is a great option because it squeezes the fruit with force rather than using heat and blades - which can reduce the number of nutrients carried into the juice.",
    "Regardless of how you prepare fresh juice, what you make will still offer a good way to take in lots of vitamins and nutrients without having to chomp down on endless pieces of fruit. If you find you tend to reach for a coffee when you\u2019re feeling sluggish, fresh juice made with greens is a good source of vitamins that help to make you feel more energized.",
    "Want to see today's juicer deals? Here they are:",
    "The downside to using a juicer is that you\u2019re limited on the types of drinks you can make and there\u2019s also the fact that juicing leaves behind a lot of fruit and veg fibers, which can feel like a waste and you\u2019ll need to dispose of the leftovers too. To create a glass of juice, you\u2019re also using several pieces of fruit which results in a higher level of fructose than if you eat fewer whole pieces of fruit. According the UK\u2019s NHS, eating whole fruit rather than drinking juices is less likely to cause tooth decay \u201cbecause the sugar is contained within the structure of the fruit.\u201d",
    "Juicers have multiple parts which can make cleaning them very difficult- some parts are not suitable for placing in a dishwasher either.",
    "Blenders have one up on juicers because they can create so many more things including smoothies and milkshakes, as well as sauces, dips, and baby food. Unlike juicers, blenders break down every part of what you place inside them so that nothing is wasted - this also means you won\u2019t be missing out on any fibers or vitamins that would be chucked out in the waste from juicing machines.",
    "Blenders use spinning blades to break down food quickly and use all of the ingredients to make a smooth liquid that\u2019s normally much thicker than a juice. This means that blenders don\u2019t waste any parts of the fruits and vegetables you use and the nutritious fibers that juicers leave behind, will be a part of your finished mixture.",
    "Blenders often have removable jugs that are suitable for placing in the dishwasher and this makes cleaning them much easier. Juicers have a few different parts and can be more time consuming to clean. Compared to cold press juicers, blenders are also much quicker at breaking down ingredients and you can sip on a smoothie within a minute - depending on how powerful your blender is.",
    "Because blenders create a thicker consistency using all of the ingredients, there won\u2019t be as high levels of fructose as you\u2019d find with fresh juice.",
    "Find today's cheapest blender deals:",
    "We know that blenders don\u2019t leave behind any ingredients when you use them to create smoothies or sauces, but by using fast-spinning blades and some heat, blenders can actually reduce the number of nutrients in your mixture.",
    "If you want a blender that can crush ice and break down firm fruits and veggies, you normally have to pay more - which makes buying a blender a pretty expensive purchase.",
    "Both blenders and juicers can be noisy while they are operating and you\u2019ll also need to factor in where you\u2019re going to store these appliances.",
    "Deciding on whether you need a juicer or a blender will depend on what you want to create - if it\u2019s just juice, then a juicer is an obvious choice, but for smoothies, drinks, sauces, dips, and soups, consider a blender.",
    "Juicers will typically create liquids with a higher fructose content because they extract juice from several fruits, rather than blending up a few whole fruits and veggies.",
    "Both juicers and blenders are available across a range of different price points so you\u2019ll be able to find one that suits your needs but be sure to keep in mind the kinds of recipes you\u2019d like to make as this could impact whether you need a more powerful machine or not.",
