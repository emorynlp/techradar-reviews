    "If you're looking to save on a Facebook Portal device, then you're in luck. The social giant's current sale is offering up to $180 in savings on the Facebook Portal line-up which includes the Portal TV, the Portal Plus and the Portal smart display. The Portal line-up is part of Facebook's mission to improve video calling by making it completely hands- and distraction-free. Each Portal device allows you to make video calls and features a smart camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep up with the action. This allows you to move and talk freely while always staying in frame. The Alexa-enabled Portal also works with other smart home devices so you can see who's at the front door, watch the news, check the weather, and more. Facebook knows that privacy is a big concern, so it's enabled controls that allow you to easily disable the camera and microphone while ensuring video calls are always encrypted. Discounts on the Facebook Portal line-up are rare and this is a fantastic opportunity to score a device at a discounted price. This limited-time offer ends on Sunday, so you should take advantage now before it's too late.",
