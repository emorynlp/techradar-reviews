  "article": [
    "As I tested the new Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, I was struck by how Wear OS has calcified into a middling software platform that really hasn\u2019t convinced me to move away from my iOS ecosystem. I\u2019m not saying the Apple Watch is for everyone, but it still feels like the best option out there, and I\u2019m not convinced to switch.",
    "Unfortunately, my opinion is largely affected by the odd territoriality of smartwatches and phone operating systems: Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 only works with Androids (bucking its predecessor\u2019s trend of multi-OS compatibility). The watches that support both mobile operating systems, however, are stuck with Wear OS 2.0, which hasn\u2019t been upgraded in years.",
    "It\u2019s an unfortunate reality, and one that forces consumers to pick their exclusive ecosystem in ways that are as unnecessary as they are embarrassingly retrograde. It\u2019s never been cool for Apple to keep Apple Watch compatibility solely with iOS devices, though we can begrudgingly understand how much more seamless you can make interactions by focusing on just your in-house operating system. But locking Galaxy Watch 4 out of iOS feels like a loss, especially as it prevents the new Wear OS 3 from going toe-to-toe with watchOS.",
    "The Fossil Gen 6 is the compromise that works with both Android and iOS devices, but unfortunately, it won\u2019t be upgraded to Wear OS 3 until 2022. In the meantime, prospective buyers are stuck in a limbo of dealing with the current Wear OS 2.0, which hasn\u2019t had a big refinement in years, while they wait for new features and integrations with Android 12 (like a watch face that matches your phone color palette through Material You).",
    "All of the Fossil Gen 6\u2019s speed via its Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus chipset is wasted on an aging interface \u2013 those smooth transitions are only switching between some basic downloaded-by-default apps. I also have to manually reconnect the watch to my iPhone on a somewhat frequent basis, a condition that may not extend to Android phones. And it\u2019s not like switching to a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is a good alternative \u2013 I\u2019d literally have to switch phone operating systems, which is easy to do as a reviewer but a hard ask for most consumers, especially since some features are only accessible if you have a Samsung phone.",
    "And really, what I\u2019m arguing here isn\u2019t about what is the absolute best smartwatch you can buy \u2013 I\u2019m talking about inertia, and that there isn\u2019t much of a reason to switch away from a setup that works because watch evolution seems even more glacial than it is in phones. By and large, smartwatches didn\u2019t get any big new features in 2021, and the year before only added blood oxygen measurements via SpO2 sensors, following the wide adoption of ECG in 2019 \u2013 which are important features for users specifically concerned about sleep apnea or heart arrhythmia, but not terribly useful for most folks.",
    "Instead, what keeps me using my Apple Watch 5 is inertia, and the lack of an exciting reason to upgrade, let alone jump to a Wear OS watch. What would it take? The same continuous connection with my phone, for starters, but also some of the other benefits of seamless integration, like intuitively adopting the same Focus mode as my iPhone is set to (or at least going on Do Not Disturb), integrating my calendar appointments, and sharing simple tasks like timers. Having an app to work as a shutter button for the phone\u2019s cameras is the kind of touch I'm talking about.",
    "It\u2019s a shame, as I genuinely think the Fossil Gen 6 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 are the classiest smartwatches you can buy \u2013 they have the panache of traditional timepiece design that\u2019s absent on the bulbous, squared-off Apple Watch. In many ways, the Fossil Gen 6 is the best traditional-looking watch we\u2019ve gotten that still works with iOS and Android phones (just above the TicWatch Pro 3, in my opinion), but I ultimately value interoperability more than looks.",
    "Other folks might think differently, and that\u2019s okay \u2013 in this post, at least, I\u2019m not trying to steer buyers in one direction or another. (If you\u2019re on the hunt, check our best smartwatches page for actual buying advice.) But the wearable market\u2019s options are few, and even fewer now that Samsung has folded its Tizen OS into Google\u2019s Wear OS 3. If you haven\u2019t felt motivated to upgrade to a new, pricey smartwatch, I don\u2019t blame you \u2013 and I\u2019m waiting just as much to get swept off my feet with showstopping watch features."
