    "The Walmart PS5 and Xbox Series X restock time today will be sent to you by our PS5 and Xbox restock tracker Matt Swider. He'll send you an alert when consoles are in stock in the US \u2013 if you follow his Twitter account and turn on notifications. The current times for the consoles to go live, according to our tracking, is 12pm EDT and also at 9pm EDT if there are consoles left over. That reflects Walmart's previous plan, though a Wednesday restock is rare for the American retailer.",
    "Here's how to get the PS5 and Xbox Series X restock alerts today:",
    "What to do today: Click on this screenshot of this example of a Walmart PS5 restock alert from Matt Swider and turn on notifications (that little bell icon) for instant alerts. This is what you'll see when there's the PS5 is in stock.",
    "The official Walmart PS5 and Xbox Series X restock time is 12pm EDT / 9am PDT, and the American retailer will be selling the consoles for MSRP. But that's not all.",
    "There may be a second nighttime restock at Walmart, according to our sources, with another batch of PS5 and Xbox consoles live at 9pm EDT / 6pm PDT.",
    "These are abnormal PS5 and Xbox restock times for Walmart and Wednesday is an abnormal day for the retailer. It usually does a PS5 restock date on Thursdays (but not every Thursday), and it's usually at 3pm EDT.",
    "Like past Walmart restocks, these are online-only purchases with ship-to-home deliveries that have now pushed into early October 2021. The first morning restock did have dates a bit sooner, with September 22, 2021 being very popular. Sometimes Walmart does deliver sooner than the estimated date.",
    "Update: While the times have changed, our Walmart guide remains the same. Here's what to do to get the PS5 and Xbox Series X in your cart.",
    "Walmart is the most popular retailer in the US, so consoles sell out quickly when the PS5 is in stock. This is one case in which the mobile app is the hero and the website is the sidekick. We'll explain how and why you should use both during a PS5 drop at Walmart."
