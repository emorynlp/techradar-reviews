    "Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd exhibit a wildly unhealthy attachment style in the new comedy drama from Apple TV Plus. Based on the popular 2019 podcast from Wondery, which detailed the true story of a psychiatrist who inveigled his way into a patient\u2019s life over three decades, this 8-part miniseries looks set to be a darkly compelling hoot. We\u2019ll detail below how to watch The Shrink Next Door online with a subscription to Apple TV Plus.",
    "Adapted by Michael Showalter and written by the multi award-winning Georgia Pritchett (HBO\u2019s Succession), The Shrink Next Door stars Ferrell as \u201cMarty\u201d Markowitz, a kind but eager-to-please business owner running his dead parent\u2019s fabric company, who\u2019s recommended to Dr Isaac \u201cIke\u201d Herschkopf (Rudd) by his sister Phyliss after one too many breakdowns.",
    "Ike\u2019s methods prove to be incredibly successful, and the encouraging but overfamiliar doctor becomes a fixture in Marty\u2019s life, his \u201cPsychiatrist, Business Partner, and Best Friend\u201d. At best their relationship is considered unprofessional, eliciting concerned comments from Ike\u2019s own wife Bonnie. At worst, it allows Ike to control Marty\u2019s life and coerce him into doing all sorts of unfathomable things.",
    "Ferrell and Rudd prove a compelling double act, while Kathryn Hahn (WandaVision, Transparent) is typically excellent as Marty\u2019s suspicious sister. So, if you like dark, character-driven dramas, lay back on your chaise longue and prepare to be stunned, as we explain how to watch The Shrink Next Door online with an Apple TV Plus subscription.",
    "While Apple's answer to Netflix has a comparatively tiny library of films and shows to get stuck into \u2013 80 and counting \u2013 what's available is top-notch, well-produced fare with little in the way of filler.",
    "The Morning Show was the calling card for Apple TV Plus at launch, costing $15 million per episode. It was complemented by the epic sci-fi drama See starring Jason Momoa, space drama For All Mankind, and period comedy Dickinson. Following this was exciting new programming like M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s moody horror series, Servant, and the experimental thriller Calls.",
    "Of course, the service's breakout hit has been the Jason Sudeikis comedy Ted Lasso, following the titular American football coach hired to manage a Premier League football team. It's earned an army of fans and a impressive amount of awards attention, netting 20 Primetime Emmy nominations this year \u2013 a record for a freshman series.",
    "The small but great library is set to grow at a steady pace - alongside recent seasons of Ted Lasso and The Morning Show, Apple TV Plus looks to have a pretty strong-looking upcoming schedule of new exclusive content.",
    "The Martin Scorsese-directed Killers of the Flower Moon, promises a 'large-scale Western' that stars big guns Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro.",
    "The Tragedy of Macbeth, meanwhile, will premiere on the streaming service on January 14, 2022. It's a pared back, black-and-white film version of the classic Shakespeare play, adapted by Joel Coen and starring Denzel Washington. And viewers are invited to watch The Afterparty that same month: a murder mystery comedy set at high school reunion, with each episode depicting events from another character's perspective. It'll feature a brilliant bevvy of stars, including Tiffany Haddish, Dave Franco, Broad City's Ilana Glazer, Sam Richardson, Ben Schwartz and more.",
