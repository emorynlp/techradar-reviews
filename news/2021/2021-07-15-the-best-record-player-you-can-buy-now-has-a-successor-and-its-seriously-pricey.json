    "Pro-Ject USA has launched its latest product, the Debut Pro Turntable. A follow-up to last year\u2019s Debut Carbon Evo, the retro inspired Pro focuses on premium analog reproduction and high quality stereo hi-fi sound, in an effort from the company to revisit its roots for its 30th anniversary.",
    "Retailing for $899 (around \u00a3649 / AU$1,209) in the US, it\u2019s definitely an item for true vinyl enthusiasts, though there\u2019s currently no word as to whether the Debut Pro Turntable will launch in territories beyond the US.",
    "The Debut Pro Turntable packs many promising features that could seriously delight stereo buffs and record player lovers alike, with what looks like a high-quality build, a pre-adjusted Sumiko Rainer cartridge, a hand-painted MDF chassis and a precision aluminum platter complete with TPE damping.",
    "While record players aren\u2019t the most technologically advanced pieces of audio kit out there, they\u2019ve recently enjoyed a resurgence in popularity, with more of us looking to the audio gear of the past to bring us the high definition sound that most streaming platforms don\u2019t offer.",
    "In fact, there\u2019s quite a wide range of turntables available to purchase across a variety of budgets these days, many of which come with modern conveniences like Bluetooth connectivity and USB ports.",
    "The price tag for the Debut Pro is on the more expensive side, but we hope that only speaks to the record player\u2019s quality. It costs almost twice as much as Pro-Ject\u2019s previous effort, the Carbon Evo, which seriously blew us away with its rich sound, impressive specs, and high quality build.",
    "If you own a vinyl collection or are looking to invest in the analog format, the Debut Pro should at least be worth looking into. And if you can\u2019t match the admittedly eye-watering price tag, Pro-Ject\u2019s prior and more affordable creations have been remarkably impressive still. On that note, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing how well Pro-Ject can justify the Debut Pro\u2019s higher cost, as well as how it compares to its older counterparts."
