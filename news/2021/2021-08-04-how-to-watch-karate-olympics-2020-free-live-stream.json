    "Karate, like Judo, finds its origins in Japan. The ancient martial art is popular worldwide, and it\u2019s a spectacular experience watching karatekas go toe-to-toe. This is the first time that it\u2019s been featured in the Olympics, so we put together this article about how you can watch karate at Olympics 2020. Note that karate is in the Olympics only for the 2020 games; it will not be featured in the 2024 Olympics.",
    "In the World Karate Championships, Japan has consistently topped the leaderboard\u2014they have 198 medals, 90 of which are gold. But that won\u2019t make the Olympics a cakewalk for them.",
    "Spain\u2019s karatekas are among the best ranked in the world and will light up the competition. Look out for stunning performances from Sandra S\u00e1nchez in particular, who\u2019s considered one of the best karatekas of all time. On the men\u2019s side, make sure you watch Japan\u2019s Ryo Kiyuna and Spain\u2019s Dami\u00e1n Quintero. At the 2018 World Karate Championship, Ryo bagged the gold, while Dami\u00e1n won the silver.",

    "Catch a karate Olympic live stream where you are with many native broadcasters offering free coverage across the Olympics schedule. In the UK, BBC and BBC iPlayer will be broadcasting live coverage of key events (although nowhere near as extensively as in the past), while Channel 7 in Australia, and its online counterpart, 7Plus, lead the charge with the most comprehensive live stream across all events.",
    "Other countries with free Olympic live streams include RTE in Ireland, TF1 in France, and ARD and ZDF in Germany.",
    "No matter where you are around the world, there should be an Olympic Games stream to ensure you can watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, whether paid-for or free. However, you may find your preferred domestic coverage is geo-restricted when abroad, or that your place of work, college, or school has prevented the ability to access your chosen service and watch online.",
    "Thankfully, there's any easy work-around. Simply download a VPN and you can spoof your device into appearing as if it's located somewhere else. Essentially, then, you can appear as if you're where your coverage is geo-locked to and watch as if you're right at home.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Three simple steps to using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select the right location, i.e. UK for iPlayer, US for Sling TV",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - so, whichever service you want to use, all you need to do is head to their website and start streaming.",
    "With many countries around the world taking part in the Olympic Games, you can find a broadcaster to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in most countries, whether free or platforms that charge.",
    "For those countries we haven't mentioned above, Wikipedia's dedicated page allows you to see a breakdown of Olympic Games TV channels to tune into."
