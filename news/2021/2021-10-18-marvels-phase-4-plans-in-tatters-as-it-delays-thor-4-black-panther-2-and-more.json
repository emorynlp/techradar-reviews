  "summary": "Marvel\u2019s Phase 4 just got a multi-month delay",
  "article": [
    "It\u2019s a bad day to be a MCU fan: Marvel announced that nearly every major film it plans on releasing over the next two years will be pushed back.",
    "Including the films affected by the delay are Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness that will now be released in early May instead of March; Thor: Love and Thunder which now releases in July instead of May; and Black Panther 2: Wakanda Forever that will now face a four-month delay, going from a July release date to November. That means The Marvels and Ant-Man 3 will be pushed back as well.",
    "Here\u2019s the full list of purported changes:",
    "The only silver lining here is that the upcoming Hawkeye Disney Plus show and Spider-Man: No Way Home were unaffected by the delays and will still be available to watch online and in theaters on November 24, 2021 and December 17, 2021, respectively.",
    "While your first thought might be that Disney wants to avoid another Black Widow scenario, the company says it\u2019s making the decision to delay the films due to production conflicts.",
    "According to Deadline, \u201csome titles are contending with finishing scenarios while others are in production,\u201d which it says has led to a \u201cdomino effect\u201d at the movie studio where films need to be pushed back later to accommodate the production schedule.",
    "The easiest way to make that happen, Disney figures, is to just simply push each of the release dates back to the next slot, freeing up some time for production to get caught up. The logic makes sense even though it's disappointing.",
    "Unfortunately none of these films will be coming to Disney Plus right out of the gate, and will instead be theatrical-only \u2013 though there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll eventually see them on the service sometime down the road."
