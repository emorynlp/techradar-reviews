    "Although Black Friday itself may be over, there are still a host of great laptop deals for you to get your hands on. Even in the face of the global silicon shortage that made supply dwindle around the world, retailers have still found a way to slash prices on all sorts of notebooks.",
    "So almost a week later, whether you're looking for a Chromebook or a MacBook, a Windows Tablet or an Ultrabook, we're sure you can find an incredible deal on the laptop of your dreams.",
    "If you're new to the laptop buying game, we've even included some laptop buying advice so you can be sure you're getting something that won't let you down. So, keep us bookmarked and let us help you find the laptop of your dreams.",
    "In the US:",
    "In the UK:",
    "With the new MacBook Pro featuring the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips up for sale, as well, we could be in line for some juicy price cuts on the first generation M1 Air and machines.",
    "It's also likely we'll see the first major price cuts on gaming laptops with Nvidia RTX 3000 series graphics cards. These machines were newly released in early 2021, so by November they will be ripe for discounts. We won't be focusing on them too much on this page, so definitely check out our guide to the best Black Friday gaming laptop deals for a deeper dive into those machines.",
    "Is it really worth all this preparation? We think so. Last year, laptops were one of the top three most searched for products with \"Black Friday\" in the query (Semrush). Ecommerce sales in November and December reached a staggering $188billion for the first time, according to data from Adobe, with $9 billion online sales happening on Black Friday alone.",
    "With global ecommerce sales projected to increase 26.7 per cent year-on-year to $4.891 trillion in 2021 (Statista), we're expecting more online laptop deals over Black Friday this year than ever before. But more people will be shopping for them than ever before, too.",
    "When you're browsing through Black Friday laptop deals, be aware that a lot of laptop manufacturers and retailers are trying to get rid of old stock. You'll see a laptop deal that cuts a huge chunk off the original price, only to find that it has a processor that's three years old. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker \u2013 even with an Intel Core i7-8500U, you should be able to get some work done.",
    "But keep in mind the current generations of laptop hardware. Intel processors should have either a 10 or an 11 in front of their model number \u2013 like the Intel Core i7-10710U. That said, 9th-generation processors should still be able to get the job done. Don't buy an 8th-generation or older Intel Core processor unless it's a seriously deep discount, though, because that will massively hurt any resale value the machine will have, plus can potentially mean sluggish performance, depending on what you use it for.",
    "Things are fairly stable in the realm of Black Friday MacBook deals. Essentially, the biggest choice you'll need to make is what size hard drive to go for. The smallest options are usually more than enough for general use but definitely look for an offer on the larger sizes that could double your storage for very little extra money.",
    "Finally, a lot of Black Friday laptop deals will try to sell you a laptop without enough RAM. As a general rule of thumb, you should shoot for at least 8GB of RAM on a Windows laptop, and 16GB if you plan on doing any heavy work on it. If you're buying a Black Friday Chromebook deal, you can get away with 4GB, but 8GB is definitely a boon.",
    "If you're buying a gaming laptop, aim for one with a current-generation Nvidia GPU, too. The Nvidia GeForce 30-series graphics chips are the current top-end, and will let you power ray-tracing in games. However, there is the older RTX 2060, GTX 1660 Ti, and even cheaper GPUs like the GTX 1650, which will still happily chug along quite nicely at 1080p gaming, albeit at lower settings.",
    "Some of the heftiest price cuts may be on machines with these specs, so they could be more than worth it - just remember they aren't quite the latest models though. As with normal laptops, generous helpings on RAM and SSD capacities are also very useful for gaming laptops - especially if you're planning on having multiple games installed at once. For more advice, take a look at our Black Friday gaming laptop deals page.",
    "The new Apple M1 MacBook Air is simply the best laptop Apple has ever made and the best laptop money can buy right now. The revolutionary ARM-based Apple M1 chip that powers the new MacBook Air is a stunning achievement. For your money, you'll get a thin and light laptop with an incredible battery life that offers great performance \u2013 even with 4K video editing,",
    "Prices for the MacBook Air have stabilised around the $900 / \u00a3900 mark over recent months, though it has dipped below this by $50 / \u00a350 for short periods of time. With the newly launched MacBook Pro models featuring the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, we're keeping an eye out for even bigger discounts on the our favorite laptop over Black Friday.",

    "It's hard to find fault with the line of Dell XPS laptops. Year after year finds a place in our list of the best laptops \u2013 and it just keeps getting better. The Dell XPS 13 is a beautiful piece of kit, with a stunning display, terrific performance and long battery life.",
    "In a number of Cyber sales leading up to Black Friday, we've seen Dell discount this machine by upwards of $200 / \u00a3250 depending on the spec. Keep a close eye on it as these savings should return in November as Dell promises any sales throughout the month are at Black Friday pricing levels.",
    "Read the full review: Dell XPS 13 (2020)",
    "The Asus VivoBook S15 is an ideal budget laptop as it boasts a thin and light design with great performance at an excellent price. For anyone who simply needs a mid-range laptop that won't break the bank but doesn't skimp on performance then this is a great choice.",
    "We've seen this model discounted countless times over the last few months as we approach November. Expect it to feature strongly in a number of Black Friday sales from various retailers, with the hope that we see some of the biggest discounts yet.",
