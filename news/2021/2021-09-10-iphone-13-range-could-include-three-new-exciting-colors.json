    "While the iPhone 13 range isn\u2019t being announced until September 14, one store has listed them early, and has even included color and storage details.",
    "The site in question is KTC (a Ukrainian web store), and it claims that the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini will be available in red, purple, blue, pink, black and white. Of those, pink is the only new color, and it seemingly replaces the green shade in the iPhone 12 range.",
    "The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max meanwhile are listed as coming in gold, silver, bronze and black. Of those, the bronze and black shades would be new, and would seemingly replace the graphite and pacific blue shades from the iPhone 12 Pro range. These are all colors that we\u2019ve heard rumored as possibilities before, so they could well be accurate.",
    "The site additionally says that the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini will come in 64GB and 128GB models. Oddly there\u2019s no mention of 256GB, even though the iPhone 12 range was available in that size, but we doubt Apple would have removed this option.",
    "The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are shown in the same sizes as their predecessors, namely 128GB, 256GB and 512GB. This suggests that the rumored 1TB models might not emerge, though equally this store\u2019s information could well be wrong, so we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt.",
    "If this leak is right then Apple is seemingly sticking with its established pattern of offering fairly muted, smart colors on its Pro range, while providing brighter colors (and more choice of colors) on the standard iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini.",
    "Given that this is what Apple tends to do it\u2019s not surprising to see, in fact we\u2019d be surprised if Apple didn\u2019t do this, but it will be disappointing for anyone who wants top-end hardware in a more showy shade, as that just won\u2019t be possible.",
    "So it\u2019s a bit of a shame to see, but of course nothing is certain just yet. We won\u2019t be sure what colors the iPhone 13 range is landing in until the phones are unveiled on September 14. Head back to TechRadar then for all the news and analysis on Apple\u2019s new handsets.",
