    "Super Bowl 2021 may have been and gone, but if you weren't able to catch all the action from Raymond James Stadium live, then you can still see all the biggest plays or watch a full game replay right now. Read on as our spoiler-free guide explains how to watch Super Bowl highlights of the Chiefs vs Buccaneers Super Bowl LV game wherever you are.",
    "There's a number of reasons you might have missed the big game - most obviously due to an unfriendly time differential with the US East Coast. For instance, folks in India faced a 5am wake-up call if they wanted to watch Super Bowl live, while in the UK and Europe catching all the action as it happened meant staying up until around 4am.",
    "Fortunately, watching Super Bowl highlights is easier than ever this year. In addition to the condensed highlights (usually around 15 minutes) that are posted on NFL.com and to the NFL's YouTube channel the day after Super Bowl, you can also watch a FREE full Super Bowl replay if you're in the UK. That's because BBC iPlayer has the full game available on-demand (as well as its own version of abbreviated highlights) .",
    "And while we promised you no spoilers, we will say it was quite the game. Literally one for the ages, Super Bowl 2021 saw 25-year-old Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs play 43-year-old Tom Brady and the Buccaneers for the sport's biggest prize - though the way this generational QB clash was billed, it was arguably even more about legacies and reputations.",
    "The result might not be what you think, but one you also deeply suspect - we debated many scenarios, but even our widest of eyes didn't have this year's Super Bowl highlights show looking quite as emphatic as it does.",
