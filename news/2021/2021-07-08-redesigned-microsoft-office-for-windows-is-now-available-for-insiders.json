    "While Microsoft is trying to fix the compatibility issues on the newly announced Windows 11, the company is also looking to introduce a new user interface for its Office applications.",
    "Though the fresh look was supposed to launch last week, the Redmond based tech company has announced that the Beta version of the updated interface is now available for insiders to download on both Windows 11 and Windows 10.",
    "According to the official blog post by Microsoft, the new Microsoft Office carries the same fluent design language that we\u2019ve come across on Windows 11. The company states that it has been working on the redesign since 2017.",
    "Microsoft is promising a simple, natural and consistent design experience with all your Windows apps This MS Office update will bring the refreshed look seen in Windows 11 to applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Access, Project, Publisher, and Visio.",
    "Additionally, users who like customizing the look and theming on their systems will be able to set the separate theme for Windows and Office apps. This can be done by choosing the theme of your choice from the Office Account tab under the file menu. In case you want to have matching themes on both Office and Windows 11 for a consistent experience, you can select \u201cUse system settings.\u201d",
    "While Microsoft wanted to do away with the ribbon bar in favour of a command bar, however, the ribbon bar retains its place in this update. Also, while the current update majorly has design tweaks, the company promises more tweaks in the weeks and months leading to the final release.",
    "To get the latest version of Microsoft Office, you need to be signed in the Office Insiders program.
