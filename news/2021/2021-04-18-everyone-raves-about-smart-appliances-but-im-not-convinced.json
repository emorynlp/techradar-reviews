    "Smart appliances used to be something that only featured in a Sci-Fi movie, where lights turned on with a clap, doors automatically locked, and voice assistants were something we\u2019d scoff at - now though, a smart home is something that\u2019s becoming easier to achieve.",
    "Smart appliances used to be the stuff of science-fiction movies, in which voice assistants greeted you when you came home and put on some soothing music, lights turned on as you entered the room, and robots did the housework.",
    "But in a few short years connected gadgets have become as ubiquitous as mobile phones in many homes, and, for some people, just as indispensable.",
    "The smart home industry is set to make over $8 million/ \u00a35.8 million in the US alone this year, while creating a \u2018smart\u2019 home has become relatively affordable, costing on average a little over $687/ \u00a3500, according to a study from Statista.com.",
    "I spend my days writing about all things home-related, smart and otherwise, and I\u2019m all for more technologically advanced appliances \u2013 because why not let them make our lives easier? To me, having a video doorbell makes sense because it lets me see who\u2019s at my door when I\u2019m not at home (or when I\u2019m in my pajamas and not sure I want to answer).",
    "Lots of appliances are so much handier if they\u2019re controlled via your phone or, better still, your voice. The best smart lights can create an instant ambiance in your home, or simply switch on when you\u2019re out if you don\u2019t want your home to appear empty for security reasons.",
    "But \u2013 and it\u2019s a big but \u2013 do we really need every appliance to be a smart one? Or do manufacturers just think we\u2019re slightly lazier than we really are?",
    "The issue I have is that some smart appliances still have a long way to go until they\u2019re actually more of a help than a hassle, while others just aren\u2019t smart enough",
    "Take a smart air fryer, for example. These appliances let you cook crispy fries in no time at all, and because they\u2019re smart-enabled you\u2019ll be able to switch them on and off from your phone - sound good? Of course it does. However, we\u2019re not quite living in an age yet where the air fryer is so smart that it can take my raw potatoes, wash and peel them, and shake them around in the air fryer so they\u2019re cooked to perfection - now that would be impressive.",
    "And while I can fully appreciate why smart thermostats are a real draw, enabling you to put the heating on when you\u2019re out and fine-tune the temperature from your sofa, when it\u2019s just as easy to switch on your air fryer by using your finger as it is to use your phone, where\u2019s the appeal?",
    "Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I\u2019m a big fan of some smart appliances. My robot vacuum is a godsend when the kitchen floor needs some TLC and I\u2019ve got better things to do (literally anything is better than vacuuming, right?), and the robot did a great job pre-Covid of sprucing up my carpets when I was expecting visitors (remember those days?). I can program the vacuum to clean up when I\u2019m out of the house, and it\u2019ll even charge itself too. But do we need everything in our homes to be smart?",
    "Even coffee machine accessories like the Nespresso Barista can be turned on via your phone; but by the time you\u2019ve launched the app, found the right setting, and switched it on, you probably could have made your coffee and been halfway through enjoying it - and you\u2019ll pay a premium for the privilege of turning it on via your phone too.",
    "I got lured into buying a larger smart appliance, and jumped at the chance to get a smart washing machine. What a treat to be able to switch the machine on remotely and have the companion app ping when my washing needs to be taken out of the machine, I thought. In reality though, this doesn\u2019t save me time, and it certainly doesn\u2019t save me any effort \u2013 although I\u2019ll be first in the queue to buy the first washer that also loads my washing, unloads it when it\u2019s done, and folds it.",
    "Here\u2019s my other problem with smart appliances: they don\u2019t always all work together. You may, for example, have bought a smart fridge and set up a smart lighting system, but that doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily use the same app or hub.",
    "The best smart speakers help to bridge that gap, enabling you to control everything from one device, but not all appliances can sync up with each other, and you ages flicking from app to app trying to create an \u2018ambiance\u2019 with your smart lights and sound system to help you chill out, only to create the exact opposite effect as you get increasingly annoyed.",
    "Probably the most frustrating thing about smart appliances is that they aren\u2019t always right. Your smart cameras might alert you to something that isn\u2019t really an issue, and who hasn\u2019t found themselves getting increasingly impatient with Alexa as it tells you it can\u2019t find the song it played just yesterday? You\u2019ll also need to be prepared to update device software and apps regularly, otherwise you\u2019ll find your smart appliance dates pretty quickly, and then there are the not uncommon issues with the Wi-Fi connectivity, especially if you\u2019ve got too many devices using the same network.",
    "I\u2019m guilty of getting sucked into the allure of creating a smart home that saves me time and effort, but in most cases I think I\u2019ll just stick to the tried and tested \u2018dumb\u2019 approach: \u201cAlexa, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d"
