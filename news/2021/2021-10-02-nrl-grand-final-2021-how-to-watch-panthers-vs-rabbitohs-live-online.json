  "article": [
    "It\u2019s time for the NRL grand final, with the Penrith Panthers going head-to-head with the South Sydney Rabbitohs in Brisbane this Sunday, October 3.",
    "The Panthers have fought their way back into the same spot they found themselves in last year \u2013 right on the cusp of a premiership win after a near-perfect season",
    "But after their devastating grand final loss to the Melbourne Storm in 2020, they\u2019ll be looking to turn their fortunes around.",
    "The question is whether Penrith has learned enough from last year\u2019s defeat to seize on tonight\u2019s opportunity, or if the pressure to perform on the big stage will get in the way of victory.",
    "Meanwhile, South Sydney will be without its star fullback, Latrell Mitchell, after he was suspended for a high tackle back in round 27. But the Rabbitohs have coach Wayne Bennett on-side, a man with seven premiership wins to his name.",
    "Tonight will also be the last time that Rabbitohs captain, Adam Reynolds, will hit the field for the club, and the team will no doubt want to send him off with a premiership win. The issue here is that Reynolds has a groin injury which could be a concern for his kicking game.",
    "Penrith\u2019s injury list is much more daunting. Tevita Pangai Junior has been ruled out of the grand final, while Brian To\u2019o, James Fisher-Harris, Moses Leota, Dylan Edwards and Nathan Cleary are all nursing injuries \u2013 it\u2019ll be a lot to overcome for the Panthers.",
    "The NRL grand final will be broadcast live on free-to-air on Channel 9 and live streamed on 9Now if you\u2019re in Australia. If you\u2019re overseas, there are options for you too. Here\u2019s how you can watch it all unfold to see who takes home the premiership.",
    "The only place to catch this year\u2019s grand final live is on Channel 9.",
    "As the Nine Network has broadcast rights to the NRL grand final, you\u2019ll also be able to stream the game live or on demand on Channel 9\u2019s catch-up app, 9Now. This platform is available on a web browser, and has apps for both Android and iOS.",
    "The grand final decider won\u2019t be available on Fox Footy or Kayo until after the match is finished, where it\u2019ll be aired as a replay.",
    "If you\u2019re a footy fan who happens to be living outside of Australia, New Zealand or the Pacific Islands, don\u2019t worry. You can watch every moment no matter where you are on the Watch NRL streaming service.",
    "For the grand final, Watch NRL has a new streaming option called the Grand Final Pass, which temporarily replaces the monthly plan. It gives customers the ability to watch the grand final live for US$29 / \u00a322 / \u20ac25 / AU$40.",
    "If you\u2019re outside Australia and want to tune into the grand final, you\u2019ll find that online access is geo-blocked. In order to get around that \u2013 and assuming it complies with the Ts & Cs of the broadcaster in question \u2013 you can download and use a VPN.",
    "How to use a VPN:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN: as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location: open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream: so if you\u2019re an Aussie abroad, just head to Kayo and stream like you were back at home"
