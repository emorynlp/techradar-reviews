    "Windows 10 May 2021 Update has arrived, but the first feature update of 2021 really isn\u2019t anything to get excited about for several reasons.",
    "Windows 10 21H1, as the upgrade is also referred to, is just a minor update, as we already knew, mostly consisting of fine-tuning the operating system and fixing bugs, although some small feature additions and tweaks have been applied (more on those later).",
    "Overall, Windows 10 21H1 doesn\u2019t do much, and also, it sounds like Microsoft is being quite cautious with the rollout. The software giant says: \u201cIn the current environment, we know that you continue to rely on your PCs more than ever. As a result, we are initially taking a measured seeker-based approach to the rollout of the May 2021 Update.",
    "\u201cWe are throttling availability up over the coming weeks to ensure a reliable download experience for all, so the update may not be offered to you right away.\u201d",
    "This is standard practice for a Windows 10 feature update deployment, of course, as the phased rollout ensures that not too many devices will be affected by any unforeseen problems which crop up as more computers receive the upgrade.",
    "However, the way it\u2019s phrased here \u2013 the \u2018current environment\u2019 of working from home in many cases, and therefore the PC being a vital tool to keep up and running flawlessly \u2013 makes us think that it sounds like Microsoft could be going for an extra cautious opening of the update floodgates.",
    "That would make sense, particularly as there is nothing hugely compelling to get with the Windows 10 May 2021 Update. The small feature additions we mentioned at the outset include Windows Hello getting multi-camera support, and some bolstering on the security front with performance improvements for Windows Defender Application Guard.",
    "There are also improvements to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Group Policy Service (in remote working scenarios in particular) and a bunch of security updates.",
    "If you do want the Windows 10 21H1 update on your machine right now, you\u2019ll have to be running version 2004 of the OS (20H1 or May 2020 Update) or 20H2 (October 2020 Update) \u2013 either of last year\u2019s upgrades, in other words \u2013 and you\u2019ll need to manually search for the May 2021 Update.",
    "To do this, go to \u2018Windows Update settings\u2019 (simply search for that in the Windows 10 search box on the taskbar) and click \u2018Check for updates\u2019. If your PC is ready for the update, it\u2019ll appear \u2013 but bear in mind that only some hardware configurations will be eligible to upgrade, and this is a gradual (possibly very cautious) rollout as mentioned, so you may have to wait a while anyway.",
    "If you do get the opportunity to grab the upgrade, it\u2019ll be a quick download and install, seeing as this is just another enablement package for Windows 10 (meaning the files are already in place, in the background, for 20H1 and 20H2 users, a switch just needs \u2018flicking\u2019 to enable them \u2013 which was also the case for those upgrading from 20H1 to 20H2)."
