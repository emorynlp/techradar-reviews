    "The Dakar Rally returns to Saudi Arabia for its 43rd run, but the 2021 edition brings us an entirely different route to last year's challenge, which both starts and finishes in Jeddah. Follow our guide as we explain where to find a Dakar Rally live stream and watch all the key moments from the race online wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "The Dakar is renowned for being the world's toughest and most dangerous off-road endurance race, and this year's rally 4,767km of deserts, sand dunes, winding roads, stony tracks and navigational hazards aplenty, split across 12 timed stages, including a marathon stage and two loop stages.",
    "The starting position for Stage 1 was determined by the outcome of the pre-race Prologue stage on January 2 and, just like last year, the roadbooks for each stage of the race will only be handed out 10 minutes before the daily racing starts.",
    "At 813km, Stage 4 is the longest individual leg of the race, but the marathon stage, which spans Stages 7 and 8 immediately after the rest day on January 9, will be a much bigger challenge, featuring nearly 1,500km of hills, stony plateaus and a mix of winding and fast sections, as well as some of the best views in the country.",
    "Carlos Sainz (the father of F1 star Carlos Sainz Jr.) was the hero of last year's race, winning the Dakar Rally for the third time in the Cars Class. As ever, there are different competitions for different categories, but a Class for Classic cars has been introduced for this year's event, along with the regulars: bikes, quads, cars, SSV/UTV, and trucks.",
