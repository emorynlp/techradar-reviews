    "Intel\u2019s Xe high-end desktop graphics card (codenamed DG2) could outgun Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070, if the latest from the rumor mill is to be believed.",
    "Intel\u2019s DG2 has (again) been covered by YouTuber Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead in a big leak which has lots of interesting points to chew over, adding to what Moore\u2019s Law has previously said in the past about the graphics card.",
    "According to word from the usual unspecified sources \u2013 so as ever, treat this with a lot of skepticism \u2013 the Xe-HPG (high-performance gaming) card will be built on TSMC\u2019s 6nm node (or it could possibly use an enhanced 7nm process, as we\u2019ve previously heard).",
    "The flagship model is expected to have 512 Execution Units and to run at clock speeds of up to 2.2GHz, with 16GB of GDDR6 video RAM on board (and a 256-bit memory bus). The TDP could reach up to around the 275W mark, or perhaps slightly less, but obviously take these specs in particular with a healthy helping of condiments.",
    "Especially the following assertion of Moore\u2019s Law, which is that the performance achieved by this Xe graphics card is set to be pitched in-between Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 and 3080. In other words, it should be quicker than the vanilla RTX 3070, and therefore maybe something in the ballpark of the RTX 3070 Ti (whenever that card turns up \u2013 supposedly soon going by the latest speculation).",
    "Moore\u2019s Law has compared DG2 to the RTX 3070 in the past, so if anything, he is now hinting that the GPU could even be slightly stronger (or rather, his sources are). That\u2019s obviously good news in terms of having a genuine competitor to Nvidia and AMD, and it\u2019s not an unbelievable assertion given the aforementioned rumored specs. Let\u2019s not get carried away with those hopes, though\u2026",
    "Another interesting nugget here is the claim that Intel could be planning an equivalent for Nvidia\u2019s DLSS (remember AMD has its own rival tech in the form of FidelityFX Super Resolution). Intel supposedly might debut \u2018XeSS\u2019, but the leak is vague on this, and as Tom\u2019s Hardware, which spotted all this, points out, it\u2019ll be a big ask for Intel to get a DLSS rival out \u2013 and get support from game developers.",
    "It\u2019s a big enough ask breaking into the two-horse GPU race, and perfecting the software in the form of graphics drivers, as it is. Tom\u2019s observes that one possible solution for Intel might simply be to adopt AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution, as it\u2019s an open source effort, so this could be feasible \u2013 providing AMD can nail the tech and get it performing well, naturally.",
    "Still, it could be the case that Intel has some vague plans for a DLSS rival right now, but that these might not see fruition until much later down the line \u2013 presumably when Intel has carved out a chunk of market share in the GPU arena and is in the position of being a serious player, and therefore will have more leverage.",
    "The release date of DG2 was also touched upon, with Intel apparently still targeting the end of the year (Q4) for the debut of the high-end Xe graphics card.",
    "In his video, Moore\u2019s Law also provides us with a glimpse of some images of the purported DG2 engineering sample (shown with dual fans), which could be taken as another indication that progress is speeding along nicely with the GPU, and maybe that rumored late 2021 launch date might just happen.",
    "A lot will, of course, depend not just on Intel\u2019s progress with DG2, along with the drivers and related software side, but also on exactly how the current chip shortage pans out. The truth is there are a lot of variables, really, to be pinning too much hope on a particular timeframe."
