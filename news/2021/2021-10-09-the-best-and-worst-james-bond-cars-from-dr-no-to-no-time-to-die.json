    "After an 18-month hiatus, No Time to Die has finally landed in cinemas, bringing to a close Daniel Craig\u2019s tenure as 007 by serving up an emotional and typically action-heavy espionage adventure.",
    "But although Cary Fukunaga\u2019s take on James Bond \u2013 the 25th movie in the age-old franchise \u2013 shows off a decidedly different side to the iconic character (no spoilers, but M is called \u201cdarling\u201d at one point), No Time to Die is nonetheless jam-packed full of gadgets, gags and, perhaps most important of all, eye-wateringly beautiful cars.",
    "In light of Craig\u2019s final bow, then, we\u2019ve put together a list of the best and worst Bond cars in the 60-year history of the franchise \u2013 including models from Dr No. to No Time to Die.",
    "Look, GoldenEye is indisputably Pierce Brosnan\u2019s best film \u2013 nay, it\u2019s one of the best in the whole franchise \u2013 but his ride, a sky blue BMW Z3, is up there with Bond\u2019s most forgettable. It was the first BMW ever driven by the character, which presented 007 with a chance to push the brand\u2019s famed German engineering to the max, but ultimately the car is merely driven to an airstrip and passed on to another agent \u2013 entirely neglecting the many gadgets (stinger missiles, radar and an ejector seat) Q so meticulously highlights in an earlier scene. If anything, then, the BMW Z3 was just a four-wheeled product placement.",
    "The Citro\u00ebn 2CV driven by Roger Moore\u2019s Bond in For Your Eyes Only was affectionately known as \"an umbrella on wheels\" \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why. In fairness, this yellow matchbox doesn\u2019t actually belong to him in the movie \u2013 rather his lady friend, Melina Havelock \u2013 and it does end up forming part of an impressive chase sequence through rural Spain, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that this is possibly the most un-Bond-like Bond car of them all.",
    "Easy pickings, this one. Not only is Die Another Day considered one of the worst Bond films (and certainly the worst of Brosnan\u2019s tenure) but it also features one of the dumbest Bond cars. This Aston Martin Vanquish could turn invisible, for a start, and possessed wheel spikes, machine guns and a mouthful of heat-seeking rockets that Bond, smartly, deploys while skating around on a glacier. It\u2019s an undoubtedly beautiful machine, but one let down by a studio more interested in silly toys than maintaining the series\u2019 penchant for automotive elegance.",
    "We\u2019re all for nostalgia here at TechRadar, but just because the Sunbeam Alpine marked the first Bond car of the lot, that doesn\u2019t make it a good one. It was small, slow and home to some downright terrible rear camera shots that miserably fail the test of time. Sure, it manages to drift its way into sending a much larger pursuer off a cliff and into a ball of fire, but the Alpine didn\u2019t re-appear in later films for good reason. Those white wheels were smart, at least?",
    "Many will claim Bond should never have set foot in an American muscle car \u2013 007 is, admittedly, neither American nor particularly muscly \u2013 but the red Ford Mustang Mach 1 driven by Sean Connery in Diamonds are Forever isn\u2019t a problem in itself. The problem comes from how the car is used (or rather, filmed) at the end of the movie\u2019s Vegas-based chase sequence. In a desperate attempt to evade capture, Bond puts the Mustang on its two right wheels to slip down an alleyway, only to re-emerge on the other side with the car balanced on its left set. Producers clearly spotted the error, but botched the scene even further by adding an improbable car-rotating shot to justify the mistake. Sure, none of that was the car\u2019s fault \u2013 but it nonetheless forms a major part of an irredeemable gaffe.",
    "In any other Bond movie, a Japanese car might have seemed an odd choice, but the Tokyo backdrop of You Only Live Twice proved a fitting playground for Sean Connery and the Toyota 2000GT Roadster. Often considered the first seriously collectible Japanese car and the country\u2019s first supercar, the Roadster rips and roars through motorways and hills while maintaining the beauty of its cream exterior right to the last. Even cooler \u2013 and rare, in a Bond movie \u2013 the car spends the majority of its screen time being driven by Bond\u2019s accomplice, Akiko Wakabayashi\u2019s Aki.",
    "An underrated car for an underrated Bond, Timothy Dalton\u2019s Aston Martin V8 Vantage in The Living Daylights is nothing less than a supermodel of a machine, and possibly the best-looking brown (brown!) car of all time. Its gadgets were also pretty damn cool, too, giving 007 lasers, rockets and skis in a way that didn\u2019t seem gimmicky (take notes, Die Another Day) as he and cellist passenger Kara traverse snowy Slovakia. If ever we needed confirmation of the car\u2019s enduring legacy, the V8 Vantage returns to action in No Time to Die.",
    "A truly modern Aston Martin fit for the 20th century, the DBS V12 quickly became the envy of every well-pennied Brit the moment Craig\u2019s Bond set foot inside its suede-laden interior in Casino Royale. The car gets put through its paces, too, saving 007\u2019s life with its built-in defibrillator and then almost taking it again by somersaulting seven times through the Montenegro mountains \u2013 resulting in a Guinness World Record and a reported production bill of almost $1.2 million. A black version of the DBS V12 also appears in the opening sequence of Quantum of Solace, which is arguably the movie\u2019s best \u2013 one guess why.",
    "You knew it was coming. Throughout much of The Spy Who Loved Me, Roger Moore\u2019s Lotus Esprit S1 is a decidedly unremarkable, ugly car \u2013 until he drives it off a bridge and turns it into a submarine, that is. The car produces fins, propellers and a roof-mounted missile that somehow manages to shoot a helicopter out of the sky, all before taking audiences on a picturesque aquatic journey through Sicilian waters. It\u2019s the movie\u2019s most famous, most ridiculous scene \u2013 and peak Moore \u2013 but one nonetheless seared into the collective consciousness of \u201870s Bond.",
    "It had to be, didn\u2019t it? Not only is the Aston Martin DB5 Bond\u2019s most iconic car, it's also the character\u2019s most popular. After first appearing in 1964\u2019s Goldfinger, the DB5 would go on to feature in Thunderball, GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, Casino Royale, Skyfall, Spectre and \u2013 spoilers? \u2013 No Time to Die. Three different 007 actors have driven the car, and each has looked just as cool doing so as the last. The DB5 is everything Bond is, but in car form \u2013 stylish, elegant, aggressive, quintessentially British \u2013 and has become, undeniably, the vehicular face of the franchise. Whoever inherits the 007 mantle from Craig in the future, you can be sure we\u2019ll see them rolling up in an Aston Martin DB5 at some point."
