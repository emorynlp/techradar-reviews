  "article": [
    "A recent rumor claimed that AMD could have Ryzen 5000 XT processors in the pipeline \u2013 somewhat faster variants of existing models \u2013 but it seems this isn\u2019t the case after all.",
    "This came from well-known leaker Patrick Schur who tweeted about spotting a B2 revision of Ryzen 5000 chips, speculating that this could be juiced-up XT refreshes of some CPUs \u2013 after all, AMD did this with Ryzen 3000 models.",
    "However, AMD has reportedly said that while this revision process is indeed underway, it\u2019s all about enabling greater manufacturing capacity for Ryzen 5000 CPUs, rather than any refresh that brings faster clock speeds.",
    "According to the statement made by AMD to Polish tech site Benchmark.pl (flagged up by PC Gamer), Team Red asserts that: \u201cAs part of our continued effort to expand our manufacturing and logistics capabilities, AMD will gradually rollover AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Desktop Processors to B2 Revision over the next six months. It does not bring functionality or performance improvements, and no BIOS update is required.\u201d",
    "Note that this statement is translated from Polish, and we have to take it on trust that it comes from a genuine AMD source \u2013 so sprinkle some condiments around liberally \u2013 but the XT rumor was always a bit of a leap in the dark itself, anyway.",
    "That said, XT chips could still be coming further down the line \u2013 who knows. Particularly if AMD feels the need to fire some silicon ammunition back at Intel\u2019s Rocket Lake chips, and Ryzen 6000 processors aren\u2019t coming this year as rumored, and won\u2019t debut until 2022 (which would mean Intel\u2019s next-gen Alder Lake CPUs could emerge unchallenged, of course).",
    "If this is true, the good news is that stock issues around some of the harder to find AMD Zen 3-based processors \u2013 like the higher-end Ryzen 9 5900X and the midrange powerhouse Ryzen 5 5600X \u2013 could ease considerably in the near-ish future. That would obviously be a very welcome prospect.",
    "Furthermore, these B2 Revision chips will work without the need for any firmware update, as mentioned in the AMD statement."
