    "Call of Duty: Vanguard\u2019s open-beta on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ends on September 22, and if you haven\u2019t jumped in already, it lets players battle it out across a number of popular game modes like Team Deathmatch and Search and Destroy.",
    "There are some neat new additions to Call of Duty\u2019s renowned twitch-based gameplay, too, such as the ability to blind fire behind cover, destructible environments, and the excellent Capitol Hill mode \u2013 where eight teams battle it out in a tournament-style fight to the finish.",
    "But don't expect a revolution from Activision\u2019s annual series. Somewhat predictably, the new World War 2-inspired setting doesn\u2019t see Call of Duty deviate too far from its tried-and-tested approach, for better or for worse.",
    "One thing that does stand out, though \u2013 almost to a jarring degree \u2013 is Call of Duty: Vanguard\u2019s new in-game announcer. The games have always had an announcer that lets you know what type of mode you\u2019re playing, notifies you when your killstreaks are ready, and if there\u2019s an enemy UAV in the air. But this time there\u2019s a surprising new callout.",
    "Call of Duty: Vanguard rips a page straight out of Halo\u2019s multiplayer for the first time by audibly calling out when you pull off a \u201cdouble kill\u201d or \u201ctriple kill\u201d. And for some reason, maybe in part due to the rather serious nature of the World War 2 setting, it feels incredibly weird.",
    "Gunning down enemies across Call of Duty: Vanguard\u2019s realistic-looking maps and hearing \u201cdouble kill!\u201d seems at odds with many aspects of the game\u2019s more serious design. Yes, Call of Duty\u2019s multiplayer has never been grounded in complete realism, of course, but the idea that your commanding officer or squad leader would cheerfully acknowledge when you\u2019ve killed more than one person in a row continued to throw me during my play sessions.",
    "It\u2019s also strange to see this feature in Call of Duty: Vanguard, considering so many Call of Duty games have come and gone before without including it. I can\u2019t imagine it was high on many fans\u2019 wishlists either, but who knows? It\u2019s a curious addition, to say the least.",
    "It\u2019s not even that I dislike the new callouts per se, as being told you\u2019ve managed to best multiple opponents in quick succession has always given me an endorphin-fueled tingle. Maybe that\u2019s because the odds are stacked against you in Halo when it comes to taking down more than one opponent. It often takes significantly more effort to kill someone in Halo than it does in Call of Duty, and often streaks are obtained thanks to being in the right place at the right time.",
    "But in Call of Duty: Vanguard? Enemies tend to drop faster than fruit flies after 24 hours on Earth, so it isn\u2019t quite as satisfying. Who knows, maybe that\u2019s why the callout was introduced in the first place.",
    "Call of Duty: Vanguard releases on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 5, 2021. It\u2019ll now release ahead of EA\u2019s Battlefield 2042, which has slipped from its initial October 22 release date to November 19, 2021. Halo Infinite, meanwhile, is set to release on December 9, 2021, and its multiplayer mode is free-to-play."
