  "article": [
    "The Fable series is finally coming back to Xbox Series X after an 11 year hiatus, but Microsoft hasn\u2019t shared any details since the game\u2019s initial reveal other than a delightfully whimsical and humorous trailer.",
    "However, a job listing on Microsoft\u2019s website has shed new light on the next Fable game \u2013 and it points to the beloved series using an unlikely graphics engine this time around.",
    "According to the recent job listing, which is for a Software Engineer at Turn10 Studios, Fable will be built using the ForzaTech engine, which powers the Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon games. The listing states that the team is looking for a candidate who can enrich \u201cthe toolset to support an open world action RPG \u2013 Fable\u201d and also add new features like \u201cray tracing to support the next console generation\u201d.",
    "Using an engine that was previously used to make racing games may seem like an odd choice, but we\u2019ve seen companies such as EA create engines and development tools that are multipurpose. The Frostbite engine, which powers the likes of FIFA 21 and Battlefield 6, has been used in multiple titles and genres across EA\u2019s portfolio, with admittedly varying degrees of success.",
    "But should we be concerned that Fable is using the ForzaTech engine? Probably not. The Forza Horizon games have shown that the engine is certainly adept for delivering a rich and vibrant open world experience, and it\u2019s proven to be scalable across PC and Xbox, which is always a plus for developers.",
    "Fable is also being developed by PlayGround Games, the developer behind the Forza Horizon series. It means it\u2019s being handled by a dev that\u2019s intimately familiar with Turn10 Studios\u2019 ForzaTech engine, which should alleviate any growing pains and ensure Fable will take full advantage of the available toolsets.",
    "Fable joins the likes of Starfield, Perfect Dark, Halo Infinite, The Elder Scrolls 6 and Forza Motorsport as some of the most anticipated games on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. It\u2019s unclear how long we\u2019ll have to wait until we see more of the game, but a 2021 release is unlikely. All of these games, including Fable, will also launch day and date on Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service."
