    "One disappointment with the original Samsung Galaxy Z Flip was that it had a slightly dated chipset, despite carrying a very high price. That was remedied for the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, but we worried that it would be repeated with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3. Now though, we have evidence that this upcoming phone won\u2019t compromise on power.",
    "A handset with the model number SM-F711U has been spotted on Geekbench (a benchmarking platform), and this is believed to be the US version of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3. As with all Geekbench listings, it includes some specs, key among which is the Snapdragon 888 chipset.",
    "That\u2019s the same high-end chipset as you\u2019ll find in US models of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range, among a number of other 2021 flagship phones, so it\u2019s reassuring to see it here. Technically it\u2019s no longer the best Snapdragon chipset \u2013 that\u2019s the Snapdragon 888 Plus \u2013 but it\u2019s in line with most of this year\u2019s flagships.",
    "Along with that, the benchmark also mentions 8GB of RAM and Android 11, with the phone achieving a single-core score of 1,015 and a multi-core result of 3,161. Those are solid results if not quite the best we\u2019ve seen, but we\u2019re reluctant to read too much into benchmark numbers, especially pre-release ones.",
    "We would of course also take all of this with a pinch of salt, but if the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 really does have a Snapdragon 888 chipset then that\u2019s very good news, especially as the phone is also rumored to actually be cheaper than its predecessor was at launch.",
    "The less than top-tier power in the original Galaxy Z Flip presumably helped keep the price a lot more reasonable than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2\u2019s, so if Samsung can get the price lower still here while offering genuinely flagship specs, then this could end up being the closest thing to a mainstream foldable phone we\u2019ve seen so far.",
    "We should find out for sure whether Samsung\u2019s achieved that on August 11, as that\u2019s when the company is rumored to be unveiling the Galaxy Z Flip 3, likely alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 range.",
