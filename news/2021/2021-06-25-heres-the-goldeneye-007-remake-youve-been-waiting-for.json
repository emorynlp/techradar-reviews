  "article": [
    "Update: Unfortunately this GoldenEye 007 remake has now been pulled from the Far Cry 5 servers after Ubisoft received a copyright complaint. Krollywood, the map creator, has said the complaints came from MGM, the studio behind James Bond, and who have been known to issue takedowns against GoldenEye fan projects in the past. Ubisoft did not name MGM in its own statement about the dispute though.",
    "The original story continues below",
    "Original: The GoldenEye 007 remake you\u2019ve been waiting for has finally been released, but not in the way you might have expected. All of the levels from the classic N64 title have been recreated in Far Cry 5, giving you a brand new reason to download Ubisoft\u2019s 2018 release.",
    "PSN user Perfect-Dark1982 recreated the GoldenEye maps using Far Cry 5\u2019s extensive level creation tools which include assets from a massive selection of Ubisoft titles (including Assassin\u2019s Creed and Watch Dogs). The GoldenEye levels are available to download and play right now through the game\u2019s Arcade mode.",
    "Unfortunately, even with Far Cry 6 coming out soon, we wouldn't get your hopes set on a true next-gen GoldenEye 007 experience. Unlike most games in the Far Cry franchise to date, Far Cry 6 will lack a map editor at launch, though given how much creators and players seem to love the mode we might see it return in some form in the future.",
    "If you want to know how to play this GoldenEye 007 remake for yourself through Far Cry 5, here's how to do it.",
    "If you\u2019re playing on PlayStation you\u2019ll want to look up the user 'Perfect-Dark1982' in Far Cry 5\u2019s Arcade mode. From there you should see their level creations, including the GoldenEye level remakes.",
    "Alternatively, if you\u2019re playing Far Cry 5 on PC or Xbox you\u2019ll want to look for the 'GE64' maps from user 'MapSwapper2' who has ported the levels over to those platforms."
