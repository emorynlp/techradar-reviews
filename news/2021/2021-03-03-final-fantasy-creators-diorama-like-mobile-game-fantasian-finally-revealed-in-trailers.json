  "article": [
    "There\u2019s been a lot of hype for Final Fantasy co-creater Hironobu Sakaguchi\u2019s and studio Mistwalker\u2019s upcoming Apple Arcade game, Fantasian, and its beautiful diorama-based settings. But now we\u2019ve gotten a peek at the story and gameplay in a pair of new trailers.",
    "The \u2018Features\u2019 trailer peels back the cover a bit on the locales, which are actually around 150 models built by hand and scanned into the game, making it look like it\u2019s set in a realm of miniatures that adds tactility to an otherwise digital experience.",
    "The Features trailer also shows how the combat and other gameplay will look \u2013 namely combat, which follows RPG convention with party characters lined up on one side of the screen taking turns attacking monsters on the other. Of course, if you want to deal with the monsters later, you can turn on the \u2018Dimengeon System,\u2019 which collects encountered enemies in a so-called dimengeon (dungeon dimension) which players can dive into to fight them all at once.",
    "The \u2018Story\u2019 trailer is less substantial \u2013 really a series of clips without dialogue or context \u2013 so you\u2019ll have to interpret what\u2019s happening for yourself:",
    "The video\u2019s description explains more of the story: players take the role of Leo, who wakes in a strange land with only a lone memory for company. To restore the rest, he and his friends will have to solve the mystery of a strange mechanical infection slowly spreading all over the world \u2013 a story written by Sakaguchi and scored by Final Fantasy legend Nobuo Uematsu.",
    "Fantasian was originally announced as an Apple Arcade exclusive in late 2019, but we hadn\u2019t heard much about it since \u2013 until a month ago, when Sakaguchi started tweeting out images of the dioramas that the game\u2019s environments are based on.",
    "Now we\u2019ve seen some of these diorama-built settings in action in the above trailers, miniature sets built by special effects veterans of Godzilla films, Attack on Titan, and Ultraman, the Features trailer description states.",
    "The game is expected to come out in May 2021, and will be an Apple Arcade exclusive, playable on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs."
