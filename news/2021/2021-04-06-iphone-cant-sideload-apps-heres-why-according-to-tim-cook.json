  "article": [
    "In an interview with Kara Swisher on her New York Times podcast Sway, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke lightly on a range of topics, including iOS 14.5\u2019s upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature, augmented reality, and user privacy in general.",
    "But when the discussion turned to Apple\u2019s legal fight with Epic Games to keep the latter\u2019s third-party store off iPhones, which is set to meetin court on May 3, 2021, Cook also said, very plainly, why you can only get apps through the App Store.",
    "\u201cIf you had side loading, you would break the privacy and security model,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou\u2019d be opening up a huge vector on another store.\u201d",
    "This has been Apple\u2019s argument against allowing users to download software outside the App Store and beyond the company\u2019s carefully-crafted iPhone and iPad experience \u2013 and Cook positioned Apple\u2019s role as curatorially protective.",
    "\u201cIn any given week, 100,000 applications come into the app review. 40,000 of them are rejected. Most of them are rejected because they don\u2019t work or don\u2019t work like they say that they work,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou can imagine if curation went away, what would occur to the App Store in a very short amount of time.\u201d",
    "Apple first launched the App Store in 2008, and has kept a tight grip on the user experience \u2013 and quality control \u2013 of the iPhone ever since by keeping strict and family-friendly standards for the apps it allows to be downloaded.",
    "\u201cPeople trust Apple in a way that they didn't trust the small shareware payment processors of the 90s and early 2000s,\u201d app creator James Thomson, whose app PCalc was one of the first 500 to launch on the App Store, told TechRadar back in July. \u201cApple made it feasible to sell digital downloads of apps to people who weren't technically savvy, and broadened the market considerably.\u201d",
    "While iPhone apps enjoyed a greater reputation for reliability on iOS devices, developers still chafed at the strict requirements, occasionally arbitrary removal from the App Store for infractions of its policies, and the 30% cut Apple took years after competing stores \u2013 like the Epic Games Store \u2013 lowered their takes to single-digit percentages.",
    "Apple halved its App Store cut down to 15% for most developers (those making under $1 million in annual profits) back in November following Epic\u2019s formal legal challenge, which did not seem like coincidence.",
    "Cook even referred to this shift in the interview, and what it means for policies going forward: \u201cThe App Store is not cast in concrete, you know? And so we\u2019ve changed over time.\u201d",
    "Of course, reducing Apple\u2019s cut is very different than allowing another store \u2013 and company \u2013 to generate income on iPhones and iPads. We may have to wait for the outcome of the Apple vs. Epic lawsuit to see if the former\u2019s position ever changes on this issue.",
