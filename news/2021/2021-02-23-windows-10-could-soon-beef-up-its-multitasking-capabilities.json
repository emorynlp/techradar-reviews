    "Windows 10 could be getting a new multitasking feature to allow multiple windows to be easily snapped on your desktop \u2013 plus those running multi-monitor setups might be able to use different virtual desktops with each display in the future (more on that later).",
    "First off, the concept of \u2018snap-based task groups\u2019 was pointed out by well-known Microsoft leaker Albacore on Twitter.",
    "So, as you can see, the idea is that you\u2019ll be able to drag app windows to the corner of the desktop, and \u201cthey\u2019ll automatically size to fit perfectly, side by side\u201d (as the options shown make clear, when resizing a snapped window, any adjacent snapped window will be automatically adjusted to fit). In short, it will be easier to work with multiple snap-based apps.",
    "Of course, the feature may not make the cut for the release version of Windows 10, and isn\u2019t even in testing with Windows Insiders at the moment \u2013 it appears to be something that Microsoft is working on internally. Watch this space, as ever.",
    "Further multitasking powers could be granted to Windows 10 users by giving them the ability to have separate virtual desktops on different displays, for those running a multi-monitor setup.",
    "The emphasis, again, is on this being a possibility rather than reality, but it certainly looks like Microsoft is working to beef up the ways in which we can multitask with Windows 10.",
    "This additional functionality could arrive in the big update for the second half of 2021, but we\u2019ll just have to see. That update, of course, ushers in the whole \u2018Sun Valley\u2019 interface revamp we\u2019ve been hearing so much about in recent times, and it\u2019s expected to be a big deal, with the first 21H1 update being a minor affair (just the same as the last one).",
