    "The puppy snatcher is back with Disney finally revealing the making of its most notorious villain. Want to watch Cruella online now? The good news is all Disney Plus subscribers now can no matter where you are.",
    "Long before her penchant for Dalmatian puppies and fur coats, Cruella went by Estella. A poor, orphaned girl who often ran into trouble with her friends, Horace and Jasper, Estella has dreams of making it big in the world of fashion with her bold designs.",
    "Set to the backdrop of 70s London where the punk era was in full flow, it's not long before doors start to open as Estella meets Baroness Von Hellman (Emma Thompson) and she begins to move amongst the crowd of the rich and famous.",
    "A manic and twisty tale, Cruella tells the story of how power and influence put into the wrong hands can quickly transpire to create a monster.",
    "Initially arriving on Disney Plus Premier Access, you'll now be able to watch Cruella online with a regular Disney Plus subscription. If you haven't already, get started by signing up now so you can stream it from anywhere.",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck into we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at a mere $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN Plus to your subscription price.",
    "The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as The Great, Upload, Helstrom and Normal People. Bringing further great value ESPN Plus offers loads of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "Disney Plus just gets better and better with its original content, on top of old favorites. It's the place to watch Loki, which is just one in the latest in a string of recent blockbuster releases exclusive to the platform, including Luca, The Mandalorian, Mulan's live-action remake, Hamilton, and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star on Disney Plus that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy. It costs a tiny bit more, but is worth it based on our initial impressions - and you can still save big by going with an annual subscription.",
    "Even more Disney Plus"
