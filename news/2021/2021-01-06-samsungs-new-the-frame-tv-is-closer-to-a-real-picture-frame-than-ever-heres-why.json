  "article": [
    "Samsung's The Frame TV is one of the most unique offerings in the TV maker\u2019s annual product ranges, and its 2021 iteration is no different.",
    "This year\u2019s version of the fashion-forward set \u2013 which apes the form of a picture frame and packs in a dedicated Art Mode to display artworks and photography when not in use \u2013 is one of the first sets Samsung has unveiled during CES 2021. And it\u2019s come with some notable changes from previous iterations of the set.",
    "The 2021 Frame TV refines its aesthetic philosophy, with a thinner-than-ever body that's just 24.9mm thick \u2013 that compares to 45.8mm for the 2020 model, meaning it's almost halved in depth.",
    "Perhaps most notably, the 43-inch model will be compatible with a portrait view, meaning you can mount it however you like to fit in with other photos or paintings on your wall. It won\u2019t be able to rotate on demand, though \u2013 you\u2019ll need the Samsung Sero for that \u2013 and we wouldn\u2019t recommend this for regular TV watching. But it may be a good fit for those mainly wanting to use Samsung\u2019s new TikTok smart TV app.",
    "There are also new bezel options for a greater variety of decors and styles, rather than the simple reds, whites, browns, and blacks of previous models. We\u2019re told users will be able to opt for bezels of varying styles and sizes, \u201cfrom slim, neutral, and minimalist to big, ornate, and bold [...] With near-endless options for customization\u201d.",
    "When it comes to the Art Store, subscribers to the 1,400 paywalled artworks (beyond the 20 or so thrown in for free) will get the benefit of an \u201cAI-based auto-curation technology\u201d to help match you with images you\u2019ll like. We wouldn\u2019t back any algorithm as much as a discerning critic, of course, but we expect it\u2019ll be useful for picking your decor nonetheless.",
    "Samsung tells us that The Frame has been a growing success for the company, with sales increasing by 170% (almost tripling, then) between its 2017 and 2020 iterations. We gave last year\u2019s model a strong four stars for its impressive and stylish design, even if we knocked it a star for its edge-lit panel and average processing.",
    "The Frame is a boon for occasional TV watchers who are mainly concerned with how the TV looks the rest of the day \u2013 you\u2019ll have to look at it on your wall or counter, after all. With a proven record of steady improvements, and more customization options than ever, this year\u2019s The Frame may be the most worthwhile yet \u2013 and we\u2019ll be sure to let you know once we\u2019ve put it through our tests."
