    "Apple TV Plus is a unique beast in the VOD streaming jungle. It\u2019s a platform built almost exclusively on original programming like The Morning Show, with only a handful of licensed titles compared to Netflix, which has hundreds. Subsequently, it has a slender content library, but it only costs $4.99 a month. And that's not the only way it differs to the streaming giant - it also comes with an Apple TV Plus free trial.",
    "Yes, before you pay a dime, you\u2019re likely entitled to an Apple TV Plus free trial. It'll provide complimentary access to critically acclaimed and Golden Globe-nominated films and TV shows; a burgeoning line-up of projects filled with A-list talent.",

    "Anyone new to Apple TV Plus can make the most of a 7-day free trial before being charged the Apple TV Plus cost of $4.99 a month (or $49.99 if you opt for the annual plan). To sign-up you\u2019ll need to:",
    "If the service doesn\u2019t grab you, remember to cancel before the 7-day trial ends to avoid being charged. Otherwise, payment will continue to be taken each month.",
    "Students and tech-heads are among those who could easily bag an Apple TV Plus free trial \u2013 and incredibly, enjoy Apple\u2019s eclectic line-up of shows for three months or even longer!",
    "If you\u2019re studying at a degree-granting university or college, all your entertainment dreams have come true. Not only does a subscription to the Apple Music student plan mean paying $4.99 rather than $9.99 a month, but Apple TV Plus is thrown in at no extra charge for a limited time.",
    "Previously you could get a whole year free with the purchase of an Apple device. Now you can get three months of Apple TV Plus absolutely free when you purchase an Apple device: that's any eligible iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac. Just remember to redeem the deal within 90 days of purchase.",
    "Additionally, if you haven\u2019t already signed-up for Apple TV Plus, then you can trial it free for a month as part of an Apple One subscription. There are three plans available, all of which include Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and iCloud storage.",
    "Paying members are being rewarded too. Apple are currently crediting $4.99 to your Apple account to spend in the App Store \u2013 which you can also use to pay for your TV Plus sub. Result!",
    "The platform has around 60 titles currently \u2013 predominately Apple Originals \u2013 which span a diverse array of genres. There are feature films, talk shows, animated movies and documentaries (Tiny World is narrated by Ant Man himself, Paul Rudd!). These sit alongside Golden Globe-nominated and critically acclaimed series like Ted Lasso, Dickinson, and M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s Servant, with a side order of entertainment for the kids.",
    "Apple TV Plus has also spent millions acquiring a handful of licensed programmes and highly-anticipated movies to keep audiences engaged. 80\u2019s favorite Fraggle Rock is now exclusive to the platform, in addition to the Peanuts cartoons (A Charlie Brown Christmas etc.) and the Tom Hanks drama Greyhound.",
    "Newer additions include spooky thriller, Calls. At the other end of the spectrum, you can enjoy musical comedy Schmigadoon!, streaming now.",
    "And there\u2019s soooooo much more goodness planned. Foundation, based on the science fiction novels of Isaac Asimov, premieres in the fall, while projects involving Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Prince Harry are just a few in the pipeline."
