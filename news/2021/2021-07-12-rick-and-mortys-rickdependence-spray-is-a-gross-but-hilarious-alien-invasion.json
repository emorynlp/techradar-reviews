    "Spoilers for this week's episode of Rick and Morty follow.",
    "Wow, this season of Rick and Morty is especially horny. First Mr. Nimbus, then Rick and Summer\u2019s apocalypse sex crawl, and now experimental monster sperm. When the show reaches for low-brow humor, it reaches down deep. While definitely not its smartest episode, the 'what am I watching?' factor of 'Rickdependence Spray' offers enough morbid curiosity to hold your attention until the end.",
    "This week\u2019s episode sees Morty on a sort of 'take your son to work day' with Beth at the Horse Hospital. When Morty discovers the breeding mount (we'll let you look that one up), the obvious happens and shows us that Morty really has no limits to how far he\u2019s willing to let his teenage hormones take him. After a week of using the machine for self-pleasure, Morty discovers Rick using one of the barrels of 'horse' semen for an experiment that can only go wrong if you\u2019re not using horse semen. And because Morty would rather do anything than own up to his shame, boom \u2013 monster sperm alien invasion.",
    "Last week\u2019s 'A Rickconvenient Mort' missed the mark because it didn\u2019t go far enough with its concept and environment themes. 'Rickdependence Spray' might be disgusting, but it has the opposite effect. It\u2019s outlandish, funny and raunchy enough for you to keep watching with your jaw to the floor, just to see how far the show is willing to take its gross premise. this episode proves there is no limit to how far the Rick and Morty writers will go for some A-grade comedy.",
    "I\u2019m not saying that this episode doesn\u2019t hit the same issues as last week\u2019s. We\u2019ve seen plenty of plots where the Earth is threatened by one kind of invasion or another. Even this season\u2019s 'Mortiplicity' starts with a similar premise. The plot is familiar, but the execution is terrific. It plays with fans\u2019 expectations that the show has no boundaries and, for better or worse, it delivers. Every time you think it can\u2019t get any worse than giant flying sperm, there is something in the next scene to top it.",
    "What works especially well about this episode is that it's driven by one of Morty\u2019s screw-ups; a screw-up so bad it might be worthy of being cataloged as one of Morty\u2019s Mind Blowers. The nice twist is, nobody else but Morty knows that the situation is his fault. Since Morty is the opposite of Rick, there\u2019s never any clever solution. It just gets a lot worse before it gets better.",
    "There are a few Rick-focused elements in the episode, but it\u2019s never the point of 'Rickdependence Spray'. The CHUD \u2013 AKA the underground horse people \u2013 reveal is a classic Rick moment, but pretty brief. As we\u2019ve seen many times, he has lots of enemies. Moments like those only work best when they show how far in the deep end he is, and when the episode functions as a smart commentary on Rick\u2019s depression and loneliness. Instead, in this episode, it just adds to Morty\u2019s larger story.",
    "That said, there is a limit to how far the show\u2019s crass humor can go. I could have done without Beth and Summer\u2019s 'men don\u2019t listen to women' storyline. It\u2019s a very obvious B plot that doesn\u2019t hold as much weight as the rest of the episode. In fact, it\u2019s probably more cringeworthy than the flying sperm, horse pregnancy, or the incest space baby that caps off the end of the episode \u2013 and that's saying something. The jokes don\u2019t land particularly well and if anything, it just feels tired and uncomfortable to watch the president and his council ignore Beth and Summer\u2019s ideas.",
    "'Rickdependence Spray' is an episode you have to see to believe. I appreciate that despite the episode\u2019s namesake, it\u2019s less focused on being a pop culture parody and more determined to be its own extremely weird thing. While some of parts of this episode are predictable, being a witness to the show\u2019s brand of debauchery still has its moments, especially when it decides that nothing is taboo.",
    "Sometimes, it just pays off to be juvenile when it\u2019s genuinely funny. You\u2019ll never be able to look at the Grand Canyon the same way again after this episode.",
    "Rick and Morty season 5 airs every Sunday on Adult Swim in the US, and every Monday on E4 in the UK."
