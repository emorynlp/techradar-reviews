    "Spoilers for the latest episode of WandaVision follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "Outside the Hex field, Monica Rambeau and Agent Jimmy Woo continue driving to meet her contact. Woo tells her that Darcy got past the last bit of the firewall at SWORD HQ, discovering R&D reports on a secret project called Cataract. He says that Hayward wasn\u2019t decommissioning Vision, he was trying to bring him back online \u2013 but nothing worked until Wanda stole Vision\u2019s body. Hayward is tracking Vision because he wants his \u201csentient weapon\u201d back \u2013 Woo points out that someone needs to tell Wanda what\u2019s going on.",
    "Wanda wakes up, realizing Vision isn\u2019t next to her. The show cuts to her talking directly to the camera, as if she\u2019s being interviewed. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve all been there, right? Letting our fear and anger get the best of us, intentionally expanding the borders of the false world we created\u2026\u201d",
    "A flashback to SWORD soldiers running away from the expanding Hex field.",
    "Billy and Tommy run into the bedroom, telling Wanda their videogame is freaking out \u2013 the controllers keep shifting eras, and even morph into playing cards. Wanda hides under the covers and says she\u2019s resting her eyes. Billy tells her his head feels really noisy \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like it. Wanda just wants to stay in bed. She tells the interviewer she\u2019s planning on taking a \u201cquarantine-style staycation\u201d as punishment for her \u201creckless evening\u201d \u2013 a whole day to herself. She pulls down the covers and realizes she\u2019s still wearing her Scarlet Witch outfit from Halloween.",
    "Wanda comes downstairs and grabs some almond milk from the fridge. When she turns back after grabbing some cereal, it\u2019s glitched into a carton of dairy milk \u2013 then the carton changes into a bottle. Wanda tells the interviewer she\u2019s not sure what that\u2019s all about \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s probably just a case of the Mondays. Am I right?\u201d",
    "The opening credits show Wanda\u2019s name written in a variety of formats, before revealing a \u2018WandaVision: created by Wanda Maximoff\u2019 title card.",
    "At the SWORD base outside the Hex, an agent tells Hayward that the WandaVision signal has disappeared \u2013 it\u2019s now just dead air. He tells her they launch today \u2013 she acknowledges and walks away.",
    "Vision wakes up in the circus. One of the performers confuses him for a clown and tells him he\u2019s late for a rehearsal with the escape artist \u2013 who just happens to be Darcy. She tells the unseen interviewer that her new gig \u201cdoesn\u2019t really speak to my skill set\u201d.",
    "Vision recognizes Darcy from outside the energy field \u2013 he says they locked eyes, that there was an understanding. She doesn\u2019t remember him, though, and walks off.",
    "Wanda asks the kids if they\u2019ve seen Vision. They say they haven\u2019t and offer to go and look for him. \u201cWell, if he doesn\u2019t wanna be here, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d she replies. Billy asks her about when Pietro mentioned \u201cre-killing Dad\u201d on Halloween. She tells Billy not to believe anything that man says \u2013 \u201che is not your uncle\u201d. They ask who he is. She admits that she doesn\u2019t have all the answers \u2013 in fact, \u201cI have no answers. I\u2019m starting to believe that everything is meaningless. You\u2019re welcome to draw your own conclusions, but that\u2019s just where I\u2019m at.\u201d",
    "Wanda admits to the camera that she might have gone a bit dark, but reasons that the kids must have inherited tough skin from their vibranium dad.",
    "Agnes arrives at the door and offers to take the boys to give Wanda some space.",
    "Wanda settles down to watch TV, but the TV and furniture start glitching and transforming into earlier models from previous episodes. Wanda uses her powers to change everything back.",
    "She assures the interviewer she\u2019s fine.",
    "On the edge of the Hex field, they meet Monica\u2019s contact, Major Goodner. Monica tells her that her mother would have appreciated her loyalty. \u201cShe\u2019s not the only one we\u2019re loyal to, Captain.\u201d Goodner shows Rambeau and Woo the incursion vehicle they\u2019ve constructed.",
    "Back at the circus, Vision continues to follow Darcy, trying to persuade her that she was part of a team monitoring a supernatural anomaly. She thinks he\u2019s asking her out on a date, and she reluctantly agrees. After a weak piece of distraction involving a mime artist, Vision touches Darcy\u2019s head to restore her real memories. \u201cPart of me secretly wanted a guest spot on the show but seriously, that sucks.\u201d",
    "She tells Vision she has answers, but first they have to run away from the circus. With Darcy due to go on stage, they steal a van and hit the road. Vision asks if his children are safe, and about the identity of \u201cthat imposter, Pietro\u201d. She can\u2019t help him.",
    "In the house, the glitching is increasing \u2013 even the stork is back. Wanda admits she doesn\u2019t understand \u201cwhy it\u2019s all falling apart and why I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d",
    "\u201cDo you think maybe this is what you deserve?\u201d asks the unseen interviewer.",
    "COMMERCIAL BREAK",
    "A woman sits alone on a park bench. \u201cFeeling depressed?\u201d asks the voiceover. \u201cLike the world goes on without you? Do you just want to be left alone? Ask your doctor about Nexus\u2026\u201d Apparently it\u2019s a unique anti-depressant that works to anchor you back to your reality \u2013 or the reality of your choice. \u201cYou should not take Nexus unless your doctor has cleared you to move on with your life. Nexus: because the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Or does it?\u201d",
    "At Agnes\u2019s house, Billy tells her she likes it there. Agnes asks if that\u2019s because her rabbit, Se\u00f1or Scratchy, is such a good listener, but Billy says it\u2019s actually because it\u2019s quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet, Agnes,\u201d he explains. \u201cOn the inside.\u201d",
    "Tommy asks Agnes if she thinks their mom is okay. Agnes says they don\u2019t have to worry \u2013 Wanda can do anything, she\u2019s supermom. Agnes admits to camera that she has a tendency to sugar-coat things.",
    "Outside the anomaly, Rambeau dresses in a spacesuit, ready to drive the rover into Westview, and vows to save Darcy. Goodner tells Woo that she\u2019s driving SWORD\u2019s most heavily armored space rover \u2013 Rambeau will \u201csail right through, unharmed\u201d.",
    "Monica accelerates towards the energy field, but she doesn\u2019t sail through it \u2013 it\u2019s more like smashing into a wall. She tries to push through but the field\u2019s density matches hers, and causes the front wheels to ride upwards. The field starts to absorb the rover \u2013 Goodner says the vehicle is disintegrating, but Woo corrects her, telling her it\u2019s being \u201crewritten\u201d. He gets on the radio to tell Monica to get out of the rover before it absorbs her. The rover is pulled in further before being thrown out. The front half of the vehicle been transformed into a standard 4x4.",
    "Monica looks at the field and looks at Woo \u2013 she says she can get through. As Woo urges her not to, she sprints back towards the Hex field and forces herself inside. As she fights her way into Westview, she hears flashbacks of her mother, Carol Danvers, and Nick Fury.",
    "When she emerges, her eyes are glowing blue. Her body has been changed somehow, and she can see the Hex field glowing. She runs towards the town.",
    "Darcy tells Vision the story of his death \u2013 how Wanda killed him to save half the universe, before Thanos rewound time, killed him all over again, and undid the universe-saving. They\u2019re stopped by yet another red light. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of overkill out here in the sticks, don\u2019t you think?\u201d As the light goes green and they try to pull away, a team arrives to repair the lights, holding them up further.",
    "Vision tells the unseen interviewer that he thinks Wanda is \u201ccreating these impediments to stop me returning home. I\u2019m not amused.\u201d",
    "Vision tries to get his head around who he is. He understands his thoughts are based on Tony Stark\u2019s AI, JARVIS, and that his body was created by Ultron \u2013 but what does that make him now? Darcy assumed Wanda had just flicked a switch in his head, but that doesn\u2019t explain why he can\u2019t leave the Hex.",
    "\u201cWhat I do know is I\u2019ve been watching WandaVision for the past week,\u201d she adds, \u201cand the love you two have is real. You belong together.\u201d",
    "Monica arrives at Wanda\u2019s house and bursts in. Wanda asks how she got in here and tells her to get out of the house. Monica tries to warn her about Hayward\u2019s plans for Vision, but Wanda uses her powers to launch the SWORD agent into the air. The neighbors \u2013 including Dottie \u2013 look on. \u201cThe drones, the missiles, Pietro \u2013 all you do is lie\u2026\u201d argues Wanda. As Monica tries to explain SWORD had nothing to do with Pietro, Wanda slams her into the sidewalk. Monica\u2019s new powers activate and she\u2019s surrounded by blue energy as she hits the ground. Her eyes glow blue again.",
    "Monica tells Wanda that the only lies she\u2019s told are the ones Wanda put in her mouth, and challenges Wanda to take her out. Wanda pauses. Monica tells her that\u2019s what makes her different to Hayward, that Hayward is prepared to burn Westview to the ground to get what he wants. \u201cDon\u2019t let him make you the villain.\u201d",
    "\u201cMaybe I already am,\u201d answers Wanda.",
    "Agnes notices the disturbance through her front window.",
    "Monica tells Wanda she\u2019s not afraid of her. She says she also lost the person closest to her \u2013 \u201cthe worst thing I can think of has already happened to me and I can\u2019t change it, I can\u2019t undo it. I can\u2019t control this pain anymore and I don\u2019t think I want to, because it\u2019s my truth.\u201d",
    "Agnes interrupts, telling Rambeau she\u2019s outstayed her welcome, that Wanda\u2019s been through enough. She tells Wanda to run along.",
    "Monica tells her again to take the field down, but Wanda refuses. \u201cDon\u2019t make me hurt you,\u201d Wanda tells Monica.",
    "The traffic light repairs continue in front of Vision and Darcy, but before they can pull away, a class of kids crosses the road.",
    "Vision tells the interviewer he didn\u2019t realize how much Wanda had endured. He suddenly realizes it\u2019s absurd that he\u2019s sitting there talking when he could be with his wife. He phases through the roof of the van and flies away.",
    "In Agnes\u2019s house, Wanda asks where the twins are \u2013 Agnes says they\u2019re probably in the basement. She walks down the stairs and the boys are nowhere to be seen. She finds herself in a huge, creepy cellar, full of vines, with magical texts and skulls. Agnes walks into the room, holding her rabbit. \u201cWanda, Wanda, you didn\u2019t think you were the only magical girl in town, did you? The name\u2019s Agatha Harkness. Lovely to finally meet you, dear.\u201d She uses her magic to put something in Wanda\u2019s brain.",
    "The show cuts to the credits for an all-new TV show called \u2018Agatha All Along\u2019. A woman in witchy clothes morphs into 1950s Agnes, as the theme song reveals that she\u2019s been \u201cpulling every evil string\u201d throughout the series. The credits show her using her malevolent influence at Wanda and Vision\u2019s magic show, controlling Herb, watching Pietro arrive on the doorstep, and making Vision believe she was just an ordinary Westview resident under Wanda\u2019s spell. It even turns out she\u2019s the interviewer who\u2019s been grilling Wanda throughout the episode.",
    "\u201cAnd I killed Sparky, too!\u201d she laughs.",
    "PLEASE STAND BY",
    "MID-CREDITS STING",
    "Monica looks around Agnes\u2019s house, and opens the hatch to the basement. She sees the stairwell glowing with magical energy, and is taken aback when Pietro appears behind her. \u201cSnoopers gonna snoop,\u201d he says.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Talk about hiding in plain sight\u2026",
    "We always suspected that Agnes was much more than your average nosy neighbor, and WandaVision has left some pretty strong hints about her true identity. Even so, the reveal in the aptly titled \u2018Breaking the Fourth Wall\u2019 is a big enough deal to rival the surprise of Pietro turning up on Wanda\u2019s doorstep.",
    "It also highlights the writing team\u2019s instinctive understanding of what makes the best episodic TV work. Because as well as being a big-budget slice of MCU action, WandaVision is \u2013 at heart \u2013 a mystery, that revels in keeping us hanging on for the next piece of the puzzle. There\u2019s no point seeding clues or mysteries if you never provide any answers, but this show knows when to tease and when to deliver a colossal revelation.",
    "Okay, you don\u2019t need a Vision-scale intellect to spot that \u2018Agnes\u2019 is just Agatha Harkness shortened, or that Billy\u2019s inability to hear her thoughts means she can\u2019t be an ordinary Westview resident. Even the fact she wore a witch\u2019s outfit on Halloween feels like a blatant clue \u2013 in hindsight.",
    "But WandaVision consistently keeps things just ambiguous enough. So when Agatha takes the opportunity to tell Wanda who she is \u2013 how much is Kathryn Hahn enjoying herself at this point? \u2013 you\u2019re totally on board for the ride. Using the \u2018Agatha All Along\u2019 titles to explain Ms Harkness\u2019s evil schemes is possibly the most memorable sequence in a show that\u2019s already had more than its fair share. Is she really the show's Big Bad, or is someone else pulling the strings?",
    "While Agnes/Agatha undoubtedly steals the show, the episode doesn\u2019t just belong to her. The noughties\u2019 fascination with sitcom characters talking directly to the camera couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for WandaVision\u2019s story arc \u2013 if ever there was a time to get inside the characters\u2019 thoughts, this is it.",
    "Darcy and Vision also make for a fun double act, but our biggest questions now concern Monica Rambeau\u2019s newly acquired superpowers. They\u2019ve only been hinted at so far, but she could be well on the way to powering up to Avenger-level \u2013 as she did in the comics. What exactly do her powers allow her to do? And what will she do with them? It looks like she holds the key to getting the unfortunate residents of Westview out alive.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
