    "The loss of Loma's WBA (Super), WBO, and The Ring lightweight titles at the hands of Te\u00f3fimo L\u00f3pez sent shockwaves through the sport, and unceremoniously dumps the Ukrainian great right back at square one.",
    "Incredibly, this is just the second non-world title fight of Lomachenko's career, the first being his professional debut in 2013. But he's not planning to be belt-less for any amount of time, choosing Nakatani as his opponent specifically because of the Japanese fighter's strong performance against L\u00f3pez.",
    "They went the distance two years ago, with the American winning via unanimous decision - as he did against Loma. It was the only defeat of Nakatani's career, and though Lomachenko is by far the more storied of the two fighters, the scrapper from Osaka is taller by six inches and has the same reach advantage.",

    "The Lomachenko vs Nakatani fight takes place on Saturday, June 26 at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas in Paradise, Nevada.",
