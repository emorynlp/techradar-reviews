    "Samsung Display has announced that it will soon start mass producing the \"world\u2019s first\" 90Hz OLED panels for laptop and notebook devices.",
    "Although smartphone users have become accustomed to 90Hz and even 120Hz displays, it's a different story when it comes to laptops. LCD screens have been able to hit high refresh rates for some time, but OLED panels - which offer punchier, more vibrant visuals - currently top out at 60Hz.",
    "Samsung Display\u2019s announcement, however, could suggest that 90Hz OLED laptops could become more commonplace starting this year.",
    "In its announcement, the company said it will start producing 90Hz OLED screens in \u201cvery large quantities\u201d starting in March, adding that that \u201cseveral global IT companies\u201d are expected to release laptops that feature the new panels later this year.",
    "Samsung also confirmed that the panels are 14-inch in size, though it hasn\u2019t yet revealed any further details regarding aspect ratio or resolution. However, the company has said that the 90Hz will offer 10 times the fastest screen response time on the market today and deliver \u201chigh-speed driving that is on par with that of 120Hz LCD screens\u201d.",
    "While there are a number of OLED laptops already available - including the Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED and Samsung\u2019s own Galaxy Chromebook - these all deliver a 60Hz refresh rate. Samsung Display\u2019s move to mass produce 90Hz panels could trigger a wave of 14-inch laptops with faster refresh rates that deliver smoother-looking visuals for gaming and remote working.",
    "\u201cOLED display panels can best satisfy the diverse consumer needs for laptops used in telework, online education, video streaming, and gaming,\u201d the company said.",
    "While good news for those after punchier visuals, it\u2019s likely these incoming laptops won\u2019t be cheap. Samsung admits that a high-spec graphics card will be required to power the display, which is likely to have a hit on battery life too."
