    "We recently reported on rumors hinting at a return for the Dead Space series, likely on PS5 and Xbox Series X \u2013 and since then, more details have emerged in new reports.",
    "As suggested by Gematsu, a next-gen entry in the sci-fi survival franchise will be a \"reimagining\" of the original Dead Space games, rather than a direct sequel, with developer EA planning to officially reveal the new title during EA Play Live on July 22.",
    "The news follows earlier hints at the game\u2019s existence from GamesBeat\u2019s Jeff Grubb, who claimed, on the outlet\u2019s official podcast, that EA\u2019s Motive Studios \u2013 the studio behind Star Wars: Squadrons \u2013 is currently at work on a dormant EA IP. Both Eurogamer and VGC have also said this information aligns with their own sources.",
    "If true, a new Dead Space game would mark the first since the series\u2019 third outing in 2013. Following the release of Dead Space 3, EA shut down Visceral Studios \u2013 the original developer behind the franchise \u2013 in 2017.",
    "The series\u2019 co-creator, Glen Schofield, has since gone on to create a new third-person survival-horror game, The Callisto Protocol, which is being developed by Striking Distance and is scheduled for release in 2022.",
    "So, what could a \u201creimagining\u201d of the original Dead Space games look like? It seems logical that any new entry would stay faithful to the third-person roots of its predecessors, though beyond that, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Would we see the return of main protagonist Isaac Clarke, or a roster of entirely new characters?",
    "We\u2019ll have to wait until July 22 \u2013 if indeed these reports end up holding water.",
    "There\u2019s good reason to believe these rumors are legit, aside from lots of news outlets agreeing on the same thing.",
    "As per our earlier report, Dead Space writer and novelist Antony Johnston recently took to Twitter to tease that he\u2019s been working on a \u201cbig video game for almost two years.\u201d When pressed further on the nature of the project, Johnston cryptically replied by saying: \u201cyou play a character having a really bad time.\u201d",
    "Admittedly, that could refer to any number of games, but given that both tweets have since been deleted, we\u2019re hoping that Johnston may have given away a little more than he was supposed to \u2013 whatever the project might be.",
    "Still, if a new Dead Space game is indeed in the works, we\u2019re excited to see how it might utilize the PS5\u2019s new tech to create a genuinely frightening horror experience. The system\u2019s Tempest 3D audio tech would offer an interesting way to generate the illusion of creeping-up-behind-you noises, for instance, while its graphical power would make for some pretty visceral plasma cutter kills.",
    "Whatever happens, stay tuned to TechRadar for all the latest Dead Space updates.",
