    "From huge summer signings to big money takeovers, plus a steady stream of memorable matches, the 2021/22 Premier League season has already laid the groundwork to go down as one of the best of recent times.",
    "Follow our guide for all the best, easiest and free ways to get a Premier League live stream and catch every 2021/22 EPL fixture online wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "The title race is building up nicely to be a three-pronged battle for the crown, with Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Romelu Lukaku-led Chelsea making the early running, with Jurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool and Pep Guardiola\u2019s defending champs Man City nicely keeping pace.",
    "There will also be plenty of focus on Man United and their efforts to salvage a season that promised so much with the big money signings of Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and old boy Cristiano Ronaldo, yet has seen the Red Devils struggle.",
    "Elsewhere, the likes of West Ham and Brighton will be looking to keep up their good early season work as they look to break into the top four alongside the likes of Spurs, Arsenal and Everton.",
    "There\u2019s plenty of drama at the foot of the table, too, with Norwich already with a huge battle on their hands to prevent another return to the Championship after a disastrous start. And can new ownership and a massive cash injection from the Saudi-led consortium prevent Newcastle from going down?",
    "Whatever unfolds over the coming weeks and months, our guide has you covered - here's how to get a Premier League live stream this season and catch every 2021/22 EPL fixture online from anywhere on earth right now.",
    "With travel restrictions now being relaxed around the world, there's every chance you may find yourself abroad during the 2021/22 Premier League season, which means you may find you're unable to access your usual football coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "The great news is there's an easy way around this in the form of a VPN - super smart software that lets you re-position your device of choice to a location of your choosing. This allows you to globe trot and still access your preferred Premier League live stream - and they're really easy to use.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a Premier League live stream from anywhere",
    "Those looking to watch this season's games in the UK with the optimum viewing experience are well served by all three broadcasters.",
    "Sky will again be offering broadcasts of all its matches in Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos sound to Sky Q subscribers, and this season they're going a step further by adding the option of HDR for their live broadcasts.",
    "That brings it in line with BT Sport Ultimate channel which was already showing Premier League games in HDR as well as 4K Ultra HD.",
    "As with last season, Amazon will also be offering a select number of its games in 4K.",
    "Norwich, Watford, Brentford replaced Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and Sheffield United in the Premier League ranks this season.",
    "Here are all 20 teams playing in the 2021/22 Premier League.",
    "With their impressive waltz to the title last year, coupled with their strengthening of their attacking options during the close season, it was no great surprise to see Pep Guardiola's Man City leading the pre-season betting to turn out as the eventual 2021/22 Premier League title winners, with odds hovering around the 4/6 mark with most bookies.",
    "Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool were the popular choice to be City's closest rivals at around 9/2, while Chelsea (5/1) and Man United(!) (8/1) rounded out the top four betting.",
    "Sadly for the newly promoted clubs, the odds for those teams beating the drop weren't too favourable. Despite winning last year's Championship, Norwich topped the betting for the team most likely to head straight back down at 10/11, with Watford and Brentford coming in not much further behind.",
    "Of the more established sides in the Premier League, Crystal Palace under new boss Patrick Viera were being backed to struggle (8/5). So it all just goes to show once again how wrong the bookies can get things.",
    "Virtual Private Network software is pretty versatile tech. As well as letting you watch sport and TV from other locales, their encrypted nature means that the information you exchange on a daily basis online is kept safely away from prying eyes. And streaming VPNs also help to get around website blocking in certain offices, schools and even countries.",
    "But even if you're away from your home coverage, you can always use a VPN to dial back into your country that does have a stream. A VPN is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location. We've tested hundreds of VPNs and can recommend these as the currently available:"
