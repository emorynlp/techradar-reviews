    "Fans of the classic Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl games have something to look forward to in the form of two new remakes, Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, releasing simultaneously in late 2021.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were announced during the Pok\u00e9mon Presents presentation as part of the Pok\u00e9mon 25th Anniversary celebrations. The projects are being developed by ILCA, who previously developed Pok\u00e9mon Home, as well as Game Freak\u2019s Junichi Masuda, director and producer on previous mainline Pok\u00e9mon titles.",
    "Players will return to the Sinnoh region on the Nintendo Switch. As before, they\u2019re able to choose one of three iconic starters, those being Chimchar, Turtwig or Piplup. The game looks to retain the aesthetic and scale of the original game that\u2019s a fan favorite in the Pok\u00e9mon community.",
    "The overworld graphics present a cutesy look to the characters and Pok\u00e9mon, looking very much like a 3D upgrade to the original\u2019s sprite-based graphics. In battle, characters and Pok\u00e9mon grow to their more realistic proportions.",
    "Details on any extra features or game modes are yet to be announced, but previous remakes such as Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, and Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver built on their respective origins substantially, so we hope Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are both able to follow in their predecessor\u2019s footsteps."
