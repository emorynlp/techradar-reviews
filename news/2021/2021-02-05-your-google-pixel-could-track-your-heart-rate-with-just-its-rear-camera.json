  "article": [
    "There\u2019s a new health monitoring feature coming to Google Pixel phones that\u2019s typically only found in wearables: tracking heart rate and respiratory rate by using the handset\u2019s cameras.",
    "The feature runs through the Google Fit app, so it\u2019s presumably free. It\u2019s coming to all Pixel phones starting in March, but will expand to more Android phones at a later date:",
    "Most wearables use skin-touching sensors to measure heart rate. In a way, Google is using phone cameras to do the same by having owners press a finger to a rear-facing camera lens and letting the software track heart rate by monitoring \u2018subtle changes in the color of your fingers,\u2019 according to Google\u2019s blog post. To determine respiratory rate, the Google Fit app asks users to prop their camera up to capture their face and upper torso in frame; from there, the camera tracks chest movements.",
    "Pixel phones (and eventually, many other phones) are capable of tracking these human changes \u2013 \u2018tiny physical signals down to the pixel level,\u2019 as Google\u2019s blog post puts it \u2013 thanks to powerful sensors and advances in computer vision. These aren\u2019t substitutes for discrete health-tracking devices and results of their scans aren\u2019t meant to be proper medical diagnostics, but Google hopes they\u2019ll help Google Fit users improve day-to-day wellness.",
    "It\u2019s hard to believe phone cameras and number-crunching algorithms could ever outperform wearables and medical-grade sensors built exclusively to track conditions, but it\u2019s a start to give users a broad idea of their health before they buy pricier equipment.",
    "But better still is the possibility of bringing health monitoring tools to folks who may not be able to afford that equipment to begin with but already have a phone in their pocket. And given Google simply has to refine their algorithms and factor in all the additional sensors and features coming to phones every year, these features are only going to improve.",
    "Better still, Google noted that its team of researchers, engineers and clinicians are exploring new ways to harness commonly-available sensors to give folks more health information, so we should expect more features like this to come.",
    "Google announced the feature alongside its February 4 event, The Check Up, which had executives from Google Health and medical professionals discussing the company\u2019s efforts to offer health and wellness tools as well as combat COVID. You can watch the full hour-ish event below:",
