    "Tom Dumoulin returns to action at the 84th edition of the Tour de Suisse, and the first since 2019, last year\u2019s race having been cancelled because of the pandemic. Join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Tour de Suisse live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online from anywhere. We also have info on this year's Tour de Suisse stage times.",
    "Finishing within a fortnight of the Tour de France, the Tour de Suisse is a key preparation race, as demonstrated by Egan Bernal last time out, riding to glory in Switzerland before conquering all at the Tour shortly after.",
    "This year\u2019s route kicks off with the first of two ITTs, and spans 1,025km of flat, hilly and mountainous terrain, as the riders snake southwards from Frauenfeld towards the heart of the Alps. There are consecutive uphill finishes on Stages 5 and 6, but the hardest of all is the final leg, which features climbs up the Oberalp Pass, Lukmanier Pass and Gotthard Pass.",
    "Reigning UCI World Road champion Julian Alaphilippe is amongst the favourites, along with Jakob Fuglsang, Adam Yates and, fitness permitting, Dumoulin, who hasn\u2019t raced since the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a last October.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a 2021 Tour de Suisse live stream from anywhere this week.",
    "As discussed above, if you're desperate to watch the Tour de Suisse but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
    "Use a VPN to get a Tour de Suisse live stream from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone."
