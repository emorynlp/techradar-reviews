    "If you\u2019ve been scratching your head over how Xbox Series X storage works, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not the only one.",
    "Even though the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are far more user-friendly than gaming PCs, the storage situation isn\u2019t as clear as it should be. There are a few caveats to note, and with space at a premium, you\u2019ll want to ensure you know exactly what you\u2019re buying and why.",
    "We\u2019ll cover everything from internal to external drives, the differences between HDD and SSD and shed some light on what an NVMe SSD actually is. More importantly, you\u2019ll know exactly how Xbox Series X storage works by the end of this guide.",
    "Remember that everything outlined here relates to the Xbox Series S, too.",
    "The Xbox Series X comes with a 1TB NVMe SSD, while the Xbox Series S is equipped with a 512GB NVMe SSD. The Xbox Series X has 802GB storage, which means 198GB is reserved for system files and the Xbox operating system.",
    "The Xbox Series S, meanwhile, only has 364GB of usable storage. Games should take up 30% less room than their Xbox Series X counterparts as file sizes are reduced due to developers not targeting a 4K resolution, but you'll likely need to expand the system's memory sooner rather than later.",
    "NVMe SSDs (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a superior storage solution compared to standard hard drives and SSDs. Due to the fact NVMe SSDs use PCIe sockets for data transfer, they can send up to 25x more data than the slower SATA equivalent (which is the hard drive the Xbox One uses).",
    "NVMe drives also cut out the middle man by communicating directly with a system\u2019s CPU, and the end result is blazing fast performance. Both the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S rely on this new storage format to create a next-generational leap in performance, so it\u2019s crucial to understand the difference between the three types of drives.",
    "No, and that can often be confusing for many \u2013 particularly as Microsoft regularly refer to their storage as just \u201cSSD\u201d. Regular SSDs (solid-state drive) rely on SATA, which is a far slower way of transferring data within a system. An SSD is still much faster than a regular mechanical hard drive (and less prone to failure due to the lack of moving parts), but its speeds pale in comparison to an NVMe drive.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s solution to expanding the Xbox Series X/S\u2019s internal memory with more super-fast NVMe storage is rather elegant, albeit expensive. Microsoft has released a 1TB Storage Expansion Card that slots into the back of both consoles, much like a memory card. Anything you store on the NVMe drives will benefit from the full suite of power that the Xbox Series X/S provide.",
    "Microsoft has also revealed that more storage solutions will be on the way, so consumers won\u2019t just be at the mercy of buying the proprietary drive. This is good news, as proprietary drives can often be more expensive than components from third-party manufacturers.",
    "You can plug in an external HDD or SSD to play Xbox One, Xbox 360 and original Xbox games on. You won\u2019t benefit from the lightning-quick speeds that the NVMe drives can provide, however, SSD drives are still considerably quicker than HDD, so if you do go for an external option, opt for an SSD. Any games that are optimized for Xbox Series X (like Gears 5 for example) will subsequently need to be moved to the internal NVMe drives to be played.",
    "Xbox Series X/S optimized games can be stored on external drives, but they won\u2019t be playable unless they\u2019re transferred back to the main NVMe drives. Quick Resume, which is a feature that lets you suspend and resume multiple games at a time, will work no matter where games are installed."
