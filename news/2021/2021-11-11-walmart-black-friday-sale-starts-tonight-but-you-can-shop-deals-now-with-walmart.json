    "The second round of the early Walmart Black Friday sale begins today, with a whole new batch of deals across 4K TVs, laptops, appliances, headphones, toys and electronics. Once again all of these offers are only available for a limited time \u2013 until November 14 \u2013 or until they sell out.",
    "Onto the deals, then. We think the very best deal is this HP 15.6-inch laptop for only $279 (was $399). This is a terrific price for an everyday laptop that includes an Intel i3 processor, 8GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Usually, you'd need to pay over $300 to get all three. Altogether, this spec will ensure speedy performance \u2013 whether you're browsing, streaming, or working \u2013 and is one of the best Black Friday laptop deals we've seen yet.",
    "Moving on, the next highlight is this 60-inch Samsung 4K Smart TV for $548. Sure, you might find a few budget TVs of this size for less in future Black Friday TV deals but it's the cheapest this TV has ever been.",
    "But that's far from everything. The latest Walmart Black Friday sale extends across a whole number of other categories. There's the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 for just $139 (was $219) \u2013 that's a huge $80 saving on an entry-level tablet for light internet browsing and media streaming. Audiophiles might enjoy the Apple AirPods (2nd Gen) for $89 (was $119) - the lowest ever price for the popular earbuds. Or, for a stocking filler, how about savings of up to $18 on these Lego Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Jurassic World sets now for only $30?",
    "Do take a look at many of the other standout deals below and stick with us as we bring you all the Walmart Black Friday deals as they go live over the next few weeks.",
    "After some more bargains in the year's Black Friday sales? We've got you covered with our hub dedicated to all the Black Friday Apple deals, our roundup of the Black Friday tablet deals and all the best Lego Black Friday deals."
