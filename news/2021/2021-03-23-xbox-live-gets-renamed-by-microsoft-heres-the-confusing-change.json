    "Update: In a statement to Eurogamer, Microsoft has clarified the future of Xbox Live and why the new Xbox network name came about. It said that \"Xbox Live isn't going away\" and that the change was made to \"create a simpler, more descriptive messaging system for Xbox in different areas\". Microsoft also said that \"none of these experiences or features will changes as part of these updates\", which means Xbox Live might not be going anywhere after all.",
    "18 years after launching Xbox Live, Microsoft has officially renamed it to Xbox network. Apparently, this is a careful rebranding of the actual service to further separate it from the similarly-named memberships.",
    "\u201c\u2019Xbox network\u2019 refers to the underlying Xbox online service, which was updated in the Microsoft Services Agreement,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told The Verge in a statement . \u201cThe update from \u2018Xbox Live\u2019 to \u2018Xbox network\u2019 is intended to distinguish the underlying service from Xbox Live Gold memberships.\u201d",
    "In other words, nothing is expected to change with how players use the now-named Xbox network \u2013 it's just going forward with a different name, which is reflected in console menus. If you were going to save screenshots or footage on Xbox Live, it'll be saved to Xbox network instead. This change was quietly rolled out, leading to a bit of confusion, as tweeted by The Verge's Tom Warren \u2013 but mechanically, nothing should change.",
    "There were whispers back in August that Microsoft was rebranding Xbox Live and potentially make changes to the Xbox Live Gold membership, per The Verge. The company denied it at the time despite curious alterations in the Microsoft services agreement renaming it to 'Xbox online service.'",
    "Then Microsoft surprise-hiked the price of Xbox Live Gold in January, but after backlash immediately abandoned the plan a day later. In an even greater mea culpa, Microsoft promised that free-to-play games like Fortnite would be made free in the coming months \u2013 no Xbox Live Gold membership required."
