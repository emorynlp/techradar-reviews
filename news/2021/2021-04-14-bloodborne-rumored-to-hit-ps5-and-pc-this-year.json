    "Another year brings yet another round of Bloodborne rumors. This time, it\u2019s concerning the PS4 classic\u2019s emergence on PS5 and PC later this year, according to a leaker with a pretty impressive track record.",
    "Twitter leaker CrazyLeaksOnATrain ignited the Bloodborne bonfire once more, stating that current-gen ports for Bloodborne are \u201cstill coming,\u201d and will be the next PS5 and PC port after Days Gone, which is also heading to PC this year.",
    "As always, we suggest to exercise caution when it comes to leaks, especially for a game as highly requested as Bloodborne. Leaker CrazyLeaksOnATrain has had a fairly solid track record so far, though, correctly predicting PC ports for Nioh 2, Kingdom Hearts and the Ninja Gaiden trilogy.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first round of Bloodborne remaster rumors, and they certainly won\u2019t be the last. FromSoftware\u2019s gothic horror action-RPG is one of the PS4\u2019s most highly regarded games, and people have been clamouring for a PC port to address the original release\u2019s often poor frame rate and load times.",
    "A PS5 and PC remaster for Bloodborne could easily address these complaints and more, with potential support for 4K, 60fps refresh rates (or higher), HDR compatibility and support for mouse and keyboard, among other quality of life features.",
    "It could also present an opportunity to introduce much of the game\u2019s well-documented cut content that didn\u2019t make it to the PS4 version. Said content included everything from enemies and bosses to weapons and entirely separate locations, and it\u2019s all available to peruse on the Bloodborne Fandom Wiki.",
    "PlayStation has been steadily releasing PC versions of its most revered PS4 games over the past couple of years including Horizon: Zero Dawn and Death Stranding, and it\u2019s soon to add Days Gone to that PS4-to-PC catalog. At this point, a Bloodborne remaster for PS5 and PC wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but it would certainly be extremely welcome."
