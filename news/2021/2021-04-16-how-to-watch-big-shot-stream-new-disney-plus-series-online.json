  "summary": "A hotshot NCAA basketball coach meets his match at high-school",
  "article": [
    "Hot-headed basketball coach Marvyn Korn's (John Stamos) old-school, \"my way or the highway\" approach may have helped him make a name for himself in the NCAA, but his quick temper also lands him in hot water... and into a coaching position at Westbrook School for Girls, where his tough-guy act just isn't going to cut it. We explain below how to watch Big Shot online with Disney Plus now.",
    "Pride and ego already in tatters after his NCAA ousting, Dean Sherilyn Thomas (Yvette Nicole Brown) then Sirens' star player Louise (Nell Verlaque) each dunk on him, and before he knows it Coach Korn has a full team revolt on his hands.",
    "As much as they love the game and want to improve for the sake of themselves, their parents and their school, the girls aren't going to respond to his toxic methods. Coach Korn needs to get with the programme, and fast.",
    "A display of mercy grants him one last chance to reveal a more empathetic and vulnerable side, and to prove that he cares not only about the numbers on the scoreboard, but his players too.",
    "Funny, poignant and heart-warming, the 10-episode series sees Coach Korn reluctantly drag himself out of his comfort zone as he's forced to risk becoming a better person. Here's how to watch Big Shot online with Disney Plus.",
    "In addition to being the exclusive streaming home of Big Shot, the service provides access to Disney\u2019s huge back catalog: tonnes of iconic animated movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King and Cinderella. It\u2019s also home to Pixar\u2019s award-winning animations (Toy Story I-IV, Inside Out, Soul) \u2013 mind-opening National Geographic documentaries, and every broadcast season of The Simpsons. Then there\u2019s Marvel and the ever-expanding MCU, which includes Black Panther and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, plus the entire Star Wars saga, from 1977 up to original series The Mandalorian.",
    "It\u2019s also the exclusive home of Pixar\u2019s extraordinary Soul, and offers Disney Plus Premier Access to subscribers: allowing them to purchase highly-anticipated new films like Raya and the Last Dragon and Cruella before anyone else \u2013 for a one-off fee.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "And finally, Star on Disney Plus has introduced a treasure-trove of new content to the platform that most global markets can enjoy. Yes, it now costs a tiny bit more. But it\u2019s definitely worth it if you\u2019re sick of Frozen and want to treat yourself to more grown-up fare like Prison Break, Atlanta, and The Walking Dead. Plus, you can still save big by picking an annual subscription.",
