    "Huge spoilers follow for Foundation episodes 1 to 7. Proceed at your own risk.",
    "Foundation fans don\u2019t need reminding how important Gaal Dornick is to its story. As a prominent character in Isaac Asmiov\u2019s original works, Hari Seldon\u2019s former prodigy was always destined for big things in Apple TV Plus\u2019 adaptation.",
    "Thanks to Mysteries and Martyrs, the seventh entry in Foundation season 1, now we know just how vital she is to The Foundation\u2019s survival. Not only that, but episode 7 also delivers more compelling drama and action in its other branching narratives: suffice to say, then, Apple\u2019s adaptation of Asimov\u2019s novels is certainly hitting its stride.",
    "What\u2019s so important about Gaal that makes her integral to The Foundation\u2019s success, then? Initially, it appeared that this particular secret wouldn\u2019t be revealed until its eighth episode as we didn't expect to be reunited with Gaal in Mysteries and Martyrs \u2013 but we\u2019re glad that we were.",
    "Before his death, Hari uploaded a digital version of his consciousness to the Raven, the spaceship that located Gaal\u2019s stasis pod back in episode 4. Hari\u2019s digital avatar, though, is glitching out and, despite Gaal\u2019s best efforts, it disappears. But not before it inadvertently turns off the ship\u2019s life support systems, which is obviously bad news for Gaal\u2019s survival.",
    "Luckily, Hari\u2019s avatar stabilizes itself and brings the ship\u2019s systems back online. It\u2019s here that we learn more about Hari\u2019s plan for The Foundation, as well as a major revelation concerning Gaal.",
    "As it happens, Hari was already dying due to an illness that he inherited from his father\u2019s side of the family. In being murdered, Hari hoped that he\u2019d become a mythical symbol for The Foundation and galvanize its members into realizing his vision. Of course, Gaal interrupting Raych\u2019s murder of Hari ruined that: Raych is now dead and Gaal, who was supposed to be leading The Foundation on Terminus by this point, took his place on the Raven.",
    "What ensues is a bitter back-and-forth between the two. An angry Gaal lambasts Hari for not caring what she or Raych wanted, while Hari\u2019s terse riposte suggests that everything she did was a choice, so he's not to blame. It\u2019s a riveting exchange \u2013 Hari and Gaal\u2019s interactions were the highlight of Foundation\u2019s early stuttering episodes, so it\u2019s pleasing to see Jared Harris and Lou Llobell converse again, even if it\u2019s in trying circumstances.",
    "Despite their emotionally charged exchange, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a mutual respect between the pair. It\u2019s inevitable, then, that they forgive each other for their previous actions even if they don\u2019t say it outright. The overarching mood onboard the Raven is depicted in a fun way during this sequence, too. Red lighting is used to depict the frustration that both feel during their tense chat, eventually making way for a blue hue that represents a calming of the atmosphere once they\u2019ve aired their grievances.",
    "It\u2019s during the latter part of their discussion that Foundation episode 7 makes its big play: Gaal can predict the future. Well, sort of. It\u2019s the reason why she \u2018felt\u2019 that the Starbridge\u2019s imminent attack in episode 1 and that something was wrong before she found Raych murdering Hari in episode 2.",
    "It\u2019s a revelation that feels like it\u2019ll be an easy way of explaining how The Foundation will combat any major problems that befall it down the line \u2013 that is, if Gaal ever makes it to Terminus. Still, it\u2019s a fun cliff hanger to end Mysteries and Martyrs on, and inevitably leaves viewers wanting Foundation\u2019s next instalment to be released immediately.",
    "Away from events on the Raven, episode 7\u2019s Terminus storyline is arguably the most intriguing of its other narrative strands.",
    "Having located the Invictus \u2013 a planet killing imperial warship \u2013 the ragtag band of Anacreons and Foundation members board it in order to restart its engines.",
    "But not everyone makes it onto (or into) the vessel. Empire Commander Dorwin is killed by Phara when he\u2019s no longer useful to the mission, while Hugo misses the Invictus\u2019 landing pad and ends up drifting off into space. Given how close he is to Salvor Hardin, we\u2019d expected his possible death to hit as hard as Abbas\u2019 did in episode 6, so it\u2019s a shame that it doesn\u2019t. Although, we don\u2019t actually see Hugo die, so there\u2019s a possibility his demise is another cop out like it was in episode 4.",
    "So what\u2019s the plan for the Invictus? The Anacreons want to use it to destroy Trantor in retaliation for their planet\u2019s destruction in episode 2. The problem is that the Invictus will start to jump to random points in space once its systems are fully operational. This, Phara explains, means that the crew only have a few hours to shut its randomized space jump sequence down. Failure to do so will strand them in an unknown location and, with no supplies, lead to their deaths.",
    "But Salvor isn\u2019t having this. She convinces The Foundation\u2019s members to spring a surprise attack on their captors which, unsurprisingly, doesn\u2019t go very well. It\u2019s a good thing that this particular fight sequence doesn\u2019t drag on for long, however. Foundation\u2019s close-quarters combat has left a lot to be desired so far, and it\u2019s not much better here. Foundation has solved many of its teething issues, but its physical combat continues to be an issue. Here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s fixed in future entries.",
    "Tensions are similarly high on Maiden. Following episode 6\u2019s events, Day isn\u2019t happy that Demerzel chose to bow after Zephyr Halima\u2019s rousing speech. Calling his advisor disloyal to the Empire, Day decides to go on the offensive on his own terms, rather than risk the prospect of Demerzel seemingly betraying him again.",
    "Naturally, Day\u2019s plan backfires. Meeting with Halima once more, he tries to flatter her with a new offer: not only will he build a new desalination station on Maiden to provide clean, drinking water to its population, but his army will also protect Maiden from any Outer Reach attacks.",
    "To his surprise, Halima declines. The only thing she wants is an end to the Cleonic dynasty and its cloning program \u2013 something that Day is unwilling to compromise on. Another fraught conversation plays out between them but, again, Halima more than holds her own. It\u2019s intriguing to see someone go up against Day and win a verbal sparring contest. Despite their reign of tyranny and infinite resources, it seems that the Imperium\u2019s leaders don\u2019t have all the answers.",
    "Undaunted, Day raises the stakes. The next day, he informs Halima and Maiden\u2019s population that he plans to walk the Great Spiral: a pilgrimage to the womb of the Mothers, which will prove that Cleon\u2019s clones do have a soul. It\u2019s a Hail Mary move on Day\u2019s part as it could prove that Halima' episode 6 proclamation was right all along. Regardless, it\u2019ll be fascinating to see the outcome of this in one of Foundation\u2019s final three episodes.",
    "If there\u2019s one somewhat weak storyline in Mysteries and Martyrs, it\u2019s events that transpire on Trantor. Here, we see Dawn and Azura\u2019s secret liaison continue apace, but it\u2019s pretty standard fare as romances go and doesn\u2019t add much to proceedings.",
    "We do get to see more of the Empire\u2019s cloning facility, with Dawn revealing that Cleon\u2019s clones can be destroyed and replaced by replicas if they\u2019re found to be defective. It\u2019s why Dawn is so reluctant to tell Day and Dusk about his color blindness and other differences, which he reveals in episodes 6 and 7.",
    "It does, though, offer an interesting insight into Dawn\u2019s dilemma: he\u2019s torn between his loyalty to his royal duties and his burgeoning romance with Azura. With Dusk indicating that he knows something is wrong with Dawn during an awkward conversation later on, too, there\u2019s a strong possibility that this version of Dawn may not live to see out Foundation\u2019s first season. It's that, or he may take Azura up on her offer and flee Trantor for good.",
    "Mysteries and Martyrs is an episode laden with exposition, but it\u2019s a necessary and much welcome entry in the series.",
    "With Foundation barrelling towards its final few episodes, it\u2019s likely that there won\u2019t be much more room for in-depth plot explanations. Episode 7, then, leans heavily into this side of Foundation\u2019s narrative, which hopefully means that it\u2019s setting up more action-oriented instalments to come.",
    "That isn\u2019t to say Mysteries and Martyrs isn\u2019t without its issues. Hari and Gaal\u2019s reunion aside, episode 7\u2019s key emotional moments struggle to stick the landing. It\u2019s a shame as the show has ironed out this problem in recent weeks, so this feels like a step back for Foundation.",
    "Still, episode 7 is a good entry rather than an average or bad one. With Foundation\u2019s various plot strands likely to collide soon, providing each one with their fair share of screen time is the right move to make at this juncture. Mysteries and Martyrs lives up to its title: let\u2019s hope that season 1\u2019s final entries do likewise.",
