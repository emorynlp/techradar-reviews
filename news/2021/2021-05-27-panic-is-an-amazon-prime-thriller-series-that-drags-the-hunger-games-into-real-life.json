    "Panic on Amazon Prime is a surprisingly deceptive TV show. On the surface, the streamer\u2019s latest young adult (YA) series, based on Lauren Oliver\u2019s novel of the same name, appears to be nothing more than standard fare for its adolescent-targeted genre. However, dig deeper and there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye.",
    "Set in the fictional town of Carp, Panic stars Olivia Welch as Heather Nill, a recent college graduate who signs up to compete in Panic, the town\u2019s annual summer-spanning competition.",
    "With a $50,000 reward on offer, Heather and best friend Natalie (Jessica Sula) join 45 other seniors in a bid to win the big cash prize \u2013 and their freedom from their rustbelt-inspired town. To do so, contestants must navigate a series of increasingly dangerous challenges that, based on previous tournaments, eventually become a matter of life and death.",
    "When new information concerning the deaths of two participants during last year\u2019s competition emerges, however, the rules of the contest suddenly change \u2013 and Heather and Natalie must decide how much they\u2019re willing to risk to be crowned champion.",
    "Beneath its romance, thriller and drama tropes, though, Panic explores subjects that teenagers and young adults can sometimes find difficult to talk about. It\u2019s this topical content that is quietly Panic\u2019s biggest draw, and lends some gravitas to a series that, based on its synopsis, sounds very typical of the Young Adult genre.",
    "Ahead of its May 28 launch, TechRadar sat down with Welch and Sula to find out how Panic directly addresses these topics, such as substance abuse, that young people can find it tough to discuss. We also chat about how the series\u2019 nerve-jangling stunts were brought to life, and why the show deviates from its source material.",
    "Panic operates in an unusual space compared to other recent book to TV adaptations. Shows usually employ authors, such as Leigh Bardugo on Netflix\u2019s Shadow and Bone adaptation, in creative consultant or executive producer roles to ensure such TV adaptations are as authentic as possible.",
    "Amazon Studios, though, chose a different approach for Panic, and set author Lauren Oliver as the show\u2019s creator. Oliver, then, had the flexibility to revise the novel\u2019s plot and characters without having to surrender her creative freedoms. It\u2019s a dual role that enabled Oliver to collaborate more closely with the show\u2019s cast and allow them to offer their own fresh takes on characters that she created.",
    "\u201cWhen you have the creator who made this story and world, you feel pretty safe when she says \u2018It\u2019s gonna veer off and do this thing\u2019,\u201d Sula explains. \u201cLauren was like \u2018Don\u2019t worry about this\u2019 or \u2018You can throw this out as I\u2019m gonna go in this direction\u2019. It was done in a very secretive way, too, so even though I read the book midway through filming, I didn\u2019t know what to expect from the show\u2019s plot.\u201d",
    "One element of the show that doesn\u2019t deviate from the source material is the set of challenges that Panic\u2019s contestants must face. Participants have to successfully navigate six increasingly treacherous rounds, including a personalized challenge where they're required to face up to their greatest fear in order to progress to the final round.",
    "With tasks ranging from jumping off a vertigo-inducing cliff into icy waters to stealthily breaking into the home of an angry shotgun-toting farmer, Panic\u2019s contestants are put through the wringer in their quest for monetary success. It\u2019s these challenges that provide the show\u2019s most thrilling moments, and there are occasions where you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re holding your breath or gripping your seat tightly.",
    "By contrast, and largely for health and safety reasons, the show\u2019s cast didn\u2019t have to perform many \u2013 if any \u2013 of their fictional counterparts\u2019 death-defying stunts.",
    "\u201cNatalie\u2019s in the game and she\u2019s savvy about it, but she\u2019s always just hanging around rather than doing anything dangerous,\u201d Sula says. \u201cI mostly stood around and prepped for the first episode\u2019s jump, and then watched my stunt double actually do it, so Natalie is pretty lucky [with avoiding most of her tasks].\u201d",
    "While that\u2019s true of Sula\u2019s character, others aren\u2019t so lucky. As the series\u2019 protagonist, and the last participant to sign up to Panic after her life savings are stolen, Heather runs the gauntlet more than most \u2013 a factor that required Welch to actively perform some of the less perilous stunts in the show.",
    "\u201cI did get to do some stunts,\u201d Welch admits. \u201cBut we also had a great stunt team, so they [the most dangerous stunts] were performed by trained individuals. I stood in front of a green screen for Heather\u2019s stunts in episodes one and two, but I did get to do a lot of work during the other rounds and some stunt driving [in the finale], which was really cool.\u201d",
    "Panic\u2019s positioning as a YA series, centered around an oft-used \u2018winner takes all\u2019 plot device (most famously seen in The Hunger Games), may not be to everyone\u2019s tastes, but it\u2019s a far deeper show than it first appears.",
    "The series shines a light on real world subjects, including suicide, that teenagers and young adults can find difficult to talk about or, in keeping with the series\u2019 exploration of fear, are even afraid to raise in the first place.",
    "Poverty, misogyny, sexual assault, and a lack of employment opportunities are also explored in-depth throughout the series. As a YA-oriented show, Panic is ideally placed to prompt these kinds of discussions among its target audience.",
    "In reckoning with this topical content, Panic\u2019s cast hopes that the series will enable viewers to recognize the importance of opening up to family, friends or medical professionals if any of these subjects hit close to home.",
    "\u201c[It\u2019s important] to see a show that addresses things that are happening in the real world, such as people having a finite amount to live on,\u201d Sula says. \u201cThese kids are gonna be pushed into doing this game because of their individual situations. I didn\u2019t grow up in a wealthy environment, but Natalie\u2019s family is very well off and has a stable home, so any real-life person in the same situation may think \u2018Wow, I can never emulate that\u2019. It represents our wider society with kids trying to financially plan [for their future], and it sucks with all of the other issues they have to deal with.\u201d",
    "\u201cThese are extreme circumstances that people are going through,\u201d Welch adds. \u201cI think the grounded elements of the show balance out the stakes of why these kids are doing this in such a blown up way [through Panic\u2019s competition]. In the end, it\u2019s the result of having a community and friendship around you, and I hope viewers realize that they don\u2019t have to suffer in silence and they can talk to their own support groups.\u201d",
    "Panic isn\u2019t set during a dystopian era, unlike other YA series including The Maze Runner, but in a way its real-world setting is an asset. Its fairly engaging plot, examination of important topics and suspenseful challenges don\u2019t make it any less appealing.",
    "If anything, it proves that similar properties \u2013 where characters are required to win a competition to escape their current predicament \u2013 don\u2019t have to exist in a post-apocalyptic or totalitarian landscape to be effective, particularly if they resonate with their audience on a thematic level. Panic does and, if you can look past its expected genre tropes, it delivers an edge-of-your-seat experience that its target audience will enjoy.",
    "Panic launches exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, May 28."
