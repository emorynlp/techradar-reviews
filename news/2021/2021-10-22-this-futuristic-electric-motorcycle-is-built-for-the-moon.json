  "article": [
    "NASA is looking for new rovers for its new Artemis space program, and German design company Hookie thinks it has the perfect solution: a lunar electric motorcycle.",
    "Because the motorbike, called the Tardigrade, has just two wheels, it\u2019s much lighter than a conventional moon buggy.",
    "\u201cA moon buggy requires almost the same space as three to four Tardigrades,\u201d Hookie co-founder Nico Muller told Interesting Engineering. \u201cThe weight is much less than that of a complete buggy made out of steel.\u201d",
    "Hookie has used laser-cut aluminum frames to further reduce weight, and Kevlar to protect the motorcycle and drivetrain from the increased radiation in space. That weight and size saving would allow NASA to use much smaller lunar landers, thereby reducing costs and fuel usage.",
    "Although NASA hasn\u2019t invested in it yet, Muller says the agency is aware of the Tardigrade project. \u201cIt would be amazing to talk about future collaborations or ideas,\u201d he said.",
    "NASA explored many different types of lunar rovers for earlier Apollo missions, including a type of electric scooter.",
    "This was very different from the futuristic Tron-type motorcycle Hookie has designed, and although NASA went as far as building a prototype, the scooter was scrapped in favor of the four-wheeled electric buggy that\u2019s now symbolic of the space agency\u2019s moon programs.",
