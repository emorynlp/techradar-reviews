    "Last year's UCI road racing world champion Julian Alaphilippe gets his season underway at the 2021 Tour de la Provence, four months after crashing out of the Tour of Flanders, where he suffered a fractured hand in the process. Will it be a triumphant return for the 28-year-old? Follow our guide below as we explain how to get a Tour de la Provence live stream and watch UCI cycling online from anywhere.",
    "2019 Tour de France winner Egan Bernal is also in the mix, fresh off the back of the Etoile de Besseges. The Colombian didn't have a great race, finishing 64th overall, and after a nightmare 2020 that was railroaded by a back injury, he'll be as keen as anyone to put in a strong performance this week.",
    "The four-stage race covers more than 670 kilometres, with stage three on Saturday the jewel in the crown. While you're putting your feet up, the riders will be struggling up the slopes of Mont Ventoux, nicknamed the Beast of Provence, on a stage that will separate the contenders from the also-rans. While they won't be going right to the top - they'll stop at Chalet Reynard - it'll be a horrible climb, especially at this stage of the season.",
    "Mont Ventoux is where Nairo Quintana effectively won the race last year, and while it's a shame he isn't defending his crown, his absence opens up a huge opportunity for others, not least Aleksandr Vlasov, who so impressed here last year.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a Tour de la Provence live stream from anywhere in the world right now.",
    "If you're desperate to watch every stage of Tour de la Provence but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
    "Use a VPN to get a Tour de la Provence live stream from anywhere",
    "Prepare to dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book if you want to 'voir en direct', because anyone in France can watch a FREE Tour de la Provence live stream.",
    "You can watch the race for FREE on L'Equipe TV, which is offering around two hours of coverage each day.",
    "However, any French residents abroad right now that are worried about missing the action need only download a VPN to re-connect to their home streaming coverage."
