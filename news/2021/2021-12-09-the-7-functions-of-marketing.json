Most marketers will present the prospect with a promotional gift, free trial, or other enticement to engage them.",
    "Now that the prospect is in a place to learn more, the salesperson will have the opportunity to present their solution.

During the presentation stage is when that need is addressed, allowing for the product or service to act as the solution to the problem.",

    "Whether it is a customer rewards program, an appealing email campaign that drives sales, or effective customer relations, marketing is the bridge between the financial growth of the business and its customers.
