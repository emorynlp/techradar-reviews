    "There's relationship drama everywhere in season 2 of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and we're not just talking about Nini and Ricky. Rattled by a chance encounter with the, ahem, adorable new North High drama teacher, Miss Jenn enters East High into the Alan Menken Awards, a prestigious high school musical theater competition, with their new production - Beauty and the Beast. We explain below how to watch High School Musical: season 2 online with Disney Plus now.",
    "We're certainly not short of antagonists in the second season of the Disney Plus smash hit show, with Miss Jenn hell bent on getting one over her old flame, arrogant, arrogant Zach, who's leading North High into the Minky's with their take on The Little Mermaid.",
    "Meanwhile, life is imitating art is imitating... art, as Nini and Ricky struggle to break free from the chains binding them to Gabriella and Troy.",
    "It's looking a whole lot like \"Gotta Go My Own Way\" all over again, as they try to come to terms with making long-distance work, after Nini's offered a place at a school in Denver.",
    "One thing that's definitely not going to make things any easier is the dangerous presence of new character Lily, who's looking to get her claws into the Wildcats lead. Here's how to watch High School Musical: season 2 online with Disney Plus.",
    "In addition to being the exclusive streaming home of High School Musical, the service provides access to Disney\u2019s huge back catalog: tonnes of iconic animated movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King and Cinderella. It\u2019s also home to Pixar\u2019s award-winning animations (Toy Story I-IV, Inside Out, Soul) \u2013 mind-opening National Geographic documentaries, and every broadcast season of The Simpsons. Then there\u2019s Marvel and the ever-expanding MCU, which includes Black Panther and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, plus the entire Star Wars saga, from 1977 up to original series The Mandalorian.",
    "It\u2019s also the exclusive home of Pixar\u2019s extraordinary Soul, and offers Disney Plus Premier Access to subscribers: allowing them to purchase highly-anticipated new films like Raya and the Last Dragon and Cruella before anyone else \u2013 for a one-off fee.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "And finally, Star on Disney Plus has introduced a treasure-trove of new content to the platform that most global markets can enjoy. Yes, it now costs a tiny bit more. But it\u2019s definitely worth it if you\u2019re sick of Frozen and want to treat yourself to more grown-up fare like Prison Break, Atlanta, and The Walking Dead. Plus, you can still save big by picking an annual subscription.",
