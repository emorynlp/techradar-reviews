    "Windows 10 is due a major revamp later in 2021 with the Windows 10 21H2 Update, and while we've had a good idea of some of the features coming to the operating system, a few exciting hidden features have just been uncovered in an early test version.",
    "As spotted by Twitter user Albacore, and reported by WinCentral, these new features haven\u2019t been publicly talked about by Microsoft, and some of them have been hidden away in menus.",
    "The fact that Microsoft hasn\u2019t been shouting about these features doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t interesting \u2013 in fact, they seem pretty cool. The reason they\u2019ve been overlooked could be because they are still being worked on, and not ready for prime time.",
    "Also, unlike the Windows 10 21H1 update, which is due soon and only comes with minor fixes and changes, the 21H2 update will be a much larger update that brings loads of new tools and features, so Microsoft may just not have a chance to showcase all the changes.",
    "One of the more noticeable changes coming to Windows 10 in the 21H2 update is a new \u2018Device usage\u2019 section in the \u2018Personalization\u2019 settings page. This new section lets you tell Windows 10 what you use your PC for, be it gaming, schoolwork and more, and Windows 10 will configure itself so that it runs best for your needs.",
    "These options actually appear when you first run Windows 10, but if you skipped setting them when they first appeared, this allows you to set it up later.",
    "You\u2019ll also be able to use Windows Spotlight as a desktop background, which gives you different, and often stunning, photos. There\u2019s also a \u2018Learn about this picture\u2019 option, which you can click and it will bring up information about the photograph, including who took it and what the photo is of.",
    "Perhaps most usefully of all, the on-screen touch keyboard is also getting new customization options as well to make it easier to use.",
    "Windows 10 21H2 Update is due in the latter half of 2021, and in the run up we\u2019ll hopefully see even more new features emerge."
