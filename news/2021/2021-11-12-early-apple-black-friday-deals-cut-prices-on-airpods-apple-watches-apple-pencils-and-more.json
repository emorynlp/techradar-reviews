    "While Black Friday deals drop prices on all manner of tech, Apple usually declines to participate, and keeps its products at full price on its website. But online retailers have all the discounts you need on AirPods, Apple Watches, Apple Pencils, and other Apple accessories. (Not in the US? Scroll to the bottom for deals in your region.)",
    "These are early Black Friday Apple deals, mind you, so expect the discounts to get better as we approach the day itself on November 26. The savings will last through the weekend and into the Cyber Monday deals on November 29, but if you wanted an early look at which Apple products are going to be discounted, here it is.",
    "While the deals will undoubtedly be better on older devices, we still have some discounts for the new Apple Watch 7, Apple AirPods Max, Apple Pencil 2, and other best picks at the top of their category.",
    "And just to be clear, we do have some great Black Friday iPhone deals listed elsewhere, so check those out if you\u2019re eager to buy an Apple handset \u2013 we\u2019ve even got a deal or two on the new iPhone 13 range. The same goes for Black Friday MacBook Pro deals, which include the exciting new Apple MacBook Pro models with the M1 Max chipsets, and some Black Friday iPad deals to boot.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for Apple accessories that sync perfectly with those iPhones, Macs, and iPads, check below:",
    "We would love to post deals for official Apple accessories like the AirTags, the MagSafe Battery Pack, or the newly recolored Apple HomePod Mini, but we haven't found deals on those yet \u2013 they're still full price everywhere. Rest assured, when we will, we'll share them with you!",
    "If you're not in the US, here are other deals in your region for the latest Apple gadgets:"
