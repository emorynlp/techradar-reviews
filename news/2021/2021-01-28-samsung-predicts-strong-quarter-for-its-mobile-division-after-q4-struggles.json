  "article": [
    "Revenues and profits at Samsung\u2019s mobile business fell during the final quarter of 2020 as increased demand for smartphones was offset by intense competition and higher marketing expenses.",
    "Like other smartphone manufacturers, Samsung has suffered from the impact of Covid-19 on demand and supply chain. However, the final quarter is traditionally a strong one for vendors as it coincides with Christmas.",
    "Although there was a quarter-on-quarter increase in demand, the company\u2019s IT and Mobile Communications division posted 22.34 trillion won (\u00a315bn) in mobile revenues and profits of 2.42 trillion won (\u00a31.6bn) for Q4 \u2013 annual declines of 10.5% and 4% respectively.",
    "Samsung expects the overall market will decline in Q1 but believes that by launching new products at all price points \u2013 including the Samsung Galaxy S21 \u2013 its own sales will increase.",
    "\u201cThe Mobile Communications Business is set to see robust sales of flagship smartphones such as the Galaxy S21 and new mass market models,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Consumer Electronics Division will likely post stable results despite weakness in seasonal demand, underpinned by new product launches and introduction of new premium lineups.\u201d",
    "Longer term, there is a belief that the market will recover as the year progresses.",
    "\u201cIn 2021, market demand is likely to recover to pre-COVID levels backed by gradual recovery in the economy and accelerating expansion of the 5G market,\u201d the company added.",
    "Overall, Samsung\u2019s profits increased by 26.4% year-on-year to 9.05 trillion Korean won (\u00a35.9bn) as revenues reached 61.55 trillion won (\u00a340 billion), an increase of 2.8%. This is despite ongoing difficulties in the memory chip market owing to a strong Korean Won and long-term price pressures.",
    "There is belief that 2021 will finally be the year that Samsung\u2019s memory business turns a corner, while significant pent-up demand will also aid the company\u2019s efforts. However, it has also warned investors that despite a bumper Q4, revenues will likely fall in Q1."
