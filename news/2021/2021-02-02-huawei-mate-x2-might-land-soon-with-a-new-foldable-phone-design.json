    "The Huawei Mate Xs landed back in February 2020, so assuming there\u2019s a yearly release cycle we\u2019re due a successor, and indeed it looks like one is about to land.",
    "Various leaks and rumors have suggested the Huawei Mate X2 is on the way, and now a leaker going by Courage Digital King on Weibo has said the phone is \u201ccoming soon\u201d.",
    "The post \u2013 spotted by GizmoChina \u2013 also reveals an interesting detail though, namely that the inner folding screen is apparently different to the design Samsung uses on phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.",
    "That\u2019s interesting because we\u2019d been assuming the design would be similar to the one Samsung uses. We haven\u2019t seen any images of the Huawei Mate X2 yet, but rumors \u2013 including this latest one \u2013 suggest that it will have an inner screen, which is a departure from the Mate Xs, as that phone has one big outer display that\u2019s always visible \u2013 you can just make it smaller or bigger by folding or unfolding it.",
    "Phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 meanwhile have the folding screen on the inside, so when it\u2019s not opened to full size it\u2019s hidden away, with a secondary smaller screen available on the outside.",
    "So it sounds like the Huawei Mate X2 will be more like this, but with an apparently different design for the inner screen. It\u2019s unclear exactly how the design would differ though. Presumably they\u2019re talking more than just size and resolution \u2013 perhaps they mean there won\u2019t be a punch-hole for the selfie camera, or maybe the screen is curved as well as foldable, but that\u2019s all just speculation.",
    "Based on previous leaks we\u2019re expecting an 8.01-inch 2200 x 2480 internal screen, and a 6.45-inch 1160 x 2700 external one, but that doesn\u2019t tell us how the design will differ.",
    "In any case, this latest leak also includes other details, stating that the Huawei Mate X2 will have a 5nm chipset (which will almost certainly be the Kirin 9000 seen in the Huawei Mate 40 range), and that it will have \u201csome very dazzling technologies\u201d, which is vague but intriguing.",
    "We should know more soon, as it\u2019s looking likely that the Huawei Mate X2 will land imminently \u2013 perhaps even before the end of February, or failing that maybe alongside the Huawei P50, which is expected to launch in March."
