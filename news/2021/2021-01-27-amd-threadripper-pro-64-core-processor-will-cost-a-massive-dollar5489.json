    "After announcing at CES 2021 that its Threadripper Pro CPUs will be coming to retailers for people to buy, AMD has now officially revealed the prices of these incredibly powerful processors \u2013 and they are expensive.",
    "The flagship Threadripper Pro 3995WX, which comes with 64 cores and 128 threads, will cost $5,489 (around \u00a34,000 / AU$7,100).",
    "Meanwhile, the 32-core, 64-thread Threadripper Pro 3975WX will cost $2,749 (around \u00a32,000 / AU3,600), and the 16-core, 32-thread Threadripper Pro 3955WX will cost $1,149 (around \u00a3830 / $1,500).",
    "These processors have been around for a while now, but before AMD\u2019s CES announcement, you could only get them in pre-built workstations.",
    "Now, however, you can buy the processors separately, but as you can see they will set you back a lot of money.",
    "However, it\u2019s important to note that these are Threadripper Pro CPUs aimed at enterprise and workstation use, and not consumers, so you won\u2019t want to put these in your gaming rig, for example.",
    "And, when you compare them to similar workstation CPUs, such as the 24-core Intel Xeon W-3265, which costs around $3,300 / \u00a32,400 / AU$4,300, AMD\u2019s pricing for its Threadripper Pro range suddenly looks a lot more competitive.",
    "AMD\u2019s official pricing comes after Tom\u2019s Guide reported early retailer prices that were a lot more expensive.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a powerful CPU for your workstation, then you\u2019ll need an WRX80 motherboard. For gamers and content creators, you\u2019re still better off looking at AMD\u2019s (and Intel\u2019s) consumer CPUs."
