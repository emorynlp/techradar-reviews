Teaming up with a pair of crooks, she pulls herself up from little and finds her fashion sense makes an impact \u2013 her work captures the attention of fashion extraordinaire Baroness von Hellman.",
    "Basically, we're going to find out how this sequence of events leads to her becoming Cruella de Vil \u2013 and embracing a life of aspirational puppy skinning, as previously mentioned. Craig Gillespie, who directed I, Tonya with Margot Robbie, is behind the camera on this one.",
