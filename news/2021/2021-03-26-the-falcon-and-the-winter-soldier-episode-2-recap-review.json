    "Spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follow.",
    "After watching \u2018The Star-Spangled Man\u2019, the decision to keep the Falcon and the Winter Soldier apart in episode 1 seem even more bizarre. As soon as Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes get to share a scene, the show sparks into life, quickly establishing the mismatched buddy dynamic the series was sold on. Just because the two were both Steve Rogers\u2019 BFFs doesn\u2019t mean they have to get along, and that bickering tension makes every moment they\u2019re on screen together crackle.",
    "This second episode is also a lot more fun than its predecessor, with a gripping thriller plot and top-level action scenes bolstered by the sort of one-liners and character beats that usually come as standard in the MCU. You knew about the Winter Soldier\u2019s staring problem, right?",
    "The lead duo aren\u2019t the first faces we see, however. Instead the focus is on John Walker, the highly decorated US military officer who\u2019s taken on the Captain America mantle. It turns out that not even carrying the most famous shield in the world is enough to overcome nerves and self-doubt, and this locker room scene (at Walker\u2019s old high school) humanizes a character who could easily be a boring man in a mask.",
    "Sure, he\u2019s got the combat side of the job nailed \u2013 he\u2019s tested \u201coff the charts\u201d in every category \u2013 but the PR aspects of the role don\u2019t come quite so naturally. At least he doesn\u2019t puke before he steps out in front of thousands of people in a crowded stadium as part of a national promo tour\u2026",
    "Although Walker\u2019s making a concerted effort to win over hearts and minds, Bucky and Sam aren\u2019t quite so sure about the new Cap. So, with Falcon preparing to ship out to Munich to investigate the Flag Smashers, Bucky turns up to tell him, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have given up the shield!\u201d",
    "While the two men agree that they never wanted anyone to be the new Steve Rogers, Bucky believes Sam could have done more to stop it \u2013 in fact, Bucky feels so strongly about it he\u2019s prepared to keep the argument simmering by accompanying Sam on his trip to Germany.",
    "Once there, they find the Flag Smashers in the sort of abandoned warehouse that criminal gangs traditionally call home, seemingly smuggling weapons and taking hostages.",
    "Despite their differing approaches \u2013 Bucky wants to dive in all arms blazing, Sam\u2019s more softly-softly \u2013 they\u2019re soon embroiled in the sort of movie-quality action sequence that\u2019s already a trademark of the show. Jumping between trucks travelling down a highway at high speed would be difficult at the best of times, but it becomes even more challenging when the Flag Smashers reveal they have the skill set of a Super-Soldier. And that hostage? Karli Morgenthau is actually the leader of the gang, strong enough to send Bucky flying and destroy Redwing \u2013 \u201cI always wanted to do that,\u201d says Bucky.",
    "The group \u2013 whose mission involves moving vaccines \u2013 quickly overpower the Falcon and the Winter Soldier, but luckily Captain America is on hand to save the day, as John Walker drops in with Lemar Hoskins (aka Battlestar), the friend who gave him a pep talk before his appearance at the football ground. Even their combined strength isn\u2019t enough to defeat eight Flag Smashers, but Cap Mk 2 is still keen to recruit Sam and Bucky. Despite his protestations that he\u2019s not trying to be Steve Rogers, however, the duo remain sceptical, and decline his offer.",
    "The Flag Smashers, meanwhile, find refuge with a civilian sympathetic to their growing \u201cRobin Hood\u201d cause. Indeed, after the first episode hinted that the aftermath of the Blip was going to be a key plot point in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, the follow-up dives into the political implications of a world where billions of people have suddenly reappeared, many of them in need of a home.",
    "While the Flag Smashers\u2019 perspective that the world was better before the \u2018dusted\u2019 were snapped back into existence is extreme, it exists in the sort of \u2018shades of gray\u2019 territory that makes for interesting and complex antagonists \u2013 whether or not you agree with their goals or methods, you can understand why the Flag Smashers are gathering support.",
    "In fact, this episode is arguably the most politicized thing ever to come out of the MCU, whether it\u2019s the motives of the Flag Smashers, the blatant racism directed at Sam by a Baltimore cop, or Sam shooting down Walker\u2019s assertion that \u201cViolent revolutionaries aren\u2019t good for anybody\u2019s cause\u201d by pointing out that\u2019s \u201cusually said by the people with resources\u201d.",
    "Marvel Studios should be applauded for making the most of its status as the biggest pop-culture franchise on the planet to draw attention to real-world issues \u2013 there\u2019s more to this show than blockbuster entertainment.",
    "The reason for Sam and Bucky\u2019s trip to Baltimore is an old man named Isaiah, who fought against the Winter Soldier (then a HYDRA agent) in the Korean War. Like Steve Rogers, he\u2019s a product of the Super-Soldier program \u2013 he still has the strength to embed a tobacco tin in the wall of his house \u2013 but the subsequent years have not been so kind. He was locked up for 30 years and subjected to numerous experiments, left behind by the government who created him. Bucky never told Rogers Isaiah was out there, figuring he had been through enough.",
    "There\u2019s little time for Sam to do anything with this information, however, as Bucky is immediately arrested for failing to show up for his regular psychological evaluations. Still, it\u2019s a great excuse to get Sam and Bucky in a room together to air their grievances with unconventional psychiatrist Dr Raynor. Despite the action scenes, the biggest fireworks of the episode come in a memorable scene where Bucky and Sam tell each other what they really think \u2013 Bucky, in particular, is struggling to come to terms with the way Sam gave up Cap\u2019s shield. They wind up agreeing to go their separate ways once they\u2019ve sorted the Flag Smashers problem.",
    "It looks like they won\u2019t be working with Captain America v2 and Battlestar to accomplish their goal, however. Despite Walker\u2019s advances and insistence that they\u2019ll be better off joining forces, Sam believes their ability to be a little more flexible about the rules of engagement will work in their favor. \u201cA word of advice, then. Stay the hell out of my way,\u201d says Walker, with the chilling air of a man who\u2019s used to getting what he wants. In his first full episode, Wyatt Russell nails the ambiguity of a guy who wants to be everyone\u2019s best friend, but might just have a more sinister agenda\u2026",
    "And yet the final scenes of the episode suggest they may all have more to worry about than Flag Smashers. The Flag Smashers are so scared of the enigmatic \u201cPower Breaker\u201d that one of their number sacrifices his life to allow his comrades to escape. Meanwhile, Bucky and Sam decide that their best source of Super-Soldier and HYDRA intel is a visit to their old adversary Helmut Zemo, still in prison after the events of Captain America: Civil War. We wouldn\u2019t bet against him being the one who\u2019s pulling all the strings\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "After a so-so opening episode, this second instalment kicks this Captain America spin-off into spectacular life. The action is blockbuster class, the Flag Smashers\u2019 are turning into memorable antagonists, and there\u2019s a pleasing complexity to the numerous long-running Marvel storylines starting to coalesce \u2013 this show is just as packed with Easter eggs as WandaVision.",
    "But the standout scenes of \u2018The Star-Spangled Man\u2019 are all human-based. We\u2019re already starting to see cracks in the new Captain America\u2019s patriotic fa\u00e7ade \u2013 Wyatt Russell has instantly become one of the series' MVPs \u2013 but everything plays second fiddle to the guys in the title. Movies and TV have a long history of mismatched duos who bicker their way through a mission. Now they\u2019re working together, Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes could hold their own with most of them\u2026",
    "New episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available on Disney Plus every Friday."
