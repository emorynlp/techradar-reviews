  "article": [
    "Researchers have discovered another malware that runs natively on the new Apple M1 Mac silicon, and this one seems to be a lot more sinister.",
    "While the first M1 malware was a standard adware, security researchers can\u2019t figure out the intentions of this new evolution, which also targets earlier Intel-powered Macs too.",
    "\u201cOur investigation almost immediately revealed that this malware, whatever it was, did not exhibit the behaviors that we\u2019ve come to expect from the usual adware that so often targets macOS systems,\u201d noted Tony Lambert, Intelligence Analyst, at the Red Canary security firm in its post on the threat.",
    "Dubbed Silver Sparrow, Lambert shares the malware has already infected about 30,000 macOS computers in over 150 countries.",
    "Collating data about the malware from other security researchers from Malwarebytes and VMware Carbon Black, Lambert soon realized that they were dealing with a novel strain of malware.",
    "\u201cThe novelty of this downloader arises primarily from the way it uses JavaScript for execution\u2014something we hadn\u2019t previously encountered in other macOS malware,\u201d shares Lambert.",
    "In his analysis he notes that the malware calls a command and control server every hour from the infected machine to check for further instructions. Till now the researchers haven\u2019t noticed the malware downloading any malicious payloads, which adds to the mystery of the malware\u2019s true intent.",
    "\u201cThough we haven\u2019t observed Silver Sparrow delivering additional malicious payloads yet, its forward-looking M1 chip compatibility, global reach, relatively high infection rate, and operational maturity suggest Silver Sparrow is a reasonably serious threat, uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d reasons Lambert.",
