    "While the Prime Day deals are in their final days before their prices go back up, supply is another story, and we'd guess there's just a few hours left until they're all sold out. That means you'll already have trouble finding many great Lego deals to buy.",
    "Why's this? Well, it's because most of the Lego deals sold like hot-cakes, with many selling out almost as soon as the Prime Day deals began. So if you wanted to get a piece of the hot discount action, you've missed your chance.",
    "Well, you've nearly missed your chance: there are a few Prime Day Lego deals left hanging around, snagging you pretty big discounts in some cases. We've listed them below, for you to peruse at your leisure, in case any appeal to you \u2013 but don't wait too long.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "So yeah, there's literally only three different sets on offer still (if you count the Lego Friends Cubes as one, although a few different ones are on offer).",
    "Strangely, a few Lego sets still have the Prime Day deals tag applied, despite not actually showing discounts. We're not sure what's up with that.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Lego from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
