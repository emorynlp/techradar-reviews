    "Amazon has slashed 38% off the price of the Proscenic T21 air fryer in the US, reducing it from $129.99 to just $79.99. That just 99 cents more expensive than the lowest price we recently saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making it great value. (Not in the US? Scroll down for the best air fryer deals in your region.)",
    "The best air fryers offer a healthier alternative to deep-frying while still producing food with a crisp, crunchy exterior. They use hot air rather than vast amounts of oil \u2013 in this case, Proscenic says the air fryer requires 80% less oil than deep frying. However, they can be a pricey purchase, so a good deal is always welcome.",
    "The Proscenic T21 air fryer has a 5.8-quart capacity, which should be enough to feed up to five people. During our review, we used just 1tbsp of oil when making a 1.1lb batch of fries, and we were impressed at how evenly browned and crisp the fries were. The air fryer also has Wi-Fi connectivity, so you can use your smartphone to start the appliance cooking, or browse over 100 recipes if you want inspiration on what to cook.",
    "In addition to air frying, the Instant Vortex Plus 10-quart air fryer can be used for rotisserie cooking, toasting and as a convection oven. The pull-down door design means you can place food on the shelf rather than having to add it to a basket, which means you can cook larger capacities. However, it's bulkier than many air fryers, and will take up more space on a countertop.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for air fryers from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
