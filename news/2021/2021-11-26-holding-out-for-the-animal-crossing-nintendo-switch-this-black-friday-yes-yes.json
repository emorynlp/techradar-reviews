    "Many of us were hoping that with the release of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise DLC, we might see some coveted Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch deals this Black Friday.",
    "Not only does the dock feature some very cute artwork of Tom Nook and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Timmy and Tommy Nook atop an island in a pastel blue sea, but this special edition of the Switch also comes with some aesthetically pleasing Joy-Con controllers - unless you're a fan of the rather garish colorways Nintendo tends to release.",
    "Well, we're sad to report that, if you hadn't already gathered, there seems to be a significant lack of adorableness to this year's Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals.",
    "However, the Animal Crossing fun is far from over for existing Switch owners - and let's face it, we all thought it was for a while there - thanks to Nintendo's decision to include Animal Crossing's new DLC in its Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) Expansion pack.",
    "(Not in the UK or US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "Over the course of its life, NSO has seen some fair criticism for its... well, nothingness. Sure, it gave you access to online multiplayer and a few neat retro games, but it was a little underwhelming when compared to competitor offerings like PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass.",
    "However, with the recent addition of the NSO Expansion Pack membership, investing a little more in your Switch experience makes a lot more sense.",
    "While there have been rumblings about the emulation quality of some of the N64 and Mega Drive titles included in this expansion, the option to relive memories of older consoles along with the Happy Home Paradise DLC makes for an enticing offer - especially if you have family or friends you can split the cost of a Family Membership with you.",
    "Bear in mind, though - if you cancel your NSO subscription, you will lose access to the DLC content, barring items you've already unlocked that will stay in your game."
