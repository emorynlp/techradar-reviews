    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best foldable phone yet, and price aside, is one that we can recommend without any real hesitation.",
    "That said, it\u2019s still not quite the perfect foldable phone, so we\u2019ve come up with a list of things that we want to see from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 to make that handset even better.",
    "You\u2019ll find all of those below, and we\u2019ll also be using this article to keep you up to date on any news and rumors as soon as they emerge. As you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s all quiet on the Z Fold 4 front so far, but we imagine leaks will start trickling out in the coming weeks and months, and we\u2019ll add them all here.",
    "You\u2019ll also find information on the likely release date and price here, as while neither have leaked, we can take an educated guess at both.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 will probably be announced in August 2022, with a release either later in the month or in early September. We say that because both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 were announced in August of their release years, hitting stores at least several weeks later.",
    "However, as there aren\u2019t any release date rumors yet we can\u2019t be certain Samsung will stick to that schedule, especially as the original Samsung Galaxy Fold was unveiled in February 2019. Though that didn\u2019t actually hit stores until September either, so we\u2019d say an August announcement is very likely.",
    "The price is something we can only really guess at for now, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 starts at $1,799 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,499. That\u2019s actually slightly less than the previous model cost, and given that Samsung\u2019s foldables are almost always criticized for their prices, we\u2019d think the Z Fold 4 will either have a similar price or be slightly more affordable, in order to head off criticism.",
    "Indeed, one source has specifically said the Galaxy Z Fold 4 will be cheaper, but they didn't say how much by.",
    "One early leak suggested that Samsung will equip the Galaxy Z Fold 4 with an under-display camera, just like the Galaxy Z Fold 3, but that this time it will be less visible under the screen, and it will also apparently be able to take better photos.",
    "This has been backed up by another leak which suggests the phone will have not one but two under-display snappers, presumably one for the main display and another under the smaller cover screen.",
    "This latter source adds that the battery will be bigger, the hinge will receive a redesign to make it lighter and more dust- and waterproof, and also the phone will come with similar snappers to the Galaxy S22.",
    "A patent application spotted by LetsGoDigital also suggests the upcoming foldable might have an under-display fingerprint scanner.",
    "But this would be no ordinary under-display fingerprint scanner, it would be a double-sided one that would sit between the cover screen and the main screen, so you could unlock the phone from either using the same hardware. As ever with patents though we'd take this with a pinch of salt.",
    "Beyond that we haven\u2019t heard anything about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, but we\u2019ll add to this section as soon as we do.",
    "What we can say is that it will probably support Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus, and will almost certainly have a top-end chipset. It will also probably have a broadly similar design to the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Beyond that, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.",
    "There are a number of things we\u2019d like to see improved or added for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. You can read the main ones below.",
    "We say this every year, but the Galaxy Z Fold range is just too expensive for most people. It\u2019s understandable that the price is high given the tech involved, but we\u2019d like to see Samsung try and push it down.",
    "The good news is that the company seems to be doing that, as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 was a little cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, so hopefully Samsung will repeat that trick with the Galaxy Z Fold 4.",
    "Ultimately, we\u2019d like to see these phones not cost any more than top-end conventional smartphones do, but we suspect that\u2019s at least a few years away still.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a top-class phone in so many ways, but its cameras don\u2019t come close to those on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and some other Samsung handsets.",
    "Given how much we\u2019re paying for these phones we\u2019d like to see that change on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Rather than the 2x optical zoom on the current model we want 10x like the S21 Ultra offers, along ideally with an extra lens for 3x zoom.",
    "While that\u2019s our biggest camera complaint, we\u2019d like to see the other snappers improved too, especially the Galaxy Z Fold 3\u2019s 4MP under-display one, which is a neat trick but feels half-baked.",
    "One thing all foldable phones seem to struggle with is battery capacity, as they tend to have batteries that are at most a match for standard smartphones, despite typically having much bigger screens.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 for example has a 4,400mAh battery, which would be an average size at best for a non-foldable phone, but with two displays, one of which is 7.6 inches, it doesn\u2019t go super far here.",
    "Its life isn\u2019t terrible, but in our tests it was generally less than a day with moderate use, so there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. Therefore, we want to see a bigger battery and longer life with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the first Samsung foldable with support for the S Pen stylus, and this is a big addition, as it helps you get the most out of its massive screen. But the S Pen is only compatible with the large main display, not the smaller secondary screen.",
    "This isn\u2019t a huge problem given that the expansive main screen is where it\u2019s likely to be most useful, but once people have a stylus there will surely be times when they\u2019ll want to use it on the other screen too, and at 6.2 inches this display isn\u2019t that tiny.",
    "So for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 we want to see stylus support included for both screens, so that users don\u2019t have to switch between the stylus and their digits so often.",
    "While our main complaint about the stylus implementation on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is simply that it doesn\u2019t work on the secondary screen, we\u2019re also a little disappointed that there\u2019s no slot for it in the phone.",
    "That means you either have to use a case with a slot built in (limiting your case options) or risk losing the S Pen. While there are certainly downsides to including a slot (it takes up extra space in the phone for one), we think that if Samsung is serious about stylus support then one should be added, especially if we don\u2019t get any more Galaxy Notes."
