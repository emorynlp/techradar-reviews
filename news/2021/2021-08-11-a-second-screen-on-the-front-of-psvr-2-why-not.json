    "While using a virtual reality headset can be immersive for the player, it can be a bit of an isolating experience for those sitting around watching you. A newly-uncovered patent shows Sony is trying to figure out how to solve this socially-awkward situation in time for the PSVR 2 release.",
    "The patent (first spotted by VR Focus and deftly named \"Display screen front panel of HMD for viewing by users viewing the HMD player\") describes how an additional external, front-mounted display could help those watching a VR player understand what the headset wearer was seeing and feeling.",
    "That first one is pretty straightforward \u2013 with eye-tracking enabled, the outer screen would mirror what the headset wearer is looking at in-game, letting those nearby have a glimpse into their virtual world.",
    "It\u2019s the second one that\u2019s a bit weirder \u2013 the second screen would be used to estimate what\u2019s happening on a wearer\u2019s face under the headset, using a previously-captured image to mimic expressions that are then shown on the external screen.",
    "According to the patent, this would use \"a first image of a user including the user\u2019s facial features captured by an external camera when the user is not wearing a head mounted display (HMD). A second image capturing a portion of the facial features of the user when the user is wearing the HMD is received. An image overlay data is generated by mapping contours of facial features captured in the second image with contours of corresponding facial features captured in the first image.\"",
    "While virtual reality has become much better for integrating social experiences, whether through multiplayer or second screen gameplay, there\u2019s still a disconnect between the player and those around them. A second screen could work to alleviate this issue, particularly when it comes to reading the wearer\u2019s emotions.",
    "In fact, it\u2019s a similar solution to what Facebook has been testing for upcoming Oculus Quest headsets, with the company recently showing off a prototype for a headset able to display the user\u2019s eyes on a front mounted screen.",
    "Keep in mind that the PSVR 2 is said to be tethered to the PS5 console via a USB-C connection, so that second screen wouldn\u2019t add a stress on any mobile battery (though would be a strain on the headset\u2019s processing power).",
    "However, we\u2019re less convinced by the idea of seeing what a wearer is seeing within VR on an external, head-mounted display. For that to be effective, you\u2019d have to be staring at the front of the user\u2019s head at all times, and considering a VR is often a 360-degree experience, that\u2019s hardly practical. The original PlayStation VR\u2019s solution of mirroring action on a connected TV (or the Oculus Quest\u2019s wireless Chromecast connection to mobile devices) seems much more effective."
