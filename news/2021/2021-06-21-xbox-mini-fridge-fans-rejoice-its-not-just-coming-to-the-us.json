    "The demand for Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Mini Fridge is rather astonishing. The announcement trailer for Microsoft\u2019s meme-turned-reality product is now closing in on four million views, and was one of the most popular reveals at the company\u2019s Xbox and Bethesda Showcase event at E3.",
    "However, there were doubts as to whether the Xbox Mini Fridge would make its way to other countries outside of the US, due to being a bit of a niche product to say the least. With a release date set for \u201cHoliday 2021\u201d (that\u2019s between November and January), Xbox general manager Aaron Greenberg has since confirmed that the Xbox Mini Fridge will indeed be released outside of the US.",
    "In the tweet below, Greenberg \u2013 who now cheekily refers to himself as a \u2018Home Appliance Visionary\u2019 in his Twitter bio \u2013 said that the world\u2019s most powerful mini-fridge is coming this holiday, and won\u2019t just be available in the US.",
    "We still don\u2019t have any news on how much the Xbox Mini Fridge will cost, but it looks as though it can hold approximately 15 regular-sized cans of soda. That should be enough to get you through even the most hardcore gaming sessions.",
    "Ever since the Xbox Series X was revealed, the internet poked fun at the console\u2019s design and made various memes depicting it as a fridge. Microsoft joined in on the fun, and went as far as to create an actual full-sized Xbox Series X fridge.",
    "Now, though, it\u2019s making a more consumer-friendly version, and it looks like the product will be an unexpected hit for Microsoft who, as far as we\u2019re aware, has never made a fridge before.",
    "Maybe we'll get an Xbox Series S portable Bluetooth speaker next. What do you say, Microsoft?"
