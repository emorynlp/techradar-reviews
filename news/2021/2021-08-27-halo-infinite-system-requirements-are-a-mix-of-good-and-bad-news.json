    "Halo Infinite system requirements for the PC version have appeared online, ahead of the game\u2019s December 8 release date, and it\u2019s a mix of good and bad news for PC gamers.",
    "When Microsoft and 343 Industries showed off Halo Infinite gameplay last year, gamers were unimpressed, to say the least, with poorly designed enemies (which brought rise to the Craig meme) and lifeless environments that felt distinctly last-gen.",
    "The backlash was so severe, that Microsoft delayed the game, leaving the Xbox Series X and S without their only noteworthy exclusive.",
    "That left a lot of us to hope that the extra year of development would be put to good use, allowing 343 Industries to make a more visually impressive title, and going by the system requirements, which have been spotted on the game\u2019s Steam page, that might be happening.",
    "When it comes to the minimum specs, there\u2019s good news here, as there\u2019s nothing too taxing for any gaming PC or laptop that was bought in the last couple of years. Considering Halo Infinite has been built to run on the Xbox One, which was never cutting-edge tech even when it launched back in 2013, it\u2019s probably no surprise that it\u2019ll run on older PCs as well.",
    "However, the recommended system requirements are where things get interesting, as they show quite a leap. As PC Gamer points out, recommending an Nvidia RTX 2070 is quite an ask, and it could mean we\u2019re in for a much more polished visual experience on PC. Along with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel i7-9700k processor, it seems if you want the most out of Halo Infinite on PC, then you\u2019ll need a pretty capable beast, and that may not be the best news for people who\u2019ve been struggling to get a decent GPU recently.",
    "It's certainly made us interested to see how Halo Infinite justifies those kind of specs, but at least the minimum requirements should be achievable for many people.",
    "Another bit of good news is that it appears the game only requires 50GB of storage space. That\u2019s pretty small for modern games, and while that may hint at a game that\u2019s smaller in scope than some people are hoping for, it\u2019ll be welcome for anyone who is running out of storage space, or has a slow internet connection."
