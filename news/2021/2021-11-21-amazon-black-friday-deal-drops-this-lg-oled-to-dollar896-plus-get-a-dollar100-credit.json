    "Looking for a cheap OLED TV this November? Check out this 48-inch LG A1 OLED going for just $896.99 (was $1,199) in today's early Amazon Black Friday deals.",
    "That's the cheapest price yet for this great entry-level OLED from LG, and, to sweeten the deal even further, Amazon is also throwing in a free $100 gift card when you use the code HBQ5KMZKGRRP at checkout.",
    "Put together, this is one of the better Black Friday deals out there right now if you're on the hunt for a display that's excellent quality but doesn't completely break the bank.",
    "While 'entry-level' for an LG OLED, the A1 still absolutely blows most cheaper options out of the water when it comes to picture quality. For example, it still supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG and packs in a very hefty 4K processor for great upscaling performance. You'll also get LG's excellent WebOS platform too - a great OS that works great with both Alexa and Google Assistant.",
    "Now, it's worth noting that the LG A1 OLED only has a 60Hz display. That's absolutely fine if you're going to be sitting back and watching your favorite shows or movies, but you may want to consider the more expensive LG C1 OLED if you're planning on hooking up to a PS5 or Xbox Series One. The good news is that model is also on sale with Amazon's Black Friday TV deals this week, and we've included it just below.",

    "Looking for something cheaper? Totally understandable! That's why we're rounding up all of today's best Black Friday TV deals on everything from super-cheap 4K TVs to lavish Samsung Neo-QLED displays."
