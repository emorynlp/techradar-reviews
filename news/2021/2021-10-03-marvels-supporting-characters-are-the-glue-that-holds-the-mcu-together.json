  "summary": "Opinion: Like The Simpsons, the MCU never underestimates the importance of its bit-part players",
  "article": [
    "Beware, spoilers for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and other Marvel movies lay ahead!",
    "One is the story of an ordinary American family in an ordinary American town; the other is the saga of extraordinary people with superpowers. One resets to the status quo at the end of almost every episode; the other revels in the vastness of its decades-old continuity.",
    "And yet, despite being chalk and cheese on so many levels, The Simpsons and the Marvel Cinematic Universe have much more in common than longevity and their availability on Disney Plus. Because whether you\u2019re hanging out in Springfield or one of the far-flung corners of the MCU, their supporting characters can be just as memorable as the big hitters with their names in the titles.",
    "Ask anyone to name their favorite Simpsons character, and they\u2019re as likely to mention Moe, Sideshow Bob or Comic Book Guy as Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Maggie. In fact, back in the show\u2019s 1990s glory years \u2013 remember those? \u2013 a major reason for The Simpsons\u2019 success was the way the focus could be on Principal Skinner one week, then Reverend Lovejoy and Aunt Selma the next. In effect, Springfield quickly became a vast shared universe populated by recurring characters you came to know and love.",
    "We don\u2019t know if Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige is a Simpsons fan \u2013 he did voice a Thanos parody in 2020 episode \u2018Bart the Bad Guy\u2019 \u2013 but it certainly looks like he\u2019s been taking inspiration, even since the MCU\u2019s early days.",
    "In the original Iron Man, it felt safe to assume that Clark Gregg\u2019s Agent Coulson was a random government suit who\u2019d never be seen again. But by the time Loki bumped him off in The Avengers \u2013 after appearances in Iron Man 2 and Thor \u2013 Coulson\u2019s loss was such a big deal that it brought the feuding Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk together to save the world. In a room full of supersoldiers, billionaire genius playboys, and Norse gods, it\u2019s the \u2018ordinary\u2019 character who keeps things grounded and real. Coulson also gives us mere mortals some perspective on what it\u2019s like to work alongside superheroes \u2013 and ask Captain America about getting your prized collection of trading cards autographed.",
    "And for all Tony Stark and Loki\u2019s beautifully crafted one-liners, it\u2019s usually the characters further down the cast list who bring the biggest laughs. Luis (Michael Pe\u00f1a)\u2019s uniquely subjective approach to storytelling gives Ant-Man its most memorable scenes, while wannabe revolutionary Korg (Taika Waititi) is arguably the standout character in Thor: Ragnarok \u2013 a movie stacked with A-list comic performances.",
    "Despite their comic relief assignments, however, the MCU\u2019s funniest supporting players aren\u2019t just there to bring the laughs. They\u2019re also fully rounded characters, with lives and motivations of their own, whether their interests are staying out of prison (Luis) or running a successful leafleting campaign (Korg). Crucially, Marvel puts in the hard yards to make sure you care about characters who get relatively limited screentime. Indeed, the thought that Korg may have been killed in Thanos\u2019s assault on the Asgardian ship in Infinity War came as just as much of a hammer blow as that famous finger snap.",
    "Even Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), up there with the silliest of all the MCU characters, is given a degree of pathos. A lauded British stage actor paid to masquerade as terrorist boss the Mandarin in Iron Man 3, Slattery is undeniably ridiculous. But he\u2019s also tragic, as a series of questionable life choices and bad luck have landed him in Xu Wenwu\u2019s prison by the time Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings rolls around. As good as he is for a hilarious anecdote \u2013 his musings on finding inspiration in Planet of the Apes are priceless \u2013 you can\u2019t help but feel for a man who\u2019s spent years in solitary confinement, with only his faceless Dijiang pet, Morris, for company.",
    "When a character like Slattery does make a surprise return, it enhances the connectivity of the universe. While it\u2019s usually the big-name Avengers-style crossovers that grab the headlines, Marvel\u2019s formula allows smaller-scale encounters to happen in almost every movie or TV show \u2013 and they don\u2019t even have to shout about it.",
    "It doesn\u2019t even matter if you don\u2019t remember that the vlogger on the bus in Shang-Chi also appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Or if you didn\u2019t spot that the Abomination is a returning character from The Incredible Hulk \u2013 a movie many viewers have chosen to forget anyway. But if you\u2019re a big MCU fan, these callbacks \u2013 however big or small \u2013 make you feel like a privileged member of an inner circle, peeking behind the curtain to see how everything fits together in Feige\u2019s grand plan.",
    "Perhaps the best thing about supporting players, however, is that they don\u2019t have to lurk in the shadows forever. Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), effectively Steve Rogers\u2019 love interest who never was, became surprisingly pivotal to the wider MCU when she turned up in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, while Ayo (Florence Kasumba) got the chance to lead the Dora Milaje in Okoye\u2019s absence.",
    "Dr Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) received an even bigger promotion in WandaVision, after spending the first two Thor movies in a thankless sidekick role. Marvel could easily have created a new scientist to be the audience\u2019s eyes and ears in Westview, but by bringing back Darcy \u2013 working alongside FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park), himself a veteran of Ant-Man and the Wasp \u2013 they emphasized that connection with earlier entries in the MCU.",
    "Now, as Phase 4 kicks properly into gear, Doctor Strange\u2019s librarian-in-chief Wong (Benedict Wong) has emerged as a surprising frontrunner to become the MCU\u2019s MVP. Not only does he show up in the trailer for Spider-Man: No Way Home and the opening of Shang-Chi (alongside the aforementioned Abomination, bizarrely), he\u2019s part of the brain trust brought in to solve the mystery of the Ten Rings.",
    "While Wong, Darcy, Sharon, Korg and Luis are unlikely to ever headline their own live-action movies or TV shows, the fact they\u2019re there, showing up every now and then to interact with the superstars of the MCU, makes the universe richer. So everyone else who\u2019s trying to build a complex shared universe should take a note from The Simpsons \u2013 it never hurts to give your supporting players the respect you give your leads.",
    "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings streams on Disney Plus from November 12."
