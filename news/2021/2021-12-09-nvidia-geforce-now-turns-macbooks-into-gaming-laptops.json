    "Nvidia GeForce Now has just got a major update that makes it run even better on Macs, potentially turning any MacBook into a gaming laptop.",
    "GeForce Now is Nvidia\u2019s cloud streaming service, which allows you to play games hosted on a remote PC on almost any device either through a web browser, or via the GeForce Now app. We\u2019ve been incredibly impressed with the service, including the new RTX 3080 subscription tier, which allows you to play modern games with advanced graphical effects such as ray tracing on devices that usually wouldn\u2019t be able to run those games \u2013 such as smartphones, older laptops and Chromebooks. All you need is an internet connection.",
    "The GeForce Now app is also available for Macs, delivering games that wouldn\u2019t normally run on Apple\u2019s hardware, and the new 2.0.36 update brings improvements for Mac gamers.",
    "Crucially, GeForce Now will now run games in the correct aspect ratio for Apple\u2019s excellent MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) and MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) devices.",
    "Pretty much all MacBooks, including the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), can now run games at 1600p, with a powerful Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU effectively powering them if people subscribe to the new RTX 3080 subscription tier, which costs $99.99 / \u00a389.89 (around AU$140) for six months.",
    "There\u2019s also a cheaper \u2018priority\u2019 tier for $49.99/\u00a344.99 (around AU$70) which offers resolutions up to 1080p, as well as a free tier with less powerful hardware and a game session limit of one hour.",
    "This means you can play games like Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing effects on a MacBook \u2013 something you can\u2019t usually do. As MacBooks use a slightly different aspect ratio and resolution compared to gaming laptops, this new update should make games look even better on Apple\u2019s devices.",
    "There\u2019s also good news for people who play a lot of Ubisoft games such as Far Cry 6 and Assassin\u2019s Creed: Valhalla, as you can now link your Ubisoft Connect account to GeForce Now, like you can also do with Steam.",
    "This means you don\u2019t have to log in to individual Ubisoft games when launching them through GeForce Now. This will make launching Ubisoft games a lot smoother, and is certainly a welcome change.",
    "Another nice thing about GeForce Now is that all games are kept updated, so you won\u2019t be faced with a big download when you want to play, unlike when gaming on your own PC.",
    "When Nvidia announced it was getting into cloud gaming, we were excited. Not only does the company have a long history with gaming hardware, especially graphics cards, it's also a big player when it comes to servers. This combo had the potential to seriously rival other cloud gaming offerings, such as Stadia from Google and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Cloud Gaming.",
    "In fact, Nvidia GeForce Now has been even more successful than we\u2019d hoped. We\u2019ve tried out the new RTX 3080 subscription tier, and have been very impressed with how it brings immersive AAA gaming to a diverse array of devices that wouldn\u2019t normally be considered gaming machines.",
    "Games look good and run well, and by bringing games to more affordable devices, or machines that people already have in the house, GeForce Now can help more people access games that they may not have been able to before.",
    "So, the fact that Nvidia is continuing to improve GeForce Now is great news. By allowing MacBooks to essentially become gaming laptops for little extra money could also bring a whole new audience to some of the best PC games out there."
