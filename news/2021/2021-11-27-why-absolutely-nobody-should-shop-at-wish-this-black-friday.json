    "My friends and I have a fun game we like to play, which we call WTF Wish. The F stands for frick, obviously.",
    "Hearkening back to the heyday of rogue, random sellers on Amazon, Wish is the wild west of e-commerce these days, giving us some top-notch randomness delivered straight to our social media news feeds.",
    "Its marketing strategy works, too - at least, in terms of the fact that I almost always stop to see what strange knicknacks I'm being recommended this time - a vast majority of which are either so explicit or just plain gross that I just couldn't bear to share them through our site.",
    "So, I thought it would be fun to check out some of the insanely low-price and popular items on Wish this Black Friday - which would be made even cheaper by the Wish Black Friday voucher code, offering up to 80% off.",
    "On a serious note, while most of the products are just good to poke fun at, we'd advise against purchasing tech items from Wish - especially as the French government has \"found a large proportion of products it examined on the Wish site to be dangerous.\"",
    "Oh, and also, we'll be using the full listing names from the site. It's part of the experience.",
    "We could go on for hours with the curse items we found on here, but you're getting the gist of it by now, we're sure.",
    "If you want some genuinely good Black Friday deals while they're still around, we're still covering the best of the best. Just not from Wish."
