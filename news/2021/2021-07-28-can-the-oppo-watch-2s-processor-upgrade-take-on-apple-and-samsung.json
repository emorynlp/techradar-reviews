    "Wear OS smartwatches have always been a little underwhelming compared to their Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch counterparts. Weaker processors and less impressive displays are part of the reason that the best Wear OS watches don\u2019t do better than 7th on our best smartwatches list.",
    "The hardware inside the new Oppo Watch 2 though, such as its Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, could finally help the Google operating system catch up a bit (if and when the device launches outside of China).",
    "This hardware announcement bodes well for the Oppo Watch 2 entering our best Wear OS smartwatches list too. The Snapdragon Wear 4100 is the same hardware used by our number two watch, the TicWatch Pro 3. This suggests the new Oppo Watch (at least on paper) has the hardware it needs to do very well, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how it does in our testing.",
    "An improved processor isn\u2019t the only feature we can look forward to in the Oppo Watch 2. 10 minutes of fast charging will net you a full day\u2019s battery life and can last for 16 days on a full charge thanks to Power Saver mode; you\u2019ve also got the usual health and fitness features too such as a heart rate tracker and an SpO2 monitor.",
    "For now though, the Oppo Watch 2 isn\u2019t available in the US or the UK, but it's launching in China on August 6. Given that the previous model released globally we suspect we\u2019ll see it soon, but is it going to be worth the wait?",
    "It might be a while before we can get our hands on the Oppo Watch 2, but should we hold out on getting a different smartwatch? We can\u2019t know for sure until we test the smartwatch out for ourselves, but we can compare its specs to what\u2019s out there already.",
    "For Wear OS watches, we\u2019ve already mentioned that we\u2019re confident the Oppo Watch 2 can do well. It\u2019ll have a powerful processor that many Wear OS devices don\u2019t yet match, and a display that\u2019s larger and has more pixels than the options currently at the top of our list. Its promised battery life is very strong too, all for an estimated price of around $200-$300 (\u00a3150-\u00a3225 / AU$275-AU$400) which is on par with the competition.",
    "If you\u2019re weighing this up against the best Apple and Samsung smartwatches, the main draw will be the Oppo Watch 2\u2019s price and battery. It will last longer and cost much less than the smartwatches offered by these brands, though we suspect its other features won\u2019t be as powerful as a result. If you\u2019re okay having less device storage and a slower processor, though, this could be the device for you.",
    "The Oppo Watch 2 takes a much more middle-of-the-road stance based on what we\u2019ve seen in the announcement. It won\u2019t be the best smartwatch out there, but it won\u2019t cost you too much either. If it does launch in the UK and the US, this could be a great budget-friendly smartwatch that\u2019ll offer you some great features, while missing out on only a few premium benefits."
