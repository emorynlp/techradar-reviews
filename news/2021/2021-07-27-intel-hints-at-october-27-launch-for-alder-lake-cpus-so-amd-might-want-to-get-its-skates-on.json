  "article": [
    "Intel\u2019s chief executive has dropped a subtle hint that Alder Lake processors might be launched at the chip giant\u2019s Intel ON event at the end of October.",
    "As flagged up by VideoCardz, on yesterday\u2019s Intel Accelerate webcast, CEO Pat Gelsinger described the Intel ON event \u2013 due to happen in San Francisco on October 27-28, but also virtually \u2013 using the term \u2018fully hybrid\u2019, which seems to be a reference to Intel\u2019s Hybrid Technology.",
    "Hybrid Technology is Intel\u2019s take on ARM\u2019s big.LITTLE architecture first seen in Lakefield chips and set to be used in Alder Lake, where normal \u2018big\u2019 (performance) cores will be paired up with \u2018small\u2019 (power-efficient) cores.",
    "Intel ON will be about all manner of things, but that includes \u2018PC solutions\u2019 and the mention of \u2018hybrid\u2019 seems to suggest Alder Lake could be unveiled, particularly given that the rumor mill has already floated the idea that Intel is looking at a launch date around the end of October.",
    "So, this fits with existing speculation, and it also makes sense in terms of Intel\u2019s overall schedule. With Alder Lake silicon to be out late in 2021, an initial reveal coming at the end of October would seem to be about the right timing before the chips actually hit shelves (possibly the following month).",
    "Then again, Gelsinger could be talking about something else of a \u2018hybrid\u2019 nature in Intel\u2019s plans, so clearly enough we shouldn\u2019t get carried away here just because this suggestion seems to fit with other nuggets from the rumor mill. Ultimately, only time will tell, but if Intel\u2019s CEO is indeed hinting at just this, we only have three months to wait before we find out the true nature of Alder Lake CPUs.",
    "Another interesting point here is that the grapevine has already asserted that the flagship Alder Lake processor will have 8 big cores and 8 small ones (for a total of 16-cores), and a render displayed during the Intel Accelerate webcast showed a 12th-gen chip with 8 large cores and 8 littles ones on the end, again providing a suggestion that the rumor mill is correct.",
    "Sample chips of the purported Core i9-12900K with 8+8 cores are reportedly being sold in China, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of leakage around these pre-release samples in recent times.",
    "Intel has been long known to be scheduling a late in 2021 launch for Alder Lake, and as mentioned, October 27 fits with what we\u2019ve heard from the rumor mill, too. It appears Team Blue is staying on target with its next-gen chips, then, and what\u2019s interesting in the overall CPU sphere is that there appears to be no whisper of any response incoming from AMD.",
    "While Ryzen processors have produced storming sales in recent times on the desktop, AMD can\u2019t afford to rest on its laurels. The danger is that Intel is taking a whole new approach with the aforementioned Hybrid Technology and its incoming 12th-gen range, with speculation contending that Alder Lake processors are going to be quite something.",
    "We\u2019ve seen leaks which suggest that the Alder Lake flagship could be a Ryzen 5950X killer \u2013 salt handy, of course \u2013 and rumors that the low-power cores should provide plenty of pep in terms of overall performance, and aren\u2019t just there for laptop users (and better battery longevity). Then there\u2019s the further consideration that Windows 11 is apparently being honed to run better with Alder Lake\u2019s new hybrid design.",
    "All of this makes for a potentially formidable Intel launch that could take the wind out of Ryzen sales, with no clear answer on the horizon from AMD yet. Next-gen Ryzen processors based on Zen 4 aren\u2019t expected until later in 2022, and with no Zen 3+ refresh in the offing according to the rumor mill, the expected response from Team Red is a 5000 XT revamp.",
    "The worry is that may not be enough, looking at what Alder Lake promises, even if AMD is planning to put its 3D Chiplet technology to use in a 5000 XT range. And what\u2019s more, if they\u2019re really happening, XT variants will need to get here in a hurry, otherwise Intel could really push its advantage even harder with the 12th-gen launch."
