    "Many users were left aghast when, for the first time ever, Spotify announced that they are raising their subscription prices for many users. Users across the UK, US and in parts of Europe can expect to see a considerable increase to their Spotify bill.",
    "In the UK, a Premium Student account will increase from \u00a34.99 a month to \u00a35.99, while the two-person Duo offering will increase from \u00a312.99 a month to \u00a313.99. While the price of an individual account remains steady at \u00a39.99, it is families who will experience the biggest blow, as Spotify\u2019s Premium Family plan is set to sky-rocket from \u00a314.99 a month to \u00a316.99.",
    "In the US and Europe, only the price of the Premium Family plan will be affected, increasing from $14.99 to $15.99, and from \u20ac14.99 to \u20ac17.99 respectively. This is thought to be Spotify\u2019s latest attempt to crack down on family plans being shared between groups of friends or individuals. In September 2019, Spotify began to ask for proof that all members on a family plan are resident at the same address - unsurprisingly, this resulted in a string of privacy complaints.",
    "These prices make Spotify seem distinctly less competitive compared to other streaming services. Taking family plans as an example, Amazon Music, Apple Music and YouTube Music are now all cheaper alternatives, with their plans all priced at the old Spotify rates of $14.99 / \u00a314.99.",
    "You can check out TechRadar\u2019s guide to the best music streaming services, for a more in-depth comparison.",
    "While some may argue that a price increase is long overdue, it\u2019s a strange time for Spotify to announce the hike.",
    "In the UK, Spotify (and other streaming services) have come under intense scrutiny, resulting in a high-profile inquiry into the economics of streaming in the House of Commons. Representatives from across the UK music industry \u2013 from label managers to working musicians \u2013 submitted impassioned evidence that they feel that Spotify\u2019s current rates of payment (between $0.03 - $0.05 per stream) is not fair recompense for their work, and that Spotify\u2019s current operating model creates a toxic \u2018winner takes all\u2019 market, where superstars are rewarded with vastly inflated profits while smaller artists struggle to make a living.",
    "In the US, The Union of Musicians and Allied Workers orchestrated a \u201cJustice at Spotify\u201d campaign, which mobilized protests at Spotify offices in 31 cities across the world. Their open letter \u2013 which demands a penny per stream rate, and would put Spotify payments on par with Apple Music \u2013 has gained over 28,000 signatures thus far.",
    "In response, Spotify launched Loud and Clear: a communications initiative which was supposed to \u201cincrease transparency by sharing new data on the global streaming economy.\u201d However, many campaigners were left with unresolved questions around the details of the deals Spotify has struck up with major labels, and whether (as many users suspect) Spotify takes payment for playlisting or preferential algorithmic treatment.",
    "Many members of the music industry will be left wondering whether there is any chance that Spotify\u2019s price increases will trickle down to musicians \u2013 or whether it will merely line Spotify\u2019s own pockets.",
    "In an even more bizarre twist, Spotify\u2019s price increase was announced as Daniel Ek, Spotify co-founder and CEO, readies a bid of \u00a31.8 million to take control of Arsenal Football Club.",
    "Unsurprisingly, news of this exorbitant bid occurring at the same time as increasing prices for users and spiraling tension over the fairness of Spotify\u2019s pay-outs for artists has been met with widespread frustration. As Tim Burgess, lead singer of indie-rock outfit The Charlatans, summed it up in a tweet: \u201cSo many artists are forced to take second jobs, give up flats because they can\u2019t pay their rent all while getting decent numbers of plays on @spotify \u2013 yet the owner has enough to bid for a premier league team. It just doesn\u2019t seem ethical to me.\u201d",
    "Some commentators have debated the ethics of raising prices at all during a pandemic \u2013 especially considering that Spotify has tripled in value during the pandemic, as streaming numbers surged over lockdown.",
    "Spotify\u2019s decision has been soundly criticized by Deezer COO Laurence Miall d\u2019Aout, who made the following statement to journalists: \u201cWe just wanted to let you know that Deezer isn\u2019t going to raise prices in the middle of the pandemic. Music, podcasts and radio help people cope and we don\u2019t feel this is the time to make things harder for them. If we ever were to increase prices, we would give our users a 3 month heads up to make sure that it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise.\"",
    "However, it\u2019s worth noting that Spotify\u2019s prices have remained static for over a decade, and that other streaming services \u2013 including Netflix \u2013 have managed to raise prices during the pandemic with a fraction of the outcry Spotify\u2019s hike has prompted. The issue is timing \u2013 and announcing a significant price hike while Spotify is weathering various other controversies over its working practices and financial decisions maybe wasn\u2019t the savviest move.",
    "Not a great deal: \u201cWe offer a variety of subscription plans tailored to our users\u2019 needs, and we occasionally update our prices to reflect local macroeconomic factors and meet market demands while offering an unparalleled service.\"",
    "Only time will tell whether this price hike is part of a wider strategy by Spotify to make payments fairer for musicians. But considering that Spotify has recently been heavily investing in its podcasting capabilities, including launching a podcast subscription service to rival Apple\u2019s, it seems like music streaming is at the bottom of Spotify\u2019s priority list, for now."
