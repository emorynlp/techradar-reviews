    "There\u2019s another Samsung Unpacked event coming on March 17 at 10am EDT, and no, we aren\u2019t expecting another flagship phone. Instead, rumors suggest the brand will unveil the Samsung Galaxy A72 mid-range phone at the digital event, which will be streamed on Samsung's press room and official YouTube page.",
    "\u2018Mid-range\u2019 might be underselling the A72: rumors suggest it will be a powerful device that\u2019s expected to inherit even more from flagship phones than its predecessor, including the vaunted \u2018Space Zoom\u2019 capable of 30x magnification. This is impressive given the Galaxy A71 didn\u2019t even have a telephoto lens.",
    "Samsung didn\u2019t outright say the A72 would be the product revealed \u2013 in fact, its invitation to the next Unpacked is very sparse on details. But there are hints that the A72 will be the focus \u2013 namely, the event\u2019s name (\u2018Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Awesome Unpacked\u2019) and the conspicuous capitalization in the one-line description on the announcement post: \u201cJoin us on March 17 for the Galaxy Awesome Unpacked to hear how Samsung Electronics is bringing Awesome to everyone.\u201d",
    "Judging by the rumors, the A72 would be Awesome to see revealed.",
    "Aside from Space Zoom, those rumored flagship perks coming to the A72 include spec upgrades like a 90Hz refresh rate for the 6.7-inch Full HD (2400 x 1080) AMOLED display with in-screen fingerprint sensor, up to 256GB storage, a 5,000mAh battery, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.",
    "That\u2019s on top of specs inherited from the A71 that are still respectable in 2021: a 32MP selfie camera and quad rear camera with 64MP main shooter, 12MP 123-degree FoV ultra-wide camera, 5MP macro, and 8MP telephoto. The only downside we\u2019ve heard? It won\u2019t have 5G \u2013 at least at first, or that some regions may only get a 4G LTE version. We\u2019ll have to wait until the March 17 Unpacked to know the truth."
