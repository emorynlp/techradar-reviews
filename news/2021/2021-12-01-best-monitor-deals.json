    "If you're looking for a cheap monitor to improve your computing experience, then you've come to the right place. We've scoured online retailers from Amazon to Best Buy for the best cheap monitor sales and deals. Whether you're looking for a display with 4K resolution, a massive screen, or a way to improve your gaming experience, our list features the best cheap monitors for any desk or budget.",
    "Because you can use pretty much any device with an external display these days, we think you should use a monitor for everything \u2013 from your iPad to your more powerful Surface Book 2. Otherwise, you\u2019re depriving of yourself of some much-needed screen real estate. With these cheap monitor deals, you don\u2019t even need to spend much to jump in on the action.",
    "To make things easier for you, we've split our selection of monitors into five categories, which include: the best general-use monitor, the best gaming monitor, the best professional monitor, the best curved monitor, and the best budget monitor. See our top cheap monitor sales below so you can find the right monitor for you at the best price.",
    "Obviously, you've come to this list because you want to save money on a new monitor \u2013 but the motivation for finding a cheap monitor will vary from one person to the next. Maybe you need an everyday display to get you from one Zoom meeting to the next, or you're seeking a gaming monitor that'll do your gaming rig justice. Two factors to strongly consider, regardless of purpose, are size and resolution.",
    "Size: You'll want a monitor that'll fit comfortably on your desk or table. Typically, monitors range in size from 15 to 30 inches (measured diagonally). Ultrawide displays, meanwhile, can top 50 inches and are fast becoming a preference among creative professionals and serious gamers.",
    "Resolution: This refers to the amount of pixels a monitor can display. Higher numbers yield a sharper picture and more refined details. For graphics-intensive tasks \u2013 like gaming or video editing \u2013 you'll want something that's at least Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) or as high as 3,840 x 2,160 (4K).",
    "Additional Features: Other features you'll want to consider will depend on the type of display you're shopping for. You can explore those more in-depth in our guides to the best general monitors, best gaming monitors, and best business monitors.",
    "The Dell S2721D is a solid and affordable QHD monitor that'll suit general users and casual gamers alike. It boasts a gorgeous 27-inch 1440p display, a 75Hz refresh rate, and a vivid IPS panel that hits 99% of the sRGB color gamut \u2013 which also makes it a decent choice for editing photos and video.",
    "Aesthetically, the Dell S2721D is quite breathtaking with three-sided ultrathin bezel. Situated on the rear are a pair of HDMI 1.4 ports, DisplayPort 1.2, audio line-out, and a security lock slot. (Curiously, it doesn't have a single USB port.) Making space for this Dell monitor will be easy since it can be oriented horizontally or vertically.",
    "For a no-frills QHD home monitor, the Dell S2721D is an excellent value buy. The built-in 3-watt speakers are weak, though, so think about picking up one of the best computer speakers with the money you'll be saving on this cheap monitor deal. Read the review: Dell S2721D",
    "The Asus VP28UQG is an excellent budget 4K gaming monitor. It may not be as feature-packed as its pricier counterparts, but it still has plenty to offer \u2013 namely FreeSync and G-Sync support, a flicker-free display panel, and built-in eye strain-reducing tech that you'll come to appreciate after hours-long sessions.",
    "Since it is a budget-priced gaming monitor, the Asus VP28UQG will appeal more to casual gamers who can also use it a general display for work or school. It'll serve as a fine introduction to the world of 4K gaming monitors until you're ready to upgrade to something more robust that can handle higher frame rates.",
    "The BenQ PD2700U is a no-nonsense 27-inch 4K monitor that'll fit well in any (home) office. You'll be sacrificing some bells and whistles here, but in exchange you'll receive plenty of pixels (for lots of detail), accurate colors, and professional calibration straight out of the box. If you intend to stream some 4K shows or movies in between Zoom meetings, you may find yourself impressed with the BenQ PD2700U's razor sharp picture. But allow us to be clear: this monitor's MO is productivity and content creation. When it comes to serious computing, the BenQ PD2700U truly shines. Read the review: BenQ PD2700U",
    "The AOC CU34G2X has plenty going for it at its price point. Standout features of this 34-inch curved display include QHD resolution, a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and AMD Freesync. Its curve radius (1500mm) isn't overwhelming. In fact, the AOC CU34G2X provides quite an immersive experience, especially once you don a pair of solid gaming headphones. Design-wise, the AOC is rather...forgettable. But it'll really help to look past that caveat because its performance is anything but forgettable \u2013 especially at this price. Read the review: AOC CU34G2X",
    "The Asus VP228HE is a fantastic budget monitor for light gaming or media streaming. Although it may 'just' be 1080p, you'll still be getting a fantastic display with bright color contrast and a vivid picture. And lest we forget its built-in bonus features \u2013 from GamePlus Technology to EyeCare Technology. Yeah, it only has a 60Hz refresh rate but there's still a 1ms response time coupled with a flicker-free screen to keep everything moving right along. At under $200 / \u00a3200, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything as remarkable as the Asus VP228HE at this price point.",
