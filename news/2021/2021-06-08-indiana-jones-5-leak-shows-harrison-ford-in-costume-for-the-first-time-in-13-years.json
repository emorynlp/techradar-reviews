    "A new image leaked from the set of Indiana Jones 5 shows Harrison Ford winding back the clock as the iconic adventurer.",
    "In a photo shared to Twitter, the 78-year-old veteran actor can be seen donning the character\u2019s famous relic-hunting get-up, fedora and all, for the first time in 13 years.",
    "Filming is now underway at the UK\u2019s Pinewood Studios and elsewhere in the country, with some scenes having already been shot at Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, as reported by GamesRadar.",
    "As per the report, the sequence shot at the railway involved Ford's stunt double and replica World War 2 military vehicles \u2013 but that\u2019s about as much concrete detail as we\u2019ve got so far.",
    "Indiana Jones 5, the first movie in the franchise since 2008\u2019s The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is scheduled for release on July 29, 2022, and will be helmed by Ford Vs Ferrari director James Mangold. Despite pulling out of directing duties in 2020, Steven Spielberg will be on hand as executive producer.",
    "Ford will star alongside Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Shaunette Rene\u0301e Wilson, while John Williams will be returning as the movie\u2019s composer.",
    "Naturally, we don\u2019t yet have any confirmed details about the movie\u2019s plot, but Mikkelsen, speaking to Collider in May, described the script as \u201ceverything [he] wished it to be.\u201d",
    "If Indy\u2019s unchanged outfit is anything to go by, it\u2019s safe to assume we can expect Indiana Jones 5 to stick to the franchise's usual winning formula of relic-stealing, boulder-fleeing action."
