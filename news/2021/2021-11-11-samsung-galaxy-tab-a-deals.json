    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab A price is already pitching pretty low, but you can usually grab it for even less thanks to regular Samsung Galaxy Tab A deals. While we usually see the lowest prices around big sales events, retailers often return to these record low costs throughout the year, so it's worth keeping an eye out.",
    "You're certainly getting a cheap tablet here, so you won't be zipping through more demanding apps with the same kinds of speeds as more luxurious devices. However, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A price offers up incredible value, especially for those just looking to catch up on some emails, stream Netflix or browse the web.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab A range is one we can fully recommend as one of the finest budget tablets around as the performance and quality puts similar tablets to shame. Tablets aren't as popular as they once were, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablets sit nicely in the middle between the much more expensive iPad deals, or the cheap Amazon Fire tablet deals, with the latter not supporting apps from the Google Play Store.",
    "Eight inch tablets are the ideal size for those looking for a smaller device that can easily be pulled out during a commute, or for a cheaper kids tablet. The 8-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A price is certainly attractive for light use, with the standard $149.99 / \u00a3149.99 cost offering up excellent value on a device that doesn't shy away from a few premium features.",
    "You're getting a perfectly decent screen for streaming content, and dual speakers capable of pumping out Dolby Atmos audio as well. With fantastic battery life and a microSD card slot that can take up to 512GB of extra storage, this is a great option for those after a budget device that feels far more expensive.",
    "If you fancy a larger version of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A, check out the latest prices for the 10.1-inch version. If you're planning on watching more video content, then this could be the one for you as the bigger screen is great for films and TV shows.",
    "It's not just a bigger tablet though, the screen resolution is improved over the smaller version and you're getting a bigger battery in here as well, which means even more power under the hood.",
    "The standard Samsung Galaxy Tab A price is $149.99 / \u00a3149.99 for the 8-inch model and $249 / \u00a3249 for the 10-inch version. The latter model does run a little expensive considering you're really only upgrading the screen size a little and picking up a slightly better battery. However, we rarely see those standard prices on the larger device anymore, and you're far more likely to find it for a much more fair $199 / \u00a3199 price tag.",
    "You won't find many tablets sitting under $150 these days, so the 8-inch model is certainly an outlier in the field. However, you're not skimping on specs to grab this particular model - as there's still some considerable power under the hood (and those Dolby Atmos speakers are certainly a surprise to many). If you're looking for a tablet for lighter browsing, checking your emails, and catching up on Netflix on the go, this is an ideal budget option.",
    "The 10-inch does also offer an interesting proposition, but we wouldn't pay the full $249. You'll easily find Samsung Galaxy Tab A deals dropping this down to $199, which is an easy price to pay for a larger screen and boosted battery.",
    "Want to check out the full Samsung range? We've rounded up every tablet still in production over on our guide to the cheapest Samsung tablet deals and sales. However, you'll find plenty more cheap Android tablets up for grabs right now, and if you're after something a little more premium you can also take a look at the latest Surface Go deals as well."
