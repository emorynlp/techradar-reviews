    "He may be the grand old age of 42 but when Manny Pacquiao enters the ring, the whole of the Philippines - and large chunks of the globe - stop what they're doing to watch. Today he's back to entertain the masses in Las Vegas, and we're here to explain how to watch a Pacquiao vs Ugas live stream no matter where you happen to be on Earth.",
    "The bad news is that it's only available on PPV in some countries, while Manny worshipers in his native Philippines get to watch absolutely FREE!",
    "More than two years after his last fight, the man, the myth, the senator, Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) switches the suit and tie for familiar old shorts and gloves, as he tries to wrestle back ownership of the WBA welterweight title that was stripped from him and inherited by Yordenis Ugas (26-4) - it's safe to say the Pac-Man was less than impressed with the decision to elevate Ugas to a title that wasn't lost in the ring.",
    "However, while he wouldn't like to admit it, he's probably pleased that he's facing the Cuban rather than the undefeated Errol Spence Jr., as had been the original plan before a retinal tear put paid to that.",
    "Ugas, also known as 54 Milagros, is no spring chicken but he's still seven years his opponent's junior. He's certainly the less storied of the two fighters, but he's been more active than Pacquiao over recent years, and he also has the height advantage and the reach advantage.",
    "Could those factors change the complexion of this fight? It's a tough one to call, so follow our guide below to watch a Pacquiao vs Ugas live stream online from anywhere - including key free details.",
    "Below, we've rounded up ways to watch today's boxing in various countries around the world. But if you're abroad and discover that your usual coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that does is showing the fight.",
    "The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Manny Pacquiao vs Yordenis Ugas anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "The Manny Pacquiao vs Yordenis Ugas fight takes place on Saturday, August 21 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.",
    "The night's main card is set to get underway at 9pm ET / 6pm PT, which is 2am BST in the UK, 9am PHST in the Philippines, and 11am AEST in Australia.",
    "Ring walks for the main event are roughly expected to be as follows.",
    "Pacquiao vs Ugas ring walk times",
    "An all-time great, Manny Pacquiao is one of the biggest names in boxing, and is still going strong 26 years after his professional debut.",
    "The 42-year-old Filipino is widely considered the greatest southpaw in boxing history, having beaten 22 world champions, including Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and Adrien Broner, to win 12 major world titles across eight weight classes.",
    "If he beats Yordenis Ugas, he'll have won world championships in four different decades.",
    "Yordenis Ugas was elevated to the status of WBA (Super) champion because the title's previous holder, Manny Pacquiao, failed to defend his title within the required timeframe.",
    "This is arguably the biggest fight of the 35-year-old Cuban's career, and he comes into in in strong form, having defeated 11 of his last 12 opponents.",
    "He fought on the same night as Pacquiao's last fight, and has had two more bouts since then."
