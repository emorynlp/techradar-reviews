    "Modularity isn\u2019t something new in computing, but the Framework Laptop hopes to bring the upgradability of desktops to more portable devices. With an emphasis on a do-it-yourself approach, the team behind this modular laptop wants to give you the control to fix and improve your own device.",
    "The Framework Laptop comes with a 13.5-inch display boasting a rather unusual 2,256 x 1,504 resolution (due to its 3:2 aspect ratio), a full HD 60 FPS webcam, and is powered by an 11th gen Intel Core processor - with three options to choose from - and up to 64 GB of DDR4 RAM.",
    "If the parts are available, you\u2019ll be able to swap in and out whichever of these you want, and you can even change the laptop\u2019s ports to fit your needs. Every aspect of the device is modular, but based on product descriptions it doesn\u2019t look like the Framework Laptop has a dedicated graphics card and it isn\u2019t clear if one can be installed.",
    "In concept, the Framework Laptop seems like an exciting idea, and the company\u2019s vision to help reduce computing waste and give people more control over their devices is one we can certainly get behind. However, we can\u2019t help but be a little skeptical until we see it in action.",
    "This is because Framework\u2019s promises for its laptop aren\u2019t too dissimilar to products like the Google Ara - Google\u2019s now-defunct modular phone. While desktop PCs are essentially modular devices, which let you add and upgrade components, laptops are more compact, so there are more restrictions on what upgrades can be made.",
    "We\u2019ll just have to wait until the middle of 2021, when the Framework Laptop is set to ship, to see if it can swap out our fears for a bit more optimism.",
