    "The next Fitbit is coming soon, and it could be a new and improved Fitbit Charge 5. 9to5Google has obtained a render that it says shows the company\u2019s next fitness tracker, codenamed \u2018Morgan\u2019.",
    "Details are scant so far (there\u2019s no \u2018Fitbit\u2019 branding on the image and 9to5Google is keeping its source close to its chest), but TechRadar has found an FCC document registered earlier this year for a new Fitbit \u2018wireless activity tracker\u2019 that might just fit the bill.",
    "External photos and a user manual for the device are currently private, but are due to be made public on October 18, 2021. There\u2019s no way to be certain that this device is \u2018Morgan\u2019, but the dates seem to line up.",
    "So is this a Fitbit Charge 5? It might be \u2013 or it could be something new. We\u2019ve been expecting a new Charge to land within the coming months, but based on previous release patterns we weren\u2019t anticipating it to land until April 2022. The Fitbit Charge 4 arrived in April 2020, so an October 2021 launch would mean less than two years between the two devices.",
    "The \u2018Morgan\u2019 codename is interesting, but no guarantee. Fitbit has been known to give its devices similar monikers during development; in 2017 we first heard about a new Fitbit device codenamed \u2018Higgs\u2019, which turned out to be the Fitbit Ionic. However, there were also rumors of a pair of of sports headphones codenamed \u2018Parkside\u2019 complete with a \u2018leaked\u2019 image, but these never materialized.",
    "We\u2019ve contacted Fitbit for a comment, but we won\u2019t hold our breath; the company declined to comment when images of the Fitbit Luxe leaked ahead of its official launch \u2013 though Fitbit did move its launch date forward a few days in response.",
    "The \u2018Morgan\u2019 looks quite different to previous watches in the Charge series, but the line is certainly due for a makeover. The Charge 4 was released before Fitbit finalized its new Biologic Industrial Design Language, which Fitbit\u2019s senior vice president of design Jonah Becker says is \"inspired by and designed for the human body\". That means smooth shapes and rounded edges, as seen on the Fitbit Inspire 2, Versa 3, Sense, and Luxe.",
    "The \u2018leaked\u2019 image shows a fitness tracker with a minimalist design, featuring a soft silicone band that sits flush with the device\u2019s body. The body appears to be plastic (though it\u2019s not possible to tell for certain), and there\u2019s a color display \u2013 something conspicuously lacking from the Charge 4.",
    "What makes us curious is the appearance of large black bezels around the edge of the Morgan\u2019s display. No watches in Fitbit\u2019s current line have such big bezels, which makes us wonder about the image\u2019s accuracy. We\u2019ll keep you updated as and when we hear back from Fitbit, but we\u2019re hedging our bets.",
    "When the Fitbit Charge 4 launched, it was one of the smallest and lightest GPS fitness trackers around. It\u2019s held up well since its launch in April last year, but its successor will need to work harder to stand out. In recent months we\u2019ve seen a bevy of cheap smartwatches including the TicWatch E3 and Amazfit Bip offering an impressive range of fitness tracking tools for a very modest price.",
    "The Fitbit Charge 5 will need a new ace up its sleeve if it\u2019s going to stand out, and it\u2019ll have to be something that won\u2019t be in direct competition with the company\u2019s other devices. The Fitbit Sense has stress monitoring sewn up, the Luxe has the style-oriented section of the market cornered, the Inspire 2 is the lightest and smallest activity band in the range, and the Versa 3 is Fitbit\u2019s take on the multi-functional smartwatch.",
    "We think it\u2019s likely that the Charge 5 will be a device aimed squarely at fitness fans, with an improved raft of features designed specifically for workouts \u2013 possibly even as a rival to entry-level running watches like the new Garmin Forerunner 55.",
    "We\u2019d be very surprised if it loses its GPS receiver (a tool extremely useful for runners and cyclists), and it could gain new tools that integrate with Fitbit Premium, such as workout plans sent from the Fitbit app to your watch, and suggested workouts based on your fitness level and goals. Additional sports profiles would be a welcome addition, as would breathing exercises (a feature missing from the Charge 4) and post-workout recovery guidance.",
    "There's some seriously tough competition, but if Fitbit can put together the right package, the Charge 5 could be the next device to take the top place in our guide to the best running watches."
