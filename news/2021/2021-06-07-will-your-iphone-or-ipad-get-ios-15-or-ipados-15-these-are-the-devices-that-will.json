    "So which iPhones and iPads will get the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 updates? Well, Apple has mentioned device compatibility for its new software, so we now know for sure.",
    "We've listed the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 compatible devices below, so you can check if your iPhone or iPad is on the list. If not, we're sorry, but you're sticking with iOS 14 or earlier.",
