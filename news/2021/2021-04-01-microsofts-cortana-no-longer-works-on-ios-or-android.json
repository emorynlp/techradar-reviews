    "Microsoft hasn\u2019t had much luck in the mobile world, with its Windows Phone platform failing and its Cortana assistant struggling to compete with the likes of Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa. In fact, the Cortana app doesn\u2019t even work on Android or iOS anymore.",
    "Microsoft has announced that as of March 31, 2021, the Cortana mobile app will no longer be supported, but that any content you created on it \u2013 such as lists and reminders \u2013 will still be accessible through Cortana for Windows, or on the Microsoft To Do app.",
    "The discontinuation of Cortana on smartphones doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, not least because it happened a while back in some regions. It\u2019s also arguably the weakest of the big name digital assistants (if you can even consider it a big name one) and is largely redundant on devices that come with alternatives built in.",
    "Even Amazon\u2019s Alexa, which is enjoying plenty of success on smart home devices, isn\u2019t talked about much in the context of smartphones, despite an Alexa app being available. This, again, is presumably because almost every phone already has Google Assistant or Siri, and users don\u2019t feel much need for an alternative.",
    "Cortana will live on for now, though, just not on your phone. It\u2019s still available for Windows 10, and as it\u2019s the default assistant there, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it sticks around for a while \u2013 whether or not many people are using it.",
    "Microsoft, for its part, claims that this move is part of Cortana\u2019s continued \u201cevolution as a productivity assistant,\u201d which suggests it\u2019s still committed to the service in some form, just one that\u2019s more at home on desktops and in business."
