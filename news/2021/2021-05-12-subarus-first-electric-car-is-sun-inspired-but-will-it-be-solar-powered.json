    "Subaru has teased the first images of its inaugural electric car effort, the Subaru Solterra EV \u2013 and it\u2019s given more than a few hints that it could utilize some form of solar power.",
    "There aren't many details to go on just yet, but Subaru has confirmed the Solterra will be powered \u2013 primarily, at least \u2013 by the electric battery platform the company has been co-developing with fellow Japanese automaker, Toyota.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean the car definitely won\u2019t have any form of solar power, though, and given the origins of its name and the seemingly deliberate positioning of Subaru\u2019s official teaser shots, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the the Solterra arrive with some sort of solar charging system, or maybe even solar roof panels.",
    "The car\u2019s name, Solterra, combines the words \u201csol\u201d and \u201cterra\u201d \u2013 the Latin words for \u201csun\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d, respectively. Now, while that usually wouldn\u2019t be enough to have us speculating that solar energy might be involved in the car\u2019s design, the Solterra is sharing an electric platform with another car that most definitely is getting a little help from the sun.",
    "Toyota\u2019s upcoming bZ4X EV is being built on the same e-TNGA platform (or e-Subaru, to Subaru) as the Solterra, and has been confirmed to utilise a fully-fledged \"on-board solar charging system\", which Toyota says will be able to extend the car\u2019s range.",
    "Of course, there\u2019s no guarantee that the Solterra will feature this same solar tech, but since the bZ4X is set to benefit from this additional charging system alongside a more conventional battery powertrain, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to learn that Subaru\u2019s debut EV will benefit from a similar feature.",
    "Solar-powered roof panels, too, might also be on the cards, especially given the recent announcements of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Genesis G80 EV. On the former, it\u2019s claimed these panels will add \u201cup to 2,000km\u201d (around 5-6km per day) of additional range per year \u2013 so they\u2019d certainly be a welcome addition to the Solterra.",
    "Still, with Subaru tight-lipped on the Solterra\u2019s specs, design and price, we\u2019re left to speculate on a set of teaser images the company has announced as a precursor to the car\u2019s official launch \u2013 expected to come later in the year, ahead of a 2022 on-the-road release.",
    "In both photos, the Solterra seems deliberately positioned in shot of the (noticeably bright) sun. While this is likely a nod to the car\u2019s name, it\u2019s nonetheless exciting to think this might be a double entendre hinting at some sort of solar-related reveal to come at a later date.",
    "As for the only other official details we know, then, Subaru says the Solterra will arrive as \u201ca truly capable and durable SUV\u201d delivered in an \u201cenvironmentally responsible package.\u201d",
    "And what could be more environmentally responsible than the sun?"
