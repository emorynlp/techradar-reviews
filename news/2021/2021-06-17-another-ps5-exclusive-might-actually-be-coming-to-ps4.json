  "article": [
    "A database entry for the Demon\u2019s Souls remake has been spotted for the PS4 \u2013 suggesting the PS5 exclusive might not be so exclusive, after all.",
    "As per reports from Playstation Game Size, the entry was not discoverable prior to the PS5\u2019s launch last November, implying the game is a new addition to the last-gen system\u2019s database.",
    "This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Demon\u2019s Souls remake is definitely coming to the PS4, mind \u2013 the entry may merely represent a test version for developers \u2013 but it does beg the question of why Bluepoint Games would concern itself with the now-outdated hardware.",
    "Currently, Demon\u2019s Souls \u2013 which itself is a remake of the 2009 PS3-exclusive \u2013 is exclusive to the PS5, and has never been playable on the PS4. The game, which sees players hack and slash their way through monster-infested hellscapes, is often credited with being the inspiration for the Dark Souls series.",
    "It wouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise to see Blueprint port the game to PS4, though. With the exception of games like Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition and Astro\u2019s Playroom, all of the PS5\u2019s launch titles \u2013 from Assassin's Creed Valhalla to NBA 2K21 \u2013 have PS4-compatible counterparts.",
    "PS5 owners have only recently begun to benefit from true next-gen exclusives, thanks to the arrival of games like Destruction AllStars, Returnal and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart in 2021.",
    "It\u2019s worth reiterating that a PS4-compatible Demon\u2019s Souls remains speculative, rather than probable \u2013 as mentioned, there\u2019s no telling of Bluepoint\u2019s intentions behind the recent database listing.",
    "Still, if we do see the game arrive on last-gen consoles in the near future, it would certainly be at odds with everything that makes the PS5 version so great \u2013 particularly from a visual standpoint.",
    "In our review, we described Demon\u2019s Souls on PS5 as a game which takes \u201cfull advantage of next-gen hardware\u201d by \u201cproviding lightning fast load speeds and probably the best graphics we've seen in a video game to date.\u201d",
    "The game also utilises the power of the DualSense controller to great effect, creating the sensation of steel clashing against armor or the flickering of fire at the end of your weapon, which ultimately works to draw you deeper into the game world.",
    "All this is to say that everything that makes the PS5 remake so great would be impossible to translate to the PS4, and so players would be left with, well, the same game from 2009.",
    "Only time will tell if Blueprint does indeed decide to take its fantasy dueller back a generation, but we\u2019re not holding out hope for a particularly impressive last-gen experience.",
