    "In an interview with Kinda Funny Games, Xbox Game Studio boss Matt Booty talked about Microsoft\u2019s current efforts in competing with Sony first-party games, Booty acknowledged Xbox has \u201cnot been out in front,\u201d and went on to say that Xbox hasn\u2019t really \u201chad the sort of 1:1 with Sony.\u201d",
    "Booty praised PlayStation Studios and its leaders for creating \u201ctentpole\u201d games \u201cthat fit into a junction where everybody can play\u201d and explore its big worlds. He also praised the really well-realized characters and high production values of Sony games, going on to say that \u201cyou can't argue with the quality and the craft and the games that [Sony] delivered and that they're working on now.\u201d",
    "Booty did avoid discussions about Microsoft\u2019s response to Sony\u2019s blockbuster games like God of War or Uncharted, even though it has announced games similar to those like Indiana Jones. But, again, Booty did acknowledge those are absolutely the games Xbox wants to go after.",
    "With the previous Xbox One generation, many people felt that Microsoft lagged behind Sony when it came to the quality of its first-party games. After the incredible year Sony had in 2018 with the critically-acclaimed releases of Spider-Man and God of War, Microsoft followed up in early 2019 by releasing Crackdown 3.",
    "This was a game that didn\u2019t have the same quality, gameplay, and story as Sony\u2019s 2018 blockbusters. It became abundantly clear that Microsoft was failing with its first-party games, which also impacted sales of the Xbox One, and PS4 lifetime sales were double the amount of the Xbox One in 2019.",
    "However, it appears that Xbox is on the right track this generation with the Xbox Series X/S and its Game Pass service. Microsoft has expanded its game studios by acquiring an abundance of development studios like Obsidian Entertainment, Ninja Theory, and all the studios under Bethesda\u2019s parent company Zenimax Media. Sony too has acquired more studios, like Bluepoint and Housemarque.",
    "Admittedly, Microsoft did get off to a slow start this generation compared to Sony. Sony released quality games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Returnal, Demon Souls, and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart in the first seven months of the PS5 release, while Microsoft had to delay its biggest game, Halo Infinite by a year, leaving its launch lineup looking pretty barren compared to the PS5.",
    "However, Microsoft\u2019s upcoming games do show promise, with Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Starfield and Redfall releasing either at the end of this year or in 2022, and we expect a quality gaming experience from these titles to compete with Sony\u2019s array of upcoming titles like God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West."
