    "Each year, when the Prime Day deals roll around, the members of my running club message me asking for advice on the best deals, so they don't have to spend time trawling for the hidden treasures.",
    "This year, Amazon's running watch deals are particularly strong, with good savings on Garmin and Polar devices. Not all of these are the latest models (you won't find the brand new Forerunner 55 on sale, for example), but even slightly older Garmin watches stand up well, and the company has a track record for updating its firmware to add new features, so even previous-gen watches are a good investment.",
    "There are also some great deals on sports nutrition, including electrolyte tabs, energy gels and bars. Perhaps not something you'd usually look for on Prime Day, but it's a great opportunity to stock up and especially if you're thinking of starting slightly longer or more intense runs soon."
