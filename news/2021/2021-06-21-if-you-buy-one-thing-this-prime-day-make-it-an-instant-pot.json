    "Instant Pots will be that one purchase you won\u2019t regret and with Prime Day deals, you\u2019ll wonder how you ever lived without one. There\u2019s nothing more annoying than splashing your cash on a fancy appliance and it just collecting dust at the back of your cupboard, but the very best Instant Pots are different. Trust us.",
    "Today, you can save as much as 54% on Instant Pots, with the Instant Pot Duo Plus now $54.95 at Amazon. Effectively, you\u2019re getting nine appliances in one as this machine can do just about everything from yogurt making to rice cooking. There\u2019s also an impressive 35% off the Instant Pot Duo Crisp at Amazon, almost its lowest price ever (just behind Black Friday).",
    "With some ridiculously low prices on Instant Pots right now, these versatile appliances will save you hours slaving away in the kitchen. They air fry, slow cook, fast cook, bake cakes, and have a heap more functions too. In fact, you can do so much with an Instant Pot, you might not need your oven much at all\u2026",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down to find Instant Pot deals in your region.",
    "There\u2019s very little that Instant Pots can\u2019t do so if you\u2019re someone that likes to mix up what you\u2019re cooking, or perhaps you just need a quick way of preparing dinner, there\u2019s an Instant Pot for the job.",
    "Rather than finding space to store a slow cooker, an air fryer, or several other appliances, an Instant Pot combines all those cooking methods into one machine - and the best bit is they\u2019re super easy to clean. You can throw basic ingredients into an Instant Pot, press one button and you\u2019ll end up with everything from succulent stews to a delicious chili. Essentially, Instant Pots are just a fantastic way to make it look like you spent hours crafting a meal when in reality, it took a few minutes of prep - that\u2019s our kind of cooking.",
    "If you\u2019re keen to dip your toe into the Instant Pot world, we\u2019d suggest starting with something like the Instant Pot Duo Nova as this model is very affordable and still offers a large selection of cooking functions to choose from. Take note of the capacity each Instant Pot has - normally one quart equates to one portion, so a six-quart machine will be able to cook food for six people at once.",
    "These Instant Pot deals will be gone once Prime Day is over, and with such a stellar reputation, we\u2019re not expecting them to be in stock for long."
