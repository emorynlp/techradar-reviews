  "article": [
    "James Wan, the creative force behind some of the most successful horror franchises in recent memory \u2013 including Saw, Insidious, and The Conjuring \u2013 returns with a brand-new movie about a woman plagued by visions of real-life murder. It\u2019s already received acclaim for its shocks, surprises, and grisly originality, and we explain here how to watch Malignant online with a HBO Max membership, available for 31 days after its theatrical debut.",
    "Based on an original story by Wan, Ingrid Bisu, and screenwriter Akelka Cooper, Malignant follows the plight of Maddison Mitchell (Annabelle Wallis), a woman who, traumatised by recent events, begins to witness a shadowy figure committing violent murders in her sleep. Turns out they actually happened.",
    "Fearing for her sanity and a prime police suspect, Maddison and her sister Sydney (Maddie Hasson) embark on their own investigation; discovering along the way that events are somehow connected to Maddison\u2019s childhood imaginary best friend, Gabriel\u2026who might just be, y'know, the devil.",
    "While Wan\u2019s horror movie reputation was founded on haunted houses full of creeping menaces, Malignant looks to chart new territory.",
    "Also starring Mckenna Grace (Annabelle Comes Home), Michole Briana White, Jake Abel and Ingrid Bisu (The Nun), expect Wan\u2019s latest to be a heart-racing shocker with a defiantly demented third-act. Feeling brave? Then read on as we detail how to watch Malignant online now.",
    "Cinemas are open again around much of the globe, meaning that movies like Malignant are getting a worldwide theatrical release. If you feel like venturing out, the film debuts in the UK and Canada on Friday, September 10, simultaneous with the US premiere. However, it\u2019s been pushed back to an October 21 release in Australia, due to Coronavirus-related lockdowns across the country.",
    "Right now there\u2019s no confirmation whether Malignant will be procured by any of the major VOD platforms in these territories. However, many of the 2021 Warner Brothers films released on HBO Max \u2013 like The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It \u2013 have been made available internationally to rent as PVOD (premium video on demand) titles, on services like Amazon Prime Video, Apple iTunes, and Google Play Store. While we don\u2019t know for certain yet, it\u2019ll be worth checking these websites to see if that holds true for Malignant.",
    "As well as instant access to new Warner Bros. blockbusters \u2013 Clint Eastwood\u2019s neo-Western drama Cry Macho is up next on September 17 \u2013 you\u2019ll get over 13,000 hours of prime content: choice picks from the Warner Bros. archive and subsidiary companies like New Line Cinema, Studio Ghibli\u2019s animated masterpieces, DC Entertainment blockbusters like Wonder Woman: 1984.",
    "Plus \u2013 the clue's in the name \u2013 you can watch every iconic HBO series ever made. Enjoy The Sopranos, Euphoria, Mare of Easttown and The Wire, plus all 10 seasons of iconic sitcom Friends, addictive HBO Max Originals like Gossip Girl, and so much more."
