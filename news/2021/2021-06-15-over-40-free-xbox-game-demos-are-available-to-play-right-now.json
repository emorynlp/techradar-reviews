    "Xbox owners can play 40 free demos of upcoming Xbox games right now, as part of the ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest demo event.",
    "These free demos are available to download and play on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One right now, but only until June 21. So if you want to check out these unreleased games, then you better act fast as there are a lot to get through.",
    "However, Microsoft thas caveated that most of these demos are an early look at gameplay and so \"may not represent the full game at their release\".",
    "We've already tried out some of the game demos on offer and would recommend checking out Zelda-like action-adventure Tunic, open-world explorer Sable, old-school RPG Death Trash and laid-back adventure Lake.",
    "You can find the full list of game demos (and their developer) below:",
    "Many of these titles featured in the Xbox and Bethesda games showcase on June 13, and we expect to see more make an appearance at Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase Extended event, taking place on June 17 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST (or June 18 at 3am AEST)."
