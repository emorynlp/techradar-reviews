    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 leaks continue to drip in, with the latest one giving us a better idea of the camera setup that the incoming foldable is going to have \u2013 and that setup apparently includes an under-display selfie camera.",
    "This information comes courtesy of tipster @FrontTron on Twitter, following up on previous predictions made last month. It doesn't look as though the camera upgrade is going to be a huge one from the Galaxy Z Fold 2, but there are some interesting details to be found here.",
    "First of all the cover selfie camera \u2013 the one that points at you when the phone is folded and you're viewing the outer screen \u2013 is said to be a 10MP Sony 1.22um IMX 374 sensor, sat inside a punch-hole cut-out on the display. That's the same selfie camera as the one on the Galaxy Z Fold 2.",
    "Around the back of the handset we've got what's described as a triple-lens 12MP+12MP+12MP camera array, which again would seem to match the setup from last year's Fold \u2013 although we haven't been given any details on the sensors used here.",
    "It's the foldable camera where there seems to be a change: that's the selfie camera looking back at you when the screen is unfolded. According to the @FrontTron tweet, this will be a 16MP UPC (under-panel camera).",
    "The sensor is listed as a Sony 1.00um IMX x71 component, which we haven't heard about before. If the leak is accurate, it means the Z Fold 3 won't have a punch-hole interrupting the main display like the Z Fold 2 does.",
    "This would be the first Samsung smartphone to come with an under-display camera: we know that Samsung has been working on the technology, but it hasn't yet seen fit to share its efforts with the wider world. Previous rumors had suggested that a foldable phone would be the first Samsung handset to get a selfie camera embedded in the screen.",
    "Phones with under-display selfie cameras are already on the market, although at the moment their performance leaves quite a lot to be desired. We'll have to wait and see whether the Galaxy Z Fold 3 can change that \u2013 the handset is being tipped to break cover sometime in August.",
