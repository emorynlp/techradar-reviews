    "Today\u2019s work environment is more flexible and demanding than it has ever been. Knowledge workers are required to jump between video calls, continually research projects and competitors, build presentations, and more, often all at the same time.",
    "Whereas often teams were able to focus on one task at a time and collaborate in the office to get answers and complete tasks, now everyone is having to shift to a more distilled, yet still demanding, workflow.",
    "As a result, employees are demanding more from their computers than they have ever before. Not only do they need the power and performance to keep them going throughout their workflow, they also need the flexibility to do their jobs from anywhere.",
    "AMD, a global leader in processor technology, built its Ryzen\u2122 PRO 5000 Series mobile processors specifically to tackle the challenges of the new professional workforce.",
    "These processors offer the advanced technology needed to maximize performance for professional applications and collaboration tools essential to business productivity, anywhere.",
    "Power",
    "Each of the 5000 series processors is built on the industry leading Zen 3 architecture from AMD which features a completely redesigned chip architecture to allow for even more performance over the previous generation.",
    "Compared to the current 11th generation Core i7 and Core i5 processors from Intel, the AMD Ryzen\u2122 PRO 7\u00b9 and PRO 5\u00b2 series processors saw up to 23% faster performance in Microsoft Office applications such as Excel\u00b9.",
    "This performance is made possible by the up to eight available high performance processing cores designed to provide responsive multitasking across productivity, collaboration, and content creation apps.",
    "Professional applications often have demanding compute requirements and the AMD Ryzen\u2122 PRO 5000 series delivers exceptional single-threaded and multi-threaded performance to handle the full spectrum of professional tools.",
    "Whether you need incredibly fast responsiveness for a powerful application or you need speed and reliability when multitasking, the AMD Ryzen PRO 5000 series can help handle it all.",
    "Security",
    "Business professionals need more than just raw power in today\u2019s new work environment. With employees working from a wide variety of locations, keeping data secure is more vital than ever.",
    "Every AMD Ryzen\u2122 chip is designed from the ground up with multiple layers of security to protect and secure sensitive data from even the most sophisticated attacks. AMD Secure Processor is integrated directly into the chip to help protect sensitive data and Memory Guard provides real-time encryption of system memory to protect against physical attacks.",
    "New for the AMD Ryzen\u2122 PRO 5000 series is AMD Shadow Stack, which offers hardware enabled protections against control-flow attacks.",
    "The AMD Ryzen\u2122 PRO 5000 Series Mobile Processors also fully support Microsoft Secured-core PC initiative, which helps protect from firmware vulnerabilities, shield the operating system, and prevent unauthorized access to devices and data.",
    "Portability",
    "Power and security doesn\u2019t help much if your team can\u2019t work where they need to. The AMD Ryzen\u2122 PRO 5000 series are designed to give you the perfect balance of performance, security, and portability so you can have peace of mind that your team can get the job done and your company\u2019s data is secure.",
    "AMD strikes this balance by optimizing the responsiveness of navigating through daily tasks to ensure you get the performance you need without draining the battery unnecessarily. Instead of pulling lots of power to push demanding applications, processing power is intelligently delivered where it\u2019s needed more and conserved when it\u2019s not.",
    "Using the industry-standard MobileMark 18 battery life benchmark, the HP Elitebook 835 G8 was able to achieve up to 20 hours of battery life with a Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U processor.",
    "As the needs and demands of business and professionals continue to evolve, IT leaders are faced with the ever more challenging task of providing workers the tools they need to do their jobs in a wide range of environments.",
    "To ensure your team has the power, security, and portability they need, make sure your PCs are equipped with the new AMD Ryzen\u2122 PRO 5000 Series Mobile Processors.",
