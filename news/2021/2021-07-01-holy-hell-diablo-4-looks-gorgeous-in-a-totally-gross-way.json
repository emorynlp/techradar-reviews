    "With action RPGs, sometimes you\u2019re so busy clicking on loot and killing beasts that you forget to take in the scenes around you. That won\u2019t be a problem with Diablo 4. Blizzard\u2019s latest quarterly update on the development of Diablo 4 gives a deep-dive look at its gorgeously gruesome art style.",
    "From a gameplay perspective, perhaps the most important aspect is that Diablo 4 will let you customize your hero character in more complete ways than ever before. Not only will you be able to tweak armor styles, but for the first time you\u2019ll be able to change individual features of the characters themselves so that all players have a truly unique hero in the world.",
    "\u201cYou will be able to change the face of your character, the hairstyle, the facial hair (beards and eyebrows), and add jewelry (nose piercing or earrings), makeup, and body markings such as tattoos or body paint,\u201d explains Arnaud Kotelnikoff, Lead Character Artist for Diablo 4.",
    "\u201cYou will also be able to change the color values of your character\u2019s skin, eyes, hair/facial hair, and body markings. Some elements will be class specific, to support the classes\u2019 unique backgrounds, but many will be shared between classes allowing more possibilities to mix and match.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe look and feel of the classes has always been one of Diablo\u2019s secret ingredients, each class instantly recognizable and imbued with a strong and unique personality,\u201d says Luis Barriga, Game Director for Diablo IV.",
    "\u201cDiablo IV offers players more customization options than ever in a Diablo game, which makes achieving that result more challenging, but the outcome is well worth it. Your Barbarian is different from anyone else\u2019s but still feels undeniably like a Barbarian. With monsters, the focus has been on creating new foes and updating classics drawn from the pantheon of atrocities in our previous games, while using new processes and technology to their fullest.\u201d",
    "Blizzard had to \u201ccompletely rebuild [its] rendering engine and authoring tools,\u201d to hit the new level of fidelity, according to John Mueller, the game\u2019s Art Director.",
    "\u201cWe wanted to use the latest tools and techniques, but we did have a concern about leaning into \u2018realism\u2019 in a way that wouldn\u2019t have that hand-crafted feeling we felt was fundamental to a Blizzard game. We didn\u2019t want the characters to feel procedural or generic because of these processes. We also embraced realism in terms of materials and character appearance. I think the touchpoint being the amazing pre-rendered look from the Diablo III cinematics.\u201d",
    "But the end result is plain to see \u2013 this is by far the most richly-detailed Diablo game ever and, possibly (going by this early look at least), the best looking game Blizzard has ever made.",
    "\u201cWe made massive improvements to the level of detail, the surfacing of complex materials like skin, cloth simulation, hair, fur, metal, even down to the details of the highlights of the eyes and rivulets of perspiration,\u201d adds Mueller.",
    "\u201cWe built a robust character customization system that is entirely new to Diablo and it was a daunting amount of technical character work. These solutions had to work not just for a single character, but for hundreds of componentized armor sets, different body types, dozens of unique personas, and completely unique art for five distinct classes (to start). This was an entirely new challenge for our team to tackle.\u201d",
    "But the money shot of the latest Diablo 4 update is a sneak peek at some of the creatures you\u2019ll be battling as you traverse the roads, fields, mountains and dungeons of Sanctuary. Take a look at the following clips of the monsters you\u2019ll face: from the succubus to the incredibly-named \u201cBlood Bishop\u201d, they\u2019re horrifyingly captivating.",
    "This isn\u2019t all just a bunch of pre-rendered show pieces either \u2013 these are in-engine looks at what the new game will include. And it\u2019s at a rather advanced stage of development \u2013 at least when it comes to the art department\u2019s role. \u201c[At] this point the work is a very good representation of what you will see when the game is in your hands,\u201d notes Mueller.",
    "Diablo 4, with a more open world and greater focus on dynamic multiplayer opportunities, has from day one been taking its inspiration from the darker aesthetic of series classic Diablo 2, rather than the slightly more colorful take of Diablo 3. That decision seems to really be paying off now \u2013 I\u2019d imagine for many gamers, this art style is how Diablo has always looked in their heads, now brought to life.",
    "There\u2019s still no release date for Diablo 4, but those itching for a click-killing can get back to the series roots when Diablo 2: Resurrected, a remastered take on the second game in the series, releases September 23, 2021. Diablo Immortal, a new entry for the series for mobile phones, is set for release some time in 2021, too."
