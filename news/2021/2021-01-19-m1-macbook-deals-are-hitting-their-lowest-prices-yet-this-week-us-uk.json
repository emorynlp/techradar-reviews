    "M1 MacBook deals are hitting both the US and UK this week, with big savings on the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. That means you can pick up a luxury laptop with the latest M1 processor for its cheapest price yet right now, with plenty of configurations up for grabs.",
    "You'll find the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air available for $1,179.92 at Amazon right now, marked down from a previous $1,249 MSRP. This model has only hit $1,200 in recent sales, so an extra $25 off makes for a particularly enticing MacBook deal, especially considering these laptops rarely take significant discounts.",
    "However, you'll also find the M1 MacBook Pro available for its lowest price ever as well. The 256GB configuration has just hit $1,219 at Amazon, down from $1,299. That's $35 cheaper than its record all time low.",
    "If you're in the UK you'll also find some excellent discounts, with KRCS's M1 MacBook deals shaving 10% off the entire range. That's led to the cheapest price yet on the 256GB MacBook Pro, coming in at \u00a31,169.10 (was \u00a31,299) and the same 10% saving available on a range of configurable MacBooks as well.",
    "You'll find all of these MacBook deals and more just below, as well as the lowest prices from around the web as well.",
    "These MacBook Air deals are perfectly suited for those after a cheaper laptop, however you can spend just a little more and find some excellent MacBook Pro deals as well. If you're looking to fill out your whole ecosystem, it's worth taking a look at cheap iPad deals as well, as the tablet can compliment Apple's luxury laptops incredibly well. Of course, there's always plenty of laptop deals in much cheaper price brackets as well."
