    "The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G wasn\u2019t unveiled alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, and other products on August 11, but it looks like the phone could still be landing very soon indeed.",
    "That\u2019s because it\u2019s now been certified by Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group), as spotted by PriceBaba. This is something that usually happens within around a month of launch, and there\u2019s no question as to which phone has been certified, because along with model numbers (for three different versions of the handset), each is labeled as the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G.",
    "Beyond an imminent launch the listing doesn\u2019t really reveal anything though. It essentially confirms that the phone supports both Bluetooth and 5G, but we\u2019d have been very surprised if it didn\u2019t. Though it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no mention of a 4G version here, which could mean the Galaxy S21 FE will only launch in a 5G flavor, unlike its predecessor.",
    "So when exactly might we get an official look at this new phone? Well, one previous rumor suggested an October launch, and that would more or less make sense with seeing a Bluetooth SIG certification now. Though if anything, we\u2019d think the S21 FE 5G might land even sooner, perhaps in September.",
    "Whenever it does land, we have a good idea of what to expect from it thanks to leaks and rumors. They point to a 6.4-inch 1080 x 2340 Super AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, a high-end Snapdragon 888 chipset, and a 4,500mAh battery.",
    "The camera is said to be a triple-lens one, with a 12MP main, 12MP ultra-wide and 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and the design is thought to be similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21\u2019s, albeit with the same color on the camera block as the rest of the back.",
    "With no new Samsung Galaxy Note this year, Samsung fans are currently lacking a conventional flagship for the second half of 2021. There\u2019s the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, but as foldables they\u2019re a bit niche, and the Fold 3 is also very expensive.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, though, is a more conventional proposition, with a likely far more palatable price.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely to support the S Pen stylus, so it\u2019s not a true replacement for a Galaxy Note, but with its high-end specs it could still tempt flagship buyers who were holding out to see what Samsung unveiled in the second half of the year.",
    "Those who liked the look of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range but wanted something a bit more affordable could also be swayed, as the Galaxy S21 FE is likely to be the cheapest model in the range, though the exact price remains unclear for now.",
    "And without a new Note, the Galaxy S21 FE will have less competition than the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE did, all of which means it might sell rather well.",
