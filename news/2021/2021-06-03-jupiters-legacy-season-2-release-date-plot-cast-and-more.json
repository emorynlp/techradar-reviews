    "Jupiter's Legacy season 2 doesn't look like it's coming to Netflix.",
    "The live-action superhero series has been dropped by the streaming giant after a single season, with comic creator Mark Millar revealing as much on Twitter on Wednesday, June 2.",
    "Strangely, neither Millar or Netflix has said that the series is officially cancelled. It's likely that it has been, but Millar's Twitter statement appears to suggest that the TV show could (hopefully) return in some form in the future.",
    "With that in mind, this Jupiter's Legacy season 2 hub will remain online for the time being. You'll still be able to read everything we did know about season 2, before Millar's announcement, below if you wish to read about where the series could have gone.",
    "The information below, too, hasn't been edited since the announcement was made, so anything after the first set of bullet points is old news.",
    "If \u2013 and it's a big if \u2013 we receive word that a second season has been greenlit, or if Jupiter's Legacy will return in another capacity, we'll update this page accordingly. For now, though, Jupiter's Legacy is no more on Netflix.",
    "Spoilers follow for Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1.",
    "Given the scale of its story in the source material, Jupiter's Legacy should get a second outing. Netflix has canceled other popular properties recently, such as The Irregulars, though, so Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 isn\u2019t a dead cert. However, Netflix owns Millarworld, the company behind Jupiter\u2019s Legacy, so it would make sense for them to renew it.",
    "With that in mind, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2. We\u2019ll dive into its potential release date, casting possibilities, story threads it could cover from the comics and more. We'll also look at how one other Netflix Millarworld production might tie into season 2's events in an Easter egg capacity, too.",
    "A word of warning before we begin: we\u2019re heading into major spoiler territory for Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1 and the comic books that inspired the series. If you don\u2019t want to know about what's likely to happen in Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2, it'll be in your best interests to leave this page.",
    "There\u2019s no launch date for Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2, which isn\u2019t surprising as it hasn\u2019t officially been renewed yet.",
    "There may also not be a release date for some time, if more episodes go ahead, based on other Netflix Millarworld productions taking precedence over it. Ahead of season 1\u2019s release on May 7, Millarworld president Mark Millar wrote a Netflix blog post that explained which of his company\u2019s properties were getting developed next.",
    "Currently, there are live-action adaptations of The Magic Order, American Jesus and a new, untitled spy property in the works. Throw in an anime series based on Millarworld\u2019s Super Crooks, and film adaptations of other comics including Empress, Huck and Prodigy, and it\u2019s a busy time for Millar and Netflix.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2, then, might not go into active development for a while. Assuming it gets renewed, 2022 feels like the earliest we'll likely see the show return.",
    "While Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 hasn\u2019t even been greenlit, Millar has been asked about a follow-up. In an interview with the Scotland Herald, Millar suggested that a second season had been given the go ahead by Netflix and would arrive next year. Additionally, in another chat with ComicBook.com, Millar admitted that he knew what the plan for season 2\u2019s plot was.",
    "\"We know where we're going [with season 2], Millar said. \u201cI mean the books are a good template. You know, the books are all sitting there for us, so we have a very rough plan. But we know it all depends on hopefully, not to get too cocky, that the audience responds the way we think they will, but we feel good about it.\"",
    "However, talking to TechRadar in the wake of season 1\u2019s release, Millar was less bullish about a second season. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what the plan is for that, but no doubt we'll find out in the next couple of months if it's coming back.",
    "There\u2019s no confirmation on which cast members will return, or what new characters may be introduced in Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2. Based on season 1, though, we can expect the following to appear:",
    "There are others who might return, but their appearances depend on what season 2\u2019s plot will be. The major absence from our cast list is Matt Lanter, who portrays George Hutchence/Skyfox in Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1. We\u2019ll explain why he might not appear in our plot section below.",
    "Other individuals who could return include Tyler Mane as Blackstar, David Julian Hirsch as Richard Conrad/Blue Bolt, Paul Amos as Dr. Barnabas Wolfe and Nigel Bennett as Dr. Jack Hobbs. Again, though, their appearances will be dictated by what comic issues Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 draws from.",
    "The major plot thread that season 2 will have to pick up is Walter\u2019s plan to overthrow Sheldon as The Union\u2019s leader. As our season 1 ending explainer article reveals, it\u2019s Walter - aka Brainwave - who created the clone of Blackstar, caused the Hilltop battle that led to the deaths of some up-and-coming superheroes, and caused a rift between Sheldon and his son Brandon throughout season 1\u2019s events.",
    "Why did Walter do this? He believes that The Union aren\u2019t using their superpowers to help make the world a better place. In that sense, Walter isn\u2019t a supervillain per se, but his ideals differ from those of his brother Sheldon.",
    "Ever since The Union obtained their abilities in 1929, Sheldon has coerced them into following his code of conduct - rules that prevent all superheroes from killing their enemies, and from interfering with issues including politics, war and epidemics. Having fought to keep Earth safe for nearly a century, though, Walter doesn\u2019t believe that Sheldon\u2019s code works anymore. He wants Sheldon gone so he can install himself as The Union\u2019s new leader and usher in an era where superpowered people can change the world.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 should continue this big plot point and lead to a major shocking moment that occurs early on in the comics. If you really don\u2019t want to know what happens at this juncture, don\u2019t read past the tweet below:",
    "In the comics, Walter convinces Brandon to betray his parents and join Walter\u2019s cause. Other superheroes follow suit, and Walter\u2019s group end up killing Sheldon and Grace.",
    "It\u2019s a significant moment in the source material. Walters ushers in a new world order where superpowered individuals end up creating a police state, and any remaining superheroes who don\u2019t join their cause are promptly dispatched if they don\u2019t go underground.",
    "Brandon\u2019s sister Chloe, alongside her boyfriend Hutch, Skyfox\u2019s son, become two such fugitives. Nine years after Walter murders her parents, Chloe and Hutch have a son - Jason - who possesses Chloe\u2019s superpowers and Hutch\u2019s natural intelligence, and who goes on to have a prominent role in leading a revolution against Walter\u2019s army.",
    "How, then, does Skyfox fit into all of this? In the comics, Chloe, Hutch and Jason - alongside other fugitive superheroes - find out where he's hiding and try to persuade him to join their fight.",
    "In Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1 and the graphic novels, Skyfox supposedly became the world\u2019s biggest supervillain following an incident that saw him leave The Union. Unbeknownst to the second generation of superheroes, however, Skyfox isn\u2019t the big bad that he\u2019s made out to be in the comics, and he could have a big role to play in Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 if this story thread is followed.",
    "If season 2 contains Sheldon and Grace\u2019s deaths, as well as the comics\u2019 nine-year time jump, we could see Chloe and company locate Skyfox and attempt to win him to their side. This would allow Matt Lanter to reprise his role as George Hutchence, albeit in a smaller role than he has in season 1.",
    "Alternatively, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 could follow a similar pattern to its predecessor by alternating between past events and the modern day.",
    "Season 1 interspersed its present day events with flashbacks to a period between 1929 and 1933, where the original six obtained their superpowers. Season 2 could follow suit through Millarworld\u2019s Jupiter\u2019s Circle comics, with these comics following The Union through the 1960s and detailing the events that led to Skyfox leaving the group.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Circle also explores more of Blue Bolt\u2019s story, who was conspicuously absent from the present day events in season 1. Additionally, the comic series examines how Fitz Small becomes wheelchair bound, why the Supermax prison for supervillains was constructed and the creation behind Sheldon\u2019s superhero code of conduct.",
    "If Netflix decides to set up the events leading to Sheldon and Grace\u2019s deaths in season 2, the TV series\u2019 second instalment may need to jump between the present day and Jupiter\u2019s Circle\u2019s 1960s plot points to cover more ground.",
    "In our view, this would be the way to go. Season 1 introduced so many characters that it was hard to keep track of them all, or provide enough screen time to tell their backstories. Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 would allow this to happen and reserve the comics\u2019 biggest moment until the season 2 finale. Alternatively, if Duhamel and Bibb have three-season contracts, their deaths could be held back until Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 3.",
    "Jupiter's Legacy may be a self-contained story, but it isn't the only one that takes place in the Jupiter's Legacy universe.",
    "Supercrooks is a Millarworld comic miniseries, and tells the tale of small-time crook Johnny Bolt, who recruits the ultimate crew of thieves to pull off one final big heist in Spain.",
    "An anime series based on Mark Millar and Leinil Francis Yu's comics is currently in the works at Netflix, and Millar recently took to Twitter to hype up the series, even though its release date is currently unknown.",
    "Following that tweet, Millar was also asked to confirm if Supercrooks took place in the same timeline as Jupiter's Legacy - which he promptly did.",
    "Check out Millar's confirmation below:",
    "What does this mean about a potential Jupiter's Legacy and Supercrooks crossover? Nothing, really. The two stories occur separately to each other, so don't expect The Utopian to appear in Supercrooks' anime adaptation or vice versa.",
    "What would be cool, though, is if Easter eggs for each TV series appear in their counterparts. Maybe a TV screen in Jupiter's Legacy season 2 could show a report based on the Supercrooks' successful (or failed heist)? It would be a fun little nod that ties the two shows together, if nothing else.",
    "Supercrooks will comprise 13 episodes (with run times around the 30-minute mark) when it arrives on Netflix. There's every chance, then, that Millar, the streaming giant or animation studio Bones could throw in a Jupiter's Legacy Easter egg or two.",
    "Millar recently revealed that Supercrooks would make its debut at the Annecy Animation Festival, which runs June 14 to 19, so we'll know more about how it fits into the world of Jupiter's Legacy then.",
    "Not yet, which won\u2019t come as a surprise since a second season hasn't even been confirmed yet.",
    "Yes. Netflix needs its own superhero TV series if it wants to compete with its competitors.",
    "Amazon Prime Video has The Boys and Invincible, while Disney has its slate of recently released and upcoming Marvel projects, including Loki, so Netflix needs a superhero property if it wishes to muscle in on this growing market.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1 has some missteps, but there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t be ironed out in season 2. Sheldon and Grace\u2019s deaths are reminiscent of Game of Thrones\u2019 Red Wedding moment, in terms of their shock value, and Jupiter\u2019s Legacy will benefit from showing that on screen at some point in the future.",
    "Until it does, however, Netflix\u2019s adaptation of Millar and Quitley\u2019s comics needs to retain audience interest by other means. Stepping up its action sequences would be a start, while providing backstories to other key characters wouldn\u2019t go amiss. If Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 2 can build on its intriguing plot points while ironing out season 1\u2019s mistakes, it should have enough about it to earn more time with viewers."
