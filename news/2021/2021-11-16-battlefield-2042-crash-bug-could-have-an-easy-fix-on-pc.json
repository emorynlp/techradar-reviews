    "Battlefield 2042 has a problem with crashing, but there\u2019s a potentially easy cure \u2013 on Steam at least \u2013 which is well worth giving a whirl if you\u2019re suffering issues and being dumped out to the desktop (or having the game just freeze up).",
    "As PC Gamer points out, what Steam users need to do is head to their Library, right-click on the listing for Battlefield 2042 in the left-hand side panel, click on \u2018Properties\u2019, then go to the \u2018Local Files\u2019 tab, and finally click on \u2018Verify integrity of game files\u2019 to do just that.",
    "The verification process goes through the entirety of Battlefield 2042\u2019s files and picks up on anything that might be missing or broken, and fixes it \u2013 and reportedly, it could well resolve (at least some) crashing issues. Definitely give it a punt, as it can\u2019t do any harm (the process does take a little while to run, though).",
    "Those playing Battlefield 2042 on Origin, EA\u2019s own store, can also right-click and use the \u2018Repair\u2019 option which performs a similar function. PC Gamer notes that while Steam\u2019s repair clearly did the trick, it\u2019s unsure whether the Origin repair made any difference, but again, it can\u2019t hurt for those experiencing frustrations at the cruel hands of random crashes.",
    "Battlefield 2042 has got off to a pretty shaky start in early access, and we\u2019ve seen the likes of various connectivity and server issues, as well as the aforementioned crashing.",
    "Some modes are having teething troubles, like Battlefield Portal where there\u2019s a known issue of players getting stuck in an \u201cinfinite queue\u201d, and the only way to escape is to hard-quit the game itself. EA is conducting an ongoing investigation into the latter issue. Also, there are continued \u2018Error: Persistence Data\u2019 glitches preventing people from playing.",
    "We can, of course, expect some problems with early access generally speaking, but we\u2018re past beta now, given that launch is imminent in just a few days \u2013 on November 19 \u2013 so EA obviously needs to get the big problems sorted pronto. Accusations of the shooter not being ready for release are already being bandied about, as you can imagine\u2026"
