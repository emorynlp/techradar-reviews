    "Global payments powerhouse PayPal may be considering expanding into the retail investing business, reports have claimed.",
    "According to CNBC, the company is considering allowing its users to trade stocks and has, to that end, hired brokerage industry veteran Rich Hagen. After leaving his position of CEO at Ally Invest, Hagen joined Invest at PayPal, a brand new division about which there are very few details at the moment, although his LinkedIn account notes Hagen is tasked with \u201cexploring opportunities\u201d in the consumer investment business.",
    "This is in line with what PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said during the company\u2019s investor day in February 2021 when discussing his long-term vision, which included the possibility of including \u201cinvestment capabilities\u201d as part of the company\u2019s offerings.",
    "This is far from PayPal\u2019s first foray into investing. Last year it expanded into the cryptocurrency market, slowly allowing an increasing number of users to buy, hold and sell bitcoin.",
    "This service was recently extended into the UK, allowing Brits to buy or sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum or litecoin.",
    "The popularization of cryptocurrencies has had a side-effect - growing awareness of the possibility of retail investment and trading, where ordinary individuals are able to easily trade everything from stocks, to precious metals, to cryptocurrencies.",
    "The trend reached its peak when a group of retail investors, organized on a Reddit subforum, \u201cshorted\u201d GameStop stocks, leaving WallStreet with billions in losses.",
    "\u201cIt has been doing really well in the U.S.,\u201d Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal\u2019s general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies, told CNBC, when asked about the company\u2019s crypto services. \u201cWe expect it\u2019s going to do well in the U.K.\u201d.",
    "\u201cThe tokens and coins have been around for a while but you had to be a relatively sophisticated user to be able to access that,\u201d da Ponte said. \u201cHaving that on a platform like ours makes a really good entry point.\u201d",
    "It might take a while for PayPal to kick things off, though, and it\u2019s unlikely the service will be available this year.",
