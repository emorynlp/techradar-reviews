    "With their ability to power multiple electrical devices anywhere, portable power stations like the respected EcoFlow family of products are catching on. The only downside: these units have typically been aimed at people needing to support electrical devices as big as clothes dryers, which has added to their battery size and weight.",
    "The new EcoFlow RIVER mini Portable Power Station is here to change all that. Weighing just 6.3 lbs (2.85kg) in a compact totable package, the RIVER mini brings portable power to a whole new range of users.",
    "Outdoor lovers/backyard barbequers, digital nomads/world travellers, and college students wanting to take their tech anywhere can now do so using the RIVER mini, without carrying a battery pack large enough for weightlifting.",
    "With its 300W rated output, the RIVER mini can power eight (8) devices simultaneously. Add in EcoFlow\u2019s proprietary X-Boost technology, and the RIVER mini can support total electrical loads up to 600W.",
    "These can be powered using this unit\u2019s two AC output ports, one car 12VDC output port, four USB output ports, and 15W wireless charger. Possible plug-ins can include laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones; WiFI routers, gaming consoles, TVs, printers, LED lights, and fans.",
    "Despite its awesome output, the RIVER mini is incredibly quiet. Measured in decibels (dB), this device\u2019s Running/Recharging noise is between 38-42 dB. To put this in context, that\u2019s the noise level of your average library.",
    "Because the RIVER mini runs on built-in batteries. It will need to be recharged from time to time. The good news: plug it into a standard AC outlet, and the RIVER mini will be up to 80% recharged in just one hour, and fully charged in 1.5 hours.",
    "No AC outlet available? No problem. The RIVER mini can be recharged by plugging it into your car\u2019s 12DVC electrical socket (aka the \u2018cigarette lighter\u2019), or by connecting it to EcoFlow\u2019s solar panels and getting free juice from the sun.",
