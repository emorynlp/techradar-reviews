    "We\u2019re still a few weeks out from Black Friday 2021, but that hasn\u2019t stopped big box retailers from rolling out the deals early.",
    "Case in point: this Roku Ultra LT deal at Walmart going on right now that cuts the price of the streaming box from $69 to $49.",
    "Not only does this deal save you $20 outright, but it allows you to get one of Roku\u2019s best streaming devices for around the cost of the Roku Streaming Stick and Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K.",
    "In our review for the Roku Ultra, we praised the streaming device for its versatility and breath in the amount of streaming services available to it. The LT version isn\u2019t quite as powerful as the regular Ultra and misses out on the Dolby Vision integration, but you\u2019re getting many of the same features at a very reasonable price.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Roku deals in your region.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Roku devices below."
