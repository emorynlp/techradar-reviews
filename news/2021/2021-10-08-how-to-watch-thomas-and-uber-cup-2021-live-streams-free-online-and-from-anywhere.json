It looks set to be another cracking tournament, so read on as we explain how get a 2021 Thomas Cup live stream and watch BWF badminton online from anywhere.",
    "China enter as the defending Thomas Cup champions - having beaten Japan in the final at Bangkok 2018 - while Japan are the reigning Uber Cup champions. Though Akane Yamaguchi will still be stinging from that lop-sided defeat to China in Vantaa last weekend, where she took Japan's solitary victory.",
    "Momota Kento is under pressure to deliver after his defeat at the hands of Shi Yuqi, as the host nation's hopes are pinned to the shoulders of Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Viktor Axelsen, who was part of the Denmark team that won the Thomas Cup in 2016.",
    "Thailand fell at the last hurdle in the Uber Cup three years ago, and will be led by Ratchanok Intanon. Can they break the recent China-Japan duopoly?",
    "Read on to find out how to get a badminton live stream from all over the world - including how to watch the Thomas Cup free online in many countries.",
    "If you don't live in a country where the tournament is being shown by a big-name broadcaster, the good news is that many people can get a 100% free badminton Thomas Cup live stream on Olympics.com.",
    "It's completely free to watch and compatible with most modern devices including smartphones, tablets, laptops, PCs, Macs, Smart TVs, consoles and more, but Thomas Cup coverage will be restricted in most countries where the tournament is being shown by local broadcasters (places like India and the UK).",
    "If you're abroad right now and still want to keep up with a badminton live stream on Olympics.com, you'll need a VPN (as explained below). Otherwise, you'll be limited to the highlights.",
    "We've set out below the ways you can watch Thomas Cup live streams in a number of countries around the world. However, if you're away travelling for work or pleasure, you probably won't be able to watch the badminton like you normally would at home.",
    "That's the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world. A good streaming VPN can let you get around these digital borders, while also offering robust protection from cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream badminton from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so, in this case, just head to the Olympics.com site"
