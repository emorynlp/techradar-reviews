    "The thrill of watching superbly skilled drivers racing ridiculously fast cars is quite something. A few years ago, catching these races could pose a bit of an issue for viewers worldwide thanks to regional restrictions and scheduling limitations. But now, with F1 TV, we can watch these races whenever we want.",
    "In this guide, we\u2019ll look at how you can get an F1 live stream with F1 TV on Roku and start streaming the pinnacle of motorsport now. You can also check out our full review on Roku\u2019s mid-level 4K streamer, the Roku Premiere, here.",
    "F1 TV is Formula 1\u2019s official streaming service. It has two subscription tiers: F1 TV Access (the standard plan) and F1 TV Pro (the premium plan). With Access, you can watch full race replays, F1\u2019s historic race archives, exclusive documentaries, live shows, and more.",
    "With Pro, you can enjoy all the features of Access, and you can also catch all the GP races live with commentary in five languages.",
    "A special feature that comes with both plans is the access to cameras on the F1 cars. You\u2019ll be able to shuffle between the main live feed and the cameras present on the 20 cars. The camera-switching feature is available even during replays, and can be hugely entertaining \u2013 you might even catch a thrilling moment the commentators miss.",
    "The F1 TV app is available in many countries across the world, like the US, Mexico, Austria, and Russia. F1 TV Pro, however, isn\u2019t available everywhere. In some countries, like Germany and the UK, this plan isn\u2019t available because of certain commercial agreements.",
    "An F1 TV Access subscription costs $26.99/year in the US, while an F1 TV Pro subscription is $79.99. The Pro plan comes with a seven-day free trial so you can make sure it\u2019s worth the money.",
    "Yes, F1 TV has been available on Roku since the beginning of 2020. You will need Roku Express (3900x) or above to run F1 TV.",
    "Setting up F1 TV on Roku is super simple. First, you have to turn on your Roku device and head to the home page. Then, go to the search bar and type F1 TV. Once you find the F1 TV channel, click on +Add channel and wait for the application to install. Open it once it\u2019s finished installing and proceed to subscribe or log in with your existing details.",
    "F1 TV is available on mobiles, browsers, and tablets. You can even use Chromecast and Apple Airplay to cast through your computer\u2019s web browser, but casting from mobile and tablet apps will be launching later in 2021.",
    "You can use browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge to watch the races. F1 TV doesn\u2019t offer support for Opera, UC Browser, and Samsung Internet, so some features of the app may not work properly on them.",
    "You can also get F1 TV on Android and iPhone. On Android devices, you\u2019ll need Android OS 7 or above to run the F1 TV app. On iPhone and iPad, you\u2019ll need iOS 10 or above, and on Amazon Fire tablet, you\u2019ll need OS 7 or above.",
    "Formula 1 has stated that the F1 TV on Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Android TV devices is still in development and will be launching later in 2021.",
