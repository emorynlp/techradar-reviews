    "Was it ever in doubt? Roger Federer made a winning return to the court after 13 months out, beating Dan Evans in three sets and just under two and a half hours yesterday. Next up for the master of elegance is a tricky match-up with the powerful Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili, where a place in the ATP Doha Qatar Open semi -finals is at stake. Read on as we explain how to get a Federer vs Basilashvili live stream and watch Qatar Open tennis online wherever you are right now.",
    "The 20-time Grand Slam champion has only faced Basilashvili once before, all the way back in 2016. Federer made light work of his opponent on that occasion, beating him in straight sets and little over an hour, but the context of today's match is completely different.",
    "At the ripe old age of 39 - that's 10 years Basilashvili's senior - the Swiss is, on paper at least, no longer at the peak of his physical powers, and there are naturally still question marks surrounding the state of his right knee, which required two surgeries last year. His battle with Evans was a close-fought one, but today's showdown against world No. 42 Basilashvili could prove an even more awkward match-up for the Swiss.",
    "The ball-smashing Georgian had a dreadful 2020, losing in the opening round of five of the six tournaments he entered, but there's nothing like a tie with one of the sport's greatest to make you up your game.",
    "Don't miss a single point from Doha today as Roger Federer's comeback rolls on. Just follow our guide below to get a 2021 Qatar Open live stream and watch Federer vs Basilashvili online from anywhere this Thursday.",
    "For broadcast and streaming details in tennis-mad countries like the UK, Australia, US and Canada, just scroll down the page - everything you need to know is there, including details of who is showing the tennis.",
    "But if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for sports fans all over the world. Fortunately, there's an easy solution."
