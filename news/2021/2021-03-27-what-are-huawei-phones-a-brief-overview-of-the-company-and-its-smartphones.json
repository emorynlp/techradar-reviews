    "If there\u2019s one Chinese phone brand of which you will be aware, it\u2019s Huawei. The super-giant tech company is a huge player, second only to Samsung in the mobile market.",
    "Huawei frequently makes the news, both the tech news and global, whether that\u2019s for launching new, super-powerful camera phones, or for getting banned from the US by Donald Trump.",
    "Much of the company\u2019s business concerns hardware, including smartphones, watches, tablets and more, but it\u2019s also big on infrastructure, since it\u2019s part of the push to set up 5G networks in countries around the globe.",
    "We won\u2019t be delving into the infrastructure side of Huawei, nor will we explore accusations levelled at the company for spying for the Chinese government or other such allegations. Here, the focus will be the brand\u2019s smartphones and consumer tech.",
    "Huawei was formed in China as a telecoms company in 1987, but brought its first smartphone to market in 2004. However, it took until 2009 for the company to release an Android phone, and from there we\u2019ve seen a steady stream of the handset types you see today.",
    "In 2013, Huawei created sub-brand Honor, which produces much of the same tech. Huawei sold Honor in late 2020. We have a separate guide to Honor phones, which you can read here.",
    "In 2019, Huawei revealed HarmonyOS, its own operating system to rival Android and iOS, and 2021 has seen the company begin user testing by smartphone users \u2013 although, at the time of writing, there haven\u2019t been any handsets to appear with it. Alongside smartphones, Huawei entered the markets for wearables in 2015, laptops in 2016, and tablets in 2019.",
    "The biggest change for Huawei in recent years came in early 2019, in what has been dubbed the \u2018Huawei ban\u2019. This is when then-US-president Donald Trump placed Huawei on the \u2018entity list\u2019 of companies that US corporations could no longer work with \u2013 and this included such firms as Google.",
    "Until that point, Huawei phones \u2013 like all Android handsets \u2013 had come with Google apps installed including Maps, Gmail and, most importantly of all, the Play Store for downloading new apps. The ban meant that Huawei phones were barred from these apps, a situation that has continued to this day.",
    "As a result, the company\u2019s market share has dwindled, although Huawei has taken steps to mitigate the damage. These include introducing the AppGallery, the company\u2019s own take on the Play Store that holds a limited number of apps; and Petal Search, which on occasion will let you download apps that aren\u2019t available on AppGallery.",
    "Since the Huawei ban, new phones from the company haven\u2019t been met with the level of fanfare they once were, and we\u2019re still waiting for the company to make a big comeback.",
    "Huawei has a number of phone lines across the globe, but here we\u2019ll detail only those that make their way to the West \u2013 and, for reasons described above, we\u2019re not including Honor phones.",
    "The company\u2019s main line of phones is the P series. These fantastic camera phones typically come with a standard device as well as a Pro, Lite and even Pro Plus model. Their launch will often see the introduction of new camera tech.",
    "There\u2019s also the Huawei Mate series. Typically higher-end than the P series, these handsets are known for presenting supercharged specs and designs, and are intended for professional users. A good comparison is to view these as Samsung\u2019s Note phones, which again are for pro users, although the Mate devices don\u2019t have styli.",
    "Huawei puts out foldable phones, too, under its Mate X banner \u2013 in fact, after Samsung it\u2019s the most prolific maker of folding handsets. So far, all Mate X devices have been \u2018book-style\u2019 foldables; Huawei hasn\u2019t yet put out a clamshell-style phone.",
    "Fans of budget devices have found plenty to like in Huawei\u2019s P Smart line, whose models have previously topped our list of the best cheap phones. These low-cost devices bring specs from the P series but at lower prices than those phones.",
    "Huawei tends to follow fairly predictable release schedules, which makes this section easy to write.",
    "The Huawei P series usually launches around April or May, although the Lite device is often unveiled a few weeks ahead of the main phone. The Mate device then follows around six months later, near the end of the year.",
    "There\u2019s less of a pattern for the Mate X phones, since these are fairly new \u2013 but, so far we\u2019ve usually seen them near the beginning of the year, in close proximity to the P phones.",
    "The Huawei P Smart handsets aren\u2019t accompanied by big launch events, and it\u2019s harder to pin-point their release. Typically we see a new model each year, and it tends to be named after the year \u2013 for example, the Huawei P Smart (2019).",
    "Huawei is a huge tech company, and as such launches numerous products all the time \u2013 but we\u2019ll look at its consumer ones.",
    "When it comes to wearables, the company sells both fitness trackers such as the Huawei Band line, and smartwatches such as the Huawei Watch Fit and Watch GT Pro. In the past, the company\u2019s wearables have been near-identical to those launched by Honor, but with the latter now sold, future products are likely to have more differences.",
    "Huawei started selling tablets in 2019, under the MatePad line \u2013 but, like its phones, these tablets don\u2019t have Google apps.",
    "Finally, there\u2019s the MateBook line of laptops. These devices tend to be quite stylish and premium-looking, and sometimes offer extra functionality if you also own a phone from the brand. Here at TechRadar, Huawei MateBook laptops have impressed, earning very high scores in our reviews."
