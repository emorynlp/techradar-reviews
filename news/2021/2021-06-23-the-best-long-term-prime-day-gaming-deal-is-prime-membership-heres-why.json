    "UPDATE: Prime Day may officially be over but you can still take advantage of a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime.",
    "This Prime Day we\u2019re seeing a good selection of gaming deals around, but gamers who want to benefit long term from Prime Day may just want to pick up an Amazon Prime membership instead.",
    "That's because Prime members get access to Prime Gaming \u2013 previously known as Twitch Prime \u2013 which is a service that\u2019s included as part of their subscription fee. Prime Gaming offers one monthly Twitch subscription to a streamer of your choice, as well as a monthly roundup of free PC games and exclusive in-game loot.",
    "That means that each month, Prime members can pick up exclusive in-game loot for titles such as Fall Guys: Total Knockout, FIFA 21, League of Legends, Red Dead Online and much more. In addition, GTA Online players can grab up to GTA$400,000 each month as well as exclusive discounts on premium items in Rockstar\u2019s online multiplayer.",
    "But that\u2019s not all, Prime Gaming also offers a free PC game library, which is added to each month and allows you to download and play a selection of fantastic titles as part of your Prime subscription. Right now, for instance, just some of the free games on offer include Battlefield 4, Batman: The Telltale Series and musical odyssey Lost in Harmony.",
    "If you\u2019re not a Prime member yet, you can sign up right now for a 30-day free trial and check out what Prime Gaming has to offer \u2013 and you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of all the other Prime Day deals that are live right now. (Not in the UK or US? Scroll down for the best Amazon prime membership deals in your region).",

    "What\u2019s more, if there\u2019s nothing taking your fancy on Prime Gaming right now, there may be something more to your taste the following month. But it\u2019s worth claiming as much as you can \u2013 while you can. Check out all the Prime Gaming offers - and claim yours \u2013 here.",
    "Prime Gaming is a fantastic service that comes packed in with your Prime membership, but it\u2019s not all that your subscription gives you access to. Prime members can take advantage of Prime Music, allowing you to stream, store, manage, and listen to music anywhere from the cloud, Prime Wardrobe, allowing you to try clothes before you buy them, and Prime Video, offering unlimited streaming of movies and TV episodes (select regions only). Plus much more, including unlimited one-day delivery in select regions.",
    "This is the Prime Day deal that will keep on giving all year round.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for Amazon Prime membership from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
