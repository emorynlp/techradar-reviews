    "Reputations count for little in as chaotic a campaign as we can remember, where stacking wins is as tough as staying healthy. With no truly dominant team in either conference, and everyone (but the Lions) capable of beating anyone on their day, the shocks are coming thick and fast. So read on as we explain where to watch NFL live streams where you are, including information for cord-cutters without cable in the US.",
    "New heroes are being crowned by the week, as the established order takes it in turns to be rightly or wrongly written off. And through it all - as the Tom Bradys and Patrick Mahomes and Aaron Rodgers of the league fall under increasing scrutiny - Bill Belichick lurks in the shadows, quietly honing a new generation of winners.",
    "The rest of the NFL has closed the gap on last season\u2019s Super Bowl contenders, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs, and yesterday\u2019s fringe attractions have generated plenty of hype of their own.",
    "Kyler Murray and Dak Prescott have catapulted the Cardinals and Cowboys into the frame, while Ravens center Lamar Jackson has hit new heights with his legs and his arms, and the Colts\u2019 Jonathan Taylor has taken on Derrick Henry\u2019s mantle.",
    "But form has been fleeting as a rule, the favorites routinely crumbling under any sort of expectation, which means plenty more twists and turns beckon as the playoffs inch ever nearer, and you can follow our guide below for how to watch an NFL live stream for every single game.",
    "If you're on holiday or you're away on business and you want to watch your country's coverage from outside your country, then you'll need to use a VPN. This will help you dial in to a location back in your home country to avoid geo-blocks and regain access to the content and services you already pay for back home.",
    "A VPN is generally perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location when the big game is on. We\u2019ve tested hundreds of VPNs and can recommend ExpressVPN as the very best VPN currently available.",
    "The defending Super Bowl champions are Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who dominated the Chiefs 31-9 to win Super Bowl LV on home turf at Raymond James Stadium earlier this year.",
    "Brady won a record fifth Super Bowl MVP award in the game, which saw him throw for three touchdown passes and no interceptions.",
    "Super Bowl LVI, or Super Bowl 56, is scheduled for Sunday, February 13 and is set to be played in Inglewood, California at the new SoFi Stadium - home to the Rams in the NFC and the Chargers in the AFC.",
    "You'd think the bookmakers would have learned by now, but the Kansas City Chiefs are currently favorites to lift Super Bowl LVI in 2022, at the expense once again of Tom Brady and Bucs - though Tampa are a close second this season.",
    "Behind them, the Bills, Ravens, Rams, 49ers and Packers are all also fancied to make deep playoff runs, while former powerhouses like the Patriots, Cowboys, and Steelers sit middle-of-the-pack as they bid for a return to glory."
