    "Another day, another rumor about a new Apple TV \u2013 but this one's special in that it comes from Apple itself.",
    "A strange string of text was discovered in the latest batch of tvOS 14.5 beta code that mentions pressing \u201cthe center button\u201d to make a choice on Apple TV. The problem? Well, there isn\u2019t actually a center button on either the Apple TV HD or Apple TV 4K.",
    "This discrepancy was flagged on Twitter by Steve Moser, a contributor at MacRumors.",
    "As Moser rightly points out, the center button phrasing is incredibly strange. It simply doesn't exist on either of the two most widely used models (we'll cover the exceptions below) and could be the next clue of a revamped remote that MacRumors had uncovered earlier this week \u2013 or the sign of a completely retooled Apple TV coming our way during WWDC 2021 in June.",
    "Here\u2019s what makes this story so credible: it\u2019s coming directly from Apple\u2019s tvOS 14.5 beta source code that\u2019s being rolled out to developers this week. It\u2019s not from an unknown source or a Jon Prosser tweet \u2013 it\u2019s from Apple\u2019s own coding team.",
    "Now, that being said, it\u2019s possible that they slipped up or \u2013 another possibility \u2013 that the code refers to the Apple TV OEM remote that other manufacturers can distribute with their set-top box. (In fact, MacRumors published a story earlier saying that it had an exclusive image of the new remote that it now says is just an image of the old OEM remote.) But there's a good chance it's 100% legit, too.",
    "Still, the fact that the verbiage is appearing now \u2013 two months ahead of WWDC \u2013 is suspect.",
    "We\u2019ll keep digging to find out more, and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to tell you more about the rumored Apple TV before it potentially is unveiled on-stage in just a few months."
