    "Several Nikon F-mount lenses appear to be on the discontinued chopping block, signaling a possible end to some classic DSLR camera glass \u2013 and maybe Nikon\u2019s beginner DSLR cameras.",
    "As spotted by Nikon Rumors, seven F-mount lenses are listed as \u2018old product\u2019 on Nikon Japan\u2019s website or appear in the discontinued section. The lenses are also listed as out of stock by some US and UK distributors, meaning they\u2019re now tough to find new.",
    "Most of the lenses are at least five years old, with many going as far back as 2010, so it\u2019s not hugely surprising news given the shrinking demand for DSLRs. But a couple of the lenses, including the AF-P DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR, are affordable companions for cameras like the Nikon D3500.",
    "The D3500 and D5600 themselves have both been listed as \u201cold products\u201d on the Nikon Japan website, so the discontinuation of some of their stalwart lenses is perhaps to be expected. But for fans of cameras with optical viewfinders, it is another example of the rapid shift from DSLRs to mirrorless cameras.",
    "The news follows similar reports last month that Canon had discontinued several EF lenses for its DSLRs. And it seems likely that news like this will continue, as brands like Nikon and Canon shift their focus away from their legacy systems towards their Z-mount and RF-mount lineups.",
    "At the time of writing we were still able to find some of the lenses below available on the official Nikon websites for the UK and US.",
    "We don\u2019t know how quickly this will change, but if the Nikon Rumors prediction is correct, it seems likely that these lenses will become trickier to buy new.",
    "While some of the entries, like the popular AF-S DX Nikkor 16-80mm f/2.8-4E ED VR, might come as a surprise, it doesn\u2019t mean an immediate end for Nikon\u2019s DX or FX format DSLRs.",
    "Right now, there are still over 50 lenses in stock for those cameras in the UK and US. And even for officially discontinued lenses, there will likely be enough stock available in third-party stores (and in the second-hand market) to satisfy demand.",
    "But the trend is clear. While DSLRs and their lenses remain the cheapest way to get a camera with a viewfinder, the newest lenses (with the latest autofocus tech) will be available for mirrorless cameras, which are clearly now the focus for Nikon and Canon.",
    "If we hear of any more Nikon DSLR lenses being discontinued, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated."
