    "While Ninjala isn\u2019t quite a household name like Fortnite, the free-to-play multiplayer title on Nintendo Switch has reached two impressive milestones recently: it\u2019s been downloaded seven million times from the Nintendo Switch eShop, and it\u2019s just celebrated its first anniversary.",
    "With its vibrant visuals, melee-focused combat and some noteworthy collaborations that would make other franchises teem with jealousy, Ninjala has established itself as one of the most popular online titles on Switch \u2013 no easy feat considering Nintendo\u2019s console isn\u2019t really a hotbed of competitive multiplayer gaming and that Ninjala is a brand-new IP.",
    "But what does the future hold for a game that sees you play as bubble-gum blowing ninjas? In an exclusive interview with TechRadar, we spoke to GungHo President and CEO Kazuki Morishita and Ninjala Director Motoki Kaneda about Ninjala\u2019s plans moving forward, why collaborations work so well within the game, and whether the company considers Ninjala a success.",
    "Collaborations have become commonplace in the gaming industry, and while historically they\u2019ve involved crossovers with other games, we\u2019re now seeing music stars, anime and even real life footballers like Son Hueng-Min enter the gaming space for the very first time.",
    "Ninjala has managed to attract some marquee names for collaborations, such as the J-Pop sensation Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and the popular anime Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, but what can fans expect to see next?",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re planning many more collaborations that will surprise our players,\u201d says Morishita-san. \u201cFor selecting collabs, we mainly collaborate with IPs that we personally like. From those IPs, we carefully choose the ones that we think our players would also enjoy. We then check for the best timing on when to collaborate with that IP.\u201d",
    "Ninjala\u2019s crossovers have certainly been diverse, and Morishita-san believes that Ninjala\u2019s mix of a fictional world and modern era is advantageous in bringing more collaborations to life. \u201cWe can collaborate with pretty much anything,\u201d Morishita-san explains.",
    "In-game events and themes are important at not only retaining players but attracting new ones to free-to-play titles like Ninjala. But unlike some Nintendo Switch games, Ninjala is truly free-to-play as it doesn\u2019t require a Nintendo Switch Online membership, something which Morishita-san believes could have added to the game\u2019s appeal.",
    "\u201cThat may be a factor, but as it is a PvP game, we wanted as many people to play without any obstacles as possible. Having it [Ninjala] free-to-play was good for us and for the players,\u201d says Morishita-san.",
    "Most people would consider seven million downloads for a brand-new IP a success, but Morishita-san is admirably reluctant to brand Ninjala a homerun just yet.",
    "\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure that Ninjala\u2019s been successful at this time, but we\u2019re happy to celebrate our first anniversary and continue to gain active players,\u201d Morishita-san says. \u201cI believe that we\u2019ll be able to say that Ninjala is a success after we grow and develop the IP in different forms and it becomes a game that\u2019s loved by many players for a long period of time.\u201d",
    "We\u2019ve already seen Ninjala branch out into media forms beyond the game, including an anime series on YouTube which portrayed the background of each in-game character. And it sounds like we could see more spin-offs like this in the future.",
    "\u201cThe 3DCG anime that we created shows the events and conspiracies that arise in the world of Ninjala,\u201d Morishita-san says. \u201cWe plan to actively expand this new side of the story through various forms of media.\u201d",
    "Now more than ever, it\u2019s the community behind a game that can dictate how successful it can be in the years to come. The good news is that GungHo is actively listening to fans of Ninjala as the team will be implementing one of the most highly requested features soon: voice chat support.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve received many requests from our players, and we plan to implement voice chat soon. We\u2019ll share more details once everything is confirmed,\u201d says Morishita-san.",
    "Morishita-san wants the Ninjala community to \u201ccontinue to send us feedback\u201d and reassures fans that GungHo is working hard to \u201cfulfill as many requests as possible\u201d, something which Kaneda-san says is in effect by delivering on voice chat support.",
    "\u201cAs mentioned earlier, we receive many requests about voice chat support, and it\u2019s scheduled to be implemented in a future update,\u201d explains Kaneda-san. \u201cWe also receive quite a lot of requests about playing Featured Battles in Room Battles or implementing a Visual Lobby.\u201d",
    "The key takeaway is, then, that Ninjala\u2019s community is being heard and the development team is doing everything it can to facilitate the most popular requests where possible.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED might not have ticked all the boxes that some players were hoping for, but one new addition will have caught the attention of online competitive players: a dedicated LAN connection port. And it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the devs at Ninjala, who also believe the OLED display will make Ninjala look even better when played in handheld mode.",
    "\u201cThe new LAN connection port is great, since it provides a more direct connection. But above all, the bigger screen will make the vivid colors in Ninjala look even more beautiful. I will definitely want one for myself,\u201d admitted Morishita-san.",
    "Ninjala seems like it has a bright future ahead, then, but fans will have to wait and see exactly what\u2019s next. The good news is that it sounds like GungHo has a lot of exciting things in the works.",
    "\u201cWe have so many things that I\u2019d like to share, but for now I can only say that we\u2019ll continue to release more updates with new ways to play and experience Ninjala,\u201d says Morishita-san. \u201cWe\u2019ll also have many more collabs, so please look forward to them.\u201d",
    "Ninjala is available to download for free from the Nintendo Switch eShop."
