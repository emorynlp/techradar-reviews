    "You shouldn't open this link, and if you do it may mean hackers are able to access your phone. Cyber security analysts are advising users to stay away from such a link.",
    "Internet security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia said in a tweet: \"Beware of WhatsApp Pink!! A Virus is being spread in WhatsApp groups with an APK download link. Don''t click any link with the name of #WhatsappPink. Complete access to your phone will be lost.\"",
