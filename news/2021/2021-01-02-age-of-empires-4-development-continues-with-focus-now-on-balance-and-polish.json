    "Since Age of Empires 4 was announced all the way back in 2017, it seems fair to say that news on the game\u2019s progress has been pretty sporadic. It\u2019s possible that could start to change in 2021, though, after a promising end-of-year update from World\u2019s Edge studio head, Shannon Loftis, on the game\u2019s progress.",
    "In a blog post on the official Age of Empires site, Loftis revealed that the development team at Relic is making \u201cgreat progress\u201d on the game, adding that \u201cwe are literally playing this game every single day\u2014both in Washington and in Vancouver.\u201d",
    "Loftis went on to explain that \u201cRTS development is funny: it takes a while to build the separate systems (AI, economy, sim, rendering, etc), and then it takes a while for them to come together.\u201d Now that things have come together to make a fully playable game, which Loftis says \u201cfeels like an Age of Empires game\u201d, there\u2019s still \u201cdebugging and balance and polish\u201d to be done before anything can be released.",
    "Prior to this glimmer of hope, the last we really saw from Age of Empires 4 was in November 2019 when Microsoft revealed a gameplay trailer as part of XO19, which you can watch below.",
    "In the blog post, Loftis also mentioned the change to working from home that was necessitated by the pandemic, which has caused problems for studios all over the world. It seems, though, that the Age of Empires 4 team has managed to stay on track.",
    "According to Loftis, the Age of Empires team has \u201cmodified (through trial and error) our processes to help facilitate productivity to keep the game on track. So much passion, such great developers, artists, designers, narrators, audio experts, and community\u2014not to mention the backbone functions that keep the company going.\u201d",
    "While we still don\u2019t have a release window for Age of Empires 4, it's good to know that the game is coming along well. We can only hope that 2021 will bring more frequent updates and perhaps that firm release date we\u2019re all hoping for.",
    "If you\u2019re hungry for more Age of Empires experiences, it\u2019s worth remembering that Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition was released in 2020 while a brand new DLC for Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is coming to Xbox Game Pass for PC, Microsoft Store, and Steam later this month."
