  "summary": "Did Tesla just enter the console war?",
  "article": [
    "Elon Musk has always been one for bold claims, but maybe the ability to play AAA games in Tesla vehicles wasn\u2019t merely a pipe dream, after all.",
    "At AMD\u2019s Computex 2021 keynote, the chipmaker confirmed that the latest generation of Tesla\u2019s infotainment system \u2013 arriving in both the new Tesla Model S and X \u2013 is powered by an AMD Ryzen processor and AMD RDNA 2 GPU.",
    "Those internals suggest Musk\u2019s in-car gaming rig is capable of providing up to 10 teraflops of computing power \u2013 which isn\u2019t far off the figure boasted by Sony\u2019s PS5.",
    "AMD CEO Lisa Su confirmed the new Tesla models \u201cwill have an AMD Ryzen APU powering the infotainment system [...] as well as a discrete RDNA 2-based GPU that kicks in when running AAA games,\u201d adding that the company \u201clook[s] forward to giving gamers a great platform for AAA gaming.\u201d",
    "We\u2019ve previously reported on leaked documents (posted by leaker Patrick Shur) which suggested Tesla planned to use an AMD Navi 23 GPU to power its infotainment systems. That speculation now seems to have been corroborated by the appearance of the same GPU at AMD\u2019s recent keynote, revealed to be powering the company\u2019s newest 6600M laptop graphics cards.",
    "Now, we\u2019re not suggesting Tesla\u2019s in-car gaming system will match the PS5 for performance, but both use largely the same technology under the hood, save for a smaller number of cores in the Tesla system (28 to the PS5\u2019s 36).",
    "The AMD Navi 23 GPU in the former also boasts 1792 shader units (processors within the graphics card responsible for processing different aspects of an image) to the PS5\u2019s 2304 \u2013 so we\u2019re talking small margins here. For comparison, the PS4 came equipped with 1152 equivalent units.",
    "We do, therefore, expect new Tesla owners to be able to play power-hungry games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla from the comfort of their heated car seats.",
    "Could these games also be playable with ray tracing enabled? We know AMD\u2019s latest GPUs are capable of the rendering method, and this would mark an immense graphical leap from the Intel-powered indie titles currently limited to the Tesla Arcade games library.",
    "The news isn\u2019t all exciting for prospective Tesla owners-cum-car-gamers, though.",
    "A Tesla employee recently shared a job posting on Twitter suggesting the company is \u201clooking for Linux game developers\u201d to work on software for the company\u2019s latest hardware, which is a pretty conclusive sign that Tesla\u2019s new in-car gaming rig may run games built for Linux.",
    "So, while 10 teraflops of performance is a mightily impressive figure for what is essentially a games console for a car, less-than-impressive Linux ports on Google Stadia have ensured our expectations are tempered when it comes to the framerate and graphical fidelity we anticipate from AAA titles running in a Tesla vehicle.",
    "In any case, with the Tesla Model S Plaid set to start deliveries on June 10, we\u2019ll have a better idea of what the system is capable of very soon.",
