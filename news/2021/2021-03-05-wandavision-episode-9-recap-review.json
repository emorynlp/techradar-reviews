    "Spoilers for the final episode of WandaVision follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "Agatha is holding Tommy and Billy with her magic string. They tell her to let them go. Wanda reminds Agatha that her powers work in the open, away from the runes. \u201cI\u2019m counting on it,\u201d replies Agatha.",
    "Agatha pulls the boys to the ground, so Wanda hits her with an energy blast. Wanda tells the boys to go to their room, as Agatha gets to her feet. Wanda blasts her again, but this time Agatha holds Wanda\u2019s red magical energy in her hand: \u201cI take power from the undeserving. It\u2019s kind of my thing.\u201d Wanda\u2019s hand is strangely blackened.",
    "Agatha suggests that Wanda should surrender her magic to someone \u201cwho knows what to do with it. And I\u2019ll let you keep this pathetic corner of the world all to yourself.\u201d",
    "Wanda throws a car at Agatha, smashing her into the side of a house.",
    "Hayward\u2019s new White Vision lands behind Wanda \u2013 confused, she asks if it\u2019s really him. He touches her tenderly on the face, but it soon turns into something more sinister as he picks her up by the head. \u201cAnd I was told you were powerful,\u201d he tells her as she screams in agony.",
    "Wanda\u2019s Vision swoops in, dragging White Vision along the ground at high speed before throwing him into an RV, which explodes.",
    "Vision asks where the boys are. Wanda says they\u2019re safe inside the house, and that she should have explained everything to him when she realized what she\u2019d done. She says she can fix the world she\u2019s created. \u201cCan you?\u201d he asks.",
    "Agatha materializes over the house. \u201cThis is awkward,\u201d she gloats. \u201cYour ex and your boyfriend together at the same party. Who are you gonna choose, Wanda?\u201d Wanda\u2019s Vision flies up to take on White Vision while Wanda takes off to battle Agatha.",
    "In an upstairs bedroom of Agnes\u2019s house, Monica Rambeau looks on and shouts Wanda\u2019s name. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath, babe,\u201d says Pietro. \u201cNo one can hear you from in here.\u201d She tries to escape, but is no match for Pietro\u2019s super speed.",
    "High above Westview, Vision asks his counterpart if they might be able to resolve this peacefully. \u201cWanda Maximoff must be neutralized,\u201d White Vision replies. \u201cYou must be destroyed.\u201d",
    "Vision takes that as a no, and as White Vision tends to remove the Mind Stone from his forehead, he phases out of the way, before piledriving his adversary into a road. They continue their battle in the sky, as Hayward watches from outside the Hex field.",
    "Agent Jimmy Woo is brought to Hayward in custody. He tells Hayward he\u2019ll never be able to cover this up. \u201cI won\u2019t have to,\u201d counters Hayward. \u201cWanda cancelled her show, so there\u2019s no footage proving there was ever more than one Vision.\u201d Woo argues that there must be a SWORD HQ security tape and evidence of tampering, but Hayward says that no one\u2019s going to care once Wanda\u2019s been eliminated \u2013 and they\u2019ll believe that the Vision who emerges from the rubble is the one she illegally tried to bring back to life. He thinks they\u2019ll thank him for recovering such a valuable asset \u2013 and Jimmy could be a part of it. \u201cIf only you had a little more\u2026 Vision.\u201d",
    "Woo sarcastically tells Hayward that he\u2019s convinced by his plan but there\u2019s a slight problem \u2013 his FBI friends from Quantico will arrive within the hour. Hayward thinks he\u2019s bluffing. \u201cAm I?\u201d asks Jimmy.",
    "Thrown into a barn, Jimmy releases himself from his handcuffs, saying \u201cFlourish\u201d. He calls up an FBI colleague, Cliff, asking if he could get there inside the hour.",
    "Wanda lands in Westview city centre and sees lots of familiar faces. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, I\u2019m just a messenger,\u201d says the courier guy.",
    "Agatha appears on the roof of Westview Appliance. She tells Wanda she\u2019s never been up against another witch before, and that there\u2019s an entire chapter devoted to her in the Darkhold \u2013 the \u201cbook of the damned\u201d.",
    "Agatha explains that, \u201cthe Scarlet Witch is not born, she is forged. She has no coven, no need for incantation.\u201d Wanda says she\u2019s not a witch, she doesn\u2019t cast spells and no one taught her magic, but Agatha tells her her power exceeds that of the Sorcerer Supreme. \u201cIt\u2019s your destiny to destroy the world.\u201d",
    "Agatha makes an incantation in Latin, and Dottie walks over to Wanda. She says her name is Sarah and she has an eight-year-old daughter \u2013 maybe she could be friends with Wanda\u2019s boys: \u201cIf you like that storyline.\u201d She pleads that if Wanda could let her daughter out of her room, she could at least hold her.",
    "Wanda thinks Agatha is making Dottie say this, but Agatha says she\u2019s Wanda\u2019s \u201cmeat puppet. I just cut her strings.\u201d",
    "Agatha casts another spell, freeing the rest of the Westview residents, who move to surround Wanda.",
    "Back in Agnes\u2019s house, Fake Pietro makes a smoothie. He says this is his man cave, \u201ca place to chillax while the missus is stirring up trouble.\u201d Monica looks at a bank statement addressed to a Ralph Bohner, 2804 Sherwood Drive, Westview. Pietro asks if she likes Steven Seagal movies, as Monica finds a photo of him \u2013 labelled Ralph Bohner. \u201cAgnes doesn\u2019t live here, you do,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re Ralph Bohner.\u201d",
    "\u201cBoner,\u201d he laughs, Beavis and Butthead-style.",
    "Monica asks how she\u2019s controlling him. He shapes up to box, asking if she wants to tussle again, but she throws him to the ground. Monica spots that Pietro\u2019s necklace is glowing with Agatha\u2019s purple magic, so she pulls it from his neck. \u201cOh god, please spare my life,\u201d he says. \u201cNice to meet you, Ralph,\u201d she replies.",
    "Billy and Tommy watch the Visions fighting from outside their bedroom window. Billy sees a vision of her mother in the town square and tells Tommy they\u2019ve got to go.",
    "The town residents tell Wanda of their pain, that they no longer recognize themselves \u2013 that they used to resist but they can\u2019t remember why. They\u2019re exhausted and when they sleep they have Wanda\u2019s nightmares. Wanda tries to assure them they\u2019re fine, that she\u2019s kept them safe and they feel at peace. They say that her grief is poisoning them.",
    "Wanda screams out, unleashing a burst of magical energy that strangles the Westview residents. Realising what she\u2019s done, Wanda apologizes and releases them, promising to let them go.",
    "\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping you?\u201d asks Agatha. \u201cHeroes don\u2019t torture people.\u201d",
    "Wanda sends a massive energy beam into the Hex field, and the town starts glitching through time periods. She tells the townspeople to run away.",
    "Hayward sees a gap opening in the field and decides this is the opportunity to get inside.",
    "\u201cNow you\u2019ll see,\u201d Agatha laughs.",
    "High in the sky, the Vision fight is interrupted when Wanda\u2019s Vision starts to decay and falls to the ground. SWORD forces enter the town.",
    "Wanda sees her Vision falling apart before her eyes, as the twins run into the town square \u2013 and also start to disintegrate.",
    "\u201cNow do you see?\u201d taunts Agatha. \u201cYou tied your family to this twisted world, and now one can\u2019t exist without the other. Save Westview or save your family.\u201d Wanda pauses and the Hex field closes up again. The run together and embrace. Agatha attacks, so Wanda protects them all with a magical bubble. Agatha absorbs the energy, leaving both Wanda\u2019s hands drained of color.",
    "\u201cHow sweet,\u201d says Agatha. The family are surrounded on all sides \u2013 Agatha on one, White Vision on another and SWORD on the third. They take an Avengers stance. \u201cListen, boys,\u201d says Vision. \u201cYour mother and I never really prepared you for this.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut you were born for it,\u201d says Wanda.",
    "Vision flies off to take on his evil doppelganger. They end up in the library, where Vision asks White Vision why he\u2019s doing this. He says his programming directive is to destroy the Vision. Vision grabs White Vision by the neck and tells him, \u201cI\u2019m not the true Vision, only a conditional Vision.\u201d",
    "\u201cI request elaboration,\u201d says White Vision.",
    "Back in the town square, Agatha lifts the SWORD soldiers into the air. \u201cSame story, different century,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019ll always be torches and pitchforks for ladies like us, Wanda.\u201d She drops the soldiers to the ground, but Wanda catches them before impact. She turns to Billy and Tommy and tells them to handle the military. \u201cMommy will be right back.\u201d",
    "Wanda flies off to take on Agatha, and disappears. Tommy and Billy use their super skills to take SWORD\u2019s weapons. Hayward still has a gun. Monica spots him and tells him to stand down. As he fires, she moves in front of the boys and her body seems to absorb the bullets, pulsing with yellow energy. Billy uses his telekinetic powers to stop the bullet that gets past her. Hayward is out of bullets. \u201cNice tricks,\u201d she says to Billy. \u201cI like yours too,\u201d he replies.",
    "Hayward tries to drive away, but is stopped by a pretzel van. \u201cHave fun in prison!\u201d says Darcy.",
    "White Vision asks if his counterpart is familiar with the thought experiment about the Ship of Theseus. The idea is that it\u2019s an artifact in a museum. \u201cOver time its planks of wood rot and are replaced with new planks. When no original plank remains, is it still the Ship of Theseus?\u201d",
    "\u201cSecondly,\u201d adds Wanda\u2019s Vision, \u201cif those removed planks are restored and reassembled, free of the rot, is that the ship of Theseus?\u201d",
    "White Vision says that neither is the true ship, and both are the true ship. They are in agreement, but White Vision doesn\u2019t have the Mind Stone \u2013 and original Vision does not have \u201cone ounce of original material\u201d. He says that, \u201cPerhaps the rot is the memories. The wear and tear are the voyages. The wood touched by Theseus himself.\u201d White says he hasn\u2019t retained any memories \u2013 \u201cbut you do have the data,\u201d says his counterpart. \u201cIt is merely being kept from you.\u201d",
    "White Vision realizes it makes him a weapon more easily controlled, and acknowledges that Vision is the true Vision because he believes himself to be. \u201cBut on meeting you I have been disabused of that notion,\u201d Wanda\u2019s Vision counters. He points out that, as a carbon-based Synthezoid, White Vision\u2019s memory is not easily wiped, and touches his head, reawakening a lifetime of memories from the MCU.",
    "\u201cI am Vision,\u201d White Vision says, and flies away.",
    "Real Vision returns to the square and embraces his sons. Wanda sneaks up behind Agatha and uses her magic to transport her back to the stake-burning in Salem centuries earlier. Wanda says that the difference between her and Agatha is that she did this on purpose.",
    "The dead witches come back to life. \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d screams Agatha \u2013 and suddenly stops.",
    "The witches start chanting Wanda\u2019s name, telling her she\u2019s a witch \u2013 the Scarlet Witch. \u201cSo it is written, so it is foretold. Harbinger of chaos.\u201d",
    "Agatha tells Wanda she can\u2019t win. \u201cPower isn\u2019t your problem,\u201d says Agatha, \u201cit\u2019s knowledge.\u201d A scarlet crown appears on Wanda\u2019s head.",
    "\u201cGive me your power and I will correct the flaws in your original spell,\u201d says Agatha. \u201cAnd you and your family and the people of Westview can all live together in peace. And no one will ever have to feel this pain again. Not even you.\u201d",
    "Wanda blasts them back into the present and they take to the skies. \u201cTake it,\u201d says Wanda, bombarding Agatha with magic. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d Vision flies up to her aid, but Wanda surrounds him in a forcefield. Agatha cackles, encouraging Wanda to embrace her fate. Woo and his FBI colleagues watch the disturbance unfold.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s more, I want it all!\u201d says Agatha, as Wanda gives her last ounce of magic. She hovers, drained of energy.",
    "\u201cAbout our deal,\u201d says Agatha. \u201cOnce cast a spell can never be changed. This world you made will always be broken. Just like\u2026 you.\u201d",
    "As Agatha tries to send the killing blow, however, her magic deserts her. Wanda restores herself. Magical runes appear in the walls of the Hex field. \u201cIn a given space, only the witch who cast them can use her magic,\u201d says Wanda. \u201cThanks for the lesson. But I don\u2019t need you to tell me who I am.\u201d",
    "Wanda goes full Scarlet Witch, absorbing her energy back from Agatha, and taking the form Wanda saw in the Mind Stone.",
    "\u201cOh god, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done,\u201d says Agatha.",
    "They return to the town square. \u201cSo what now? You gonna lock me up somewhere?\u201d asks Agatha. Not somewhere, says Wanda \u2013 here in Westview. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the role you chose. The nosy neighbor.\u201d",
    "As Agatha tells her she has no idea what she\u2019s unleashed, that Wanda\u2019s going to need her, but Wanda says she\u2019ll know where to find her if she does. Wanda turns her back into sitcom form: \u201cHiya, hon,\u201d she says cheerfully.",
    "\u201cYou live here now,\u201d says Wanda. \u201cNo one will ever bother you.\u201d",
    "The family are reunited. \u201cSo it would appear our dream home has been reduced to a fixer-upper,\u201d says Vision. \u201cI know you\u2019ll set everything right. Just not for us.\u201d \u201cNo, not for us,\u201d she agrees.",
    "They walk away, and Wanda and Monica acknowledge each other. The Hex field shrinks, turning Westview back to normal. The family return to their home, Wanda and Vision returning to their sitcom forms. They tuck the kids in bed, and tell the boys they\u2019re very proud of them both. \u201cA family is forever,\u201d says Wanda. \u201cWe could never truly leave each other, even if we tried.\u201d",
    "As they leave the room, Wanda adds, \u201cBoys, thanks for choosing me to be your mom.\u201d",
    "Wanda looks at the family photo and turns off the living room lights. Vision turns it back on, claiming he read somewhere that it\u2019s bad luck saying goodbye in the dark. Wanda says he didn\u2019t. He admits he made it up, but says he really wanted to see her properly. They look out of the window to watch the advancing Hex wall. Before he goes, Vision says he must know what he truly is. \u201cYou are the piece of the Mind Stone that lives in me,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou are a body of wires and blood and bone that I created. You are my sadness and my hope. But mostly you\u2019re my love.\u201d",
    "\u201cI have been a voice with no body, a body but not human, and now\u2026 a memory made real,\u201d he says. \u201cWho knows what I might be next. We have said goodbye before, he says, so it stands to reason\u2026\u201d She finishes his sentence: \u201c\u2026we\u2019ll say hello again.\u201d",
    "The Hex field passes through them and Vision disintegrates. \u201cSo long, darling.\u201d",
    "Wanda is left in the foundations of the house in Westview, wearing the same clothes as when she arrived. She pulls up her hood and walks into town. She arrives in the town square, with all the townspeople glaring at her. She walks towards Monica, who says they\u2019ll never know what she sacrificed for them. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t change how they see me,\u201d says Wanda. \u201cAnd you, you don\u2019t hate me?\u201d",
    "\u201cGiven the chance and given your power, I\u2019d bring my mom back, I know I would.\u201d Wanda says she\u2019s sorry for all the pain she\u2019s caused \u2013 Monica says she knows. Wanda says she doesn\u2019t understand her power \u2013 but she will.",
    "As sirens approach, Wanda turns into Scarlet Witch form and flies away. Monica wishes her good luck.",
    "MID CREDITS SEQUENCE",
    "Monica looks on as Woo manages the crime scene. \u201cAuthority looks good on you, Jimmy,\u201d she says. He asks where Darcy is. Monica says Darcy believes that \u201cdebriefs are for the weak\u201d, but that they can thank her for apprehending Hayward, who\u2019s taken into custody by the FBI.",
    "A previously unseen agent tells Captain Rambeau that they\u2019re waiting for her in the theater. Once inside the agent says she was \u201csent by an old friend of your mother\u2019s\u201d \u2013 and transforms into Skrull form. \u201cHe heard you\u2019d been grounded. He\u2019d like to meet with you.\u201d",
    "Where, asks Monica. The Skrull points onwards. Monica smiles.",
    "END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE",
    "A remote, beautiful wilderness. Wanda sits on the veranda of a log cabin. As she goes inside to check on the kettle, the Scarlet Witch is imprisoned inside, using the Darkhold and seemingly casting spells. Billy and Tommy call for help as the Witch\u2019s eyes glow red.",
    "Verdict:",
    "How often do you watch a big Hollywood blockbuster and feel that it nails the action sequences, yet falls emotionally flat? WandaVision\u2019s aptly titled \u2018The Series Finale\u2019 is the opposite. While it\u2019s a muddle of convoluted plotting, predictable fight scenes, and rushed character arcs, it never loses sight of the human story at its core. Okay, correct that \u2013 the Synthezoid/all-powerful magical being story at its core.",
    "Wanda, Vision and the kids coming together to fight numerous enemy forces is pure Incredibles stuff, a close-knit family looking out for each other \u00ad\u2013 what a shame they don\u2019t use their powers as inventively as Brad Bird\u2019s super-team. Meanwhile, the decision to bid farewell to Billy and Tommy by tucking them up in bed before they\u2019re consumed by nothingness is a masterstroke, that allows Wanda and Vision to share a suitably resonant farewell. Nobody could accuse WandaVision of engineering a fake happy ending.",
    "But \u2013 with the possible exception of Vision and Vision\u2019s metaphysical debates about their existence \u2013 everything else feels rushed and insubstantial. Even with (most of) the exposition dealt with last week, there are way too many story strands competing for attention \u2013 some really important characters are left short-changed as a result: Darcy Lewis is reduced to the briefest of comedic one-liners in a cameo that amounts to nothing more than taking out Hayward; Monica Rambeau, freshly set up as a superhero, gets barely any time to show what her powers can do; and Hayward himself has simply morphed into the two-dimensional, rent-a-bad guy. (Remember, this is a man who tries to shoot a pair of kids, so simply being arrested by the Feds feels like something of an anti-climax.)",
    "Admittedly Kathryn Hahn has the time of her life as the power-hungry Agatha, but even her motives seem a little too by-the-numbers. Indeed, after that magnificent episode 7 reveal, we\u2019d hoped for something a little cleverer than, \u201cI want your powers, Wanda!\u201d (Being sentenced to a lifetime in sitcom purgatory also makes little sense to the narrative \u2013 how would that even work?)",
    "It\u2019s perhaps ironic that a show that\u2019s revelled in pushing the boundaries of what a superhero story can do should be dragged down by genre clich\u00e9s \u2013 and those of the MCU. It\u2019s now a key part of the Marvel formula that there\u2019ll be a few loose ends to be picked up in later adventures. But WandaVision\u2019s finale skirts perilously close to the sort of Iron Man 2/Avengers: Age of Ultron territory where setting up future instalments is just as important as telling a satisfying story.",
    "And in hindsight, there\u2019s a sense the writers went overboard on Easter eggs that never came to fruition. That Rambeau\u2019s \u201cengineer\u201d was nobody we\u2019d ever come across before, or that Evan Peters\u2019 Pietro had no connection to the X-Men movies \u2013 he was just a Westview resident who happened to look familiar \u2013 feels like a cruel tease.",
    "Still, there\u2019s no shame in making a brilliant show with a slightly disappointing final chapter. Turns out that Marvel Studios are just as good at TV as they are at movies.",
    "Every episode of WandaVision is now available to view on Disney Plus."
