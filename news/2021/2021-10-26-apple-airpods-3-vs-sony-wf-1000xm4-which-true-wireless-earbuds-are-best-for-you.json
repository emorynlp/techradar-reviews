  "summary": "Here's how the Apple AirPods 3 stack up against the best true wireless earbuds",
  "article": [
    "The Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds sit at the top of our best true wireless earbuds list, and we awarded them five out of five stars when we tested them.",
    "But how do the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of earbuds compare to the brand new Apple AirPods 3? In this guide, we'll put the Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds and the Apple AirPods 3 head-to-head.",
    "As a quick refresher, Apple brought out the original AirPods in 2016 and the second-generation Apple AirPods in 2019 \u2013 think of those as Apple's entry-level true wireless earbuds.",
    "The Apple AirPods Pro, a step up in terms of performance and price, also launched in 2019 and Apple\u2019s first pair of high-end over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max, arrived later in 2020.",
    "Ever since the second-generation Apple AirPods landed, there\u2019s been speculation about when a new set of true wireless earbuds will arrive. Now we know they\u2019re the Apple AirPods 3, which were announced in October 2021 and are available to buy now.",
    "These true wireless earbuds are a big improvement on the 2019 AirPods, with support for immersive Spatial Audio, an IPX4 water resistance rating, new drivers, an improved design and much more. In our testing, we awarded them four out of five stars.",
    "Back in 2020, when we pitted the Apple AirPods Pro against the Sony WF-1000XM3 we settled on the Sony WF-1000XM3 Wireless Earbuds \u2013 although it was an extremely close call. Will the newest offerings from Apple and Sony fare the same? Read on to find out whether the AirPods 3 or the Sony WF-1000XM4 are the best wireless earbuds you can buy today.",
    "The Apple AirPods 3 cost $179 / \u00a3169 / AU$279. That\u2019s significantly cheaper than the Apple AirPods Pro, which will set you back $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399. However, the AirPods 3 don\u2019t offer noise cancellation \u2013 and that\u2019s what sets them apart from Apple\u2019s higher-end Pro offering.",
    "The AirPods 3 are more similar in price to the 2019 AirPods (which have now been given a permanent price cut). When they launched, they cost $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249 (with the standard charging case), and $199 / \u00a3199 / AU$319 with the Wireless Charging Case.",
    "As the AirPods 3 come with the wireless charging case as standard, they\u2019re actually a little cheaper than their predecessors. In any case, we were glad to see that Apple has stuck with a similar price point for the third-generation AirPods, rather than making them much pricier.",
    "In comparison, the Sony WF-1000XM4 are considerably more expensive at $279.99 / \u00a3250 / AU$449.95. However, they offer more advanced features and are priced similarly to the best earbuds you can buy today from brands like Bose, Grado and Sennheiser.",
    "The Apple AirPods 3 look similar to the previous generation of AirPods, but there are some differences; for instance, they have an IPX4 water resistance rating, making them suitable for use while working out.",
    "What\u2019s more, the stems of the AirPods 3 are a little shorter, and the housing is more softly contoured, which gives them a streamlined look more in keeping with the AirPods Pro than the second-gen AirPods.",
    "Unlike the AirPods Pro, there are no interchangeable ear tips on offer. Instead, they have the semi-open design of the second-gen AirPods. Great for those who don\u2019t like earbuds pushed into their ear canals, not so great for those who want a better audio experience and a snug fit \u2013 sound isolation isn\u2019t the best, and there\u2019s some sound leakage, too.",
    "At 4.28g each, the AirPods 3 are lightweight and comfortable to wear. But although they didn\u2019t fall out during a jog, we wouldn\u2019t bet on them for more strenuous exercise.",
    "The Sony WF-1000XM4 aren\u2019t the smallest earbuds you can buy \u2013 although they\u2019re, thankfully, smaller than the XM3s \u2013 which means they aren\u2019t discrete, but they are fairly understated with a plain design and small gold embellishment.",
    "We found the Sony WF-1000XM4 a little fiddly to insert during testing and felt they should fit more deeply in the ear than they do, but they are mostly comfortable and easy to wear.",
    "Whether you prefer the Apple AirPods 3 or the Sony WF-1000XM4 in terms of design is a question that\u2019s down to personal preference. Do you prefer an open fit or a closed fit?",
    "The stems of the AirPods have also become a popular design feature over the years, so even though they\u2019re smaller on the AirPods 3, you\u2019re still getting the Apple \u2018look\u2019. Then again, if you want a more understated design, the Sony WF-1000XM4 will look the part whether you\u2019re at home, the office or the gym.",
    "The Apple AirPods 3 offer a 30-hour maximum battery life. They also come with a wireless charging case (that's MagSafe-compatible). If you're in a hurry, a quick five-minute charge will give you about an hour of playback.",
    "The onboard battery life is around six hours, but that drops to five hours if you have Spatial Audio enabled. That\u2019s a bit disappointing \u2013 or at least not a big improvement over the second-gen AirPods.",
    "In comparison, the Sony WF-1000XM4 bring you eight to 12 hours of on-board battery life and 24 hours in total with the case. Like the AirPods 3, they\u2019re Qi charging pad-compatible, and five minutes plugged into an outlet will deliver another hour of playback.",
    "The Sony WF-1000XM4 beat the AirPods 3 in terms of battery life, but whether that\u2019s a dealbreaker for you will depend on where and how you\u2019ll be using your new earbuds.",
    "The Apple AirPods 3 don\u2019t offer noise cancellation - that\u2019s the job of the AirPods Pro for now. However, we were impressed with the sound quality of these buds generally. The AirPods 3 come with new custom-made, low-distortion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers, and although these aren\u2019t audiophile in-ear headphones, they\u2019re a perfectly enjoyable listen for music, podcasts, audiobooks and calls.",
    "They also offer Spatial Audio Support, placing sound in a 3D sphere around you to create a more immersive experience. However, with support for only the SBC and AAC codecs, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy hi-res audio with the AirPods 3.",
    "They also offer a bunch of additional features, like Audio Sharing, Announce Notifications, and integration with the Find My network, which all make the AirPods 3 a good option for use with an iPhone \u2013 but less appealing for anyone with an Android.",
    "Similarly, the XM4s are packed full of features, many of which we\u2019ve seen from Sony\u2019s over-ears, including Speak-To-Chat, DSEE Extreme audio upscaling \u2013 designed to extract high-resolution sound from standard-definition digital audio files \u2013 and adaptive noise cancellation.",
    "The Sony earbuds also support hi-res audio playback, thanks to the company\u2019s bespoke LDAC codec \u2013 although aptX support is missing here. As for spatial audio? The WF-1000XM4 have their own solution in the form of Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio, which requires a compatible music streaming service like Amazon Music HD or Deezer.",
    "We think you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a more comprehensively-specced pair of wireless earbuds. If you\u2019re looking for good sound quality and a wide range of features, you can\u2019t beat the Sony WF-1000XM4 in this particular showdown. But those with lots of Apple products might prefer the decent sound and additional features of the AirPods 3.",
    "The Sony WF-1000XM4s might be our favorite true wireless earbuds right now, but this was a close call.",
    "The Sony WF-1000XM4s are still the best all-rounders and superior in terms of audio quality and noise cancellation. Their design is also more suited to anyone looking for an understated pair of earbuds and isn\u2019t fussed about the AirPods look (or is trying to actively avoid it).",
    "But they are more expensive than Apple\u2019s latest earbuds, which means they might not be the right option for you. Instead, the Apple AirPods 3 are the better choice if you have an iPhone \u2013 pairing the buds with an iPhone 13 mini was as easy as opening the wireless charging case and tapping the prompt that appeared on our screen.",
    "What\u2019s more, there\u2019s hands-free Hey Siri activation, Announce Notifications, Audio Sharing, and Group Facetime with Spatial Audio. These are appealing if you\u2019re already bought into the Apple ecosystem but useless if you\u2019re not invested in Apple\u2019s line of smartphones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches.",
    "We also recommend them if you\u2019re happy to sacrifice noise cancellation for Spatial Audio and solid sound quality rather than the best of the best. Design-wise, they\u2019ve got the stems that are everywhere these days, but we do love the slighter shorter design, which gives the AirPods a touch more elegance.",
    "Yes, one of the biggest disadvantages of the Apple AirPods 3 is they don\u2019t have ANC and the Sony WF-1000XM4 do. However, the noise-cancelling of the XM4s isn\u2019t the absolute best you\u2019ll find, which means if you\u2019re looking for exceptional noise-cancelling and an audiophile-grade experience, neither option will be right for you. Instead, you should look to noise-cancelling earbuds like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds or over-ear headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM4."
