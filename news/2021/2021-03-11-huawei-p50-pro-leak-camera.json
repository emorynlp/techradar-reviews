    "A new Huawei P50 Pro leak shows renders of a phone with, quite simply, some of the biggest camera lenses we\u2019ve ever seen on a phone. They\u2019re huge. Grotesque. We can\u2019t wait to try them out.",
    "Assuming they\u2019re real, of course \u2013 leaks aren\u2019t always accurate, and there\u2019s less of a guarantee that renders represent the final design of a phone. But this leak comes courtesy of the reliable Steve Hemmerstoffer aka @OnLeaks, who revealed the new design on Voice with a suitably appropriate warning for readers to brace themselves for the first images of the phone:",
    "Hemmerstoffer didn\u2019t have any camera details to go with the images, so we don\u2019t know exactly how truly massive each of these two lenses are expected to be \u2013 but even eyeballing them shows that both of them lined up in a camera block take up a third of the phone\u2019s length.",
    "Hemmerstoffer\u2019s leak did include other alleged info about the P50 Pro: it\u2019ll have a 6.6-inch display with slightly curved waterfall edges, an in-screen fingerprint sensor and a centered punch-hole for the selfie camera (as opposed to the two-lens oval hole in the Huawei P40 range).",
    "Per the leak, the top and bottom of the P50 Pro are flat, much like the P30, and the supposed dimensions (159 x 73 x 8.6mm) are barely longer and wider than the P40, though expect that camera bump to thicken the phone to 10.3mm. Expect a rear glass panel and metal frame with speakers at the top and bottom.",
    "This leak certainly blows the doors open on the P50 Pro; what few rumors we\u2019ve heard focused on whether the phone will be the first to come with Huawei\u2019s Android-rivaling operating system Harmony pre-installed from the factory floor. But now we\u2019re wondering what those lenses could accomplish \u2013 even phones of yesteryear we remember having big cameras, like the Nokia Lumia 1020, actually just had large camera blocks. We\u2019re eager to see more about what might be the largest lenses ever to grace a smartphone."
