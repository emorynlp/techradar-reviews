  "article": [
    "Update: Our Nvidia GeoForce RTX 3080 stock tracker last found the GPU at Amazon on Sunday, March 28. When it's back in stock, our Twitter tracker will send you an alert if you're following the account. In addition to Amazon, we're checking Best Buy, GameStop and Newegg, among others. The RTX 3080 is in stock right now as part of a pricey pre-built Dell desktop, not for the normal MSRP of $699. It's also always available on eBay, but for inflated prices hovering around $2,000. Ouch.",
    "That's why we started an RTX 3080 Twitter tracker to alert you when there's new stock for a reasonable price, just like we did with our PS5 restock and Xbox restock trackers.",
    "Our Nvidia 3080 GPU restock alerts look like this (for example):",
    "On average, the Nvidia RTX 3080 is in stock for just two minutes when American retailers go live with inventory on waves. That's why it's important to get GPU restock alert on minute one and know ahead of time where to buy the RTX 3080. You hardly have time to get through the checkout process, and with Amazon's 1-click buying process, it's even harder to scoop up the 3080.",
    "2. Figure out the US retailers that will have GPU restocks",
    "Amazon is one of four major retailers in the US that has had consistent RTX 3080 stock, and since we started intently tracking in February, it has carried the Nvidia GeForce graphics card from six brands: Asus, MSI, PNY, Zotac, Gigabyte and EVGA.",
    "Amazon RTX 3080 restock is random, with dates and times happening morning and night without a known pattern. That's why we're setting up alerts \u2013 to connect you to the sought-after GPU as soon as it goes back in stock.",
    "You can actually buy the RTX 3080 today \u2013 if you're willing to spend money on a pre-built desktop PC. It starts at $2,616 (final checkout price once you go through some discounts) for the Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition R10 gaming desktop. There are two desktop configurations with this GPU included, with differences in the RAM and hard drive size. Of course, the souped-up version with 128GB of RAM and 4TB of storage costs $3,939 (again, final checkout price).",
    "Either price from the Dell store is eye-watering, but if you were going to buy a pre-built gaming PC anyway, then buying the RTX 3080 is in your grasp. It's a way better value than paying for a $2,000 RTX 3080 from eBay.",
    "The Best Buy RTX 3080 stock is probably your best chance to buy the GPU in the US simply because Amazon makes it too easy to check out. As long as you have your credit card and address details correct ahead of time, you should be able to check out with Best Buy faster than others who trip over those formalities. We last saw Best Buy have 3080 Founder's Edition restock along with next-gen consoles on the morning of Friday, March 12.",
    "GameStop has only recently started carrying GPUs, and it's been coupling them with with next-gen console restock, too. So far, we've seen the The RTX 3080 from Asus, MSI and EVGA, though the plan for GameStop seems to be that it'll carry more stock \u2013 as soon as it becomes more readily available. Surprisingly, unlike Newegg, GameStop isn't forcing its customers into a bundle, either.",
    "On Monday, March 29, we did see a Newegg Shuffle, which is the PC and component retailer's lottery to buy hard-to-find CPUs and GPUs including the RTX 3080. But this time there was pretty much every graphics card but the 3080.",
    "We've been covering each and every Shuffle at TechRadar and tweet it out every time there's a chance for you to purchase graphics card stock, no matter the brand. Just be prepared to spend extra on a bundled cooler fan or something you didn't know you needed.",
    "eBay is almost certainly your last resort if you're looking to buy the RTX 3080 GPU. While we do occasionally see some $700 price options on there, those are recent listings. They always end up skyrocketing to $2,000 or above. Rarely is it any price less than that. You might as well as buy the Dell desktop PC for that kind of cash."
