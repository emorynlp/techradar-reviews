    "Did you watch the Pok\u00e9mon cartoon show as a kid, or kept up through the years? Now you can watch episodes of the anime for free on the Nintendo Switch with the Pok\u00e9mon TV app, which also includes a bunch of extra videos and other content.",
    "The Pok\u00e9mon TV app has been available for phones and smart TVs since 2019, but its arrival on the Switch brings the content to a platform where plenty of Pok\u00e9mon fans already are \u2013 not just those playing Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, but players of the new Pok\u00e9mon Unite MOBA and waiting for the upcoming open-world Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus game.",
    "There\u2019s more than just seven full series of the Pok\u00e9mon anime \u2013 the app also includes videos for tips on Pok\u00e9mon games, competitive broadcasts of Pok\u00e9mon games, and even stuff specifically for younger viewers in a dedicated \u2018Junior\u2019 content category.",
    "While it doesn\u2019t have every episode of every season of the anime, it does have complete seasons of the earliest and latest series along with some of the films, some of which are only on the service for a limited time, suggesting the content might rotate in and out. The Pok\u00e9mon TV app is available to download for free on the Nintendo eShop.",
    "There\u2019s nothing suggesting Nintendo will join the streaming content wars, and it\u2019s not like there are many shows or movies of its characters over the years beyond a few Saturday morning cartoons and one infamous film. Pok\u00e9mon has been the only Nintendo property to spread across multiple media, and has persisted over the years, so it makes sense that the Pok\u00e9mon TV app would migrate to the Nintendo Switch.",
    "While the Switch\u2019s 720p display isn\u2019t the best for watching media, the Pok\u00e9mon anime isn\u2019t exactly known for high-resolution graphics \u2013 especially the original series that debuted in 1997 in Japan (1998 in the US and elsewhere), a time when cathode ray tube (CRT) screens and TVs commonly maxed out at 480p resolution.",
    "It\u2019s interesting that so much Pok\u00e9mon content is migrating from smartphones to the Nintendo Switch and vice versa \u2013 the Pok\u00e9mon TV app started on mobile before coming to the console, while Pok\u00e9mon Unite launched on the Switch and will soon become available on phones. Pok\u00e9mon has always been synonymous with on-the-go gaming, a tradition which has lived on in Pok\u00e9mon Go.",
    "While we wouldn\u2019t expect the latter to arrive on the Switch given its reliance on location data and rear camera (for the AR purists), the relationship between console and smartphone seems to be getting stronger \u2013 which is good news for Pok\u00e9mon fans.",
