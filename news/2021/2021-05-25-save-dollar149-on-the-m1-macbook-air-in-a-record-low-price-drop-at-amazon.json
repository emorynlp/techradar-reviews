    "Amazon's MacBook deals have been playing with the M1 MacBook Air price for a few weeks now. However, we've just spotted a new offer that can secure you the larger 512GB model for its lowest price ever. This MacBook Air deal had previously been stuck around the $1,149 mark - however with an extra $49.01 off at checkout you can grab the powerful ultrabook for just $1,099.99 (MSRP $1,249).",
    "That's a fantastic offer and one of the best MacBook deals we've seen in a long time. However, if you are looking to spend a little less you can still pick up the 256GB model for its record low $899.99 price (was $999.99).",
    "This isn't a new discount, however it is a return to a fantastic lowest cost yet. The 256GB M1 MacBook Air only just took its first steps towards that $899 position a few weeks ago, but recent days saw it climbing back up to $949.99. Amazon's extra $49.01 discount is also available on this model, though, returning us to that popular $899.99 sales price.",

    "You'll find more MacBook Air deals just below, with all the lowest prices from around the web compared. However, if you're looking for extra cooling (leading to longer sprints of more demanding use), a Touch Bar, better mics, and a slightly boosted battery, check out the MacBook Pro deals just underneath.",
    "We're rounding up plenty more generations of MacBook Air deals right here on TechRadar, as well as all the best cheap iPad deals for those looking to hybridize their workflow. These discounts also bode well for this year's Prime Day deals, so stay tuned for more savings over the next few weeks."
