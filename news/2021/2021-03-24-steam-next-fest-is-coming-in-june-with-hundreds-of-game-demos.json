    "Steam Next Fest is Valve\u2019s newly revealed \u201cmulti-day celebration of upcoming games\u201d and it\u2019s scheduled to take place in June 2021.",
    "Previously known as Steam Game Festival, Steam Next Fest is set to feature \u201chundreds of game demos\u201d, \u201coodles\u201d of developer livestreams as well as conversations with development teams about the games they\u2019re developing that are coming to Steam in the near future. According to Valve, the event has been renamed \u201cto more directly communicate its focus\u201d on upcoming games.",
    "Valve's digital event will kick off on June 16 and will run through to June 22. The last Steam Game Festival took place in February 2021 and offered access to 500 demos for free. Though Valve has confirmed there will, once again, be hundreds of demos to choose from, an exact number hasn't been given just yet. That\u2019s likely to be confirmed closer to the time.",
    "With Steam Next Fest now confirmed, June has the potential to be a very busy month for game fans.",
    "Although E3 2021 has been cancelled in a physical sense once again, there are reports that the ESA isn\u2019t ready to abandon the event entirely this year. According to a report from VGC, there are proposals for E3 2021 to take place digitally over three days between June 15 and June 17 - right at the same time as Steam Next Fest. This digital E3 would apparently also see demos release online, as well as \u201ckeynote sessions from games partners, an awards show, a June 14 preview night and other smaller streams from games publishers, influencers and media partners.\u201d",
    "That\u2019s not to mention Geoff Keighley\u2019s Summer Game Fest which has the potential to take place at this time too. 2020\u2019s Summer Game Fest ran over the course of four months, though Keighley has said on Twitter that the next iteration is likely to be \u201cmore condensed\u201d.",
    "So, while there\u2019s going to be a shortage of in-person events in 2021 it\u2019s unlikely that there\u2019s going to be a shortage of exciting games news."
