    "On the last day of CES 2021, the brand quietly announced another of its anticipated phones, the budget Samsung Galaxy A32 5G \u2013 which, as its name implies, is set to be a cheap 5G phone.",
    "While far from the specs of the flagship Samsung Galaxy S21, the Samsung Galaxy A32 looks to be a capable smartphone with a quad rear camera, according to Samsung\u2019s announcement \u2013 which was little more than a blog post with a spec sheet.",
    "The Samsung A32 specs include an unnamed octa-core processor (which Android Central suspects could be a newly-announced Mediatek Dimensity 700-series chip), from 4GB to 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage (expandable to 1TB via MicroSD), and a big 5,000mAh battery. The 6.5-inch display is only HD Plus (720p), but the phone packs a quad rear camera fronted by a 48MP main shooter, with 8MP ultra-wide, 5MP macro, and 2MP depth cameras.",
    "Paired with 5G connectivity, the new phone looks like it will be powerful yet affordable \u2013 though we can\u2019t say for sure, since the Samsung Galaxy A32 price and release date weren\u2019t announced in the official post. We do know that it\u2019ll come in four colors: black, white, blue, and violet.",
    "While it didn\u2019t get the firehose of leaks as the Samsung Galaxy S21 phones, the Galaxy A32 had its share of early rumors and renders released. Samsung clearly geared up the A32 as an affordable 5G phone \u2013 but so did plenty of other device makers.",
    "At CES 2021, we saw the year\u2019s first phones revealed, mainly from TCL and Motorola. Both brands revealed lineups of budget phones, including an affordable 5G phone each (the TCL 20 5G and Motorola One 5G Ace, respectively). The Galaxy A32 5G may technically be the first Samsung phone to come out in 2021, but it got beaten to the punch in its niche.",
    "Whether that ends up mattering likely comes down to each brand\u2019s dominance in the region, as they look to be very similar phones, at least on paper. But we\u2019re eager to test them out and crown the best cheap 5G phone of 2021...at least until more contenders arrive."
