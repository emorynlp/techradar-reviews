    "We've seen lots of great Prime Day deals on true wireless earbuds like the Apple AirPods \u2013 but if you're after something a little different, these deals on the Samsung Galaxy Buds range of wireless earbuds are well worth a look.",
    "Our top deal is on the company's latest model, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Usually $199.99, Amazon has slashed $30 off the price, bringing them down to $169.99. While this isn't the lowest price we've ever seen, it's still a fantastic deal on these noise-cancelling earbuds.",
    "You can also save on the Galaxy Buds Pro in the UK, which have been reduced from \u00a3219 to just \u00a3149, a return to their lowest ever price.",
    "If you're looking for something cheaper, Amazon has also discounted the older Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, and the Galaxy Buds Plus in both the US and the UK, bringing them down to budget-friendly prices. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for Samsung Galaxy Buds deals in your region).",
    "The best way to describe the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro is they\u2019re pretty much the Apple AirPods Pro equivalent for the Samsung Galaxy S21 series of phones. But that doesn\u2019t quite encapsulate everything these true wireless earbuds can do.",
    "Yes, both the AirPods Pro and Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds offer active noise cancellation. Yes, they both have some form of spatial audio support that can make TV shows and movies more immersive. And sure, they both have five hours of battery life before they need to be recharged.",
    "However, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro go far beyond these standout features for folks who own a Samsung phone and tablet \u2013 for them, these earbuds are the missing puzzle piece that really does tie everything in Samsung\u2019s world together.",
    "If you want something a little cheaper, then the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus may be the right choice for you. They offer an improved sound quality compared to their predecessors, a 22-hour combined battery life, and support for iOS devices, as well as Android devices.",
    "For more adventurous types, there are the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. The kidney bean shape of these buds is very different from what we've seen from rival brands, with most other wireless earbuds on the market. They\u2019re certainly unique, but those interested in high-end sound quality and excellent ANC over a conversation-starting design should look elsewhere.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Galaxy Buds Plus, and Galaxy Buds Live from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
