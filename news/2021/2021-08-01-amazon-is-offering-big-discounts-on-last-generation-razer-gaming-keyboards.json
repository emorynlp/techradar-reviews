    "Razer releases plenty of gaming keyboards every year, each with incremental upgrades over the previous model. If you're just looking for a cheap deck, then, there are some excellent prices to be found on previous generation models, and Amazon is offering a plethora of savings this weekend.",
    "The Razer Cynosa and Ornata gaming keyboards are the stars of the show here, both nearing their lowest ever prices right now. The Cynosa is $20 off at just $39.99 (was $59.99) - that's just $5 away from a record low that we haven't seen since January. Meanwhile, the Ornata is down all the way from $99.99 to $59.99, just $8 away from the $51 record low that we've only seen twice in this model's lifetime.",
    "These keyboards are pretty much identical to their more expensive predecessors in experience and quality, but don't offer the dedicated media controls found in later models. You'll still find a few discounts on the V2 instalments, but the value offered in the cheaper keyboards isn't quite matched here as we've seen far lower prices on the newer models in recent memory.",
    "However, if you don't want to pick up an older gaming keyboard, the Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition V2 is currently available for its lowest price ever - just $69.99 down from $139.99. That's a massive $70 discount on a premium deck, and it's also available with a range of switch options.",

    "If you're kitting out your full rig, check out the latest gaming laptop deals for more discounts. Or, take a look at the latest cheap gaming chairs, gaming monitor sales and gaming mouse prices."
