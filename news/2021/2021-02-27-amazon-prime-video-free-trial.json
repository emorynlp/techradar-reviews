    "Amazon Prime has been pretty indispensable during the pandemic: ensuring we got our groceries and gag-worthy TV shows on demand. As a result, Prime Video \u2013 its on-demand streaming element \u2013 is crushing the competition in terms of number of subscribers and worldwide availability.",
    "Despite the platform\u2019s ubiquity, an Amazon Prime Video free trial of 30 days is still up for grabs. That\u2019s a huge draw for entertainment junkies: an entire month to catch award-winning Amazon Originals, buzz-worthy series The Boys, live sport, and Golden-Globe nominated titles like the hilarious Borat\u2019s Subsequent Moviefilm and Regina King\u2019s One Night in Miami.",
    "Signing up is easy, there\u2019s tons to watch, and a paid membership doesn\u2019t have to break the bank once the Amazon Prime free trial is over. Read on and we\u2019ll explain all below.",
    "If you\u2019re new to Amazon Prime, or it\u2019s been over twelve months since you were a Prime member, then the 30-day Amazon Prime Video free trial is available for you. It\u2019s even better for students, who are entitled to an incredible 6-months.",
    "Signing up is easy, just follow the bullet points below:",
    "Your Amazon account will need a current, valid credit card linked to it. But, as long as you cancel your membership before the free trial period expires, you won't be charged.",
    "A typical Amazon Prime sub \u2013 which bundles together Prime Video, unlimited music, Prime Reading, free delivery and more \u2013 is $12.99 a month in the US, and \u00a37.99 / AU$6.99 / \u20ac7.99 around the world.",
    "Pay $119 for the annual membership and save a decent wedge, all the while getting lightning-fast delivery and multi-media entertainment all year round.",
    "But if you\u2019re only interested in blockbuster movies or the weekly drama of Amazon Original series, then an $8.99 Prime Video membership will leave you $3 a month better off. That's an option only available stateside. It really does pay to study too, because once the 6-month free trial ends, students only have to pay $6.49 a month to access everything on Prime. That\u2019s 50% less than the typical fee and cheaper than a basic Netflix plan.",
    "There\u2019s plenty to feast your eyes on: over 13,000 movies and TV series. It has classic Hollywood fare like It\u2019s A Wonderful Life, brooding modern thrillers \u2013 You Were Never Really Here and Zodiac, for example \u2013 and plenty of comedies and feel-good indie flicks.",
    "Prime is packed with great Amazon Originals too: Transparent, Hunters, Fleabag, and Tales from the Loop to name only a few. Then there\u2019s a slew of recent Golden-Globe nominated titles like Sound of Metal and the Amazon exclusive Small Axe.",
    "Meanwhile, sports fans can enjoy live matches and docuseries like All or Nothing. And, if some of your favorite programming is missing, chances are you\u2019ll find it via Amazon Channels. There are more than a 100 you can subscribe to, such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Shudder, which often provide their own 7-day free trial.",
    "Much like Netflix, the content available does vary from country to country. So the best way to see exactly what's on offer where you are is to head to Amazon and grab that 30-day free trial.",
