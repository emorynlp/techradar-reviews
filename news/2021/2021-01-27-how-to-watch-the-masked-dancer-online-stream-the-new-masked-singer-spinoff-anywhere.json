    "We didn't think it was possible, but they've done it - the silliest show on TV just got an even sillier spinoff. Here's introducing the very first season of The Masked Dancer... and you can probably guess the premise. That's right, the panel - led once again by the fabulous Ken Jeong - have to figure out the identities of 10 elaborately costumed celebrities. Who will now be dancing rather than singing off against each other. Duh. Here's how to watch The Masked Dancer online - no matter where in the world you are.",
    "Between them, we're told our contestants have sold more than 38 million albums, and amassed 20 Emmy Award wins, 20 Grammy Award nominations, 10 World Dancing titles, five New York Times Best-Selling Author titles, four Olympic gold medals and three Broadway show appearances. But winning The Masked Dancer would obviously surpass all of these.",
    "As in The Masked Singer, the celebrities will be dropping clues throughout the series, some much more enlightening than others, and you can always count on Jeong, alongside choreographer and singer Paula Abdul, and actors Ashley Tisdale and Brian Austin Green, to put two and two together and come up with... Celine Dion.",
    "The costumes, as ever, are utterly superb, the Hammerhead and Exotic Bird arguably being the standout efforts, and it's a wonder that our contestants have been able to move so, ahem, impressively in them, whether performing a hip-hop, salsa, jazz or tap-dancing routine.",
    "It's addictively silly television, and we've got everything you need to know if you plan to watch The Masked Dancer online each and every week - just follow our guide below.",
    "If you find yourself abroad and unable to access the same streaming services, there's a reason for this: geo-blocking, a common digital annoyance that means certain content can only be viewed in certain parts of the world.",
    "Luckily, there\u2019s an easy solution. Downloading a VPN will allow you to stream shows like The Masked Dancer online anywhere. It's a simple bit of software that changes your IP address, meaning that you can access on-demand content or live TV just as if you were at home."
