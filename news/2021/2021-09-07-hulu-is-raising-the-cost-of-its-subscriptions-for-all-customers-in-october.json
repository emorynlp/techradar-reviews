  "article": [
    "Hulu has announced that it will raise the prices of both its ad-supported and ad-free tiers of its service for new and existing customers starting on October 8.",
    "For Hulu ad-supported customers, the new price of the service will be $6.99 per month \u2013 up from $5.99 per month \u2013 while ad-free customers should expect to pay $12.99 per month (up from $11.99 per month).",
    "It\u2019s not a sizable increase \u2013 both tiers are only getting a $1 per month price hike \u2013 but it does put the streaming service in a strange predicament. For one, Hulu ad-free is now almost the same cost as the Hulu, Disney Plus and ESPN+ combo deal that runs $13.99 a month, making it almost worth converting for the additional content.",
    "The price hike also means that an ad-free subscription of Hulu is almost the same cost of Netflix\u2019s Standard Plan that costs $13.99 per month. You\u2019ll still save a substantial amount by watching the service with ads, but it\u2019s now a tougher decision for folks who don\u2019t want to watch ads.",
    "While this is an unfortunate situation for subscribers, it\u2019s not entirely unexpected. Streaming services like Hulu are always upping their costs to keep up with inflating content budgets.",
    "If there\u2019s a silver lining to the price hikes, it\u2019s that it won\u2019t affect customers signed up for Hulu with Live TV who have been paying $65 per month since the last price hike in December, and we probably won\u2019t see another hike like this for at least another six months.",
    "The bad news? Well, if you subscribed to a number of services like Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and others to escape the cost of cable, you might find that your new monthly bills are starting to look a lot closer to your old one.",
    "Streaming will always be the preferred way to watch content for cord cutters, but the rising costs of streaming are making it a less-compelling option than it was a few years ago.",
