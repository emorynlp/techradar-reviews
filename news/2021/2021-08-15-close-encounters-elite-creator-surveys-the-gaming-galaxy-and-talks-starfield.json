    "Reportedly set \u201c300-ish years in the future\", official news of Starfield\u2019s release at E3 2021 provided the shot of hype craved by industry figures and players alike. \"And now man is living amongst the stars: what does that mean?\", pondered Bethesda\u2019s Todd Howard in an accompanying video interview to launch the title. But until Elite came out way back in September 1984, there were no stars. At least not on home computers. It was this game that first ventured into the final frontier.",
    "Imitating the questing, but disarmingly amateur, training phase of Ryan Gosling\u2019s Neil Armstrong in First Man, David Braben and Elite co-creator Ian Bell devised a game founded on raw invention. They built a primitive vessel soldered together with fizzing sparks of ambition, powered by BBC Basic machine code and streamlined via straight-edged vector aerodynamics to open a portal into a new world.",
    "From a back-alley office behind a British Gas showroom in Cambridge, Braben and Bell lifted off into a cosmic vacuum now, some 40 years later, overpopulated by competing titles from across the gaming galaxy. As the latest, Starfield enters the space race with the weight of expectation already bearing down on the makers of Skyrim and Fallout. Now owned by Microsoft, Bethesda has promised a \u201cHan Solo simulator\u201d, striking an Xbox exclusive with a release date itself set quite far in the future: November 11, 2022.",
    "Braben, who was awarded the 2015 video game BAFTA Academy Fellowship in recognition of his contribution to the industry, remains a key commentator here. After all, Elite \u201cchanged the world\u201d. Arguably, it spawned the concept of open-world games, acting as a direct prompt for Grand Theft Auto, which Rockstar North founder Dave Jones reportedly described as \u201cElite in the city\u201d. The release of Elite Dangerous in 2012 compounded Braben\u2019s influential position, providing the platform for a unique perspective on the new generation of titles set in space.",
    "Speaking to TechRadar online from a Greek island, we ask Braben if he had tuned in to E3\u2019s Starfield launch?",
    "\u201cI did. It\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve always been a fan of Bethesda\u2019s games. Starfield looks very much like the sort of story-based adventure that we might associate with the men-in-tights games,\u201d he jokes, before elaborating: \u201cI hope they do it right. I\u2019m sure they will. I think in terms of the way the story-based expedition works, it\u2019s probably a pretty good setting. The trailer actually didn\u2019t tell me very much about the game, which is often the case with early trailers. It\u2019s probably true of some of ours too. But it was a lovely teaser. Let\u2019s see where it goes from there.\u201d",
    "To really understand the future of this genre, it\u2019s important to examine the past. Braben and Bell met at Jesus College, Cambridge, finding a shared interest in early home computers and the programming techniques that would lead them to cram a 22K game into the BBC Micro\u2019s 32K capacity. Elite went on to shift more than one million copies, becoming the first non-American best seller in the US. But Braben\u2019s fascination with the worlds beyond our world had taken hold some years earlier.",
    "\u201cI was very interested in astronomy, the planets and how the solar system formed. But I also had a huge interest in science fiction. I avidly read the likes of Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Isaac Asimov. There was a huge range of people who wrote very creatively, very interestingly, presenting very different worlds. I was thoroughly engaged with it, entirely in books.",
    "\u201cThere were almost no science fiction films that captured the same spirit. It was all either camp and laughable or didn\u2019t really engage with what you might consider hard science fiction that you got from the books. Star Wars was the first one that presented a world that was plausible. That was an amazing film. For the first time, the world that I had read about in books actually made it to the screen.\u201d",
    "While Braben enjoyed the \u201cart-house conceptual\u201d vision of Space Invaders and 2-D design of Asteroids, comparable games set in the outer cosmos proved to be both a source of frustration and inspiration.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the exploration side,\" he comments. \"That\u2019s one of the things that drive it. Ian (Bell) and I had both become a bit sick of the fact that all the games out there were rather samey. There were three lives, extra life at 10,000, typical playtime of less than 10 mins. They were so regimented. I think that was very much driven by the arcades and trying to go for the next coin drop. I thought \u2018if you had a home computer, why follow that structure?\u2019\u201d",
    "Looking back, Braben compares the first phase of Elite\u2019s success to a quote from the 2018 Queen biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody: \u201cWe\u2019re four misfits, writing music for misfits\u201d.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of Elite and also that we stood our ground,\u201d he explains, recounting a meeting with Thorn EMI, who turned it down because of the absence of these ubiquitous and \u201cregimented\u201d gaming tropes. \u201cWe were writing for people with interests like us and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shame in that. It might be a niche audience but at least it is an audience,\u201d he says.",
    "In 1994, following the collapse of his partnership with Bell, Braben established Frontier Developments, a video game company that released Frontier: Elite II and Frontier: First Encounters. In 2014, after an extended hiatus and funded by a spectacularly successful Kickstarter campaign, which raised approximately \u00a31.7m, Elite Dangerous was released. But how had Braben\u2019s ambitions changed?",
    "\u201cThere are so many different aspects of it to be hugely proud of,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe fact that every single object in the night sky is in the game and a whole lot more that is just slightly further away than we can see. That is the joy of exploration. Going beyond the horizon and finding something new.\u201d",
    "In fact, Braben points out that just \u201c0.04% of our galaxy has been explored by players\u201d so far and Elite Dangerous, with revenues of \u00a3100m, continues to expand. May\u2019s Odyssey extension added a range of new features centering on more immersive first-person gameplay. While admitting frustration at the technical issues that beset its launch, Braben remains thrilled by Elite\u2019s evolution and the hardwired community experience. \u201cIt\u2019s that real incredible richness and dynamic range. You just don\u2019t see that in games,\u201d he says.",
    "However, the last decade has seen a tangible renaissance in this realm. A recent Wireframe feature chronicled the genre and suggested Elite Dangerous was the point when \u201cspace became cool again\u201d. In 2019, Outer Wilds claimed the Best Game BAFTA, EA has confirmed a remake of Dead Space, while No Man\u2019s Sky has been proclaimed as \u201cone of the all-time biggest turnarounds in industry history\u201d.",
    "Braben congratulated No Man\u2019s Sky developer Hello Games for its continued commitment to the title, which celebrates its fifth anniversary this month.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve played No Man\u2019s Sky a little and it\u2019s a very different experience,\" Braben tells us. \u201cI think they have put a lot of work in since release to improve the game and I applaud that,\u201d he says, before addressing a broader question about the genre\u2019s rejuvenation. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s technological. I think it\u2019s much more social. People have seen the success of Elite Dangerous. They\u2019ve seen the money raised for Star Citizen. The focus has changed and people have realized what an interesting genre this is.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t really see Dead Space in quite the same way. It\u2019s a very good game and I did love playing it but if you\u2019d have asked me to list space games, I probably would have put it in a different category. But I love to see things that spark people\u2019s imagination and challenge ideas. That\u2019s really important. Dead Space does that as does Elite Dangerous. To get you to look up at the night sky and realize how tiny and fragile the Earth is. There are so many things culturally that we need to be looking at, as Sir David Attenborough has been drawing attention to. It\u2019s another way of showing just how small we are in the vastness of space.\u201d",
    "Returning to Starfield and Braben feels it\u2019s important that Bethesda recognizes the challenges that exist in the modern digital world and learn from the recent releases \u2013 including No Man\u2019s Sky and Cyberpunk 2077 \u2013 which have become targets of social media vilification because of missed deadlines or lackluster content.",
    "\u201cIt is a risk,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome games can very much become all things to all people. We have this with Elite Odyssey as well, where people expect every ship interior to be different. Let\u2019s see how Bethesda does. I don\u2019t want to be criticizing them. I think they\u2019re a very good company but I do think they\u2019ve gone live so early that they\u2019ve got their work cut out. That\u2019s the truth of it.\u201d",
    "With games like Starfield garnering so much attention, does Braben feel a sense of achievement at being the first to plant a flag into the ground?",
    "\u201cI think there is an element of right time, right place but I\u2019m pleased we stuck to our guns,\u201d Braben says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize because we were so different. We held onto that difference. All I would ask is for people to be ambitious. Go a long way further if you can. I applaud game companies that do that and I think Starfield has a very good chance of doing that.\u201d"
