    "Owners of small businesses looking for tools to help their trade succeed should have a quality laptop at the top of their list. Keeping an eye on business logistics, effectively dealing with streams of inevitable paperwork, and creating and managing marketing content for customers are all things business owners need to be able to do, and a good laptop will give you the ability to do all of that and more.

This makes them easy to take with you no matter where you have to go, and you can use them on pretty much any surface.",
    "While there are many awesome laptops out there, there\u2019s nothing better suited for business owners than HP Intel Evo devices.

    "Next up is Wi-Fi 6, which is the latest Wi-Fi standard. Compared to the previous generation of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6 networks have better speed, higher stability, and farther range. Additionally, Wi-Fi 6 networks strain the battery of devices connected to them less as well. Each HP Intel Evo device is fully compatible with Wi-Fi 6, so if you\u2019ve got a Wi-Fi 6 router, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the best wireless internet available with these laptops.",
    "The fun doesn\u2019t stop at Wi-Fi 6, though. Another fantastic feature of HP Intel Evo laptops is that they feature Thunderbolt 4 ports, which recently superseded Thunderbolt 3 as the ultimate connectivity port for various accessories and peripheral devices. Thunderbolt 4 allows the user to transfer data to and from storage devices at a rate of 40Gb (gigabits) per second, which is blazing fast. You can also use these ports for 100W charging, which results in incredibly speedy recharges. Another excellent feature of Thunderbolt 4 is the ability to hook up to two 4K displays to your device, which is awesome if you want to use your laptop in a workstation-style environment on occasion. Thunderbolt 4 also supports longer cables than Thunderbolt 3 did, which means that you\u2019ll have more flexibility when setting up docking stations and other peripherals.",

    "If you\u2019re looking to save as much money as possible or you just need something that performs excellently for general business productivity, go with the HP ENVY x360.

    "Business owners that want to maximize power or work with more intensive tasks such as media editing should opt for either the 13-inch or 14-inch variant of the HP Spectre x360. This device is a little pricier than the ENVY, but makes up for it by offering better performance, luxurious display options, and an overall design that screams \u201cpremium.\u201d The 13-inch version is ideal if you\u2019d prefer something as small as possible, while the 14-inch version is great for people who like having a larger display."
