    "Sony\u2019s latest PS5 system update delivers a number of pleasing changes that vastly improve the overall user experience. From expanding the internal storage with an SSD for PS5 to vertical Trophy lists, I\u2019ve been testing out a beta version of the system update for the past few days \u2013 and I must admit, many of the qualms I had with the PS5\u2019s UI have mostly been resolved.",
    "But what I didn\u2019t expect this new system update to dramatically improve was the PS5 Sony Pulse 3D Wireless Headset. In fact, it makes such a difference that I believe anyone who owns Sony\u2019s official PS5 headset will greatly benefit, and it means I can now strongly recommend the Pulse 3D to those who might be considering picking up a PS5 headset in the future. And that wasn\u2019t previously the case.",
    "I\u2019d purchased the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset in the past on a whim, only to send it back due to the headset\u2019s volume being frustratingly quiet. This isn\u2019t just a problem related to Sony\u2019s official headset, though: I\u2019ve consistently found that headsets are quieter overall on PS5 compared to the likes of Xbox Series X and PC, which can make some headsets more difficult to drive, and often leaves me wanting more \u201coomph\u201d from certain cans when gaming.",
    "My initial first impressions of the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset were exactly the same as before: it was painfully quiet, even when listening at max volume, which meant that games like Resident Evil Village and Returnal sounded far more muted than I would have liked.",
    "After finding the new equalizer presets, which can be found by going to \u2018Sound\u2019 in the PS5\u2019s Control Center, the EQ presets available include \u2018Standard\u2019, \u2018Bass Boost\u2019, \u2018Shooter\u2019 and three customizable slots called \u2018Audio Mode\u2019. After flicking between Bass Boost and Shooter, one thing immediately stood out: the headset was noticeably louder. However, it wasn\u2019t as dramatic as I\u2019d like, which led me to creating my own Audio Mode preset.",
    "What followed was a slight Eureka moment.",
    "While I\u2019d never usually commit the cardinal sin of sliding every EQ band up to max, the PS5\u2019s equalizer doesn\u2019t really impact the headset\u2019s sound signature as clearly as the Xbox Wireless Headset\u2019s EQ does. But what it does do is significantly increase the volume of the headset whenever you raise each slider. And that\u2019s proven to be a game changer.",
    "After settling on a V-shaped style EQ, which essentially helps to boost the low and high-end frequencies, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s helped bring some of my favorite PS5 games to life in the audio department, particularly those with native 3D Audio support. More importantly, there\u2019s the flexibility to lower and raise the volume depending on the game I\u2019m playing without maxing out.",
    "The combination of being able to tailor the frequencies of the 3D Pulse Headset as well as it resulting in a much-needed boost to overall volume has suddenly made Sony\u2019s official headset my go-to cans for gaming on PS5. Resident Evil Village can now make the hairs on my neck stand on end with its chilling audio, and I can pick out threats in Returnal far easier simply using sound alone. Switching back to the \u2018Standard\u2019 EQ only serves to outline just how damn quiet Sony\u2019s cans were before.",
    "One caveat that\u2019s worth mentioning, though, is that bass is still pretty limited on the 3D Pulse Headset, particularly compared to the eardrum thumping lows that the Xbox Wireless Headset can provide. The new EQ won\u2019t fundamentally change that, however, I\u2019ve found that spatial audio benefits most when the higher end frequencies aren\u2019t drowned out by too much low-end. So ultimately, that isn\u2019t a deal breaker for me.",
    "Sony\u2019s system update brings more pleasing changes to PS5 owners, but if you care about 3D audio and have lamented the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset\u2019s subpar volume level, things are about to get a lot louder in the near future."
