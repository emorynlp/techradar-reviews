  "article": [
    "Apple\u2019s Mac mini with the M1 processor has run into a pretty weird sounding bug, where pink squares (or pixels) appear on the monitor screen it\u2019s connected to for no apparent reason.",
    "Apple is aware of this problem, and indeed investigating the cause of the issue, according to an internal memo sent to service providers (as reported by MacRumors).",
    "As the report notes, the problem with pink squares popping up on an external display has been complained about across not just the MacRumors forum in the past \u2013 since the new M1-powered Mac mini was launched, in fact \u2013 but also elsewhere online such as Reddit and Apple\u2019s own support forum. The intruding squares may be more prevalent when using an HDMI cable rather than Thunderbolt.",
    "There are also scattered reports of green squares (see this Reddit thread) or even black ones, as well as the pink squares (or dots). Swapping out to another HDMI cable doesn\u2019t appear to make a difference, although changing your wallpaper might, at least going by other reports.",
    "Sadly, the Apple memo doesn\u2019t give us any clue as to when a fix might be expected, but seeing as the Mac maker is seemingly aware of the issue, we can keep our fingers crossed that a solution might be delivered in the near future.",
    "What Apple did provide, though, was a (rather clunky) workaround to banish the squares, which is as follows:",
    "This is seemingly a temporary fix, as Apple notes if the squares or dots make their presence known again, users should simply repeat the above steps. Which will obviously get a bit tiresome \u2013 so once again, let\u2019s hope the fix is inbound sooner rather than later.",
    "Trying the other mentioned potential workaround of changing wallpaper is clearly worth a shot, too, and represents a far more convenient countermeasure \u2013 if it works, that is."
