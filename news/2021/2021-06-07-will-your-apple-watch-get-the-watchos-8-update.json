  "summary": "An upgrade for (almost) everyone",
  "article": [
    "Apple\u2019s big annual software show \u2013 WWDC 2021 \u2013 is under way, and the keynote speech was packed full of big announcements, including watchOS 8, which is set to come with all sorts of updates. These include a new Mindfulness app (which replaces the Breathe app), new activity types in the Workout app, and a whole lot more.",
    "So if you\u2019ve got an Apple Watch strapped to your wrist you might understandably be wondering whether you\u2019ll be eligible for the update.",
    "The short answer is probably, as Apple is making watchOS 8 available to every device that can run watchOS 7 \u2013 meaning the Apple Watch 3 and above.",
    "Specifically then if you have an Apple Watch 3, Apple Watch 4, Apple Watch 5, Apple Watch 6, or Apple Watch SE, then you\u2019ll be able to get watchOS 8 when it lands.",
    "That\u2019s good news, and would usually be slightly surprising, as support for the oldest models often drops off with a new annual software release.",
    "That said, this year it\u2019s not so surprising, since Apple still sells the Apple Watch 3, so it would be odd for the company not to support it for a while longer, and would probably also upset anyone who bought the device recently. Still, the Apple Watch 3\u2019s days are surely numbered, and we\u2019d be surprised if it gets watchOS 9 next year.",
    "As for when you\u2019ll be able to get watchOS 8, you\u2019ve likely got a while to wait, as although it has been announced, based on past form it probably won\u2019t be released in finished form until September, probably alongside the Apple Watch 7, which is sure to run watchOS 8 out of the box.",
    "In the meantime there's a developer beta from today (June 7), and that will be followed by a public beta in July. But both of those could prove buggy and unstable, so in general we\u2019d recommend waiting."
