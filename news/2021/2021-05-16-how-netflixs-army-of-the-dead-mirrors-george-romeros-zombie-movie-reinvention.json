    "Army of the Dead feels like a homecoming for Zack Snyder. Seventeen years on from his feature film debut \u2013 a 2004 remake of George Romero\u2019s iconic Dawn of the Dead movie \u2013 Snyder returns to his horror roots in his first post-Warner Bros project.",
    "Billed as a zombie-heist film, Army of the Dead is the first of three Netflix projects to which Snyder is tied to \u2013 and it\u2019s one that draws big parallels with Romero\u2019s influential zombie back catalog.",
    "Ahead of the film\u2019s launch on May 21, TechRadar sat down with Snyder and its cast to discuss how Army of the Dead, like Romero\u2019s works, reimagines the zombie genre through its social commentary. We also find out what inspired Army of the Dead\u2019s creation, and the reasons that audiences might sympathize with the movie\u2019s undead hordes.",
    "Set in the aftermath of a Las Vegas-based zombie outbreak, Army of the Dead follows Scott Ward (Dave Bautista), a retired zombie war hero who is approached by casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) with an intriguing proposition. The task? Complete a mission into the zombie-infested city to retrieve $200 million from one of Tanaka\u2019s casino vaults, and Ward will earn $50 million as his reward.",
    "Ward agrees to Tanaka\u2019s proposal, and assembles a team of specialists including fellow ex-soldiers Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) and Maria Cruz (Ana de la Reguera), prolific safe-cracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer), a zombie expert and Las Vegas guide known as the Coyote (Nora Arnezeder) and helicopter pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro).",
    "However, when the group is unexpectedly joined by Ward\u2019s daughter Kate (Ella Purnell) and Tanaka\u2019s Head of Security Martin (Garret Dillahunt) with mysterious assignments of their own, survival \u2013 not money \u2013 becomes their number one priority.",
    "Army of the Dead is Snyder\u2019s first non-superhero movie since 2014\u2019s 300: Rise of an Empire, but it\u2019s an idea he\u2019s had for some time. A concept born during his time on Dawn of the Dead, Snyder had initially hired writer Joby Harolds to pen a script ahead of his project\u2019s original March 2007 announcement. However, a plethora of problems, including a costly budget, put paid to those plans and the project was put on ice.",
    "With his Warner Bros commitments ending with 2017\u2019s Justice League \u2013 this year\u2019s Snyder Cut of the same movie aside \u2013 Snyder\u2019s search for his next venture eventually led him back to the idea he conceived years earlier.",
    "In a sense, it\u2019s poetic that Snyder would resuscitate a movie about the undead over a decade later. As he explains, though, his original vision for the film hasn\u2019t dramatically changed in the intervening years, save for one personal alteration.",
    "\u201cWhen I sat down with [screenwriter] Shay Hatten, I told him \u2018Let\u2019s not read the old script\u2019, Snyder recalls. \u201cI said \u2018Let me tell you the idea and we\u2019ll just do it from scratch\u2019. It [the general idea] hasn\u2019t changed that much, but it [the script] has become enthused with who we are right now. Scott and Kate\u2019s relationship, for example, has changed because my relationship with my kids has changed.\u201d",
    "Reinventing zombies isn\u2019t a new concept to the genre. Similar movies, such as Romero\u2019s Land of the Dead or Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, have introduced intelligent and athletic zombies respectively to the genre in order to increase the threat that the undead pose to humans.",
    "To differentiate itself from movies that have come before, Army of the Dead approaches its zombies from an emotional perspective. Army of the Dead embraces the genre\u2019s standard, slow-moving zombies \u2013 referred to as shamblers by Ward and company \u2013 but it also establishes a new breed of zombie that displays emotion.",
    "Enter the alphas: fast, strong, intelligent and emoting zombies who, in the confines of the walled-off Las Vegas, rein over the city\u2019s undead hordes. The formation of a zombie society, not dissimilar to our own or those seen in family-oriented animals, is borne out of this hierarchical approach, and gives Army of the Dead\u2019s zombies a personable feel.",
    "In combining their human appearance with the pack-based mannerisms of wolves and lions, Snyder believes that audiences will empathize with the movie\u2019s alpha zombies, despite their dangerous nature.",
    "\u201cZombies don\u2019t usually have a consciousness and are hard to connect to,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut, in this case, I really wanted them to have this emotion. I treated them like pack animals, who nuzzle each other [to reaffirm their emotional bonds]. I felt that, if I could have the audience feel sympathy or connect to the zombies, then I would have succeeded [with that approach].\u201d",
    "As well as its zombie-centric plot and action-packed sequences, Army of the Dead is a thematically dense movie. Its examination of political and societal issues \u2013 such as immigration and misogyny \u2013 is timely, given how often they appear in the current news cycle.",
    "In the same way that Romero\u2019s Dawn of the Dead was a satirical critique of consumer culture and capitalism, or Train to Busan explored class divide, Army of the Dead\u2019s creative team sought to address these subjects in a sensitive manner \u2013 and they certainly left their mark on the film\u2019s cast.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s humbling to add to conversations that are often had in a very persistent and consistent way on social media,\u201d Hardwick says. \u201cYou have that commentary in a movie because this is the era where we have to be there for each other globally. For us to say \u2018Hey, we\u2019re gonna search this stuff, even if we have to put apple sauce around this medicine we\u2019re getting people to digest with cool shots, action moments and a diverse cast\u2019, that\u2019s pretty powerful.\u201d",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s not a cliched zombie movie,\u201d Arnezeder muses. \u201cIt criticizes a lot of important topics in our society, such as refugees and social identity, and I think the best thing about making art is taking risks, which this does. It\u2019s very visual and poetic [in that sense], and makes for a profound story.\u201d",
    "Family is also a core theme at the movie\u2019s heart. While Ward\u2019s group has a familial feel to it, despite their varying nationalities and backgrounds, it\u2019s the relationship between Scott and Kate that drives particular theme forward. For reasons we won\u2019t spoil, the duo\u2019s father-daughter bond is dysfunctional at best. Scott and Kate regularly butt heads, and it\u2019s these emotionally charged scenes that specifically challenged Bautista.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m not the most seasoned actor and I don\u2019t have a theatrical background,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when you\u2019re in those scenes, it can be exhausting. This film is the first where I had to go through multiple emotions in a very short time, but I want these types of roles so I can stretch myself.\u201d",
    "Army of the Dead brings Snyder\u2019s career full circle following his Dawn of the Dead remake, but his filmmaking work is far from over. Next up for the writer-director are two Army of the Dead spin-offs for Netflix \u2013 Army of Thieves and Lost Vegas \u2013 that will explore the backstories of certain characters in more detail.",
    "Similar to Romero\u2019s zombie films, which equally act as character studies, Snyder ultimately views Army of the Dead as a character-led movie. The influence of Romero\u2019s works on multiple aspects of his latest project are evident, then \u2013 and, in Snyder\u2019s own view, had as big an impact on Army of the Dead as his other filmmaking experiences did.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s funny how the emotional part of the movie is its centerpiece,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cAll of the characters, where they are emotionally, become the movie\u2019s heart. Yeah, it\u2019s a zombie-heist movie, but it\u2019s also a character-led one. I feel like I\u2019ve evolved since Dawn of the Dead, and the movie has become more important to me than it was 15 years ago.\u201d",
    "Army of the Dead launches on Netflix on Friday, May 21."
