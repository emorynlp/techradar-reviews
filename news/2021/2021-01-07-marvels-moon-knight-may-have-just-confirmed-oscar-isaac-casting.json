    "Moon Knight cinematographer Gregory Middleton has seemingly confirmed that Oscar Isaac will be donning the white cape of Marvel\u2019s titular hero in the upcoming Disney Plus series.",
    "In a recent Instagram post, Middleton wrote: \u201cWell the secret is out. It\u2019s an honor to be a part of introducing a new character to the MCU #MoonKnight,\u201d describing Oscar Isaac \u2013 who was tagged in the post \u2013 as an \u201camazing performer.\"",
    "The post all but confirms Isaac will portray the lead role as Marc Spector, the lesser-known superhuman crimefighter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe whose powers are granted by the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. The 41-year-old actor had been widely reported to front the series, with Keanu Reeves also rumoured to be in contention for the lead role.",
    "Middleton\u2019s comments also confirm that the character\u2019s signature white cape will feature in the show \u2013 \u201cWho says cinematographers worry about white costumes!\u201d \u2013 though this was perhaps more of a foregone conclusion than Isaac\u2019s casting. Still, it\u2019s good to see Disney sticking to the source material.",
    "Marvel\u2019s Moon Knight series is one of a lot of MCU projects bound for the streaming service in 2021. WandaVision is just around the corner, set to premiere on Disney Plus starting January 15, before The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, She-Hulk, Ms. Marvel and Hawkeye all make their way to the platform later on in the year.",
    "Marvel's Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige had previously suggested that both She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel would wrap production in 2020, but Covid-19 restrictions meant filming was halted for most of its projects \u2013 meaning its release slate has gone a little awry.",
    "Moon Knight was first announced at D23 way back in August 2019, so there\u2019s no telling when to expect it\u2019s arrival on Disney Plus \u2013 given that Isaac\u2019s casting as the lead has only just been announced (and still unofficially, mind), it\u2019s not likely to be any time soon. Still, it looks like there\u2019ll be enough Marvel to go around until then."
