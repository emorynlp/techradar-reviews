    "If you\u2019re after a new Samsung TV this year, there are plenty of options to choose from. That\u2019s par for the course for Samsung, which, as the world\u2019s biggest TV maker, has a wide variety of screens from low-spec 4K displays to dazzling 8K behemoths. But if you\u2019re opting for a 4K QLED TV, there\u2019s a chance you may not get what you\u2019re after.",
    "The Samsung QN85A and Q80A QLED TVs are similar in name, but very distinct in their specification \u2013 and you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re not opting for a model that doesn\u2019t offer what you need.",
    "So what are the differences between them? Read on to find out.",
    "The QN85A and Q80A are both QLED TVs in Samsung\u2019s 2021 TV range. That \u2018QLED\u2019 moniker stands for \u2018quantum dot light emitting diode\u2019, referring to the quantum dot filter used to enhance contrast in the display. Samsung tends to package together its better, more premium processors and TV technologies in its QLED televisions, too.",
    "These televisions sit next to each other in the 2021 range, meaning that the QN85A is the step-up model from the Q80A \u2013 and they do have a lot in common. The problem is that Samsung used to name its sets a bit differently, with 2020's Q95T, for instance, being an alternate version of the Q90T that came with the One Connect Box. The \u201880\u2019 and \u201885\u2019 terminology here, though, doesn\u2019t do the same thing at all.",
    "The main difference to note is in the Mini LED backlight that Samsung has brought to a number of its 2021 models. Mini LED tech packs in tens of thousands of tiny LEDs for precise brightness control and superior contrast, and it\u2019s worth getting it in your QLED TV if you can \u2013 if the QN95A we reviewed is anything to go by.",
    "You can tell which Samsung TVs have a Mini LED backlight by their name: so-called \u2018Neo QLED\u2019 models starting \u2018QN\u2019 have it, and regular QLED models starting with just \u2018Q\u2019 don\u2019t.",
    "To go with this improved backlight, Neo QLED models like the QN85A also feature an advanced Neo Quantum Processor 4K, rather than the Quantum Processor 4K used in the Q80A. You are getting the same level of motion smoothing technology, though a more limited Direct Full Array backlight on the step-down model.",
    "Both feature the same 60W audio across a 2.2.2 channel sound system, and you\u2019ll benefit from HDMI 2.1 ports on both sets too.",
    "Only the QN85A of the two ships with the Slim One Connect Box, also.",
    "Both of these QLED TVs come in the same spread of 55-inch, 65-inch, 75-inch and 85-inch sizes, meaning there aren\u2019t any options for those after a smaller screen.",
    "The Q80A starts at $1,299 / \u00a31,399 / AU$2,295 for a 55-inch size, whereas the high-spec QN85A starts at $1,599 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,895 for the same size.",
    "That uptick in price scales with the other sizes, too. The Q80A will set you back $1,699 / \u00a31,999 / AU$2,995 for the 65-inch, $2,599 / \u00a32,799 for the 75-inch, and $3,699 for the 85-inch at launch. (The largest two sizes aren\u2019t listed in Australia.)",
    "The QN85A Neo QLED, meanwhile, costs $2,199 / \u00a32,499 / AU$3,795 for the 65-inch, $2,999 / \u00a33,799 / AU$4,495 for the 75-inch, and $4,499 / AU$6,495 (around \u00a33,200) for the 85-inch.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that both are available for pre-order in the US (to arrive by April 8) and Australia (releasing March 25), and set to launch in the UK imminently too.",
    "Both of these QLED TVs should offer a capable picture and high specification compared to the average 4K TV. The only QLED TVs you should avoid are those with edge-lit panels that can\u2019t reach the consistent brightness of Direct Full Array (like the Q80A) or Mini LED backlights (like the QN85A).",
    "In our review of the Mini LED-sporting QN95A \u2013 this year\u2019s flagship Samsung 4K TV \u2013 we said that \u201cThe results speak for themselves, with superb SDR and HDR images that benefit from deep blacks and brighter highlights, all of which are delivered without blooming or loss of shadow detail.\u201d",
    "As ever, opting for the more expensive model should net you a better picture, then. But that means the Q80A is the top QLED TV without Mini LED, and you should still get a capable performance \u2013 especially as last year\u2019s Q80T QLED was one of our favorite screens and best gaming TVs, offering a lot of premium specs at a semi-reasonable price."
