  "summary": "Here are the top Hisense TVs of 2021 you need to know about",
  "article": [
    "Hisense might not be the first brand you think of when it comes to the best TVs. But over the past few years, it\u2019s made a name for itself by bringing out a range of TVs that pack in a lot of the latest tech for aggressively competitive prices.",
    "Each year, the brand has brought out TVs that are cheaper alternatives to many of the displays from bigger brands, but with similar specifications. So what did Hisense bring us in 2021?",
    "Throughout 2021, Hisense has released a wide selection of TVs, including Laser TVs, like the Hisense 100L5 Laser TV; 8K TVs, such as the Hisense U80G ULED 8K TV; experimental Dual Cell models, and plenty of entry-level 4Ks all the way through the year for those on a smaller budget, including the Hisense U6GR ULED TV in the US or the Hisense U7QF QLED TV in the UK.",
    "If that sounds like an exciting mix of TVs to choose from, that's because it is. Hisense has a lot of range and although it's mostly known for offering value LCD screens at aggressive price points, in 2021 it released several high-spec models that are well worth your time, too.",
    "This combination has lured plenty of shoppers to Hisense, with the company ranking fifth overall for TV sales in the US in 2021. And it\u2019s quickly growing, largely thanks to the fantastic value across the entire Hisense range.",
    "In our guide below, we\u2019ll round-up the TVs that Hisense has brought out in 2021, from entry-level 4K displays for those on a budget through to the latest Laser TVs that bring the big screen cinema experience to your living room.",
    "If you\u2019re not sure this brand is for you, check out our should I buy a Hisense TV guide, which helps you decide based on recent Hisense TV reviews.",
    "Hisense U9DG Dual Cell Series (75-inch only): This is Hisense's high-end, flagship TV and it comes with a big price tag, but it may be justified. Hisense has been teasing its Dual Cell technology for a few years now, pairing together a 4K grayscale screen with an HD 'luminance layer' for enhanced contrast and color \u2013 in a similar fashion to the quantum dot layer of its QLED TVs, perhaps, but with significantly different underlying technology.",
    "The Hisense U9DG features two million local dimming zones, which on paper is a big step up from the tens of thousands of dimming zones on the latest Mini LED TVs \u2013 even if it pales in comparison to the per-pixel lighting of OLED screens. You'll get a 120Hz panel, up to 1,000 nits peak brightness, as well as a host of gaming features such as VRR, ALLM, FreeSync, and \"high-speed HDMI ports\" (which we hope refers to HDMI 2.1, for next-gen gaming capabilities).",
    "Read our review here: Hisense U9DG Dual Cell Android TV (75U9DG) review",
    "Hisense U800GR 8K ULED (75-inch only): The U800GR is Hisense's debut 8K TV, packing in 33 million pixels as well as the beloved Roku smart TV platform and AI upscaling. It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos too, and also 1,000 nits peak brightness \u2013 not as bright as new Samsung TVs, certainly, but a pinch higher than today's best OLED TVs. We reviewed the model when it soft-launched in Australia as the U80G, and we liked it very much indeed, praising the upscaling and functionality (even if the sound left a little to be desired).",
    "Hisense U8G ULED (available in 55, 65-inch): Other mid-range models include the Hisense U8G ULED, with 1,500 nits brightness, 4K resolution, Dolby Vision IQ (for calibrating brightness in response to ambient light), Dolby Vision and an anti-glare screen.",
    "We awarded the Hisense U8G Android TV (65U8G) 4 out of 5 stars when we first reviewed it for its exceptional picture quality and great value for money.",
    "Hisense U7G ULED gaming TV (available in 55, 65, 75-inch sizes): There's also a gamer-specific model called the Hisense U7G, with a 4K display and 120Hz panel, as well as HDMI 2.1, VRR, ALLM and Freesync Premium for high-spec video passthrough and anti-screen-tearing technologies.",
    "Hisense U6G and U6GR ULED TV (available in 50, 55, 65, 75-inch sizes): The Hisense U6G is the lowest specified model in the new 4K TV lineup, making do with a 60Hz panel and 600 nits peak brightness, though it does pack in full array local dimming (rather than edge lighting) as well as Dolby Vision / Dolby Atmos format support.",
    "We reviewed the Hisense U6G ULED TV in 2021 and awarded it 4 out of 5 stars for its excellent image quality and affordable price.",
    "In November 2021, Hisense released the U6GR ULED TV in 55-inch and 65-inch variants but only at Costco in the US, meaning that you'll need to be a Costco member in order to purchase the new TV.",
    "Hisense A6G, R6 and R7 smart TVs (sizes from 43-inch to 75-inch): Some lower-spec models are also on their way, with the 'R' series sets presumably coming with the Roku TV OS, and the budget 'A' budget model starting at a meagre $299 for those a bit more strapped for cash. You can expect cheap processing, and we'd advise to opt for smaller sizes for screens this cheap, so as not to make any visual issues too glaring \u2013 but they offer a more accessible starting point than a lot of the more premium models above.",
    "Hisense L5F Laser Cinema (100, 120-inch): Hisense's projector-TV hybrid is still here, with up to 120-inch projection and 4K images on a paired projector screen, running on the Android TV platform. It is pricey (you may want to opt for a high-end projector like the Samsung Premiere for this amount of cash) but it's there for those wanting to be at the forefront of new, experimental AV technologies.",
    "Hisense U9GQ (75-inch only): This is Hisense\u2019s flagship TV for 2021 and the brand promises it offers \u201cdetailed, exquisite and lifelike images\u201d. It has a 75-inch Mini LED display with a high refresh rate of 120Hz. It\u2019s packed with 10,000 LED backlight units and has Full Array Local Dimming Pro, which means it can achieve an impressive brightness of 3,000 nits. It offers Quantum Dot Colour, which Hisense says delivers \u201cover 1 billion true-to-life colours\u201d and HDR10+ and Dolby Vision adjusts images based on what you\u2019re watching to give you the best experience.",
    "Hisense 100L5 Laser TV (available in 88 and 100-inch sizes): Built to be big and bold, Hisense's range of Laser TVs aren't like your average TV. This much becomes obvious as soon as you clock the fact that they give you a massive 88 and 100-inch screen sizes for less money than many regular 75-inch TVs.",
    "The main reason it can offer so many inches for your buck is that it\u2019s not strictly speaking a TV. Rather it\u2019s an ultra-short throw projector combined with a rigid projection screen that\u2019s designed to reject ambient light, so that you don\u2019t have to black your room out every time you want to watch it.",
    "The projector is a DLP affair illuminated by laser lighting, meaning that it can go brighter and reach a wider range of colors than regular lamp projectors. It also won\u2019t need its laser replacing in the course of its lifetime unlike lamp projectors, and also unlike regular projectors can be switched more or less immediately, without significant warmup or cool down time.",
    "We reviewed the Hisense 100L5 Laser TV, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars for its bright, colourful picture and great value for money. Hisense's Laser TV range also includes the 100-inch Hisense L9.",
    "Hisense A9G (available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes): A new OLED TV from Hisense, the A9G is available in 55-inches and 65-inches. Thanks to HDR10+ and Dolby Vision IQ, there\u2019s excellent picture quality on offer here, as well as brightness with up to 1,000 nits at peak brightness. With IMAX Enhanced licensing, Hisense promises \u201cclearer pictures and brighter images.\u201d And, in terms of audio, you're getting 2.1.2 channel speakers (front-firing) as well as Dolby Atmos support. All of these features make these OLEDs a great idea if you\u2019re looking for a new, very large TV this summer and love watching movies.",
    "Hisense U8GQ (available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes): The U8GQ range features Quantum Dot Colour and Full Array Local Dimming Pro for consistent lighting and precise brightness control. However, Hisense drops the brightness to 1,000 nits for a more affordable \u2013 if less ambitious \u2013 QLED television than its more premium offerings. It also features a Game mode, as well as the same IMAX Enhanced certification of the A9G.",
    "Hisense A7GQ series (available in 43-inch, 50-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch, 75-inch sizes): There are a few different mid-range TVs coming from Hisense this summer, including the A7GQ series. This TV comes in a range of different sizes and offers a 4K HDR display and 60Hz panel. It also has Quantum Dot, 4K HDR and Dolby Vision and Atmos built-in with a 60Hz refresh rate.",
    "Hisense E76GQ series (available in 50-inch and 55-inch sizes): Another mid-range TV option from Hisense, this time available in only mid-sized 50-inch and 55-inch sizes. The E76GQ series is similar to the A7GQ with a 4K HDR display and 60Hz panel along with support for 4K HDR content, as well as Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.",
    "Hisense A6G series (available in 43-inch, 50-inch, 55-inch, 58-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes): If you\u2019re looking for a smaller range of sizes, the entry-level A6G series might be the best bet. This TV supports 4K content, has a 60Hz MEMC, Dolby Vision and DTS:Virtual:X audio to boot.",
    "Hisense A4G series (available in 32-inch and 40-inch sizes): For the smallest (and cheapest) Hisense on offer in summer 2021, the A4G series has DTS:Virtual:X audio and the VIDAA U5 Smart OS.",
    "Now we know all of the new TVs Hisense released in 2021, what technology has the brand been working with that makes it stand out from the competition?",
    "The latest news is all about Dual Cell. This is a proprietary panel technology that pairs a 4K grayscale display with a 'luminance layer' to add color to proceedings. It's certainly a curious idea, and since Hisense ditched OLED after the pretty disastrous Hisense O8B, this seems to be its next big bet. It's leaning into 8K resolution displays too with the new U80G 8K ULED, which is certainly a promising debut and may well pave the way for more 8K screens in future Hisense ranges.",
    "Hisense also has big plans for its recently released laser TV range, saying that the tech is the future of home entertainment, calling it a \u201cmore natural way for human eyes\u201d to watch TV, with reduced amounts of red light to contend with, alongside greater energy efficiency \u2013 with reportedly 40% less energy consumption than LCD sets of the same size.",
    "In 2019, sales of laser TVs grew 107% in China, making it the fastest-growing TV category in the country. However, it\u2019s always easier to increase a small number of sales than a large one, and there just isn't the sample size or mass market penetration to confidently say where laser TVs are going.",
    "Hisense appears to be sticking with laser tech with its L5F model for 2021, which keeps the 120-inch projection of previous models but at a (slightly) lower price point of $4,999 (rather than $5,999), suggesting it should become more affordable over time. Then there are the L5 laser TVs in the UK, which bring the same tech to 88 and 100-inch sizes.",
    "Although lots of the Hisense TV tech seems flashy, and erm, laser-y, there are some more mundane developments regarding smart platforms that may hold the most promise for the TV maker \u2013 with more sets using the brilliant Roku OS, also found on streaming devices like the Roku Express and Roku Premiere.",
    "Hisense tends to use Android TV for the interface on its more budget TVs, and its own propriety Vidaa U platform for fancier sets that carry more of the weight of the Hisense brand \u2013 the latter is pretty zippy, even if there are a few odd blind spots around picture settings and screensavers.",
    "You'll find both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ HDR formats on these TVs, too, and Hisense tends to pack them into more mid-priced sets than some of the competition.",
    "L5 Series (available in 100 inches): First up, there's the L5 Laser TV. This is the follow-up to 2018\u2019s L10E, retaining the same innovative form factor that teams a display screen with an ultra-short throw projector for precise image control.",
    "The L5 is slightly dimmer than the previous model, at 2,600 lumens rather than the L10E\u2019s 3,000 lumens, and uses a simpler Android TV smart platform rather than Hisense\u2019s Vidaa U interface, as well as a smaller color gamut, but the reduced cost should compensate for the slight drop in performance.",
    "XD9G Series (available in 65 inches): We\u2019ll also see another ULED set, the XD9G ULED, making use of Hisense\u2019s Dual Cell panel, which fuses a 2K and 4K panel together for enhanced contrast, and boasts \u2018rival contrast\u2019 to OLED at a lower price. We\u2019ll have to see if the XD9G ULED (the \u2018XD\u2019 stands for \u2018extreme detail\u2019) can meet those standards when it releases in late 2020.",
    "H9G Quantum Series (available in 55, 65 inches): Hisense\u2019s H Series of ULEDs will get some new models, with a H9G Quantum follow-up to the H9F.",
    "H8G Quantum Series (available in 50, 55, 65, 75 inches): There's also an H8G successor to the H8F, with similar \u2018quantum\u2019 contrast tech.",
    "H65G Series (available in 43, 50, 55, 65, 75, 85 inches): Later in the year we'll see the H65G: a less advanced 4K models with the Android smart platform and without ULED enhancements. The \u201865\u2019 confusingly don\u2019t refer to screens sizes, though.",
    "H55G Series (available in 32, 43 inches): A downgrade to the above, with a 2K screen and more compact sizing options, for those with smaller needs.",
    "Hisense R8F Roku TV (available in 55, 65 inches): Dolby Atmos enabled 4K TV with Roku operating system. Retailing for $499 for the 55-inch and $699 for the 65-inch.",
    "Hisense U8QF ULED (available in 55, 65 inches): The charge is being led by the U8QF, which Hisense is calling its \"flagship model\" for 2020. It's predictable a ULED TV \u2013 Hisense's premium TV label \u2013 which packs in a quantum dot filter for enhanced contrast, as well as support for HDR10+, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR.",
    "The distinguishing feature, though, is a front-firing JBL speaker, which is built into the television itself. The U8QF is retailing at \u00a31,099 for the 55-inch and \u00a31,699 for the 65-inch size.",
    "Hisense U7QF ULED (available in 50, 55, 65 inches): The Dolby Atmos-enabled U7QF, for one, will come in 50-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch sizes, though currently only the 55-inch model is currently on sale \u2013 for \u00a3899. Expect the same HDR support as above, but without the built-in JBL speaker.",
    "Hisense A7500F (available in 43, 50 inches): Another Dolby Vision HDR TV, coming with DTS Virtual: X technology for clearer dialogue output, as well as a dedicated Game Mode \u2013 which keeps input lag under 20ms. Starting at just \u00a3449 for a 43-inch model.",
    "Hisense AE7400F (available in 43, 50, 55, 65 inches): An iteration on the above, with DTS Virtual: X but not the Game Mode. \u00a3599 for a 55-inch model, and \u00a3899 for 65-inch. Expect HDR10+ and Dolby Vision both to be supported.",
    "Hisense A7300F (available in 43, 50, 55 inches): A 4K TV with a dedicated Sports Mode and built-in Alexa. Pricing not yet confirmed.",
    "Hisense A7100F (available in 58, 70, 75 inches): Equivalent specs to above. Pricing not yet confirmed.",
