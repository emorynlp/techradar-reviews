    "We're very used to being burnt on the Black Friday Apple Watch, as they're rarely very good - you'd be lucky to get $100 off one of the older wearables or even $30 off a newer one. But there's a big exception.",
    "The Apple Watch 5 from 2019 has a massive $290 discount - that's 39% of its cost - in this fantastic Black Friday deal. Sure, it's still a pretty expensive smartwatch even with the reduction, but certainly less so than before.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for Black Friday Apple Watch deals in your region).",
    "This Apple Watch 5 deal is on the smaller 40mm version, with cellular connection and a fancy Milanese Loop band.",
    "Sure, it's a two-year-old Apple Watch, so if you need the newest and flashiest tech it's not your best bet.",
    "Plus, you could probably pick up the Apple Watch 5 cheaper if you didn't want the Milanese Loop or cellular connection, as these two features bump up the price, but other versions don't have the $290 discount.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the best Black Friday Apple Watch 5 deals from around the web below, with offers available in your region."
