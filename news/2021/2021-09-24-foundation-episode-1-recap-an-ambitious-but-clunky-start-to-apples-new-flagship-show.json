    "Spoilers follow for Foundation episode 1. Watch it first before reading on.",
    "Apple TV Plus has been a surprise offering during the intensifying streaming war. Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video have dominated in recent years, but Apple has quietly gone about building a back catalog of top-rated movies and shows \u2013 including the multi-award winning soccer comedy series Ted Lasso.",
    "Now, Foundation, Apple TV Plus\u2019 new flagship show, aims to be the streamer\u2019s most ambitious and potentially successful production yet. Based on Isaac Asimov\u2019s influential sci-fi book series, Foundation is a sprawling, centuries-spanning tale with a unique premise that should appeal to audiences of a space opera disposition.",
    "On the surface, Foundation\u2019s plot sounds like it\u2019ll be easy to follow. It tells the story of The Foundation, a group of outcasts led by mathematical genius Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) and his understudy Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell), who seek to save the Galactic Empire from total destruction.",
    "Claiming that the Empire will endure 30,000 years of darkness and civil wars if it doesn\u2019t change course immediately, Selon and Dornick propose that they can shorten that timespan to 1,000 years if certain criteria are met, including the formation of their Foundation. The Empire\u2019s dictatorial rulers \u2013 led by the narcissistic Brother Day (Lee Pace) \u2013 reluctantly agree. To ensure that the pair\u2019s band of followers doesn\u2019t grow further and threaten to overthrow the Empire\u2019s leaders, though, Brother Day exiles Seldon, Dornick and their disciples to Terminus, a seemingly uninhabitable planet on the outskirts of the galaxy.",
    "So far, so good, right? No exactly. Despite its seemingly straightforward premise, Foundation\u2019s premiere \u2013 called The Emperor\u2019s Peace \u2013 is at-times hard to follow. As viewers, we\u2019re taken on a whistle stop tour of its main players, key locations and story threads (both mainline and subplots) during its 68-minute runtime without pausing for breath, which doesn\u2019t give us much space to process what\u2019s going on or who these characters are.",
    "It feels like the show is rushing to get its most important plot point \u2013 Seldon\u2019s revelation that the Empire is heading for destruction \u2013 without investing enough time to introduce us to anything else. Who are these people? What are their motivations? Where did they come from? Why are they integral to Foundation\u2019s story?",
    "These are questions that are likely to be answered in more detail in future episodes. Given the complexity of Asimov\u2019s novels, too, showrunner David S. Goyer probably had a tough time crafting an opening episode (with a limited runtime) that focuses on the essentials and forgoes additional story elements until later entries.",
    "But we need some reason to invest in Foundation\u2019s setting and characters, and its opening episode doesn\u2019t elaborate on why we should. Its planet hopping and sometimes brief character introductions don\u2019t give the show\u2019s premiere enough room to breathe, or give its poignant scenes, such as Gaal leaving her home world of Synnax to work with Seldon, the emotional depth that they require.",
    "Frustratingly frantic as it is right now, Foundation\u2019s pacing issues should iron themselves out as the series progresses. And, in a sense, it\u2019s hard to fault the show for moving quickly \u2013 like the source material, Foundation aims to span 1,000 years of human history. So it needs to proceed at a rate of knots to get into the meat of its story.",
    "Foundation\u2019s TV adaptation is as wildly ambitious as the book series, too. The sheer scope of the show is highly impressive, particularly from a visual perspective, with key planets such as Trantor brought to life in extraordinary detail. Sure, it\u2019s VFX-heavy, but a show of this scale needs to be. It doesn\u2019t look tacky, either, thanks to some fairly classy art direction, which emboldens Foundation with a sense of realism despite its far future setting.",
    "The magnitude of Foundation also extends to its sizable cast. Goyer previously described it as \u2018Game of Thrones in space\u2019, and the sheer number of characters proves that such a comparison isn\u2019t an absurd one to make. HBO\u2019s live-action take on George R.R. Martin\u2019s fantasy novel series is packed with likeable and detestable characters and, based on its opening episode, Foundation has its fair share of good, bad and morally gray individuals.",
    "Interactions between like-minded individuals, such as Seldon and Dornick, are fairly routine and don\u2019t offer much in the way of suspense. Conversations between those who don\u2019t see eye-to-eye, though, provide plenty of tense moments and, arguably, this is where Foundation shines brightest.",
    "Seeing Seldon and Dornick verbally spar with Brother Day, or the Empire\u2019s prosecutors as they\u2019re tried for treason, makes for entertaining viewing and provides an insight into just how cleverly exploitative they are. Seeing the pair manipulate events in their favor, and sow the seeds of doubt in their adversaries, is riveting and feels very David vs Goliath-esque in its approach.",
    "Day\u2019s interactions with his fellow emperors, too, make for intriguing viewing. Like Day, Brother Dawn (Cooper Carter) and Brother Dusk (Terence Mann) are clones of Emperor Cleon I, the Galactic Empire\u2019s first ruler, so you would suspect that the trio would be in agreement on every decision they make.",
    "And yet they don\u2019t. Despite presenting a united front in public, there\u2019s an immediate underlying tension between them \u2013 the adult Day and Dusk, in particular \u2013 privately. It\u2019s fascinating to watch and, if future episodes continue to explore the potential fracturing of Day and Dusk\u2019s relationship, we\u2019ll be in for a wild ride. Game of Thrones was so initially enthralling because of its similarly strained relationships, so if Goyer hopes that audiences make comparisons between Foundation and HBO\u2019s adaptation, it\u2019ll need plenty of drama throughout its 10-episode run to keep that momentum up.",
    "Speaking of dramatic moments, Foundation\u2019s first episode only has one significant event, but it\u2019s certainly impactful. The destruction of Trantor\u2019s Star Bridge \u2013 which acts as the galaxy\u2019s gateway to its main hubworld \u2013 by supposedly Anacreon and Thespin terrorists is a harrowing watch. We only see a fraction of the destruction and the millions of lives lost but, frankly, what we witness is traumatic enough. If similar chaotic and tragic sequences play out during season 1, Foundation will be an emotionally draining watch.",
    "The Emperor\u2019s Peace is an ambitious if awkward start to Apple TV Plus\u2019 latest big production. It struggles to find a balance between methodically introducing its sizable cast, locations and numerous plot points, and progressing at a pace that doesn\u2019t bog it down.",
    "It tries to run before it can walk and, if you forgive the pun, it doesn\u2019t do as good a job at laying the foundations as it probably could've done. As a result, episode 1 can be hard to follow, particularly if you aren\u2019t familiar with Asimov\u2019s book series.",
    "When it belatedly gets going around the 40-minute mark, though, Foundation\u2019s premiere begins to get interesting. The latter half shows that the series has the potential to be a success and, with many of its cast introductions now out of the way, there should be more room for character development, thematic depth and more stimulating story threads.",
    "There\u2019s enough political intrigue and personality clashes to keep viewers engaged, but Foundation will need to lean further into these areas if it hopes to keep its audience entertained. If episode 2 can find a better equilibrium between its many moving parts, we may be in for a wild ride \u2013 but the jury is still out for now.",
    "New episodes of Foundation debut exclusively on Apple TV Plus every Friday."
