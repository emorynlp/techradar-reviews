    "Windows 10 has an issue with the taskbar, Microsoft has admitted, while letting affected users know that a solution is in the works.",
    "If you\u2019ve been following the news on Windows 10 problems of late, you\u2019ll recall this one popping up with the latest June cumulative update (and the preview version of that batch of patches in late May). It affects those using the May 2021 Update, October 2020 Update and May 2020 Update, plus the November 2019 Update.",
    "Microsoft pinpoints this bug as actually creeping in with KB5001391, the preview update of May\u2019s patching, back in late April, and observes that: \u201cAfter installing KB5001391 or later updates, the news and interests button in the Windows taskbar might have blurry text on certain display configurations.\u201d",
    "The software giant adds: \u201cWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.\u201d",
    "Meantime, the obvious workaround as we\u2019ve discussed before is simply to turn off News and interests on the taskbar (right click the icon for the app \u2013 or an empty bit of the taskbar \u2013 then left click \u2018News and interests\u2019, and select \u2018Turn off\u2019).",
    "What\u2019s interesting here is that while Microsoft has acknowledged the visual corruption of the News and interests icon in some cases, there\u2019s no mention of the other problems which have been reported elsewhere.",
    "That includes the taskbar system tray icons becoming corrupted, or vanishing entirely, seriously impacting the usability of Windows 10. Microsoft hasn\u2019t commented on these other gremlins, but again, if you\u2019re suffering these, simply dumping the \u2018News and interests\u2019 icon is a possible simple cure.",
    "If that doesn\u2019t work for you, other options are to uninstall the cumulative update which caused the problem \u2013 not ideal, obviously \u2013 or you could try moving the taskbar to the top of the screen, as Wccftech (which spotted Microsoft\u2019s announcement) suggests.",
    "Other potential remedies include heading to Settings > System > Display to make sure the option for changing the size of text, apps and other items (under \u2018Scale and layout\u2019) is on \u2018recommended\u2019."
