    "The Major League Baseball playoffs return to their traditional format with the most wide open field in years. This has the makings of an all-time classic October, so read on as we explain how to get a 2021 MLB playoffs live stream and watch every baseball game online - no matter where you are in the world.",
    "Tampa Bay once again bossed the AL and will be desperate to go one better than they managed a year ago, while San Francisco, well... just wow. The Giants bettered the reigning World Series champions by one, notching a ludicrous 107 wins to take top seed in the NL. Those poor old 106-win Dodgers!",
    "But such is the strength of this season's playoffs, that the top seeds aren't necessarily the favorites.",

    "A VPN is becoming an essential bit of kit for baseball fans for two reasons. Firstly, MLB blackout rules mean that you can't use its otherwise comprehensive MLB.TV streaming service to watch teams within your own market - fine for Yankees fans living in Seattle, not so great for those in the Bronx.",
    "It's a real pain for cord-cutters, but fortunately, VPNs help you get around this by allowing you to relocate your IP address to a different location. This means you can still be sitting in your NYC apartment, but your computer will be rerouted to a server in a different part of the country - thereby allowing you to watch the Yankees (or Mets) just like you would if you had a fancy cable package.",
    "Secondly, if you find yourself abroad at all during the 2021 MLB season, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual baseball coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
