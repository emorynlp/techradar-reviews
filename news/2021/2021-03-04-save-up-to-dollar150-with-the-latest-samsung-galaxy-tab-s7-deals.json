    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 is seeing another round of price drops this week. While discounts over the November and December Black Friday deals period did have these tablets a little cheaper, we haven't seen those record lows since, and if you're in need of a tablet fast you'll still find some excellent offers on the tablet right now.",
    "If you're looking to get your hands on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 as soon as possible there are some excellent offers across the S7 and S7 Plus range.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is seeing an excellent $100 discount on its smallest model, bringing the 128GB configuration down to $749.99. However, the best offer sits on the 256GB Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus. For just $50 more than the 128GB model you're doubling your storage and picking up a stunning tablet for an overall $130 discount (now $799, was $929.99). Or, boost that storage even further with a 512GB device reduced by $150 to just $879.99 (was $1,029.99).",
    "However, if you are willing to wait a little there are some even better Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 deals out there. This Navy Blue 256GB model is down to just $569.99 compared to the usual $729.99 MSRP of this configuration. That's a stunning price drop, which makes this larger model the same price as the discounted 128GB version and drops it back to its lowest price ever - though there is a catch. You'll be waiting between one and two months for shipping on this particular deal.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Samsung Galaxy tablet deals in your region.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 comes packed in a slimline 498g chassis and sports an 11-inch LED display at a 1600x2560 resolution and excellent 120Hz refresh rate. You're getting the same Snapdragon 865+ CPU as the S7 Plus model as well, which makes for an excellent snappy response when paired with 6GB RAM. That's all perfect for everyday tablet usage, whether you're streaming, browsing the web, playing games or taking notes.",
    "The main draw for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is that gorgeous AMOLED display. It's a serious upgrade over the LED screen of the base model, and well worth a look if you're after high quality streaming or media editing. You're also getting more screen real estate with a 12.4-inch panel on this model at a resolution of 1752 x 2800. Under the hood you'll find the same brain powering the whole thing, with the Snapdragon 865+ at the helm.",
