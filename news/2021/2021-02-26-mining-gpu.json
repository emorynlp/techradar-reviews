    "Just like picking out any other gear, finding the best mining GPU can be tough, especially since the requirements for cryptocurrency are a little different than something like gaming.",
    "The ideal graphics cards need power and adequate memory to keep up with the demands of mining. But, they can\u2019t be too expensive, which is why a card like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and its sibling, the Nvidia RTX 3060, are great picks. Minimizing costs is just as important if you\u2019re mining with one computer, since you won\u2019t be yielding a lot of cryptocurrency at a time.",
    "The world of cryptocurrency has been explosive in the recent past, which is why there\u2019s so much attention on it. Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins are gaining more traction, which has led to quite a bit of demand for mining graphics cards.",
    "We\u2019ve collected our top picks for the best mining GPUs 2021 has to offer here, balancing power, efficiency and price. That way, you can make the most out of your mining operation and start making back your initial investment.",
    "For other important components, also check out our guides on the best mining CPU, best mining motherboards and best mining SSDs.",
    "Boasting a step up in better performance than the previous generation, is the RTX 2070. At a lower price point, it\u2019s easy to offer some compelling reasons to upgrade to the MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 for gaming, design and content creation. Of course, it\u2019s also among the leaders for the best mining GPUs currently. It has a heatsink designed for better heat dissipation, and Zero Frozr technology which can actually stop the fan in low workloads for less noise. It also has top hash speeds of 43.3 MH/s according to MiningCharts.",

    "Not too long ago, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti was the undisputed king of GPUs. And, it\u2019s still royalty if you want 4K gaming or extremely smooth ray tracing on high settings. As far as how good it is for mining, it can deliver a 32.76 MH/s hashrate for some decent monthly income, making it a solid choice for a mining GPU if you want smooth mining performance. That is, if you can afford that high price that this is a significant barrier to entry.",

    "The Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti is still among the most powerful graphics cards out there, even in the face of its successors. It boasts Titan X-equivalent gaming performance and impressive cooling performance with 11 GB of GDDR5X memory. More importantly for those mining for cryptocurrency, this GPU can deliver a 21.63 MH/s hashrate on the KawPow (NBMiner) algorithm, according to BetterHash.net, and generate a healthy monthly income. It isn\u2019t so readily available these days, but for those that can find it in stock, you might even find it on a deal.",

    "One of the best AMD graphics cards we\u2019ve tested in years, the Radeon RX 5700 XT is a total beast when it comes to 1440p gaming. Also, unlike Ray Tracing, it touts many features that are actually usable from day one such as support for up to 6 monitors and Super Alloy Power II components that are aerospace grade. When it comes to cryptomining, it\u2019s even more impressive. It has been reported to deliver a 49.01 MH/s hashrate on the Ethash (Claymore) algorithm, and is capable of generating monthly income almost on par with the 2080 Ti for much less.",

    "Featuring the latest Polaris architecture, the XFX AMD Radeon RX 580 GTS is a solid choice for gaming. It should also come as no surprise that it\u2019s also among the best mining GPUs out there, combining an affordable price tag with nice profitability. This has been found to generate more than $3 of daily income with a 29 MH/s hashrate, making it an excellent option for crytominers on a more modest budget.",
