    "The Razer Kiyo ring light webcam has gathered quite the following since launching into the burgeoning streaming market back in 2017. Now that the new Kiyo Pro model is firmly on the shelves, though, we\u2019re seeing some excellent discounts hitting the previous generation.",
    "Walmart has just shaved an additional $17 off the usual $99.99 sales price, bringing the final price to just $83.60. That\u2019s a tidy markdown on an already well-priced piece of streaming gear, and a price that suits the Razer Kiyo\u2019s entry-level market particularly well. Not only that, but you\u2019ll find plenty of Razer deals on the official store right now, offering up to 30% off peripherals and accessories.",
    "If you\u2019re looking to get started in streaming, this all-in-one device is a must-see. You\u2019re getting a 1080p (at 30fps) / 720p (at 60fps) streaming webcam with a full onboard ring light to keep your frame illuminated with a strong, but adjustable, key light. While the quality here isn\u2019t going to compete with the most professional setups, those just starting out (and who don\u2019t want to break the bank) will find excellent value here.",
