    "Dyson Supersonic deals are hard to come by, but the high-tech haircare device, which is one of the best hair dryers you can buy, does occasionally see them. You're more likely to see a bundle deal - with free accessories, such as a travel bag - than a price drop, but we're constantly searching the sales, and you'll find all the best Dyson Supersonic deals here as soon as they drop.",
    "Dyson's premium hairdryer features innovative technology that makes it, unlike any traditional hair dryer. The Supersonic has a digital motor that creates ultra-fast drying while also preventing heat damage. But all that tech comes at a cost, and the Dyson Supersonic is priced well above most hair dryers, currently retailing for $400 in the US and \u00a3300 in the UK.",
    "The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is built with a powerful V9 digital motor that combined with air multiplier technology produces high-velocity controlled air for fast, controlled drying. The Supersonic hair dryer measures air temperature 20 times a second so you'll never have to worry about damaging your hair with extreme heat.",
    "The Dyson hair dryer also offers four different heat settings, as well as three different speed settings, so you can style your hair exactly how you want. The controlled heat and settings also help with reducing frizz so you can achieve sleek, smooth hair with every use. The Supersonic also comes with three different magnetic attachments so you can achieve different styles using just one tool.",
    "The high price tag on the Dyson hair dryer can initially cause shock, but there are several reasons for the steep price. The Supersonic is engineered like other Dyson appliances and therefore priced similarly.",
    "It features a tiny digital motor that - combined with the heat sensor - produces fast drying results without damaging your hair. Dyson installed the tiny motor in the handle rather than the head, which balances the weight of the dryer so your hand won't get tired when drying your hair. Dyson also claims that the Supersonic will outlast other hairdryers, so you won't have to keep repurchasing the same $70 hair dryer every couple of years.",
    "Extreme temperatures can damage hair, so Dyson engineered a hair dryer that protects hair while also achieving fast drying and controlled styling. The Supersonic features a powerful Dyson digital motor that's six times faster than other hair dryers.",
    "The motor combined with the Air Multiplier technology produces high-pressure controlled air, which results in a smooth and even hair drying experience. Thanks to the intelligent heat control, which measures air temperature 40 times a second, the extreme heat is regulated, so your hair is protected against damage.",
    "The short answer is yes; the Dyson Supersonic dries hair faster and more efficiently than traditional hair dryers. The Dyson hair dryer combines controlled heat with a powerful motor that results in drying time that's twice as fast as most hair dryers. The Supersonic also features three different drying speeds so you can control how fast you want your hair dried."
