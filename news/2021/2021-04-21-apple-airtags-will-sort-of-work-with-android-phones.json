    "Eagle-eyed Apple enthusiasts have noticed that the Apple AirTags unveiled at the Spring Loaded event might be even better than we first realized. According to official Apple information, the tiny lost item trackers are compatible with Android phones through NFC, potentially making it even easier to find your lost items.",
    "Once an Apple AirTag is put into lost mode, iPhones and iPads in its vicinity will pick up its Bluetooth signal and anonymously ping you the item\u2019s location through the Find My app. While Android phones can't yet use the Apple Find My app, they\u2019ll instead be able to use their NFC readers to learn helpful information (like your phone number and the AirTag serial number) to return your lost item to you.",
    "We don\u2019t yet know how this will work in practice - we imagine this will be an optional feature as Apple knows not everyone will want to hand out their number to strangers - though it shows Apple is keen to make the AirTag a formidable force in the tracking world.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a Find My Android phone style app, Google already has you covered. Log into your device\u2019s connected Google account and use Find My Device to locate your handset.",
    "Don\u2019t hold your breath for Apple\u2019s Find My app though, we can\u2019t see it coming anytime soon. We\u2019ll have to see how AirTags work in practice, but given how well iPhones sell we\u2019d expect that in many parts of the world there\u2019ll be enough people walking around with one to provide decent coverage for the service.",
    "Apple has brought other services to Android before, like Apple Music, so never say never. But with AirTags lined up to be a huge iPhone selling point, we don\u2019t imagine Apple wants to give up exclusivity yet."
