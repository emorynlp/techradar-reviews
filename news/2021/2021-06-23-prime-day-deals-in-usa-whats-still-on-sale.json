    "Amazon Prime Day has finished, which means most of the hefty discounts found during the two-day sales event have pretty much disappeared. However, there are still some great deals available if you know where to look. From cheap TVs and discounted headphones, including AirPods, to some of the best laptops and iPads - there are plenty of bargains to be had, and all you have to do is scroll down for the best of them. We've pulled together this handy list of all the best deals that are still running on June 23 and beyond. Luckily for you, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy launched competing sales that are still happening right now, so we've included those top offers as well. They're pretty generous deals, too \u2013 you're still going to save a lot if you pick one up. If there are any deals that take your fancy, we suggest you don't delay as we don't know how long these discounts will be around \u2013 and the next mammoth sale won't be until Black Friday 2021 in November."
