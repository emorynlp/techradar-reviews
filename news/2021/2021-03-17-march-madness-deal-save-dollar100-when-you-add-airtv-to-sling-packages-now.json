    "Oh March Madness, how we missed thee! And how glad we are to have you back. Which is why we're already planning the perfect way to live stream March Madness action this year.",
    "And to make things that little bit easier - and cheaper - cord cutting MVP Sling TV has a deal that may make the next month of basketball action that little bit sweeter still.",
    "Make a Sling TV package your cable-replacement of choice now, and you can add an AirTV 2 and HD antenna for a mere $49. That's a massive $100 saving on the tuner's RRP, and means you can integrate additional local channels - that include CBS, ABC, Fox and NBC - to the 30+ live channels on your chosen Sling plan, for free!",
    "And the slam-dunking deal doesn't end there. AirTV also gives you an extra 50 hours of free DVR storage, meaning that you won't have to miss a game this year's college basketball jamboree.",
    "If you're a cord cutter or have ever thought about removing yourself from the vice-like grip of cable television, you'll likely have encountered Sling TV. Of all the TV streaming services out there, it's among the cheapest of the OTT cable replacements. On price, it massively undercuts much of the competition.",
    "Plus, unlike most others, you get a choice of what channels you pay for. There are the bog standard Orange (good for sports fans and those with kids) and Blue (better for dramas) or a combo of the two. And then you can go ahead and add further channels that you actually want, like Sports Extra, Comedy Extra and Hollywood Extra.",
    "Having an AirTV box sitting next to your set (maybe something new and flashy you've found on our best March Madness TV sales run down?) is a great way to consolidate your full array of local channels and Sling TV stations in one easy place.",
    "In our full AirTV 2 review, we lauded its great value proposition. That's because it also gives you the opportunity to put those extra channels on your phone or tablet, as it cleverly works alongside your HD TV antenna. Plus, as we mention above, it has included DVR capabilities that allow you to store up to 50 hours of game time, TV box sets or, frankly, anything else that you want to save for later.",
    "And at $49, it really is a bargain! Head to the Sling website to take advantage of this deal."
