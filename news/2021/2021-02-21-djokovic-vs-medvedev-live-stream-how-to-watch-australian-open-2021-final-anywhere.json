    "Is this the moment Daniil Medvedev steps up to the next level? The 25-year-old has won the ATP Finals and the ATP Cup, and could now add a maiden grand slam to his haul. But standing in his way is top seed, world No. 1 and defending Australian Open champion, Novak Djokovic. It's the young pretender vs the master, so read on as we explain how to watch the Australian Open final online and get a Novak Djokovic vs Daniil Medvedev live stream wherever you are today.",
    "Medvedev is on a 20-match winning streak, with Stefanos Tsitsipas becoming his latest victim in the semi-final. The fiery Russian needed just three sets to stop the Greek - his fifth straight-sets victory in Melbourne.",
    "It's not been quite as smooth a ride for Djokovic, who has not been a happy camper over the past fortnight. The Serb has been spiky, and has attributed his laborious performances to an apparent injury, though his standards have picked up as the tournament has progressed.",
    "He's also got history on his side. The Aussie Open has become the Djokovic Cup over recent years, with Novak winning eight out of a possible 13 titles since 2008. It was his first ever major, and now it's his to lose.",
    "But if anyone can stop him it's Medvedev, who crushed him 6-3, 6-3 at the ATP Finals in November. Don't miss a single point from Melbourne Park because it couldn't be easier to get an Australian Open live stream from anywhere. Watch all the drama unfold by following our Novak Djokovic vs Daniil Medvedev live stream guide below to watch Australian Open final online right now.",
    "For broadcast and streaming details in tennis-mad countries like the UK, Australia, US, Canada and New Zealand, just scroll down the page - everything you need to know is there, including details of who is showing the tennis.",
    "But if you try to watch your domestic coverage from somewhere outside your home country, you'll soon find a problem - geo-blocking. That's where the broadcaster prevents you from watching your usual feed from abroad. It's a common problem for sports fans all over the world. Fortunately, there's an easy solution."
