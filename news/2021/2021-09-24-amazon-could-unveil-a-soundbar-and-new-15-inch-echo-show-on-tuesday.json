  "article": [
    "Amazon could use next week\u2019s hardware and services event to show off a new soundbar for TVs, a 15-inch Echo smart display, a second-generation Echo Auto device and new wearables, according to a new report.",
    "The report comes by way of Bloomberg who has gleaned information about some of Amazon\u2019s upcoming projects from its Lab126 division. If that name sounds familiar, that\u2019s the division that constructed the original Echo and Echo Show devices, and is often hard at work building the next generation of flagship products.",
    "Among the devices we\u2019ll purportedly see at next week\u2019s briefing are a larger-screen display that could act as both a home control panel when it\u2019s wall-mounted or a large screen tablet in the kitchen when it\u2019s on a mount.",
    "The device sounds like it will share much of the same DNA as the smaller Amazon Echo Show devices but might have a special ability to help you track your Amazon packages on their trip to your doorstep.",
    "Also on the docket is a smart soundbar \u2013 something that other third-party companies already produce \u2013 but Amazon's in-house model could potentially come with a built-in camera for video chats similar to Facebook\u2019s Portal Go devices.",
    "Lastly, Bloomberg\u2019s report mentions more vehicle integrations and a potential second-generation Amazon Echo Auto device that could be mounted on the dashboard. That move could make Amazon a larger player in the automotive space, which has largely been dominated by Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto.",
    "As TechRadar reported earlier this week, Amazon will be holding its annual hardware and services event on September 28 at 9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm BST.",
    "While Amazon isn\u2019t making a livestream of the event available to the public, it has invited a number of mainstream technology publications who will be publishing the news as it becomes available.",
    "As for how much of Bloomberg\u2019s reporting will show up on Tuesday, however, it's still a matter of debate. Amazon\u2019s only likely going to show what\u2019s ready to be sold before the end of the year \u2013 it really doesn\u2019t show off its products too far in advance.",
    "That being said, we\u2019d wager that the 15-inch Echo Show screen will likely be there as we\u2019ve heard rumors about it since last year, as will the Alexa soundbar. The soundbar would be a nice pairing with the Amazon-branded Omni TVs that the company announced earlier this month and makes sense given Amazon\u2019s previous experience developing speakers.",
    "As always we\u2019ll take everything we hear with a grain of salt \u2013 but, if we know one thing, it\u2019s that you can count on some decently sized announcements on Tuesday afternoon so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for news as it drops."
