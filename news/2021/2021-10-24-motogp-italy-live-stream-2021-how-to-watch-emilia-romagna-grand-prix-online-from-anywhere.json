    "We saw a glimpse of the old Marc Marquez a few weeks back in the US, but even at his talisman circuit the Spaniard could only put four seconds between him and wunderkind Quartararo. With just three races to go, all the Frenchman needs to do is beat Bagnaia by three points to secure the title \u2013 can he do it? Read on as we explain how to watch all the Italian Grand Prix action online \u2013 no matter where you are \u2013 with our MotoGP live stream guide.",
    "While it's looking like we'll have a dry track on Sunday, practice and qualifying is going to be a drizzly affair. This could spell doom for Quartararo who, despite an incredible season, is still yet to find his feet on his Yamaha in the rain.",
    "While performing poorly won't scupper his title hopes, he'll no doubt want to put the final nail in the coffin by nabbing those final three points over Bagnaia this weekend. If he does, it'll be a couple of bright and breezy outings to Portugal and Spain to round off the season.",
    "But will that pressurise Bagnaia and the rest of the grid to put the hammer down and really make Quartararo work for his title? We shouldn't think they'll give him an easy ride, and while the chance is slim, there's still everything to race for.",
    "Whoever you're rooting for, all you need to do is follow our guide below as we explain how to watch the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix and get a MotoGP live stream from anywhere.",
    "If you find yourself abroad at all during the 2021 MotoGP season, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual MotoGP coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking \u2013 best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you whizz around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe-trot and still access your preferred MotoGP live stream. It's a completely legal workaround, very affordable, and super easy to use \u2013 allow us to explain more.",
    "Use a VPN to watch a 2021 MotoGP live stream from anywhere",
    "It's remarkably easy to use a VPN, too:",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our top choice for streaming right now is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open up the app, choose the location that corresponds to your country, and hit the 'on' button",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - you'll now be able to watch on 10 Play outside Australia, on BT Sport outside the UK, and so on"
