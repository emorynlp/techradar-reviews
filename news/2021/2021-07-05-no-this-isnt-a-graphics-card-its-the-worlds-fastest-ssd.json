    "You\u2019d be forgiven for mistaking Gigabyte\u2019s Aorus Xtreme Gen 4 for a graphics card at first glance \u2013 albeit a very slim one \u2013 but this is actually an SSD, and an incredibly fast offering at that.",
    "The Aorus Xtreme Gen 4 can achieve up to a blistering 28GB/s when it comes to sequential read speeds, or 26.6GB/s with writes, and with capacities running to 32TB, as you might guess, this is a seriously high-end SSD product aimed at workstations rather than a run-of-the-mill PC.",
    "The Aorus Xtreme is actually a bunch of 4TB Aorus Gen4 7000s M.2 SSDs, up to eight of them, on a card complete with Phison PS5018-E18 controllers, and this raft of solid-state drives can be configured in RAID to reach that potential top read speed of 28GB/s.",
    "That GPU-esque look comes from the twin fans which are on top to keep the Aorus Xtreme out of any danger of overheating, along with an expansive aluminum heatsink plus a whole raft of temperature sensors \u2013 10 of them \u2013 to make sure the unit is keeping suitably cool. There are three fan operation modes, so things can stay nice and quiet if the drive isn\u2019t being taxed and is just ticking along.",
    "This is a PCIe 4.0 drive, of course \u2013 or rather a pile of them \u2013 and so obviously a compatible system is needed in that respect, with plenty of PCIe lanes to hand, and a beefy CPU. But as we\u2019ve already mentioned, this product is designed for heavyweight workstation PCs, not your average consumer machine.",
    "Still, it\u2019s always interesting to see just how fast things can go in terms of storage these days, even if most consumers don\u2019t have the kind of PC required to run a drive like this \u2013 or a wallet deep enough to afford it, of course.",
    "While Gigabyte hasn\u2019t announced any pricing for the Aorus Xtreme Gen 4 yet, the price tag of the 2TB Aorus Gen4 7000s falls just shy of $400, and remember, if you\u2019re loading up eight of these at double the capacity (4TB)\u2026 well, that\u2019s going to get very expensive, very quickly.",
