  "article": [
    "Few could argue that Jonathan Taylor isn't the hottest player in the NFL right now, and the league's leading rusher, fresh off an extraordinary five-touchdown performance last weekend, faces up against the best rush defense in the biz in this must-watch showdown. Read on as we explain how to get a Buccaneers vs Colts live stream and watch the NFL game online from anywhere.",
    "The 22-year-old running back made the Bills, whose own rush D ranks amongst the NFL's top 10, look like a joke, and though the Colts are only 6-5 for the season, they're now being talked about as contenders, and we're not just referring to the playoffs.",
    "That may seem a touch premature, considering the Bills are the only genuinely top-tier team they've beaten, but it's worth remembering that they came agonisingly close against the Ravens and Titans, losing to both in overtime.",
    "The Bucs bounced back from a three-game skid by beating the Giants, a fired-up Tom Brady showing that he can gallop when he needs to, and right about now is when everyone has been expecting them to really come of age.",
    "Indy may be hot right now, but stop Taylor and you invariably stop the Colts.",
