    "There are spoilers for the second season of The Morning Show throughout this article. Read at your peril!",
    "The Morning Show season 2 is here \u2013 and even in its opening two episodes, it\u2019s clear that the Apple TV Plus darling is tripping up in an all-too familiar way.",
    "Billed as the flagship show for Apple\u2019s streaming platform when it first launched back in 2019, in what was until recently a very thin catalogue of programming, The Morning Show had a lot of responsibility to perform \u2013 but perform it did.",
    "The ensemble drama series took big-name stars like Jennifer Aniston (Friends), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde), Steve Carell (The Office) and Mark Duplass (Safety Not Guaranteed) and put them in the midst of a morning news television show rocked by a sexual misconduct scandal. But with a firm handle on such a sensitive topic, and the complex lattice of personal and professional relationships that arises in large media organizations, this #MeToo inspired-show navigated the quagmire of consent and assault in a truly powerful way.",
    "Some accent work by Reese Witherspoon aside \u2013 alongside an \u2018Irish\u2019 bartender she encounters midway through the season \u2013 the acting is exceptional, with Jennifer Aniston particularly putting in a career-best performance as Morning Show co-host Alex Levy. Supporting performances from N\u00e9stor Carbonell (Lost) as an emotive weatherman, Bel Powley as a production assistant romantically involved with him, or Karen Pittman as the show\u2019s weary producer, all help to elevate The Morning Show above the by-the-numbers \u2018scandal\u2019 drama it could have been.",
    "But it\u2019s the success of the first season, and the incredible work done by its cast, that has backed The Morning Show into a corner \u2013 keen to keep its key cast members onscreen long after the denouement of its first season.",
    "The start of season 2 spends a lot of time moving cast members into their proper places, even if that means undoing or contradicting their character arcs so far. Aniston\u2019s Alex Levy opens the season in isolation, writing a memoir of her career shortly after exploding it with a confessional broadcast on The Morning Show\u2019s misconduct cover-ups.",
    "But instead of focusing on the experience of being \u2018on the outside\u2019 of the media machine, or the journey of writing this tell-all book, we catch up with Alex after all this is over \u2013 and as she\u2019s speedily convinced to return to her old position at UBA.",
    "We immediately see the same character conflicts from the previous season return, overshadowing the more interesting narrative directions that a second season could have taken. Alex and her old co-host Bradley yell at each other with distrust, as scorned colleague Daniel firmly lays out the wrongs Alex did to him. Mark Duplass\u2019 producer Charlie Black, seemingly so happy in his new job and relationship, is also promptly brought back into the UBA fold, dredging up season one\u2019s best arcs and refusing to let them move on.",
    "It\u2019s an all-too common problem for successful TV shows, which feel the pressure of consistency while moving the story forward \u2013 often with actor contracts to grapple with. (Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe Dameron was intended to die after Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but by his own admission it sounds like plans changed after he fought for his appearance in later films.)",
    "We saw the same issue in Halt and Catch Fire, a stunning character study that follows the intertwining lives of those at the heart of technological change, from portable computing to the world of online gaming. The core trio of Lee Pace, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy are electrifying to watch in the first season, but even as these characters split apart, so too are they forced back into proximity through unlikely connections in the next businesses they end up working at.",
    "The show\u2019s writers want to move each person\u2019s arc forward, but insist on keeping tried-and-tested character dynamics in play too.",
    "So too in the sitcom Scrubs, which went out with a whimper in season 9, having had the bold vision of a new generation of trainee doctors to follow, while cramming in almost every Scrubs regular from previous seasons \u2013 leaving no oxygen for new, interesting ideas.",
    "When it comes to The Morning Show season 2, this may feel like preemptive criticism \u2013 after all, there are another eight episodes where we could see a course-correct. The show following Steve Carell, as he attempts to lay low after being publicly outed as an abuser, is already the most fascinating thing in it \u2013 what can possibly come after that?",
    "The spectre of the Covid-19 pandemic, too, appears to be seeping into events, with word of a virus outbreak in China appearing early on in the season, and an ominous sneeze closing the second episode as 2020 comes into view. And the strong screenwriting that elevated the first season is still on show, with dialogue that\u2019s by turns cutting and obtuse, as the sleek veneer of the media machine comes in and out of view, veiling and unveiling the emotions of those caught up in it.",
    "I'm keen to see how The Morning Show plays out \u2013 but after such an excellent first season, I'm already disappointed by the long shadow it casts over its successor."
