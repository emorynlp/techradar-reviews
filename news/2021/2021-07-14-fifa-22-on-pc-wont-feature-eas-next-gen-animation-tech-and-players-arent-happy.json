    "EA has confirmed that the upcoming FIFA 22 on PC won\u2019t feature the gaming giant\u2019s new HyperMotion technology, which uses advanced motion capture and machine learning to overhaul the game\u2019s animation system.",
    "The company has confirmed that HyperMotion technology will only be available on next-gen consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S) and Google Stadia.",
    "It\u2019s another example of EA breaking parity between platforms, with last year\u2019s FIFA 21 on PC also missing out on key features that were present in the next-gen console versions.",
    "HyperMotion technology is FIFA 22\u2019s biggest draw this year, as it utilizes machine learning and Xsens motion capture suits to deliver revolutionary animation technology, transforming players\u2019 movement. It means FIFA 22 will include over 4,000 new animations, and should provide a more organic experience for players to enjoy.",
    "In an interview with Eurogamer last year, FIFA 21 executive producer Aaron McHardy said the company wanted to keep a low minimum spec for FIFA so it could \u201copen doors\u201d, and be more inclusive of FIFA PC gamers playing on devices with more entry-level specs.",
    "Not surprisingly though, EA\u2019s decision has annoyed many PC gamers, with some taking to Reddit and Twitter to vent their frustration.",
    "It\u2019s understandable that PC gamers would be upset by EA\u2019s decision to hold back key features from the PC version of a title, particularly giving the ever-improving capabilities of gaming rigs.",
    "However, PC gamers aren\u2019t the only ones that have issues with FIFA 21. Though EA hopes HyperMotion will be a revolutionary new technology, it won\u2019t necessarily address the glaring issues with yearly FIFA iterations that seem to occur across all gaming platforms.",
    "Those issues include the pay-to-win nature of FIFA Ultimate Team, and the lack of attention to overhauling Career Mode. It\u2019s the reason FIFA 21 received a mixed 72 Metacritic score, and we\u2019ll have to wait to see if FIFA 22 will bring much-needed innovations to the series."
