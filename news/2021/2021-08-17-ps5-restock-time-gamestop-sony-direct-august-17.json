    "PS5 and Xbox restock news: If you didn't get the PS5 restock Tuesday, you should follow our PS5 and Xbox restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider, who will send you an alert when the consoles are in stock \u2013 if you follow and turn on notifications. A lot of people were able to buy GameStop PS5 bundles \u2013 there was a single Xbox Series X bundle available today. It won't be the last PS5 restock today, August 17. Those with the Sony Direct email invite (sent to random PSN users) can buy a PS5 at 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT. Sony's official PlayStation store and could open up a second virtual queue for PSN users without the coveted email invite at 5pm EDT / 2pm PDT.",
    "Here's how to get fast PS5 and Xbox restock alerts to know the exact time:",
    "Gamestop has one of the most complex checkout methods for the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles, but we're here to help you navigate that pesky add-to-cart button and the error messages it likes to throw at customers.",
    "We'll do a GameStop PS5 and Xbox restock live stream whenever the retailer goes live with consoles.",
    "Directions: Click on this screenshot of a PS5 and Xbox restock alert from Twitter tracker Matt Swider and turn on notifications (that little bell icon in the profile) for instant alerts.",
    "This is what you'll see when there's the PS5 is in stock.",
    "We've been touting exclusive sources that suggested a GameStop PS5 restock was happening this week before Wednesday, and sure enough, we've finally nailed down the restock date: it's scheduled for Tuesday, August 17, 2021 at 11am EDT.",
    "It's not the only PS5 restock retailer in the US making news today. While GameStop is offering bundles today, Sony Direct \u2013 the official website for Sony's PlayStation brand \u2013 is also having a restock of its console: $499 for the PS5 Disc and $399 for the PS5 Digital, both at MSRP.",
    "This marks two very different ways to buy the console. Different prices and different methods of checking out (clicking an add-to-cart button and refreshing relentlessly at GameStop vs waiting in a virtual queue at Sony Direct).",
    "The next GameStop PS5 restock was today, August 17, according to PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider, citing exclusive sources ahead of the actual restock time. Matt and TechRadar have had the exclusive news about the last two GameStop PS5 restock dates.",
    "GameStop has spent two weeks amassing console inventory for online orders after doing two consecutive back-to-back PS5 restocks both two and three weeks ago. By skipping the restock last Tuesday, it has more consoles for sale \u2013 all in bundle form.",
    "The GameStop PS5 restock time just officially confirmed the information we've been waiting to hear exactly 90 minutes before the console restock: PS5 Disc and PS5 Digital bundles will be on sale Tuesdays at 11am EDT / 8am PDT.",
    "That time is 11am EDT / 8am PDT and has been since June 2021, so this makes sense.",
    "No, the PS5 has not been sold at GameStop stores during 2021 for two very obvious reasons. First, the pandemic caused many retailers in the US to pull back on plans to restock hard-to-find consoles and GPUs that could cause anxious crowds.",
    "Second, as we saw with the Best Buy GPU restock last month and Pokemon Cards at Target earlier in 2021, fights have broken out when tensions are so high. While many people think the online process is unfair, and they're right, the in-person logistics are oftentimes not any better, and GameStop knows this.",
    "Yes, you need to be a PowerUp Rewards Pro member to get the PS5 bundles from GameStop. It costs $15 per year for this membership and it deters resellers.",
    "GameStop labels this 'early access' but this is confusing. We can explain it better: you get first access to consoles, not access any earlier than the posted time.",
    "In fact, the GameStop restock time is often late, turning on the add-to-cart button without allowing you to add the console to your cart for several minutes. This throws many people off and they peel away from buying it, despite our expert advice.",
    "Everyone without a membership has to wait. When can non-members buy a PS5 at GameStop? So far, the answer has been never. They always run out before all of the GameStop PowerUp Pro Rewards members can buy them, so no one else gets a chance. Demand has just been that high since launch.",
    "Important: In other words, in the past, you've had a 0% chance of getting a PS5 if you're not a member. You have a 75% chance of getting a console if you are a member.",
    "If you're really interested in the GameStop PS5 restock bundles, then the PowerUp Rewards Pro is completely worth it. It costs $15 annually (you do not need to renew for the following year if you don't want to).",
    "This barrier to entry is actually a good thing: it weeds out resellers, making it far less profitable for people to buy a PS5 console and sell it for profit on eBay or StockX, charging more than $800 to consumers who fail to get lucky at stores like GameStop, Walmart, Amazon and Best Buy. GameStop is catering to true gamers.",
    "Some people have asked PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider if \"it's worth it for $15 a month\" or \"$20 a year.\" You don't need to pay either rate. Here are the facts: ut's $15 a year, so you will not be charged per month like many people think, and the $20 per year membership won't net you anything special except for the GameStop-backed Game Informer magazine in print form instead of digital.",
    "Yes, GameStop has been doing PS5 bundles for much of 2021, and here's why. First, retailers don't actually make much money off of console sales. Profits are margin-thin; even Sony has lost money on the PS5 Disc console until recently. They all make up for this loss by selling games and accessories.",
    "Second, we've seen what happens at Best Buy and Walmart when the PS5 is sold for MSRP without bundles: resellers and bots are always the first ones to claim consoles. This is another reseller deterrent along with the GameStop PowerUp Rewards Pro membership.",
    "The next Sony Direct PS5 restock date is August 17, and so far this particular virtual queue is only open to anyone who has that coveted Sony Direct email invite.",
    "The Sony Direct restock time is confirmed for these lucky few: 3pm EDT / 12pm PDT, according to an official email sent by email@email.playstation.com. About half of the time (recently), Sony Direct has opened up a second virtual queue for everyone at 5pm EDT / 2pm PDT.",
    "The Sony Direct restock dates have been happening twice a month this summer, one limited to PSN users with the email invite and no one else, and another for people with the email invite and then everyone else.",
    "Getting the Sony Direct invite email today is a matter of luck, but we can tell you this: it's intended for PSN users, according to PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider. While random, there are ways to open yourself up to getting the email invite.",
    "Every time there's a Sony Direct restock, we get thousands of Twitter direct messages asking how to sign up for the Sony Direct email, and Sony's method is \u2013 naturally \u2013 buried in a bunch of submenus. Matt will walk you through the process \u2013 if you're on the newsletter list."
