    "After months of rumors, it came as a surprise to some that Apple didn\u2019t unveil the AirPods 3 at this week\u2019s California Streaming iPhone 13 launch event.",
    "However, a new report says that there\u2019s no need for concern \u2013 they\u2019re in production and could be here before the end of the year.",
    "The report comes by way of Digitimes, and claims that the next true wireless earbuds have a finalized design and are in production. The report stops short of giving us an exact release date or price for the earbuds, but seems to suggest that they\u2019ll be available before the end of the year and only cost slightly more than the AirPods\u2019 current $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$229 sticker price.",
    "Apple, of course, has yet to corroborate or even acknowledge the rumor \u2013 but it does seem to be plausible given how much we\u2019ve already heard about the forthcoming earbuds.",
    "According to Bloomberg, which spoke with people familiar with the plans, the AirPods 3 could include motion sensors for fitness tracking and integration with Apple Fitness Plus, along with noise reduction.",
    "We\u2019re also expecting to see support for spatial audio and better battery life, as well as a design similar to the AirPods Pro with shorter stems.",
    "We\u2019re also hoping there\u2019s a chance that the AirPods 3 will have outright active noise cancellation similar to the AirPods Pro \u2013 but unfortunately that hasn\u2019t shown up in any of the reports we\u2019ve seen so far.",
    "At this point, we\u2019re still waiting to see what the final model will look like \u2013 but if it truly is out in production now, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it pops up and you can bet we\u2019ll be covering it when it does."
