    "A new trailer for The Matrix Resurrections has arrived \u2013 and it\u2019s basically a highlight reel of the best scenes from the first three (okay, two) movies.",
    "Titled D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, the 60-second teaser merges sequences from the original trilogy with those from the upcoming fourth instalment, which is scheduled to land in theaters on December 22, 2021.",
    "To be honest, we don\u2019t learn all that much more about what to expect from Resurrections in this new trailer \u2013 it\u2019s more a series of glitchy code and morphing faces than telling reveals \u2013 but it\u2019s still managed to make us even more excited to see how director Lana Wachowski plans to breathe new life into the iconic sci-fi franchise.",
    "You can check it out below.",
    "The trailer opens with an ominous line from Carrie-Anne Moss\u2019 Trinity \u2013 \u201ca d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is usually a glitch in The Matrix, it happens when they change something\u201d \u2013 which itself is an immediate callback to the 1999 original.",
    "From then on (once again to the tune of Jefferson Airplane\u2019s White Rabbit), we\u2019re treated to a montage of moments from The Matrix and its sequels, including Morpheus\u2019 offering of the red or blue pill, Neo\u2019s awakening from the gunge-filled pod, the dojo fight sequence and Neo\u2019s battle with Merovingian.",
    "These are spliced with new scenes from Resurrections, like those showing Trinity disintegrating into code, an angry-looking Jonathan Groff and an explosive fight against the machines.",
    "It then ends with a rather on-the-nose piece of text reading CHANGE, followed by a voiceover saying, \u201cWhy use old code to make something new?\u201d A third voice (Jessica Henwick\u2019s Bugs, we think) closes proceedings by revealing that \u201cmaybe this isn\u2019t the story we think it is.\u201d",
    "Yes, that is hype we\u2019re breathing now.",
    "As for what we already knew about The Matrix Resurrections, it\u2019s clear that the film will be dealing with Neo\u2019s return to The Matrix and the as-yet-unexplained survival of Trinity (who \u2013 spoilers! \u2013 was killed at the end of Revolutions).",
    "Lana Wachowski, who directed the first three entries alongside her sister, Lilly, is helming this one alone, while Reeves and Moss are both reprising their roles. We also know Laurence Fishburne won\u2019t be returning as Morpheus, and that his character is instead being re-interpreted (though we don\u2019t yet know specifics) by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.",
    "New cast members include Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Christina Ricci, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Er\u00e9ndira Ibarra \u2013 but, again, we\u2019re still unsure of their respective roles.",
    "We do learn from this trailer, though, that Groff\u2019s character is likely to play a villainous role. In our first look at Resurrections back in September, he appeared in more of a therapeutic capacity \u2013 clearly excited by the possibility of Neo\u2019s return to The Matrix \u2013 but this time around we see him don a more menacing facial expression \u00e0 la the tortured Morpheus in the original movie.",
    "Speaking of that mythical martial arts maestro, this new teaser also suggests Resurrections will at least acknowledge Fishburne\u2019s time spent playing the character. He\u2019s included here more than Abdul-Mateen\u2019s version of Morpheus, so we\u2019re excited to see how the new movie ties the two together.",
    "And then, of course, there\u2019s the trailer\u2019s closing line \u2013 \u201cmaybe this isn\u2019t the story we think it is.\u201d Not that we had much of an idea beforehand, but it\u2019s good to know that Wachowski and co. have clearly made it their mission to subvert expectations with the upcoming sequel.",
    "All will be revealed on December 22, when The Matrix Resurrections is released concurrently in theaters and on HBO Max."
