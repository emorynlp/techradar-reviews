    "Spoilers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follow.",
    "\u201cThe [Super-Solder] Serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse\u2026\u201d",
    "These words are not taken from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, but they could have been. When Dr Abraham Erskine, original creator of the infamous drug, gave Steve Rogers this pertinent warning in the original Captain America: The First Avengers, he was effectively summarizing the themes of a show that would debut a decade later.",
    "Even more than in previous episodes, the core theme of \u2018Truth\u2019 is the way immense power can affect the decisions you make \u2013 or the decisions other people make on your behalf when you\u2019ve been transformed into one of the most valuable weapons on the planet. In other words, once you\u2019ve ingested Super-Soldier Serum, you\u2019re constantly walking that fine line between heroism and villainy \u2013 and Steve Rogers may just have been the only person with the moral rectitude to stay the right side.",
    "We saw last week what can happen when great power isn\u2019t matched by great responsibility, as Captain America 2.0, John Walker, brutally murdered a Flag Smasher, instantly transforming Cap\u2019s shield into a blood-soaked symbol of oppression. This follow-up wastes little time dealing with the aftermath, as Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes attempt to apprehend Walker in an abandoned warehouse \u2013 for some reason, this show has a bizarre obsession with warehouses.",
    "It\u2019s a brilliantly dirty scrap, expertly choreographed to showcase three fighters who don\u2019t know the meaning of holding back. Walker comes perilously close to showing that shield-in-forehead might become his signature move, while Sam and Bucky\u2019s technical augmentations are pushed beyond their limits \u2013 Walker even unceremoniously tears the wings from Falcon\u2019s back.",
    "That it comes to Sam using his jet pack to forcibly remove Walker\u2019s shield \u2013 snapping the Cap wannabe\u2019s arm in the process \u2013 sums up a fight scene that manages to stand out even in a show that\u2019s consistently raised the bar for blockbuster action on TV.",
    "Like the series premiere, \u2018Truth\u2019 gets the action out of its system early, shifting gears to get inside the psyches of the human beings who inhabit superhero uniforms.",
    "Inevitably, this means the book being thrown at Walker with all the intensity of a flying shield. It turns out that Captain America killing a foreign national in a public place is kind of a big deal \u2013 enough, in fact, to see Sam and Bucky removed from the investigation \u2013 and Walker finds himself given an \u201cother than honorable discharge\u201d from a US Army he\u2019s served with distinction. In fact, it\u2019s only his exemplary record that saves him from a court martial.",
    "And yet, despite the many questionable decisions he\u2019s made in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier \u2013 and his false claims that the man he murdered was Lemar Hoskins\u2019 killer \u2013 you still sympathize with the way he\u2019s been treated. As he tells the tribunal, he\u2019s spent his entire life living by military mandates, only doing what they\u2019ve asked of him \u2013 and doing it well. When the finely tuned human weapon malfunctions, is it the fault of the Super-Soldier himself, or the institution that created him?",
    "Now disillusioned with the army, but still obsessed with fulfilling his calling as Captain America, Walker may be more dangerous than ever. Especially now that the incredibly charismatic Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine has paid him a visit, seemingly looking for a way to exploit his unique set of skills.",
    "Karli Morgenthau is also struggling to stay on the right side of the Serum\u2019s corrupting influence. While The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has \u2013 up to now \u2013 made great efforts to emphasize the Flag Smashers\u2019 humanitarian motives, here Karli starts morphing into a more two-dimensional villain \u2013 and she\u2019s much less interesting as a result. Hurting the powers-that-be now seems more important to her than helping people in need \u2013 to the point she\u2019s prepared to join forces with known criminals like the returning Georges Batroc. Helmut Zemo is clearly speaking sense when he says she\u2019s been completely radicalized.",
    "So it\u2019s a big shame that he\u2019s so marginalized in \u2018Truth\u2019. We have no doubt he has more of a role to play in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (whether it\u2019s in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier or another movie/TV show), but to have his role reduced to being carted away by the Dora Milaje seems a waste of a character who tends to be the best thing about every scene he\u2019s in.",
    "But make no mistake, this is Sam Wilson\u2019s episode. From the moment he has his wings permanently clipped by Walker, he gives the story its narrative drive and heart. Most powerful are his scenes with Isaiah Bradley, as the forgotten Black Super-Soldier reveals the full tragedy of his life story. He and his fellow test subjects had no idea what drugs they were taking \u2013 he was arguably the lucky one, in the sense that his iteration of the Serum didn\u2019t kill him \u2013 and was subsequently locked up to make sure nobody knew he existed. Even his letters to his late wife were prevented from reaching her.",
    "Coming face-to-face with a man whose idealism has been brutally knocked out of him by the hand life has dealt him is a pivotal moment for Sam, a man who shares Steve Rogers\u2019 belief in humanity\u2019s potential for good. Does he believe Isaiah when he says that the US government will never let a Black man be Captain America \u2013 and that no self-respecting Black man would ever want the role anyway? Or does he set out to become the sort of positive symbol a broken world can get behind? It\u2019s emotional, thought-provoking stuff, and once again, Marvel should be commended for engaging with essential, politically relevant topics \u2013 even when it means raising uncomfortable questions about difficult aspects of America\u2019s history.",
    "Unfortunately, the second half of the episode can\u2019t live up to the promise of the first, as the longest instalment of the series so far somehow feels both flabby and rushed. Scenes where Sam ropes in the local community to help repair the family boat \u2013 with a bit of superpowered handyman assistance from Bucky \u2013 are genuinely uplifting, and reveal that the bond between the two title characters goes way deeper than sharing a mutual friend.",
    "But the major character about-faces \u2013 Sam deciding to accept the Captain America mantle; Bucky agreeing to reassess his strategy on atoning for his crimes \u2013 seem to happen in an instant, based around the sort of trite, over-simplistic pep talks you\u2019d expect to hear in a middle-of-the-road soap opera.",
    "And even with an intriguing mid-credits sequence that shows Walker seemingly retooling himself as an off-the-books Captain America, it feels like the episode ends before the cliffhanger comes into play. After the haunting image of Captain America brandishing a blood-soaked shield, Flag Smashing security guards turning off the lights and Sam opening a mysterious box from Wakanda have a whiff of anti-climax. We\u2019re not sure if we should be on the edge of our seats for next week\u2019s season finale or not\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "With a brutal opening fight scene, John Walker facing justice for murdering a Flag Smasher, and the full, tragic story of Isaiah Bradley coming to light, \u2018Truth\u2019 doesn\u2019t pull any punches. In fact, the first half of the episode is as strong as anything we\u2019ve seen in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier so far, a complex character study delving deep into the darker corners of the MCU.",
    "But despite some lovely character beats shared between Sam and Bucky \u2013 maybe they can be friends after all\u2026 \u2013 the episode unravels in its closing act, as over-simplistic motivations and the lack of a proper conclusion leave you feeling the showrunners are saving too much for the last chapter. Or maybe we\u2019re wrong and it\u2019ll be a season finale for the ages\u2026",
    "New episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier are available on Disney Plus every Friday."
