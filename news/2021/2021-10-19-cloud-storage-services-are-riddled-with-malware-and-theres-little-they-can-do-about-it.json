  "article": [
    "Cybersecurity researchers have accused Microsoft of knowingly hosting dangerous malware for years.",
    "The conversation kickstarter was the security researcher known as TheAnalyst, who took to Twitter to call out Microsoft for dragging its feet when it came to removing ransomware facilitating malware hosted on OneDrive.",
    "\u201cDoes @Microsoft have any responsibility in this when they KNOWINGLY are hosting hundreds of files leading to this, now for over three days,\u201d asked TheAnalyst.",
    "Former Microsoft security analyst Kevin Beaumont joined in the conversation noting that OneDrive has been used for hosting malware for years.",
    "\u201cMicrosoft cannot advertise themselves as the security leader with 8000 security employees and trillions of signals if they cannot prevent their own Office365 platform being directly used to launch Conti ransomware. OneDrive abuse has been going on for years,\u201d noted Beaumont.",
    "Beaumont continued, explaining that getting things taken down from OneDrive is a nightmarish process. He went as far as to cite Microsoft\u2019s rather slow reaction times to refer to it as the \u201cworld\u2019s best malware hoster for about a decade.\u201d",
    "However, reporting on the development, HotHardware notes that using cloud storage services to host malware is a problem that plagues other vendors as well. In fact, according to a research by the Bern University of Applied Sciences, Google Cloud and Cloudflare are currently among the top online malware hosting networks.",
    "Beaumont agrees that the problem isn\u2019t exclusive to Microsoft, calling on all \u201ctech companies have got to do better.\u201d",
    "According to security experts that TechRadar Pro spoke to, the issue isn\u2019t as simple to fix as it sounds.",
    "Morey Haber, chief security officer, with cybersecurity vendor BeyondTrust, argues that thanks to the prevailing privacy-paramount atmosphere, it wouldn\u2019t take much effort for anyone to get away with uploading malware to their private online storage.",
    "\u201cThe question is, does the online provider have the authority or responsibility to assess the files, in a private instance, for malware or potential illegal activity? And, if they do, how much authority do they have to assess anything for any type of legal issues? Simply, where does the cloud service provider start and stop being a representative for law enforcement,\u201d asks Haber.",
    "He continues that of course if the malware in the cloud is publicly accessible, or accessible to large quantities of people, or being served to individuals as a part of an attack or other illegal activity, it is established procedure for the cloud provider to take them down immediately.",
    "However, in his opinion assessing a private instance shouldn\u2019t be subject to the same legal paradigm. This would perhaps explain the inaction of the cloud providers against the malware hosted in the threat actor\u2019s private silos.",
