    "Sony has announced a successor to its SRS-WS1 wearable speaker, the SRS-NB10, a high-concept alternative to headphone listening.",
    "A wireless neckband speaker, the SRS-NB10 is designed to rest on the shoulders of the user, allowing you to take conference calls, listen to music and \u201cwalk around in total comfort all day,\u201d according to Sony.",
    "This time around, the audio-based wearable will come boasting up to 20 hours of battery life, a splash-proof design and the company\u2019s Precise Voice Pickup Technology, which aims to ensure users are heard even when background noise is at its loudest.",
    "Sony says the SRS-NB10 features a full-range speaker unit that\u2019s angled upwards, so sound is optimised for the user\u2019s ears only. Passive radiators are embedded at the back of the speaker, too, which the brand claims will boost the bass to ensure sound is as well-balanced as possible.",
    "The clear selling point of the wireless neckband speaker, though, will be its supposedly light and comfortable design, which is intended to allow users to wear it with ease all day \u2013 even while \u201cdoing daily chores like washing up.\u201d Thanks, Sony.",
    "The SRS-NB10 will come in a choice of charcoal grey or white \u2013 colors designed to match most home or office d\u00e9cor \u2013 and be available from September 2021 for around $175 / \u00a3130 / $230.",
    "This might seem like a stroke of genius from Sony. After all, what could be better for home working than a stylish, comfortable, portable speaker that can be worn all day, every day?",
    "Well, temper your expectations, because its predecessor, the SRS-WS1, was terrible.",
    "OK, it wasn\u2019t terrible, but our verdict labelled the company\u2019s inaugural wearable effort an extremely niche speaker that offered average sound. It didn\u2019t have Bluetooth or a microphone, so it wasn\u2019t particularly useful, and its sound was artificial and lacked bass.",
    "It was also $300 (about \u00a3230, AU$451), which just wasn\u2019t good value for money.",
    "With the improvements Sony claims to have made with its successor, though, the SRS-NB10 may address those deal-breaking concerns. The wearable does now, at least, have a purpose as a workplace assistant, and sound improvements to the speaker itself appear to represent a giant leap over the disappointing dual speakers found in the SRS-WS1.",
    "It\u2019s almost half the price, too \u2013 so could Sony\u2019s latest effort actually prove a worthy investment?",
    "It\u2019s too early for us to say just yet, but stay tuned to TechRadar for our review of the SRS-NB10 wireless neckband speaker when it arrives in September."
