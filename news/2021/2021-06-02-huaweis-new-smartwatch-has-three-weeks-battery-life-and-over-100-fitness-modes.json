    "The Huawei Watch 3 is finally here, four years after the Watch 2 (though the company has put out other smartwatches in the meantime).",
    "Unveiled at a big launch event alongside a Pro version of the watch as well as new tablets and gadget software, the Huawei Watch 3 will be on sale later in June.",
    "Both devices are expensive smartwatches, with the standard model costing \u00a3349.99 (roughly $500, AU$640) and the Huawei Watch 3 Pro hitting \u00a3499.99 (about $710, AU$910 - we don't have prices for either outside the UK just yet). But perhaps their features will make up for those high prices.",
    "In many ways, the Huawei Watch 3 and 3 Pro build on some of the company's recent smartwatches. They have over 100 fitness modes, 1.43-inch screens, and circular designs like standard watches.",
    "The devices both have one rotating crown and one button, both on the right edge, which is a very Apple-Watch-like design. They also have a temperature sensor, something we haven't seen on a Huawei watch before, which lets you monitor how warm your skin stays over time.",
    "The big feature here is that the smartwatches run HarmonyOS 2, a new operating system Huawei designed to rival Google's Android ecosystem, which runs on different types of gadgets.",
    "That's mainly a design change, and on smartwatches it looks a lot like Apple's watchOS, but it hints at stronger connections between the watches and other Huawei gadgets in the future.",
    "The Huawei Watch 3 has a 14-day battery life, but the Watch 3 Pro boosts that up to 21 days (or three weeks), which is very good for a smartwatch. That's the big change between the watch versions.",
    "Want to know more? We've tried out the new smartwatch, so be sure to read our Huawei Watch 3 hands on review."
