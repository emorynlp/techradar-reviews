    "After it was first made available to the public last year, Samsung has now released a second version of its MicroLED TV \u2013 The Wall \u2013 that\u2019s even brighter and more colorful than the original.",
    "What separates The Wall from the competition now, and what made it so special last year when it came out, is that it uses MicroLED display technology to create a modular display up to 1,000 inches in size, a 120Hz refresh rate and upwards of 16K resolution (15,360 x 2,160-pixels).",
    "New this year are LEDs that are 40% smaller than last year\u2019s that should, according to Samsung at least, offer higher contrast and better color uniformity. Inside it\u2019s got a new processor running to help upscaling to its impressively large resolution and the display itself has shrunk in width allowing it to fit closer to the wall.",
    "Ideally, The Wall is going to be used as a screen for retail spaces and office buildings \u2013 but without a known price tag, budgeting for one is going to be pretty difficult.",
    "Samsung announced the news that The Wall will be available worldwide, however it didn\u2019t give an exact price per panel. That means the cost is \u2013 for both better and worse \u2013 not publicly available.",
    "That said, we can do some rough estimates to get ourselves there.",
    "Last year\u2019s version of The Wall sold for a steep, steep price of $156,000 (around \u00a3113,000 or AU$210,000) for the 110-inch version. We\u2019d expect that this year\u2019s version of The Wall to cost around the same, but there\u2019s no guarantee that the pricing for businesses this time around will be the same as it was for the general public last year as there are more factors to consider.",
    "Either way, not everyone will be in the market for a brand-new 110-inch MicroLED for their small business \u2013 but if you\u2019ve got deep enough pockets you can custom order one now on Samsung\u2019s website."
