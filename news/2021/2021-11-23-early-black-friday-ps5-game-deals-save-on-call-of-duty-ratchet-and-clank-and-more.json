    "Looking to pick up some early Black Friday deals on PS5 games? Then, you're in luck, as Walmart has just dropped some great PS5 game deals ahead of the big day later this week.",
    "Walmart may not have dropped a large quantity of PS5 game deals, but it's all about quality here. The games on offer are some of the best PS5 games you can get right now, with the newly released Call of Duty: Vanguard down to $39, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart discounted by $12, and the essential Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales priced at just $29.83. (Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region)",
    "We don't expect these prices to get any lower at Walmart during Black Friday, and it's unlikely other retailers will offer better prices on these games as Walmart is usually the one to watch in the US for excellent game deals - with Amazon a close second. If you do choose to wait until Black Friday, however, be prepared that these Black Friday PS5 deals may have sold out by then. Nothing that tickles your fancy here? Then check out our roundup of the best cheap PS5 game deals and prices for Black Friday.",
    "If you can't work out which of these games to add to your PS5 games library, then it's worth noting that you can't go wrong with any of these titles. If we're taking taste into account, then we recommend that those who love first-person shooters consider Call of Duty: Vanguard, while those looking for a more family-friendly PS5 game should consider Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (which really takes advantage of Sony's latest console's capabilities).",
    "However, our top pick out of all three is Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, which is a family-friendly adventure that will entertain both adults and kids alike. After all, who doesn't like Spider-Man?",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for PS5 games from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
