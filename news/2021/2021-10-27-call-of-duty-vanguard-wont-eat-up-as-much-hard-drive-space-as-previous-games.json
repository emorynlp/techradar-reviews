    "Call of Duty: Vanguard won\u2019t take up nearly as much room on console and PC hard drives as previous releases in the series, Activision has revealed.",
    "Activision made the announcement on Twitter via the official Call of Duty account, calling it \u201cgood news for hard drives everywhere\u201d. The tweet doesn't go into a huge amount of detail, simply explaining that \u201cnew on-demand texture streaming tech\u201d will see Call of Duty Vanguard\u2019s \u201cinstall size at launch\u201d come in \u201csignificantly below previous Call of Duty releases.\u201d",
    "In fact, this tech will apparently \u201csave up to 30%-50% on next-gen console and PC hard drive disk space\u201d.",
    "Since making this announcement, Activision has confirmed the estimated file sizes and disk space needed to play the game on various consoles. As promised the numbers are notably reduced when compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's launch in November last year and fall into that 30% to 50% reduction window, though PlayStation consoles require significantly more disk space than Xbox.",
    "In the post, Activision also notes that players can \"choose to manage storage space and reduce the game\u2019s overall file size during or after the pre-load\". Information for PC is marked as \"coming soon\".",
    "This follows a reduction in the file size of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone earlier this year after an update which took advantage of \"enhancements to the overall content management system[...]made possible through data optimization and streamlining content packs needed for individual game modes.\"",
    "Call of Duty games have long been notorious for the amount of hard drive space they take up. We've already mentioned Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's launch last year, when the game took up a sizeable 133GB of space on PlayStation 5 and an even larger 136GB on Xbox Series X.",
    "It was also only earlier this year that 500GB PS4 owners who had Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone installed were warned by Activision that they \u201cmay need to make room\u201d and \u201cdelete some unused Game Content\u201d.",
    "Suffice it to say, then, that this is surely welcome news for Call of Duty fans on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC who might have been looking anxiously at their hard drive in the run up to the game\u2019s November 5 release date.",
    "While expanding available storage is at least now an option on PS5 and Xbox Series X, it\u2019s not exactly cheap at the moment and for those without it, space is still at a premium. Visions of having to tell visitors \u201cno, no, that\u2019s not my Xbox, that\u2019s my Call of Duty machine\u201d dispelled. For now, at least."
