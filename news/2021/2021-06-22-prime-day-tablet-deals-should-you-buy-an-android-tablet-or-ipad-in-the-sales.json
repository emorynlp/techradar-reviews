    "While we bid adieu to the Prime Day deals, with the clock ticking in some regions and already run out in others, there are still a few people desperately trying to pick up last-minute deals and discounts.",
    "There have been Prime Day tablet deals covering the three main groups on the market: iPads, Amazon Fire devices and Samsung Galaxy Tabs. Some of them are over, but some remain.",
    "If you're buying a new tablet, especially if you haven't owned one before, it can be hard to know which to buy. Do you go for an iPad, an iOS device, and get in on Apple's ecosystem? What about Amazon Fire tabs, tied to the company's suite of apps? Then there's Samsung Galaxy Tabs, pure Android slates that work as close iPad rivals.",
    "To help you get your head around these three food groups, and understand the Prime Day deals that are on for them right now, we're going to run you through them.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "We're seeing a few iPad deals on Apple's entry-level range of slates, and its Pro range of top-tier slates, and here and there the Mini line of tiny tablets and Air range of mid-rangers have seen price cuts too.",
    "If you already own an Apple device, especially an iPhone, an iPad might be best for you. You'll be used to the software, and lots of the apps you already own can easily be ported over.",
    "Plus, iPads are designed to be easily accessible to people who aren't necessarily up on their tech, so they'll be easy to use for all.",
    "On the downside, iPads are pretty expensive, even during Prime Day, as the deals aren't knocking too much off the asking price of these slates. That price just goes up if you want accessories like a keyboard or stylus.",
    "Amazon's own-brand range of slates are perhaps the most popular Android tablets, although you're technically getting a fork of the Android software that's designed by Amazon.",
    "These slates are super affordable, costing just a fraction of other devices. Even if you go for the bigger Fire HD 10 devices, you won't be paying too much. Prime Day deals bring the prices down even lower.",
    "The slates are also hardy with plastic shells and big batteries, so they've got lots of stopping power for adventures and long journeys.",
    "The problem with Amazon Fire tablets is that they're locked to Amazon's ecosystem of apps, as they're designed for entertainment. So if you want a portable tab for Prime Video, Prime Music, Netflix, Spotify and the like, they'll be perfect - but they're not great for productivity or creativity.",
    "Samsung's Galaxy Tab devices are close iPad rivals. The Tab A line consists of affordable slates and the Tab S devices are top-end Android powerhouses.",
    "The Android ecosystem is a bit more open than iOS, with a bigger selection of apps and different ways to customize the way you work. Plus, it'll work better alongside an Android phone.",
    "Plus, Samsung tablets are pretty powerful, with long-lasting batteries and, most importantly, beautiful screens.",
    "On to the negatives: the Android OS still doesn't work well for tablets, compared to smartphones. Plus, sometimes Samsung's slates can be a little pricey for what they are, and the stylus experience isn't as good as on iPad.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the various tablets from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
