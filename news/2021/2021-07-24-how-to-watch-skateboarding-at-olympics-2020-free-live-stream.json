    "Street sees skaters performing on a course reminiscent of your local skate park, with athletes enjoying free reign across handrails, benches, and curbs. Brazil\u2019s Leticia Bufoni is women\u2019s favorite for gold in Street, though younger skaters like Pamela Rosa, Rayssa Leal, and Aori Nishimura are hot on her wheels.",
    "Park offers a throwback to skateboarding\u2019s Venice Beach roots, using hollowed-out swimming pools as its stage. With steep inclines and smooth surfaces, skaters can expect to fly high while enjoying the freedom to create a run as impressive as they like. History will be made by thirteen-year-old Team GB skater Sky Brown, as she makes her debut performance in Tokyo as Britain's youngest Olympian. Certainly, a performance to watch.",
