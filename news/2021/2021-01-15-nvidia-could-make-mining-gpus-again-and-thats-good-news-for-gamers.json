    "Nvidia is keeping a close watch on developments with crypto-mining regarding its graphics cards, and is potentially ready to again start making new dedicated GPUs for that purpose \u2013 a move that could potentially help ease the stock pressures on RTX 3000 products.",
    "This news comes from a conference call with Nvidia\u2019s CFO Colette Kress as reported by Seeking Alpha, in which the subject of whether cryptocurrency mining has contributed \u2018meaningfully\u2019 to RTX 3000 sales \u2013 and the huge demand for Ampere GPUs \u2013 was raised.",
    "Kress noted that: \u201cWe don\u2019t have visibility on how much of the RTX 30 Series end demand comes from mining. So, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a big part of our business today. Gaming demand is very strong, and we think that\u2019s larger than our current supply. This time feels different than what we had seen several years ago for a couple of reasons.\u201d",
    "Kress is referring here to the big spike of crypto-mining demand in 2018, and this time around with Ampere, she observes that \u201cinventory levels are now very lean, and we have better visibility into that channel inventory\u201d.",
    "She concludes: \u201cSo, in summary, if crypto demand begins or if we see a meaningful amount, we can also use that opportunity to restart the CMP product line to address ongoing mining demand.\u201d",
    "In short, what Nvidia is saying here is that it can\u2019t be sure exactly how much RTX 3000 demand is driven by crypto-miners, but if the cryptocurrency market continues to look a strong proposition, then CMP model production could be cranked up.",
    "CMP refers to dedicated crypto-mining cards, which remove the video outputs (miners don\u2019t need them) and can be made (and therefore sold) more cheaply \u2013 or indeed in the current climate, any availability at all would likely be a selling point.",
    "While Bitcoin mining may be the province of ASICs, other coins are still ripe targets for utilizing GPUs for mining operations, notably Ethereum which has been on a major upward trajectory (not quite to the same extent as Bitcoin, but it\u2019s still ramped up a lot in the latest crypto explosion).",
    "Theoretically, if Nvidia does make dedicated mining cards again, that could ease the amount of RTX 3000 GPUs which are potentially being bought for this purpose rather than gaming.",
    "So that would certainly be a good thing \u2013 although there is also the argument that miners would likely prefer to buy a fully-fledged GPU rather than a CMP model anyway, for resale value down the line (for example if \u2013 or arguably when \u2013 the crypto bubble bursts with a vengeance).",
    "At any rate, gamers struggling to buy an RTX 3000 graphics card to enjoy playing the latest big releases, and who believe crypto demand isn\u2019t helping Nvidia\u2019s well-documented stock shortages \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly seen some evidence that suggests this is the case \u2013 can be hopeful that perhaps Nvidia will take the course of pushing out CMP products for miners.",
