    "Scotland's dreams of a first Six Nations title since 1999 (when it was still the Five Nations) withered in their defeat to Ireland last weekend, leaving them fifth in the standings with only Italy below them. However, Gregor Townsend's men have a game in hand over everyone bar France, and could still surge up the table and into second, which would mark their highest finish since that triumph 22 years ago, in which Townsend shone as a player. Read on for how to get a Scotland vs Italy live stream and watch Six Nations rugby online right now - including for free across the UK and in Ireland.",
    "Wooden spoon secured for the sixth year in a row, Franco Smith's team is playing to avoid another humiliating sweep of defeats. Italy haven't won a Six Nations game since 2015, and their points difference of -142 this year is shocking.",
    "Scotland may be wondering what might have been if their France clash hadn't been postponed. It left them kicking their feet for a month, the momentum from their promising start wasted. Yet they came agonisingly close against Ireland, clawing back a 14-point deficit only to lose out to a late penalty.",
    "They may have to cope without Finn Russell and Jonny Gray today, both of whom were unable to complete the Ireland game, while Scott Cummings is out with a broken hand. Zander Fagerson, however, is back in the fold after serving his four-week suspension.",
    "The title may be out of reach, but Scotland could still finish as the best of the rest. Follow our guide below as we explain all the ways to get a Six Nations live stream and how to watch Scotland vs Italy FREE online today.",
    "If you're outside your country of residence - whether that's Scotland or anywhere else - and try to stream the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
