    "If you were wondering whether Valve might consider having exclusive games for its incoming Steam Deck handheld, the answer is no.",
    "The clarification comes from Valve\u2019s Steam Deck FAQ for game developers, in the wrap-up section at the end, where one question is: \u201cWould Valve be interested in having any Steam Deck exclusive titles?\u201d",
    "The answer is a simple: \u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t make much sense to us. It\u2019s a PC and it should just play games like a PC.\u201d",
    "What\u2019s interesting here is this nugget of info from the FAQ viewed in light of what we heard from the rumor mill (specifically YouTuber Tyler McVicker) about Valve making a Half-Life-based co-op game codenamed \u2018Citadel\u2019 designed to showcase the Steam Deck \u2013 which might have got folks thinking about some kind of \u2018exclusive\u2019 for the handheld.",
    "The message, then, for PC gamers at large, is not to worry that somehow the next outing in the Half-Life franchise could be for Steam Deck owners only. Of course, that\u2019s never going to happen realistically \u2013 there\u2019s no way Valve would run the risk of annoying mainstream desktop PC gamers, or muddying the idea that the Steam Deck is a PC through-and-through, as observed in the FAQ statement. But maybe after Half-Life: Alyx being made for VR, some folks out there are a bit paranoid.",
    "If the aforementioned Citadel (purportedly a shooter and RTS hybrid) is indeed real, it\u2019ll be for mouse and keyboard-toting PC gamers as well as Steam Deck \u2013 although it could still be built to take advantage of the abilities of the handheld PC such as gyro controls. As Valve notes elsewhere in the FAQ, the gyro offers \u201cfiner precision for people that are used to gamepad inputs, but also take[s] the mouse paradigm from the desktop into a portable form factor\u201d.",
    "Furthermore, regarding McVicker\u2019s rumor about Citadel, Valve told PC Gamer: \u201cWe think it\u2019s important to reiterate that while Tyler is a passionate gamer, he has no inside information about what goes on at Valve. Any important announcements on projects that we are or aren\u2019t working on will come directly from us.\u201d",
