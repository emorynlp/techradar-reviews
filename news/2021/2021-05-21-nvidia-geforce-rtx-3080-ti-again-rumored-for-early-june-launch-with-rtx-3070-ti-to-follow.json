  "title": "Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti again rumored for early June launch, with RTX 3070 Ti to follow",
  "category": "computing",

  "summary": "Plus RTX 3080 Ti has been spotted (once more) with 12GB of VRAM",
  "article": [
    "Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti are imminent, according to the grapevine \u2013 with plenty of speculation on these GPUs pouring forth recently \u2013 and another couple of rumors have cropped up, one reinforcing the 3080 Ti\u2019s purported 12GB of VRAM, and the other giving us a slightly adjusted launch timeframe for these GPUs.",
    "Let\u2019s deal with the latter first, and according to Wccftech\u2019s sources, the RTX 3080 Ti will be out on June 3, with its lesser sibling, the RTX 3070 Ti, set to emerge a week later on June 10.",
    "Previous chatter has pointed to an early June launch, and indeed the last rumor insisted on a timeframe of June 2 and June 9 respectively, only a day out from this fresh gossip \u2013 and consistent with that week-long gap between the two GPUs going on sale. Of course, we have to take all this with a good deal of caution, and Wccftech itself makes it clear that this is only what Nvidia supposedly has planned right now, and that could change.",
    "The RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti are expected to be announced on May 31, which has been what the rumor mill has contended for a while now, meaning the reveal will come at Computex 2021.",
    "Now, we\u2019ve argued that this might not make a whole lot of sense in terms of Nvidia\u2019s big angle at Computex being AI and data center products, but it\u2019s certainly possible that Team Green could be planning an Ampere reveal too.",
    "After all, a Computex press release specifically mentions Nvidia and the opportunities involved with \u2018GeForce PC gaming\u2019, although that doesn\u2019t necessarily entail a Ti variant launch (it could be something to do with the GPU stock situation, perhaps wrapped up with the anti-crypto-mining measures Nvidia is implementing \u2013 who knows).",
    "The other option would be an E3 reveal, but that would come after all the rumored on-sale dates we\u2019ve seen flying around; so certainly don\u2019t rule Computex out.",
    "As for the other nugget from the GPU rumor mongers today, that\u2019s about the RTX 3080 Ti, which has been spotted at the Korean National Radio Research Agency (RRA) in the form of cards registered by Palit and Leadtek (as highlighted by hardware leaker @harukaze5719 on Twitter, via VideoCardz).",
    "Both of these 3080 Ti models are shown with 12GB of video RAM, which again reinforces previous leakage that this will be the memory configuration. The 3080 Ti should use pretty much the exact same design as the existing RTX 3080 (in other words, 2.5-slot, triple fan, with the same overall board design).",
    "The 3070 Ti wasn\u2019t mentioned in this new bit of spillage, but previously we\u2019ve heard that it will run with 8GB of VRAM."
