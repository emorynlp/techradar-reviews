    "With payment technology evolving at eye-popping speed, consumers continue to be bombarded with a variety of different payment options at retail operations. The invention of some of the best cloud POS systems, or web-based point-of-sale systems ever seen, allows retailers to provide a variety of payment platforms easily and from the same device, minus the hassle of an old-school cash register.",
    "With the variety of options for modern-day cloud POS systems, it can be a headache for business-owners to understand which option they should choose. TechRadar breaks down the benefits of top-rated cloud-based systems in this article",
    "TechRadar also states that a recent study revealed that 50% of consumers globally prefer could-based payment methods versus the hassle and inconvenience of carrying cash.

    "A could POS system is an online point of sale system that allows business owners the ability to process payments through the internet rather than a desktop computer. Cloud-based POS systems let operators store transaction, inventory, employee and other business data on a remote server.",
    "Given that cloud POS systems fall under SaaS (Software as a Service) they often employ a subscription model for business-owners. As an owner, this means you have access to tech support, automatic software updates (a big selling point from traditional POS systems), staff training and dedicated account management, plus enhanced encryption security.",
    "This technology provides business owners the opportunity to operate more competently, and effectively for their consumer-base. Transactions are faster, safer, and track more data than ever before.",
    "Cloud POS systems are also capable of running on virtually any device \u2013 including a tablet or cell phone. Small businesses such as boutique retail operations, food trucks, mom and pop restaurants, home service providers, etc. highly benefit from these systems as they are more-feasibly transportable for on-the-job transactions.",
    "That\u2019s not all either \u2013 cloud-based POS systems also allow operators to access their point of sale from any location as well and manage their business remotely. With the advancement of internet technology, most cloud systems rely on a wireless network, so there isn\u2019t a need to connect physically to a land-based server.",
    "So what are the components of this savvy modern payment system? Well, it can be made up of hardware and software. A stable touchscreen is needed to serve as the system monitor, allowing consumers to utilize a pen, or fingertip, to navigate through the transaction. A customizable customer touchscreen display provides the business owner the opportunity to ask customers to sign up for loyalty programs, review orders, sign receipts, etc. And of course a card reader is required to take payments.",
    "A hard drive is also a necessary component to ensure efficient system operations. Some cloud-based systems have upgraded to SSD (solid state) hard drives, which run smoother and more efficiently than standard hard drives. A router can be included to allow the business owner the ability to securely send data between various devices, and a printer to provide hard copies of any necessary documentations.",
    "An article by financesonline.com breaks down the significant benefits cloud-based systems have over legacy systems through their retail consulting research. Here is what they discovered: 35% of retailers are already offering personalized rewards based on customer loyalty.",

    "It is extremely beneficial if you operate multi-stores at different locations. For instance, when you sell an item at a specific store, the available amount of that item on that outlet will be changed accordingly. In addition, the level of stock is immediately deducted in the warehouse.\u201d",
    "This is always the question-of-the-day when it comes to technology isn\u2019t it? In our guide to the Best POS systems we advise that business owners will likely only pay once for hardware, then monthly for software use and additional services. Not all providers charge a monthly fee, however, but rather take a percentage from the transaction, such as Square.",
    "We also state that costs have come down in recent years, and the payment screen, card reader and printer can be acquired for the cost of a single terminal \u2013 around $600. The options vary depending on which components you choose for your business.",
