  "article": [
    "The story of Black Friday 2021 when it came to offers on VPN services was that all the biggest providers went early with their promotions - we were seeing big discounts from the likes of NordVPN and Surfshark as early as late October!",
    "When PureVPN entered the fray in mid-November, it pulled the rug out from under the feet of all the other providers when it came to sheer price point. And with Cyber Monday now arriving, it's apparent that story isn't about to change.",
    "The provider started off by discounting the monthly rate of its five-year subscription to $1.33 per month. And then it gave TechRadar an exclusive discount coupon to take an extra 15% off. Insert the code tech15 at the checkout to take 15% off the offer price.",
    "That means you'll pay a barely believable $1.13 (approx. \u00a30.85 / AU$1.59) per month for your new VPN. Take a quick look at our Black Friday VPN deals guide, and you'll see that no other quality VPN provider gets close.",
    "Without going for an inferior free VPN, no provider comes close to touching this pricing. Just take a look at our dedicated VPN deals guide if you don't believe us.",
    "It is worth noting that - just like pretty much every other VPN company out there - PureVPN requires that you pay the whole amount upfront. So although it's advertised as being $1.33 per month, you'll have to pay for the whole five years. With the 15% discount, that means a cost of $67.96.",
    "But if you're not happy with PureVPN's services, it also offers a 31-day money-back guarantee. That makes this a real risk-free Cyber Monday bargain.",
    "If you want to go for a service with a better reputation than Pure, then there are still some great prizes to be had. Among the biggest names are NordVPN, which is down to $3.29 a month for two years, and Surfshark, which is now all the way down to an effective $2.21/pm for the next 27 months.",
    "Private Internet Access can go even cheaper if you're happy to commit to three years. Having thrown in an extra three months free, the monthly cost is now set at a tiny $2.03.",
    "And what of our #1 recommended provider, ExpressVPN? Well, frankly, it can't compete with the rest on price alone. Its monthly cost is $6.67 per month, with three months extra free on its annual plan. But you do at least get Backblaze secure cloud backup thrown in as well.",
    "There are loooooads of VPN uses. Virtual Private Networks allow bypass geo-restricted content. So if you wanted to watch a Netflix show that is geo-restricted to a location, a VPN changes your IP address, so your device gets tricked into thinking it's in a different location. Make sure to check out our Netflix VPN guide if your primary reason for a VPN is streaming, while they're also brilliant for letting you watch sports and shows that are only available overseas.",
    "Some people will be more concerned about the fact VPNs help you browse the internet securely. A VPN uses encryption technology that basically means your browsing and activity will be anonymous. So if you're worried about your cyber security, a VPN is definitely the way to go.",
    "Beyond that, they help get around blocked websites and apps in countries that ban them, assist in secure online banking and shopping (especially on public Wi-Fi), and have even been known to get around broadband bandwidth throttling and bag cheaper flights on comparison sites, too.",
