  "article": [
    "Microsoft is changing its default font \u2013 the one used off the bat in Microsoft 365 apps, including the Office apps many folks use every day like Word \u2013 and the company wants users to pick their favorite option from a choice of five.",
    "As detailed in a Microsoft 365 blog post, the five options are: Tenorite, Bierstadt, Skeena, Seaford, and Grandview. While this isn\u2019t a formal vote as such, the software giant encourages people to head on over to social media (linking the Microsoft 365 Twitter account) and make their voices heard.",
    "So, if you have any opinion on the font options and feel a compulsion to chip in, provide your feedback\u2026",
    "As you\u2019re likely aware, Calibri is the current default font of Microsoft\u2019s choosing, and its reign has lasted since 2007 (before that, it was that old chestnut Times New Roman).",
    "Regardless of which font is finally chosen as the successor to Calibri as the new default, all of the five new efforts will be available in Office apps, and indeed they are present now. Pop into Office 365 and you can see and use the fonts to check them out in their full glory.",
    "The blog post goes into a lot of detail about the design philosophy behind each of the five different fonts, which \u201cspan the various sans-serif styles \u2013 humanist, geometric, swiss-style, and industrial\u201d.",
    "In short, Tenorite is a very rounded, wide and crisp font, Bierstadt is clear-cut and \u2018mechanical\u2019, Skeena looks clean and has distinctive thicker and thinner strokes for the different bits of the letters, Seaford offers \u201cgently organic and asymmetric forms\u201d, with Grandview looking rather, well, grand, and built around being highly legible and generally standing out.",
    "We\u2019re finding ourselves gravitating towards Skeena\u2019s clear and distinctive appearance, at least on initial impressions. So, there\u2019s our vote, Microsoft, if you\u2019re reading\u2026"
