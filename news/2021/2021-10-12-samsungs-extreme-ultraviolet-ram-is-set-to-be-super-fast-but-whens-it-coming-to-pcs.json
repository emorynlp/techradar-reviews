    "Samsung has announced that it has started mass producing what it claims is the \u2018industry\u2019s smallest\u2019 14-nanometer (nm) DDR5 DRAM, offering drastically improved speeds over the previous generation DDR4 RAM (which is what most of our PCs are currently using).",
    "By utilising the pretty awesome sounding extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology, Samsung has increased the number of EUV layers in its DDR5 chips, allowing them to be smaller, but with a higher density.",
    "This looks set to bring a range of exciting possibilities. For a start, Samsung says its 14nm DDR5 DRAM will be able to hit speeds of 7.2 gigabits per second (Gbps), which is over twice the speed of DDR4, which peaks at 3.2Gbps.",
    "By being smaller and denser, power consumption could be cut by up to 20%, and Samsung also hopes this will improve overall wafer productivity \u2013 essentially meaning it should be able to create more usable chips using this process \u2013 particularly important whilst we\u2019re in a midst of a global chip shortage.",
    "In Samsung\u2019s announcement, Jooyoung Lee, Senior Vice President and Head of DRAM Product & Technology at Samsung Electronics, explains that \u201cmulti-layer EUV\u2026 has enabled extreme miniaturization at 14nm \u2014 a feat not possible with the conventional argon fluoride (ArF) process.\u201d",
    "So, Samsung is making RAM that\u2019s drastically faster, more power efficient and should hopefully be in plentiful supply? Sign us up.",
    "For anyone keen to upgrade their PC with Samsung\u2019s new memory, how soon will they be able to? Sadly, it may be a while. In Samsung\u2019s announcement, the company doesn\u2019t give any consumer release dates.",
    "Instead, Lee talks about how this new memory is helping Samsung to address \u201cthe need for greater performance and capacity in the data-driven world of 5G, AI and the metaverse.\u201d So, this memory looks like it will be aimed \u2013 primarily at least \u2013 at data center, supercomputer and servers.",
    "However, we\u2019d love to see this come in some form to consumer RAM as well.",
    "We are starting to see DDR5 RAM hitting the shelves, however, so that RAM upgrade may not be too far off. However, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have a CPU and motherboard that support the new memory \u2013 Intel\u2019s Alder Lake processors will be the first to do so, and we hope to see them before the end of 2021.",
    "Of course, with any brand-new technology, it may be worth holding off for a while. DDR5 RAM will initially be very expensive (plus there\u2019s the expense of buying new processors and motherboards to factor in), and by waiting a while you should see prices drop as more options come to market.",
    "It\u2019ll also allow new advancements \u2013 such as Samsung\u2019s 14nm process \u2013 to arrive, hopefully offering noticeably improved performance over the first wave of products.",
    "When you\u2019re keen to upgrade, having to wait may be hard, but in this case it could really be worth it."
