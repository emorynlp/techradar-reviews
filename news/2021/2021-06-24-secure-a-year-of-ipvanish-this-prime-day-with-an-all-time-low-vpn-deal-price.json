    "It's a known fact that when it comes to signing up to a VPN, it works out as better value for money if you commit to one of the provider's longer term plans. And it just got even cheaper if you make the most of IPVanish and its current summer saving on its 12-month plan.",
    "Usually offering a hefty discount on your first year, the saving just got even bigger with up to 68% off IPVanish for your first 12 months.",
    "Now costing just $28.79 for your first year, that works out at only $2.40 a month for IPVanish. If you want to bag even better value for money, you can get the VPN with its cloud backup package for just $2.66 a month, making your money stretch that bit further.",
    "Make the most of one of the best current VPN deals while it's still around - this IPVanish promotion is expected to end June 28.",
    "It's worth noting, while the monthly rate works out as $2.49 a month, you will be paying $28.79 in one payment for the whole year, thereafter paying $89.99 a year if you choose to continue with your membership.",
    "Those who want to benefit from secure cloud storage on top can pay $31.99 for their first year before it renews to $99.99 a year.",
    "There's no question this is a fantastic VPN provider. Sitting in our buying guide for top-tier VPNs, IPVanish fits the bill with an array of superb features that help to improve the security, speed, and overall experience as you browse online.",
    "Boasting 1,600 servers in total across over 75 countries around the world, IPVanish boots security with the help of IKEv2, OpenVPN, L2TP, IPSec and P2P protocols, as well as great features like a dedicated kill switch, AES-256 encryption, DNS and IPv6 leak protection, on top of its no logging policy.",
    "Depending on which package you opt for, you'll also be able to benefit from secure cloud storage from SugarSync. For any files taking up space on your devices, then, you can store in the cloud with 500GB of data to use that you can sync across your devices so you can access it wherever you are.",
    "Unlimited connections to boot, IPVanish can be installed across your own personal devices, as well as sharing with the rest of your household to better keep under lock and key your browsing history.",
    "A VPN or Virtual Private Network allows you to browse the internet securely and bypass geo-restricted content. So say for instance you wanted to access a Netflix show or movie which is geo-restricted to a location, you could access this through a VPN. A VPN changes your IP address, effectively tricking your device into thinking it's in a different location.",
    "Is your main concern for getting a VPN streaming? Make sure to check out our best Netflix VPN guide.",
    "Apart from bypassing geo-restricted content a VPN is also crucial in maintaining cybersecurity, which is another reason why it has become so increasingly popular. A VPN uses encryption technologies which basically mean you're browsing anonymously.",
    "And it doesn't stop there, as our article on the more obscure VPN uses explains."
