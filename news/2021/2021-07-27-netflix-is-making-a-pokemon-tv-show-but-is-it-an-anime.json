    "An original Pok\u00e9mon TV show is reportedly in early development at Netflix, according to industry insiders.",
    "The claim comes via Variety, whose sources have alleged that a Pok\u00e9mon TV series is in the works at the streaming giant.",
    "However, given how early it is in its development cycle, there's very little information about its plot, characters or how it'll tie into the wider Pok\u00e9mon universe.",
    "While much of the project remains a secret, there are a couple of things that we do know about Netflix's Pok\u00e9mon series.",
    "According to Variety, Lucifer co-showrunner Joe Henderson is attached to write and executively produce the TV show. Lucifer is one of Netflix's more popular TV shows, so installing Henderson as its Pok\u00e9mon TV writer-producer is a smart move.",
    "As for whether Netflix's Pok\u00e9mon project will be an anime or not, it isn't expected to be. Instead, Variety claims that the series will be live-action in much the same vein as 2019 Pok\u00e9mon movie Detective Pikachu, which starred Ryan Reynolds as the titular character.",
    "Netflix's desire to produce a live-action Pok\u00e9mon TV show isn't that surprising.",
    "The streamer has become the home for multiple Pok\u00e9mon animated productions (both 2D and CGI), so it appears that Netflix wants to nail down its place as the go-to platform for Pok\u00e9mon TV shows and movies \u2013 in the Western world, anyway.",
    "The decision to make a live-action Pok\u00e9mon show will also help to differentiate Netflix's original Pok\u00e9mon projects from the animated films and TV series that it airs through its licensing deal with The Pok\u00e9mon Company. Making a live-action series instead of an animated one, then, seems like the right move to make.",
    "However, despite the global box office success of Detective Pikachu \u2013 the only live-action Pok\u00e9mon production to date \u2013 fan reception to the Netflix Pok\u00e9mon news has been mixed.",
    "Users on the Pok\u00e9mon, Television and Netflix Reddit pages have been left divided by Variety's report, with some expressing happiness over the news while others have deep reservations about it.",
    "Our view? Netflix has done a good job with its other video game adaptations, such as Castlevania and The Witcher, regardless of whether they've been animated or live-action, so there's every chance that the streamer can do a similarly decent job with its Pok\u00e9mon TV show.",
    "It'll have to get the style, tone and aesthetic right, though, to win over fans. We've recently seen how making changes to hugely popular series can cause a massive fan backlash (we're looking at you, He-Man).",
    "If Netflix hopes that its Pok\u00e9mon TV series will be received well (or better), it has to do right by the franchise \u2013 or Pok\u00e9mon fans, just like He-Man's fanbase, won't be happy."
