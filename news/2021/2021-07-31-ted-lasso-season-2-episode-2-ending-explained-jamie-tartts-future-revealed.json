    "Spoilers follow for Ted Lasso season 2 episode 2 \u2018Lavender\u2019.",
    "The second episode of Ted Lasso season 2 has landed on Apple TV Plus, and its cliffhanger ending could lead to some tense moments for Ted (Jason Sudeikis) and AFC Richmond\u2019s squad moving forward.",
    "Jamie Tartt, the egotistical but talented soccer player who spent time on loan at Richmond last season, has returned to the club \u2013 and, this time, he\u2019s back permanently.",
    "Given that Ted has spent months building a harmonious dressing room atmosphere, Jamie\u2019s shock return threatens to undo that good work. So how will Richmond\u2019s players, including Sam Obisanya (Toheeb Jimoh) react to Jamie\u2019s signing? And what could Jamie\u2019s return mean for Richmond\u2019s chances of promotion back to the Premier League?",
    "Ahead of Ted Lasso season 2 episode 2\u2019s release, TechRadar sat down with Phil Dunster, who plays Jamie in the show, to find out just how divisive Jamie\u2019s return could be.",
    "Jamie was conspicuously absent for much of season 2\u2019s opening episode but, as viewers will now know, there was a reason for this: Jamie had signed up to be a contestant on Lust Conquers All, a satirical take on reality TV dating shows like Love Island.",
    "Within the first 10 minutes of episode 2, though, Jamie\u2019s entire world comes crashing down.",
    "After he\u2019s voted off Lust Conquers All, Jamie learns that Manchester City \u2013 the team he left to appear on the reality TV series \u2013 don\u2019t want him back. A chat with his agent, too, reveals that there are no clubs that want to take a punt on him either. The reason? \u201cYou\u2019re seen as a liability,\u201d Jamie\u2019s agent tells him.",
    "Despondent and desperate, Jamie meets up with Ted to ask if he can return to Richmond in a permanent capacity. The duo engage in a heart-to-heart, but Ted turns Jamie\u2019s request down.",
    "That is, until Ted appears to change his mind as a result of conversations with Sam and Doctor Sharon Fieldstone (Sarah Niles), the club's newly appointed sports psychologist.",
    "A photograph of Ted and Jamie\u2019s meeting leaks online and, once he hears that Jamie may be coming back, Sam storms off. Ted follows him to reveal that Jamie won\u2019t be returning.",
    "Ted, though, reconsiders his stance when Sam inadvertently reminds him that Richmond haven\u2019t won yet this season. A similar point is made by Sharon, who prompts Ted to change something as his team is on a run of eight straight draws.",
    "Cue episode 2\u2019s climactic scene, with Jamie \u2013 kitted out in Richmond\u2019s training gear \u2013 arriving for first-team training, much to the displeasure of Sam and Richmond\u2019s other players.",
    "For Dunster, Jamie\u2019s sudden reappearance, and the potential impact it\u2019ll have on Richmond\u2019s squad, is a reflection of real-life soccer where players don\u2019t get along with all of their teammates. Even so, given the positive environment that Ted has fostered since Jamie\u2019s departure, his return could spell danger for Richmond\u2019s team spirit.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trepidation to Jamie coming back,\u201d Dunster tells TechRadar. \u201cIn Sam\u2019s case, you have this person who has been thriving because Jamie is no longer there, but now has to deal with him wanting to come back. And the team and Ted seem open to it [Jamie\u2019s return], so Sam feels betrayed by that. It\u2019s a brilliant idea on our writers\u2019 part as it\u2019s what would actually happen at a football club.\u201d",
    "The muted reaction to Jamie\u2019s return, though, is indicative of what Richmond\u2019s squad initially thinks of Ted\u2019s decision \u2013 and Jamie can sense it.",
    "Manchester City\u2019s sudden recall of Jamie from his loan spell last term, combined with him setting up the goal that relegated Richmond in the season 1 finale, means that Jamie has plenty of bridges to mend if he wants to regain his teammates\u2019 trust.",
    "He was Richmond\u2019s star player before Ted\u2019s arrival. Now, though, Jamie finds himself as the outsider of the group for the first time in his career \u2013 and it\u2019s a position that, while alien to Jamie, might be the catalyst for real change within him.",
    "\u201cHe understands that people are going to be upset with him,\u201d Dunster explains. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t quite know how to deal with that yet, but their reactions don\u2019t surprise him. He\u2019s an underdog for the first time in his professional career and people aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s going to work out. But, as we see throughout this episode and the rest of the series, he finds very Jamie-esque ways to try and win hearts and minds.\u201d",
    "Judging by Jamie\u2019s past attempts to do the right thing and win people over, viewers can expect more bumps in the road as Jamie looks to redeem himself. Under Ted\u2019s guidance at his spiritual home of AFC Richmond, though, Jamie is in the right place to improve personally and professionally. If he does, maybe, just maybe, Richmond can truly start to believe in that dream Premier League return.",
    "The first two episodes of Ted Lasso season 2 are available to stream now on Apple TV Plus."
