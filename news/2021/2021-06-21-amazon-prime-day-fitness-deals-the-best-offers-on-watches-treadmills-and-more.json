    "We've seen a huge array of fitness equipment in this year's Prime Day deals, including big savings on top brands like Garmin, Fitbit and XIaomi.",
    "Fitness trackers and smartwatches make up the bulk of this year's deals, so if you've been thinking of investing in a new sports watch then this is the perfect time. Most of these devices are at their cheapest prices ever, and we don't expect they'll drop this low again until Black Friday (perhaps not even then).",
    "We've also found some great offers on other fitness equipment, including treadmills and running headphones, and we'll be keeping a close eye out for new deals throughout the rest of Prime Day so you don't miss a thing."
