  "summary": "New patch means the game should run much more smoothly in general",
  "article": [
    "Resident Evil Village just got a patch on PC which aims to smooth over frame rate hitches caused by the game\u2019s anti-piracy countermeasures (DRM), while also potentially giving a further frames per second boost via AMD\u2019s new FidelityFX Super Resolution (or FSR for short).",
    "The official Resident Evil Twitter account announced an important update on Steam, noting that \u201cadjustments have been made to optimize the anti-piracy technology\u201d of the game.",
    "As you might have seen, there was a good deal of controversy last week when Digital Foundry discovered that a cracked version of Resident Evil Village ran smoothly, where a retail copy exhibited stuttering issues that messed with the smoothness of gameplay.",
    "Capcom acknowledged the problem and promised it was \u201cworking on a patch to address PC performance issues\u201d which \u201cshould be available soon\u201d, and it appears that this solution has now arrived.",
    "While the patch notes don\u2019t directly address or mention stuttering, rather just that an \u2018optimization\u2019 was applied, it\u2019s obviously enough a fair assumption that this is the cure Capcom was talking about last week. And indeed anecdotal reports on social media indicate that it has improved frame rates for some gamers in situations which were previously proving problematic.",
    "Note that Resident Evil Village actually used a double layer of DRM, with both Denuvo and Capcom\u2019s own anti-piracy tech.",
    "The other change as we mentioned at the outset is the introduction of support for FSR, which is AMD\u2019s equivalent of DLSS (remember that FSR can benefit all graphics cards, not just AMD models, if a game doesn\u2019t have support for DLSS \u2013 and Village does not, though it does offer ray tracing). We knew this was coming because AMD had previously let us know that Resident Evil Village was in line for the FSR treatment.",
    "Like DLSS, the idea is to boost frame rates, and again anecdotally, there seem to be some nice little fps bumps for those early adopters who\u2019ve already patched up and reported their findings \u2013 like an extra 10 fps for an RX 580 on the \u2018high quality\u2019 setting (presumably meaning \u2018ultra\u2019 or max image quality).",
