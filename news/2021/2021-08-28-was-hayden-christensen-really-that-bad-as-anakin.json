  "article": [
    "I\u2019m going to say it: I like the Star Wars prequels.",
    "Granted, my opinion is surely warped by my proximity in age to George Lucas\u2019 CGI-filled adventures and yes, the original movies guided by Lucas, Kershner and Marquand are objectively superior feats of filmmaking. But that doesn\u2019t make the franchise\u2019s turn-of-the-millennium entries any less enjoyable.",
    "Revenge of the Sith is, obviously, the best of the three, though Attack of the Clones boasts some pretty great set-pieces, too \u2013 Geonosis! Kamino! \u2013 that keep it streets ahead of the Phantom Menace when it comes to my fondest memories of the iconic franchise.",
    "But the latter two movies stick in the mind for another reason \u2013 a toe-curling, braid-wearing, sand-hating reason by the name of Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christensen.",
    "In light of his upcoming role in the now-fully-shot Obi-Wan Kenobi series on Disney Plus, we ask the question: was Hayden Christensen really that bad as Anakin?",
    "For starters, it\u2019s worth drawing attention to Christensen\u2019s career prior to his appearance in Attack of the Clones.",
    "The Vancouver-born actor made his debut at just 12 years old on a Canadian TV series, Family Passions, which led to minor roles in movies throughout the late \u201890s, the most notable being Sofia Coppola\u2019s The Virgin Suicides.",
    "Christensen\u2019s breakout role came in 2000, when he starred in the Fox show Higher Ground as a teen who turns to drugs after being sexually molested by his stepmother. The following year, he would appear again as a misunderstood teenager (you see the pattern?) in Irvin Winkler\u2019s Life as a House, which earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations.",
    "Prior to the release of the latter, it was announced that Christensen would be starring as an adult Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episodes 2 and 3, following an audition process that saw casting director Robin Gurland sift through more than 1,500 candidates.",
    "According to a 2002 profile on Gurland, she said of the young actor at the time: \"When Hayden came for his first meeting, I opened the door, and I just suddenly became flushed, because I knew. I sat him down and looked at him through the camera, and all of a sudden, I could feel goosebumps.\u201d",
    "\"For Anakin, the role is so innate, the actor has to connect with it,\u201d Gurland is quoted as saying, \u201cbut by the end of [the interview], I just knew that Anakin had walked in the door.\u201d",
    "In fairness, Christensen\u2019s selection over 1,499 other prospective Anakin\u2019s has little bearing on whether he proved himself a talented performer in that casting call.",
    "The role of the ill-fated Jedi \u2013 whether Lucas intended this to be the case or not \u2013 was an innately physical one. The director himself is alleged to have approved Christensen\u2019s casting because he \"needed an actor who [had] that presence of the Dark Side.\u201d In all likelihood, the young Canadian probably just had the right moody eyes for the job.",
    "But irrespective of his now much-maligned, stilted line delivery and the character's general whininess in both Episodes 2 and 3 (though in the former, particularly), there\u2019s still something to be said for Christensen\u2019s physicality, which contributes to Revenge of the Sith\u2019s most powerful moments.",
    "For instance, when Anakin first sees Padm\u00e9 again after crash-landing on Coruscant, the mannerisms in Christensen\u2019s face betray his character\u2019s excitement, anxiety and fear at hearing the news of his wife\u2019s pregnancy in a genuinely convincing manner \u2013 before being undermined entirely by the film\u2019s god-awful dialogue, that is.",
    "The same is true of Padm\u00e9\u2019s arrival on Mustafar with Obi-Wan, when Christensen\u2019s body language paints a far more impactful picture of Anakin\u2019s confusion, anger and loss of control than any corny line he\u2019s subsequently forced to deliver.",
    "Anakin is a lost boy, a na\u00efve prodigy exploited by a power he doesn\u2019t fully understand, and the entire Mustafar sequence \u2013 right up until Obi-Wan gets the high ground \u2013 is the best showcase of Christensen\u2019s ability to portray him as such. Sure, his moody eyes help a lot in that regard, but Christensen doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for being a genuinely impressive emotional performer.",
    "It\u2019s only when Anakin opens his mouth that things take a turn for the meme-worthy \u2013 and that isn\u2019t really Christensen\u2019s fault.",
    "Let\u2019s not beat about the bush: George Lucas\u2019 direction of the prequels is not great. There were way too many long shots, some downright terrible post-production editing decisions and an obvious over-reliance on CGI.",
    "The Hollywood legend is undoubtedly a great ideas man, responsible for creating the most successful fictional universe in the history of cinema and a phenomenal film in A New Hope, but a lot of what we love about Star Wars comes from his collaborators. The Empire Strikes Back \u2013 the highlight of the original trilogy \u2013 was directed by someone else.",
    "The biggest crimes perpetrated against the prequel movies, though, were their scripts. No actor involved in any of the three episodes escaped being tarred with Lucas\u2019 cringe-worthy dialogue, but Hayden Christensen was the biggest victim of them all, subject to now-infamous lines like \u201cI don\u2019t like sand,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t make me kill you\u201d and \u201cNo\u2026 no it\u2019s because I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
    "I put it to you: how was Christensen supposed to deliver those lines with any conviction?",
    "In the heat of the moment, experiencing extreme rage, would anyone really say, \"well, from my point of view the Jedi are evil!\" What is this, a debate? Daniel-Day Lewis isn\u2019t making that sound any better, I can tell you. Honestly, Christensen would\u2019ve been better served just shouting \u201cAAAAAR\u201d at Obi-Wan \u2013 that would\u2019ve saved him from years of internet heat.",
    "Ewan McGregor\u2019s lines weren\u2019t much better, but being the more established actor at the time meant less criticism was hurled his way. Think about it: rather than his performance being damned to the depths of Hollywood hell, McGregor\u2019s quotes have instead become embedded into the pop culture lexicon \u2013 \u201cI have the high ground,\u201d \u201cHello there!\u201d etc. Why is that?",
    "Christensen was the fall guy for everything that was bad about the prequels. After Revenge of the Sith, he went on to star in a handful of perfectly acceptable films, but never landed another big-budget leading role like Anakin.",
    "It was a fate that also befell his predecessor, the young Anakin played by Jake Lloyd, and to a lesser extent many other Star Wars stars. While Harrison Ford ascended to icon status, how many other films can you name starring Mark \u201cLuke Skywalker\u201d Hamill in a leading role? Or Carrie \u201cPrincess Leia\u201d Fisher?",
    "Personally, I\u2019d love to see Hayden Christensen enjoy a career renaissance, emerging from the ashes of a much-denigrated franchise by climbing up the indie ladder and reminding the industry why he chose the profession in the first place. Hell, Matthew McConaughey defied the end of a withering romantic comedy career by popping up and winning an Oscar.",
    "I think Christensen\u2019s got it in him to stick it to the naysayers. Because maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 he isn\u2019t as bad an actor as everyone made out."
