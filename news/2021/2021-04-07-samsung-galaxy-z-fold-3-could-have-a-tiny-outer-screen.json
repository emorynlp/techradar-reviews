    "A new rumor suggests that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 may have a very small outer screen; one that\u2019s smaller than the screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 2. The leak says the display will be the same resolution (816 x 2260 pixels) but will only be a 5.4-inch display, rather than the 6.2-inch of the Fold 2.",
    "This new display size seems a little off if you ask us - so it\u2019s worth taking this leak with an extra pinch of salt - especially since the inner display will supposedly be a much larger 7.7-inches.",
    "It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s just a typo and we could be looking at a 6.4-inch display instead but we\u2019ll have to wait for an official reveal to know for sure.",
    "If the leak is true, the design of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 could be disappointing for fans looking to upgrade their Fold 2 or those wanting to try out a folding phone for the first time. We\u2019ll have to see if there is a method to Samsung\u2019s madness should the leak turn out to be real.",
    "Samsung\u2019s Z Fold line of phones open up like a book and feature two screens. One screen sits on the phone\u2019s \u2018front cover\u2019 - making it look like a thicker regular phone - and the other is inside - giving you an extra large \u2018double-page spread\u2019 of a display.",
    "The aim of the Z Fold series is to balance keeping the smaller form factor of a phone but give you a larger screen like a tablet, though the developing tech and extra components mean that it can all come at a price.",
    "If the Z Fold 3 does feature a smaller outer display than its predecessor, our first guess is that this is a cost saving method.",
    "Hopefully, the screen size would be part of a plan to bring the new model into a more reasonable price range for phone buyers. As we learn more about the Galaxy Z Fold 3, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated.",
