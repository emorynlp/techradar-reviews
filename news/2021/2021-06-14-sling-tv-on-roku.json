    "Introduced in January 2015, Sling TV was one of the first OTT alternatives to traditional cable.

    "Whether team Sling Orange or Sling Blue, you\u2019ll get the following networks: A&E, AMC, BET, Cartoon Network, Comedy Central, TNT, Vice, and Nick Jr. However, Sling Orange has over 30 channels, with EPSN and more family-friendly Disney content, which are not on Sling Blue.
