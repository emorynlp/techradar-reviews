    "Microsoft is working on a new update for Microsoft Teams designed to improve the guest user experience in its increasingly popular online collaboration tool.",
    "For those unfamiliar, guest access allows businesses to provides access to teams, documents in channels, resources, chats and applications to those outside of their organization while still maintaining control over their corporate data.",
    "Guests may include partners, vendors, suppliers or consultants and anyone with a business account like Azure Active Directory or an account for an email service like Microsoft Outlook or Gmail can participate as a guest in Teams.",
    "Now tough, Microsoft will give guests even more control over their experience in Teams by allowing them to decline invitations, initiate leaving an organization and manage the guest tenant list.",
    "In a new post on the Microsoft 365 roadmap, the software giant has revealed that guests will now be able to do even more in Teams.",
    "For instance, guest users will now be able to decline a pending guest invitation within the Teams app and when they click \u201cDecline\u201d, the Teams Tenant List will not show the tenant with the pending invitation in the Account Management tab. Guest users can now also initiate leaving an org and when they click on \u201cLeave Org\u201d they will be guided on how to leave a tenant from both Teams and the company's Azure Portal.",
    "Finally, guest users can now manage the guest tenant list in Teams by choosing to hide or show guest tenants in the menu of Microsoft's video conferencing software.",
    "Being able to collaborate with others from outside one's organization is one of the best features in Teams and through this new update, which is expected to roll out in December, guests will have more control over their experience when doing so.",
    "We've also highlighted the best online collaboration tools and best video conferencing software",
