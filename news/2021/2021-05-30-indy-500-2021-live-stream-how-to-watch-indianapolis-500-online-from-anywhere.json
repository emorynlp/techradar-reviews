    "Put the milk on ice, because we're Back Home Again in Indiana for the jewel in the IndyCar crown - the legendary Running of the Indianapolis 500. It's one of the most celebrated events in motorsport and each of the past seven Indy 500 winners are competing in this, the 105th edition of the race. So read on as our guide tells you how to watch a 2021 Indy 500 live stream from anywhere in the world.",
    "Defending IndyCar champion Scott Dixon - a 50-time race winner, six-time champion and honorary Hoosier - has only triumphed at the Brickyard once, winning the 92nd Indy 500 from pole position back in 2008. And that's where he starts again today.",
    "The New Zealander has finished second three times, with last year's race perhaps the most painful example. Having led 111 laps, he was overtaken by Takuma Sato late on. The Japanese driver crossed the finish line less than a tenth of a second ahead of the Dixon, but Taku starts way back in 15th this time around.",
    "Another two-time winner in contention is Juan Pablo Montoya, the Colombian great who famously cruised to victory in 2000, becoming the first rookie to win the Indy 500 since Graham Hill. And 21-year old Colton Herta, starting in 2nd today, will be hoping that he can go into the record books today as the youngest ever winner of the Indianapolis 500.",
    "Find out how to watch this year's race with our guide to getting an Indy 500 live stream from anywhere in the world.",
    "Below you'll find our run down of the broadcasters and countries showing the event. But if you're outside your country of residence and try to stream the Indy 500 via your usual broadcaster, you'll likely discover that you can't due to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "But there's still a way to tune in! By downloading and installing a VPN, you can tell your device it's back at home and enjoy your home coverage wherever you are. Make sure you read all the fine print first, though, ensuring you're in compliance with any terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Indy 500 from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone."
