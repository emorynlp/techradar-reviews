    "Amazon Prime Day has landed early for Prime members this week with a ton of excellent Amazon device deals - including this awesome Ring Video Doorbell plus Amazon Echo Dot bundle for $44.99 (was $99.98).",
    "The Ring Video Doorbell is one of the best-selling smart security devices on the market currently - and not just because it\u2019s really great value. It\u2019s easy to install, works seamlessly with other Alexa devices, has two-way audio, and captures really great 1080p video (at night too). It\u2019s a good addition to the home if you\u2019re concerned about neighborhood safety, or simply want to keep an eye on things.",
    "The Ring Video Doorbell by itself is actually selling for the same price right now too, so we\u2019d think of this early Prime Day deal more as a free Amazon Echo Dot more than anything else. Of course, you\u2019re not bagging the latest device (see that here), but the third-gen Echo Dot is still worth $34.99 by itself so this isn\u2019t an insignificant freebie at all. It\u2019s also still a really capable little smart speaker with seamless Alexa integration and a small footprint that\u2019ll allow it to fit in in any room.",
    "This early Prime Day deal is of course open to Prime members only. If you're interested, you can get a free 30-day trial - the details of which we've included below. It's a good time to sign up too as we're expecting many more deals to drop on Amazon devices in the lead-up, as well as thousands on other items across the main event (21st - 22nd June).",
    "Amazon has recently come under scrutiny for its recent launch of a new feature called Amazon Sidewalk - a low-level network that connects your Alexa device to others outside your home. The good news is you can fully opt out of this feature as well as others in the device privacy settings. If you'd like to know more, and how to disable Amazon Sidewalk, then read our recent story on how to do just that.",
