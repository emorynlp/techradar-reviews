    "It's all about Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jokers as Big Brother USA returns for its twenty-third season with a new game plan in place. Freshening up the reality TV show's longstanding format, new twists see the HouseGuests split into four teams, with the introduction of a Wildcard Competition set to shake things up when it comes to nominations. But who will be evicted from the Big Brother house next? Get all the information on how to watch Big Brother 23 in 2021, with the option to make the most of a Paramount Plus 7-day free trial if you're a new customer.",
    "Big Brother 2021 brings together 16 contestants, ranging from 21 to 40-years-old, who become HouseGuests taking part in weekly challenges in order to try and avoid facing eviction. The final remaining HouseGuest will be the winner and receive a cash prize of $500,000.",
    "With Julie Chen returning once again to host Big Brother USA, that's about all that is remaining the same as we embark on Big Brother 23. The house has been completely renovated, channelling the theme of 'Big Brother Beach Club' with its garish sea life motifs (think giant coral) and a gaming room with a table made out of poker chips.",
    "That's not all that's different this year, either. The format for Big Brother 23 is putting an emphasis on being a team player as HouseGuests will be split into teams, with contestants vying to become Team Captains and therefore able to choose who joins their team. Anyone else getting flashbacks to being picked last in gym?",
    "Promising plenty of other twists, along with the usual drama that comes with throwing 16 complete strangers who have to live together, we've got all the information on how to watch Big Brother 23 2021 where you are below.",
    "We've detailed how you can watch Big Brother 23 in the US, but bear in mind that if you're abroad at any point during the housemates' stay in the Big Brother house, you won't be able to watch Big Brother 23 from abroad.",
    "Don't allow geo-restrictions to get in your way, which restrict certain services and content to specific parts of the world. You can get around geo-blocks by using a VPN service. It's completely legal, very affordable and easy to use - and it also encrypts your browsing, offering protection against cybercriminals and government snooping.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Big Brother 23 from anywhere",
    "Sadly, Big Brother fans based in the UK and Australia aren't invited to this party in the USA - at least not yet.",
    "There's no direct means of viewing CBS shows like BB23 in these countries, either live or on demand, at present.",
    "However, as mentioned above, folks from Canada, the US or anywhere else where you can watch Big Brother 23, can still catch all of the latest BB All drama. Just grab yourself a top VPN and watch the streaming service you normally use back home."
