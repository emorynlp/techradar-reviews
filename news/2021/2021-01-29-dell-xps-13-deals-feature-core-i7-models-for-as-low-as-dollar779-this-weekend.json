    "If you're looking to save on a premium ultrabook, there are a myriad of excellent Dell XPS 13 deals being featured on the official Dell store this weekend - all of which feature price cuts of over $300 on Core i7 models.",
    "We previously covered a few Dell XPS 13 deals last weekend, and it's looking like Dell is very much eager to waggle some temptingly low prices on slightly older premium models right now to clear the way for the newest stock. Prices last weekend were ever so slightly better (by about $10 - $20), but these are still great deals.",
    "Prices start at just $779.99 for a 'baseline' model featuring an Intel Core i7-10510U, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD. If that memory configuration is a little too weedy for you, you can also upgrade to a 512GB SSD version for $899, and a 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD version for $944.99. You'll find all three of these Dell XPS 13 deals with price cuts of over $300 right now, making for some pretty tidy savings regardless of your preferences.",
    "Even though these are slightly older models with chunkier bottom bezels, their specs are nothing to sniff at and they're of course still featuring that stunning design that the XPS range is known for. Subsequently, if you're looking for a cheap but fast ultrabook, these are really great value this weekend. Note: we're expecting the baseline model to sell out really quickly as this particular configuration is always really popular. We'd definitely jump on it if you're interested, or potentially opt for that 512GB SSD config if you can afford it.",

    "If you're wanting to see what else is about this weekend, we recommend heading over to our main best Dell XPS 13 deals page, which has more prices, plus plenty of buying advice on buying the most premium Dell laptop deals. If this weekend's Dell sale is a little out of your price range, we've also got a cheap laptop deals page that features some very, very good bang for the buck machines."
