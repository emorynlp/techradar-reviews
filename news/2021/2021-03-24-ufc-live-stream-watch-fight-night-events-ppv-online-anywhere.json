    "The world's best known MMA promotion, UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship in full) runs both weekly Fight Night events and blockbuster PPV cards every month. Follow our guide as we explain how to watch a UFC live stream online from anywhere in the world. Catch all the 2021 PPV action, plus every Fight Night event by following our guide below.",
    "Whether you're a dedicated UFC Fight Night fan, just tune in for the big cards featuring names like McGregor, Khabib and Nunes, or simply enjoy Sean O'Malley's hairstyles, the often vicious and always unpredictable nature of MMA fights mean that title belts change hands regularly - making for a great spectacle for die-hard fans and new enthusiasts alike.",
    "Or more recently, UFC 254 where Khabib Nurmagomedov submitted Justin Gaethje in the second round of their Lightweight Championship fight to secure his legacy as one of the sport's all-time greatest fighters. The Eagle retired immediately after the emotional fight, leaving the hyper-competitive Lightweight division in a state of flux - and seemingly primed for the aforementioned McGregor comeback.",
    "On top of that, a second-tier of events exist called UFC Fight Nights. These are held on a weekly basis and occur all over the globe, usually featuring up-and-coming local fighters. They're still a darn big deal, though, being held at huge international venues with tickets changing hands for hundreds of dollars.",
    "Both types of UFC events are shown exclusively on ESPN and the ESPN Plus streaming service in the US, usually taking place on Saturday nights. There's also a third series of Octagon bashes called 'UFC on ESPN' - these occur intermittently and air on one of ESPN's TV channels in America. For the events that matter most, follow our guide and find out the best ways to watch a UFC live stream wherever you are this November.",
    "UFC restarted in May 2020 with Fight Night: Smith vs Teixeria - held behind closed doors in Jacksonville, Florida. It steadily regained momentum from there, the early highlight of the resumed calendar with out a doubt being Justin Gaethje's spectacular, career defining victory over Tony Ferguson at UFC 249.",
    "After that, UFC 250 saw Amanda Nunes dispatch Felicia Spencer by unanimous decision to retain her featherweight title - and historic position as the first ever women's two-division champion. Kamaru Usman defeated fan favourite Jorge Masvidal at UFC 251 to cement his seemingly unassailable position atop the welterweight ranks - though the fight of the night was undoubtedly Rose Namajunas' split-decision defeat of Jessica Andrade.",
    "Fast forward to UFC 254 and we had the biggest card in October, headlined by Khabib vs Gaethje. The Eagle cemented his place as one of, if not the greatest UFC lightweight fighters of all-time, submitting Gaethje in the second round of an emotional fight hat saw Khabib competing for the first - and at present last - time following the death of his father and trainer, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, who died tragically in July of coronavirus-related complications.",
    "Khabib broke down in tears after the fight was over, and what followed was one of the finest moments of sportsmanship of the year, Gaethje consoling his conqueror on the mat in a moment that defied everything we've come to expect from 2020.",
    "In between the actual fights, UFC poster boy Conor McGregor decided to 'retire' from the sport once again, while all-time great and reigning light heavyweight champion Jon 'Bones' Jones finds himself engulfed in a pay dispute with Ultimate Fighting Championship supremo Dana White. At the heart of the conflict is Jones' proposed move up to the heavyweight class with a view to fighting Francis Ngannou.",
    "Jones says he has nothing left to prove at light heavyweight - though top title contender Dominick Reyes no doubt takes a different view. Jones defeated Reyes by unanimous decision back at UFC 247 - though many pundits scored the fight definitively in Reyes' favour.",
    "This year? 2021's UFC 257 main event saw Conor McGregor's much-hyped return dampened by Dustin 'The Diamond' Poirier, who avenged his earlier to defeat to Mystic Mac in emphatic style.",
    "Jon Jones will almost certainly will be back in the Octagon sooner rather than later. Who he faces and under what banner is another matter entirely - the most enticing prospect for most fight fans would be a cross-promotion rematch against Bellator's Ryan Bader.",
    "Now that UFC has resumed, MMA fans may be considering adding to or upgrading their merch collection - and we're pleased to say that the official UFC store is loaded with tempting swag.",
    "To absolutely nobody's surprise, Fight Island is the theme of the promotion's latest collection - yet much to our amazement, some of the new apparel that's on sale is actually fit to be worn in public.",
    "Recent additions include UFC-branded face masks, and best of all, you can save 10% on your first purchase just by signing up to the UFC email list - you've got a dummy address for this kind of thing, right?",
    "Free shipping is available on orders over $75 and standard items should arrive within two weeks (international shipping times and taxes vary), so check out the UFC Store today."
