    "Smart home company Blink has just taken the wraps off its first-ever smart doorbell camera at the Amazon September event.",
    "According to Amazon, the Blink Video Doorbell can be installed both wired and wirelessly and has a two-year battery life.",
    "Other specs include 1080p HD day and night video, two-way audio, chime app alerts, and the ability to connect to and sound your existing in-home chime.",
    "Of course, what folks will find most appealing about the Blink Video Doorbell is its price \u2013 it's just $49 (around \u00a337, AU$70).",
    "In addition to the Doorbell, Blink announced two more devices that can keep an eye on every corner of your house.",
    "Among them, the Blink Floodlight Camera is a battery-powered LED mount that works with Blink Outdoor that can act as a motion-triggered floodlight for the back yard. There's also a new Blink Solar Panel Mount that supplies a nonstop sustainable charge from the sun for Blink Outdoor.",
    "These devices are available for pre-order from Amazon, but they unfortunately aren't quite as cheap as the Video Doorbell: the Blink Floodlight Camera mount will start at $39 (around \u00a328, AU$55), or you can buy a Blink Floodlight Camera bundle with Blink Outdoor starting at $139. The Blink Solar Panel Mount bundled with Blink Outdoor will start at $129 (around \u00a395, AU$180).",
    "For now, these devices are US-only, but we're expecting to hear some news about global availability in the next few weeks.",
