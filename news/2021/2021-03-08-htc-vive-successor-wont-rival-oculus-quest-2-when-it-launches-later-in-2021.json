  "summary": "HTC is developing a new standalone headset, but it\u2019s not an Oculus Quest killer",
  "article": [
    "A top HTC official said the company plans on producing a new wireless, standalone VR headset in 2021 that is \u201cprobably better than what\u2019s out there from any vendor today\u201d.",
    "That\u2019s the word from Alvin Wang Graylin, President of Vive in China, who was interviewed on YouTube on a channel called TeliportMe.",
    "\u201cI think we\u2019ve said in the past that we will release a new AIO [all-in-one] this year,\u201d Graylin said. \u201cIt\u2019s our next-generation standalone. We will have one this year [and] it is going to be a great product.\u201d",
    "Graylin then goes on to say that he can't provide many details about the new headset outside of some basic info, but says that it will be better than anything the company has available today.",
    "So what's the bad news? Unfortunately, Graylin also said he doesn\u2019t see it lining up against the Oculus Quest 2, Facebook\u2019s premium wireless headset that came out in 2020 and the current leader in the standalone VR space. Long story short, we could be looking at a successor to the HTC Vive Focus (pictured above) or something a bit further away from the Oculus Quest in terms of price and performance.",
    "UPDATE: When TechRadar reached out to HTC for a comment on today's story, a representative told us \"As a market leader, HTC VIVE will continue to build a holistic VR ecosystem of new products, services and solutions that meets both consumers' and business' needs and drive adoption of immersive technologies. We will be excitedly sharing some details about our next big moves soon. Stay tuned!\"",
    "If you\u2019ve been on the fence about buying a new VR headset this year, the news of yet another headset on the horizon probably won\u2019t make your decision any easier.",
    "Sony announced earlier this month that it plans on producing a PSVR 2 headset down the road and there\u2019s even been talk of the long-rumored Apple VR headset making an appearance later this year, too.",
    "Despite all of the potential headsets coming down the road, few of them seem to line up exactly with what the Oculus Quest 2 offers \u2013 which, namely, is a standalone VR headset with a good resolution and the potential to hit a 120Hz refresh rate in the future. That's on top of a solid catalogue of games, and the ability to run it from your PC with a link cable.",
    "Whatever materializes out of Sony, Apple and HTC\u2019s camp might be great for their specific use cases, but so far it doesn\u2019t appear that anyone is making a real competitor for the Quest 2 this year.",
