  "article": [
    "First revealed back in 2019, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction (originally known as Rainbow Six Quarantine, then as Rainbow Six Parasite) was finally revealed at the Ubisoft Forward event, which took place on June 13 as part of E3 2021.",
    "While Rainbow Six Extraction's release date was initially slated for this year, it's been pushed back to January 2022, per an official tweet. Rainbow Six Extraction is a 1-3 player co-op experience which pits you and your team of Operators against an ever-evolving alien threat. You'll need to successfully complete dangerous excursions into hostile territory but will face numerous threats that will stand in your way.",
    "The game has a couple of interesting twists that should keep players on their toes \u2013 any fallen Operators will be MIA until they're rescued, and there's also the looming threat that you could lose all your hard-earned abilities you unlock during a run.",
    "Think you're up for the challenge of overcoming the growing alien spread of the Arch\u00e6ans? Here's everything we know about Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction.",
    "Rainbow Six Extraction's release date would have been September 16, 2021, but an official tweet in July announced the launch was pushed back until January 2022.",
    "The game will support cross-play and cross-save across all platforms, and will be available on the Ubisoft Plus subscription service.",
    "The game will be available on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 and PS4 and Stadia.",
    "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction is a PvE spin-off of the incredibly popular Rainbow Six Siege. Developed and published by Ubisoft, the game was first announced at Ubisoft's E3 2019 showcase under a different name: Rainbow Six Quarantine.",
    "The name was later changed due to Parasite, as the developer wanted to distance itself from the global pandemic, but we now know exactly what players can expect when Rainbow Six Extraction launches on September 16.",
    "You can choose from a roster of 18 Operators, each of whom have their own unique gadgets, weapons and abilities. You'll need to harness and combine the powers of the Operators effectively if you want to overcome the alien threat which is spreading across America known as the Arch\u00e6ans. With 12 maps to tackle set across four regions of the United States, you'll go up against procedurally generated challenges and various enemy types that will each pose a distinct challenge.",
    "As you move through each map, which are split into three subzones, the difficulty will increase. You'll unlock new React gear, though, which will let you take out the aliens more effectively.",
    "You'll need to weigh up the risk and reward when moving to new subzones, however, as if you fail, your Operator will be unavailable until they're rescued, and you'll lose the abilities you've unlocked.",
    "We also got a look at some of the game's enemies, known as Arch\u00e6ans. There are 10 parasitic archetypes in total, including the Spiker, Breacher, Tormentor and Apex. Each offers a distinct challenge for players to overcome, and you'll need to use a combination of stealth, abilities and teamwork to survive.",

    "Unlike Siege, however, which is a 5v5 multiplayer game, Rainbow Six: Extraction is 1-3 player PvE (player vs environment) game where Operators face off against alien parasite creatures. This concept was first established with the limited-time Outbreak event in Rainbow Six Siege, so you can consider this game a continuation \u2013 or evolution \u2013 of that event.",
