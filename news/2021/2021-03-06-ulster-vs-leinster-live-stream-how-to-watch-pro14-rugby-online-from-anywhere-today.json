    "With just two games left to play after this weekend, tonight's meeting of Irish rugby's biggest rivals has taken on the significance of a playoff clash. It's the biggest match of the 2020/21 Pro14 season so far, so read on as we explain how to watch an Ulster vs Leinster live stream wherever you are in the world right now.",
    "Leinster and Ulster have left the rest of their Conference A rivals in the dust, but only one of them can make it to the Grand Final, with this season's playoffs having been scrapped. Leinster are six points clear, and will confirm their place in the final with a bonus-point victory tonight.",
    "It's incredible to think that just two months ago, Ulster were 10 points ahead of their Dublin-based rivals at the top of the conference. But the pendulum swung in the second-half of their meeting in early January, with Sean Cronin, Robbie Henshaw and James Tracy all scoring tries after the break to secure a resounding 24-12 Leinster win.",
    "The good news for Dan McFarland and Ulster is that they've got Stuart McCloskey and Tom O'Toole back from Six Nations duty. John Cooney and Eric O'Sullivan are also available for selection, having been used as injury cover for the national side.",
    "Leo Cullen and Leinster, meanwhile, need to navigate tonight's goliath game without more than a dozen of their biggest talents, including captain Johnny Sexton, who were required to attend Ireland's training camp this week.",
    "It's the biggest game in Irish domestic rugby, and there's certainly hope for an upset. Follow our guide below for full details of how to watch Ulster vs Leinster online and get a reliable Pro14 live stream from anywhere.",
    "We've recommended some of the best places to live stream Pro14 rugby below. But you might run into a problem trying to access them if you're outside of your country - even if you're fully registered and in all likelihood paying a subscription fee.",
