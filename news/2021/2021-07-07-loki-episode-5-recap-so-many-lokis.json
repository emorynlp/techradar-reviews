    "Spoilers for the first five episodes of Loki follow.",
    "When James Cameron made his classic sequel to Alien, the clever use of a plural in the title told us exactly what we were getting \u2013 xenomorphs and lots of them. There\u2019s a strong argument that this week\u2019s trip to the MCU should have gone down a similar path, because Lokis is now a much more appropriate name for the show than Loki. As Agent Mobius so eloquently puts it, \u201cYou throw a rock out here and you hit a Loki.\u201d",
    "Though recent Rick and Morty outing 'Mortiplicity' probably surpasses it, there can\u2019t be many TV episodes that feature so many characters who share the same name. With the Tom Hiddleston Loki we\u2019ve been following from episode 1 (not technically the original model, but let\u2019s call him Loki Prime), Classic Loki, Kid Loki, Boastful Loki and even a cheeky alligator, this is an episode in need of a collective noun \u2013 a Mischief, perhaps? \u2013 for a group of Lokis. In fact, so many of them crop up in \u2018Journey into Mystery\u2019 that you can see why Sylvie chooses to go under a different name \u2013 it makes life so much easier.",
    "That this doesn\u2019t become incredibly confusing is a massive credit to Loki\u2019s writing team and its director, Kate Herron, who emphasize the fun over some potentially complex temporal mechanics. The so-called Void that exists at the end of the universe is a convenient but intriguing construct that pulls all of space and time together, providing an excuse for multiple Lokis to come face-to-face as they keep themselves hidden from a \u201cliving tempest that destroys matter and energy\u201d known as the Alioth.",
    "The principal quartet of new Lokis are brilliant additions to the show, each of them exaggerating a facet of Loki Prime\u2019s personality. The traitorous Boastful Loki claims to have vanquished both Captain America and Iron Man before claiming all six Infinity Stones, while Kid Loki managed what Loki Prime never could, and killed their brother, Thor. And then there\u2019s Alligator Loki, a reptile removed from time for eating the wrong cat, who emerges as an unlikely star, despite the fact he utters not a single word \u2013 the decision to keep him silent pays off superbly, making him even more of an enigma.",
    "Best of all, though, is Richard E. Grant\u2019s Classic Loki. Although he\u2019s forced to wear the sort of ridiculous outfit that looks much better on a comic-book page than it does on screen, Grant gives the older incarnation of the character a surprising amount of gravitas. It turns out his own encounter with Thanos played out with considerably less bravado than Loki Prime\u2019s did in Infinity War, but his subsequent life of solitude brought out a wiser, more thoughtful version of the Asgardian. His self-sacrifice to give Sylvie time to enchant the Alioth is arguably the episode\u2019s big moment \u2013 if you\u2019re going to provide a distraction for a giant cloud monster, conjuring up a full-scale model of Asgard is a spectacular way to do it.",
    "After those guys hit the mark so spectacularly, bringing in a mob of rogue Lokis feels like overkill, cameos that exist more for the benefit of a few gags than progressing the story. Their underground scrap is played brilliantly for laughs \u2013 give Alligator Loki a hand \u2013 but the episode would lose little if it wasn\u2019t there. In fact, the sequence\u2019s biggest contribution to Marvel may just be the Vote Loki Variant, a peripheral character whose appearance in trailers and marketing made us believe he was going to be significant to the plot.",
    "Ultimately, however, the only Lokis who really matter are Loki Prime and Sylvie, and the episode does plenty to progress their story arcs. Having got all the information she could from Renslayer and Miss Minutes \u2013 the latter\u2019s evolution from cartoon star to fully-functioning member of the TVA has been one of the highlights of the series \u2013 Sylvie\u2019s decision to self-prune comes as something of a shock. But getting her to the Void is pivotal to the story, particularly in the scenes she shares with Loki Prime. While they have some major differences of opinion \u2013 Sylvie\u2019s plan to enchant the Alioth seems much more practical than Loki Prime\u2019s gung-ho \u201ckill the monster!\u201d approach \u2013 their mutual attraction is undeniable, especially in a nice moment when Loki Prime uses magic to wrap his blanket around Sylvie.",
    "As lovely as these scenes are, however, you can\u2019t help feeling Loki Prime\u2019s redemption has been a little too quick and easy. At the start of the series premiere, after all, he was fresh from unleashing an army of invading aliens on New York in the first Avengers movie \u2013 that he\u2019s now playing hero and hugging Mobius feels somewhat implausible, even in a show about an agency that monitors space and time.",
    "Speaking of the Time Variance Authority, the show\u2019s biggest questions now concern the identity of the mysterious figure pulling the strings. Is Renslayer feigning ignorance about her employers, or is she as in the dark as everyone else? Will the ever-quotable Mobius be able to fix anything when he makes it back to his old place of work? And what will Loki Prime and Sylvie find when they visit the house \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d. Next week\u2019s season finale has a lot of work to do if it\u2019s going to deliver the satisfactory answers a wonderfully inventive show deserves\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "Another fun episode that goes big on exposition without ever forgetting its primary function is to entertain. The quartet of Special Guest Lokis all play their part \u2013 an Alligator Loki spin-off, anyone? \u2013 but \u2018Journey into Mystery\u2019 never forgets this is primarily Loki Prime and Sylvie\u2019s story. Their romance may be improbable, but somehow it\u2019s working. It\u2019s also a relief to see that Mobius survived his trip to the end of the universe, even if his new-found love for Lokis is similarly unlikely.",
    "Aside from Loki Prime\u2019s accelerated journey from villain-to-all-out-hero, the episode\u2019s one slight misstep is that \u2013 like the penultimate instalment of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier \u2013 it feels like a story in need of a bigger cliffhanger. We can\u2019t have been the only ones waiting for a mid-credits sting that never appeared\u2026",
    "The season finale of Loki debuts on Disney Plus on Wednesday 14 July."
