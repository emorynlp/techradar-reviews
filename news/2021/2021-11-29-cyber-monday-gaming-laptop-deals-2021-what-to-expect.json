    "Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals are one of the few ways you'll get your hands on some of the latest PC gaming hardware this year, given that a dastardly mix of shortages have made components like the latest Nvidia RTX and AMD Radeon graphics cards almost impossible to buy.",
    "Luckily, there are loads of Cyber Monday laptop deals running right now, with many of the great offers we saw running as Black Friday gaming laptop deals still going strong. That means if you saw a bargain over the weekend, you might still have time to nab it before it flies off the shelves.",
    "We're also seeing plenty of other deals going live, so if you have cash burning a hole in your pocket, check out our Cyber Monday live blog for all the latest tech deals, or perhaps our specific Cyber Monday laptop live blog if you're determined to snag a cheap laptop.",
    "All the deals going live can be extremely confusing though, especially once you realize that a lot of retailers are putting some old models on sale. Quick pro tip: if you see a gaming laptop with a GTX 1660 Ti in it and it's above $800 in the US or \u00a3700 in the UK, stay away. That's what we in the business call a Cyber Monday non-deal. (It's late, we couldn't think of something clever).",
    "But don't worry, we know what we're looking for and we can point you to the gaming laptops that aren't going to shove yesterday's hardware in your face for today's prices. All we want to do is find you the best gaming laptop you can get.",
    "So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked through the rest of Cyber Monday weekend, and we'll keep it updated with the latest deals, so you can be sure you're not missing anything.",
    "Cyber Monday is basically already here, so if you're asking if you should wait for Cyber Monday, the time for that is over. There will likely be a few deals that launch at Midnight EST in the US, but mostly the deals that are live now are the Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals. Have fun. Dive in. Game on. Etcetera.",
    "We love the Alienware M17 because it combines extreme gaming performance with a beautiful 17-inch display. And while it's definitely not as thin and light as a Razer Blade, this large laptop is still pretty easy to carry around with you wherever you go. And, Dell is usually pretty good at putting its Alienware laptops on sale for Black Friday, so now might be the time to jump in on it.",
    "Read the full review: Alienware M17 R4",
    "Right now, the Asus Zephyrus G15 is ranked as our best gaming laptop - and it's not hard to see why. It's thin, light and sleek while also packing enough power, thanks to the AMD Ryzen 9 chip housed within. And, while this is a very expensive device, we usually see at least one flash sale on Black Friday for an Asus Zephyrus laptop. If that happens this year, our advice is to jump on it as soon as you can.",
