  "summary": "Turns out, home security cameras are pretty effective",
  "article": [
    "Smart home security devices are a great tool for protecting your property when you\u2019re not around. More affordable than traditional CCTV systems, they can be self-installed and ensure you can view a live feed from the camera through your smartphone even when you\u2019re not at home.",
    "It\u2019s clear consumers really do believe the best home security cameras and the best video doorbells are an essential tool when it comes to deterring burglars - one in five US homes has a home security camera installed, according to security site Safety.com\u2019s recent home protection survey.",
    "But can these cameras really stop you getting burgled? We spoke to a former thief to find out his take on whether self-installed cameras really do mean a burglar is less likely to target your home. If you\u2019re certain you want to get your hands on the best home security cameras now, rather than read on for a burglar\u2019s opinion, then check out these great deals for some of the best on the market.",
    "As far as Luke Harris, a former burglar-turned-security-consultant at smart alarm firm Boundary, is concerned, home security cameras really do make thieves think twice before breaking into your property.",
    "\u201cIn a burglar\u2019s mind, when they are scoping out a property, they want to be in and out as quickly as they can, with as little chance of getting caught as possible. This means that any visual or physical deterrent \u2013 whether it be outdoor lighting, a security camera, or a visible alarm \u2013 can put them off,\u201d Harris told TechRadar.",
    "Harris was just 12 years old when he started breaking into his neighbors\u2019 houses to steal cigarettes. Having been kicked out the family home at 15, his descent into criminal activity continued, as he regularly committed burglaries, until at 26 he decided he had had enough",
    "He took a job as a kitchen porter and worked his way up to chef, but when the pandemic struck, he lost his job. In September 2020, Harris saw a plea from Boundry for a reformed burglar to act as a security consultant and stress test the firm\u2019s new security systems. He decided to use his misdemeanors to his advantage and beat around 50 other applicants to the role.",
    "\u201cSpotting a security camera is likely to stop a burglar in their tracks, as they not only know that the property is well protected, but also that there is a chance that their face is being recorded and passed on to the police,\u201d Harris added.",
    "It seems obvious, but this means clearly visible outdoor home security cameras installed on the exterior of your home will offer greater deterrent than those located inside your home.",
    "Many security cameras, such as those from Arlo, Ring and Eufy, are powered by a rechargeable battery, which means you have more flexibility on where they can be mounted, so it\u2019s important to ensure they are in a location that is immediately obvious to anyone approaching the property.",
    "Some home security cameras such as the Arlo Pro 4 or the Ring Spotlight Cam have swappable batteries. So, provided you purchase an additional battery, you\u2019ll be able to get the camera back online in seconds when the battery dies, rather than leaving it out of action for hours while the built-in battery recharges.",
    "So what about indoor home security cameras? As far as Harris is concerned, just like outdoor home security cameras, if you\u2019re going to use them they need to be as visible as possible.",
    "\u201cNo burglar likes being caught on camera, so breaking into a house and seeing one would be enough to at least make them think twice,\u201d he said.",
    "However, he adds that smart security devices such as motion sensors that trigger loud alarms \u201care more likely to stop a burglar in their tracks. If you have a limited budget when it comes to smart security, it\u2019s clear it's better to focus on exterior home security cameras, and smart alarm components.",
    "As Harris points out, home security cameras offer the chance to pass footage of the perpetrator onto the Police should something happen. However, many require a subscription to ensure you can review the video recorded at a later date, and download the clips so they can be shared with law enforcement. We\u2019d highly recommend signing-up to one of these subscriptions so if the worst happens, you can share the footage with those necessary.",
    "There are some home security cameras such as the Eufy SoloCam E40, Blink\u2019s range of home security cameras, and the Swann Spotlight Outdoor Security Camera, come with the ability to store footage locally or in the cloud without the need for a subscription.",
    "Others, such as the Arlo Ultra and Arlo Ultra 2, offer the option of local storage through a micro SD card inserted into the base station that connects the cameras to the internet. However, it\u2019s worth noting that video clips stored this way can\u2019t be played back through the app - instead, the micro SD card must be inserted into a computer to review the stored footage.",
    "Harris believes the things that put people off the most when breaking and entering are \u201csudden actions or noises that suggest they have been caught out\u201d",
    "\u201c...that can be a light coming on, an alarm going off, or even a security camera being noticed,\u201d added Harris.",
    "With this in mind, consider a home security camera with a built-in light that can illuminate automatically when motion is detected, such as the Arlo Pro 3 floodlight, as well as the Ring Floodlight Cam and the new Google Nest Cam Floodlight - both of which are mains-powered and will requires professional installation if you don\u2019t have the right skills and qualifications.",
    "Harris concludes by saying that while these are a good choice, they will only offer so much protection:",
    "\u201cI would say that a security camera shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense; in order to keep burglars out fully you will want an integrated smart alarm system, ideally with an automated police response as well, just to be sure.\u201d",
    "As far as Harris is concerned, you don\u2019t have to rely on smart home devices to deter burglars, there are some very simple steps you can take to help dismayed thieves from attempting to break into your home."
