    "Quantum computing in your enterprise may be a lot closer than you (probably) think. A new report from Classiq claims many enterprises are already dabbling with the technology, have budgets allocated for it, and expect equity investments to skyrocket in coming years.",
    "Classiq polled more than 500 U.S. professionals, from managers to the C-suite, all of which said they were \u201cfamiliar with quantum computing\u201d, in a bid to find out more about the sentiment towards the technology.",
    "It found that the vast majority (89.8%) believe IT departments should have budgets dedicated to quantum computing. Almost two-thirds (61.9%) already have budgets set up, with an additional fifth (21.6%) planning on incorporating quantum computing into their IT plans in the near future.",
    "That\u2019s because, for many (38%), an effective quantum computing strategy could mean a competitive advantage. For a third (32.9%), it means new revenue streams. Whatever the key benefit may be, practically all respondents (95.7%) agree that quantum computing can bring performance breakthroughs, which is why four in five (82.1%) see it as a necessity.",
    "When asked when they expect quantum computing to take hold of the enterprise, most (62.9%) said anywhere between five and 10 years.",
    "Better development platforms, software portability, as well as more education and training, could speed up the process, though. Most believe the technology isn\u2019t as popular today, due to a lack of understanding. Almost three in four (72.3%) said it was very important for them to be able to move quantum code developed on one type of quantum computer, to another.",
    "Citing the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the report stated that confidence in reaching \u201cquantum advantage\u201d has soared in the past 12 months. Quantum advantage is described as a milestone when quantum computers start solving problems beyond the reach of traditional computers.",
    "\u201cEquity investments in quantum computing nearly tripled in 2020, the busiest year on record, and are set to rise even further in 2021,\u201d BCG added, also saying that quantum computing could create $450 billion to $850 billion in value in the next 15 to 30 years."
