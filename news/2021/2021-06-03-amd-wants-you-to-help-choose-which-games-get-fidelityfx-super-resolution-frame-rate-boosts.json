  "article": [
    "AMD is asking PC gamers for feedback on which games they would like to support FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR for short).",
    "As you\u2019re likely aware, AMD just announced (at Computex 2021) that FSR is planned to launch later in June, and the big revelation was that it\u2019s a potentially high-performing open standard which can work across different GPUs (meaning Nvidia graphics cards as well as AMD \u2013 and Intel might even be planning FSR support with its incoming Xe gaming GPUs).",
    "But just as with Nvidia\u2019s DLSS, this rival FSR tech will require games to support it, and that\u2019s where AMD wants your help and feedback in letting the firm know which titles you\u2019d like to see brought into the fold.",
    "The FidelityFX Super Resolution Game Survey asks you to name your \u201cthree favorite PC games that you\u2019d like to see support\u201d added for, and also collects a bit of data on what GPU you run.",
    "Presumably these responses will be crunched and some kind of ranking of the most-wanted games for FSR will be compiled, and that\u2019ll help drive AMD\u2019s development efforts going forward with this tech.",
    "AMD has made some big promises with FSR, including that it could double up frame rates in performance mode with an AMD GPU, although it won\u2019t be as effective as that when using a rival Nvidia graphics card (but still expect considerable boosts).",
    "One key difference is the lack of machine learning with AMD\u2019s solution, and Wccftech, which spotted the above survey, has already been casting some doubt on how this could impact the effectiveness of the quality of FSR compared to DLSS.",
    "We won\u2019t actually know how good FSR really is compared to DLSS until we get to test the feature out with some games ourselves, of course \u2013 so stay tuned for that in due course."
