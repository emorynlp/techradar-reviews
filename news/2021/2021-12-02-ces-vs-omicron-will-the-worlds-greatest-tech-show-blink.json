    "Two words zip through tech newsrooms every January like the electrical signals pulsing in a PC: \u201cCES Flu,\u201d shorthand for the cold you caught after a week spent interacting with 150,000 tech enthusiasts from around the globe at the industry's annual expo in Las Vegas. But the term took on new meaning in 2020, when the world\u2019s biggest tech trade show was fingered as a superspreader event for Covid-19.",
    "CES 2021 was cancelled due to Covid, but with the world having started to open up, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) \u2013 the trade group behind the show \u2013 announced that CES 2022 would be back on the ground in Sin City. However, with the virulent new Omicron variant of Covid posing a new and possibly unique threat, will the CTA hit 'Go' on CES?",
    "\u201cThe safety of our participants and partners is a top priority,\u201d Jamie Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the CTA, told TechRadar. \u201cWe are actively tracking the emerging news and science around the new Omicron variant and continue to follow guidance from the CDC [the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and WHO, as well as relevant federal, state, and local government requirements. While it is too early to determine the impact of this latest variant, we will continue to monitor and adjust our plans and health protocols as necessary.\u201d",
    "Too early for the CTA, perhaps. But the tech industry is watching \u2013 and it\u2019s not thrilled.",
    "At the kick-off event for CES 2022 in New York City in November, CTA president Gary Shapiro admitted bluntly that the event would be smaller than in past years: \u201cLet\u2019s be honest: It will have a smaller footprint, and it will be fewer people. COVID is keeping some people home,\u201d he said.",
    "But will Omicron keep yet more people home? Over the last few days, as governments have instituted harsh quarantines and banned travelers from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, worries are growing. Consumer electronics giant LG announced on Monday that it planned a far more robust virtual presence for 2022 than in years past \u2013 but it told TechRadar the change had nothing to do Omicron.",
    "\"LG's corporate decision to approach participation in CES 2022 in a robust but different way occurred prior to the Omicron concerns that are now gaining global attention,\u201d Chris De Maria, spokesman for LG, told us. \u201cRenewed international travel challenges reaffirm the importance of engaging in a variety of ways with our key constituents \u2013 customers, consumers, partners and press \u2013 both onsite and digitally to experience LG's 2022 innovations in the way that best meets their needs.\"",
    "Embracing virtual is key to the modern trade show, but will the old format exist at all for CES 2022? Some attendees seem skeptical.",
    "\u201cJLab Audio will still attending but we expect multiple in-person meetings to be cancelled,\u201d Win Cramer, CEO of the consumer audio company, told us. Cramer plans a smaller team at the show than in pre-pandemic years \u2013 for now, anyway. \u201cWe're sending a fully vaxxed skeleton crew \u2013 the same crew that was scheduled to go pre-Omicron.\u201d",
    "Others are bluntly pessimistic. \u201cI cannot imagine attending in person this year,\u201d Dan Ness, founder of market research firm MetaFacts, said. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll hear exhibitors providing virtual alternatives, while others will blindly press ahead in real life.\u201d",
    "The CTA does have comprehensive health protocols in place to minimize the spread of disease at the show, of course. Attendees must show proof of full vaccination against Covid-19, chairs will be spaced further apart during panels and press conferences, and even the width of many aisles will be increased \u2013 something made easier by the decreased number of vendors showing their wares.",
    "And for 2022, the show was already planning to look different. The Las Vegas Convention Center\u2019s South Hall is traditionally awash in computing components and drones and wireless charging dongles; this year it will be closed entirely. And a brand-new wing of the Las Vegas Convention Center, dubbed the West Wing, will be unveiled, as a home for the automobiles \u2013 self-driving and otherwise \u2013 that have cropped up in recent years.",
    "But with the show now just a month off, and important questions about the transmissivness and deadliness of Omicron, and the efficacy of current vaccines in combatting the strain, yet to be answered, the question marks around the show are growing.",
    "Meanwhile, the first case of infection by Omicron was reported in the United States on Wednesday. It's unlikely to be the last."
