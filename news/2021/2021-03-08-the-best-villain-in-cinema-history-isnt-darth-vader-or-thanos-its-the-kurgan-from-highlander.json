    "It's asked all the time: Who\u2019s the best villain in cinema history? \u201cOh it\u2019s Darth Vader with his funny lungs!\u201d, \u201cNo, it\u2019s Thanos with his prune-fingered snap!\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s the Joker with his face paints!\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s Hannibal Lecter with his beans!\u201d",
    "No. They are all the wrong answers, answers punishable by death in the \u2018Obvious-and-Probably-Factually-Correct-Answers-That-are-Still-Actually-Wrong\u2019 High Courts.",
    "No. On the 35th anniversary of its release, the correct answer lies within 1986's flashy fantasy adventure, Highlander, the film that gave us the eternally quotable \u201cthere can be only one\u201d line, with its absolutely fiendish villain, the Kurgan.",
    "He is, to put it bluntly, a proper bastard.",
    "A little bit of scene setting for those unfamiliar with the film. Highlander is a centuries-spanning sci-fi action epic, centring on 16th century scotsman Connor MacLeod (a bafflingly accented Christopher Lambert). The movie sees immortal warriors across the globe fight through the ages to win \u2018The Prize\u2019, a sort of ultimate knowledge of all humanity\u2019s thoughts and secrets. Being immortal, these warriors effectively live forever, surviving stabbings and bludgeoning, explosions and gunfire \u2013 but they can\u2019t survive without their heads. Cue the excuse for a load of badass sword fights and beheadings, as a mysterious force draws the remaining immortals towards New York for a final 20th century showdown.",
    "Is Highlander good? Objectively... probably not. It\u2019s all a bit silly, and too much B-movie fun for cinema snobs to really take seriously. Really, it's a dyed-in-the-wool dad movie. Sean Connery stars as an ancient Egyptian Spaniard with a musketeer\u2019s facial hair, a pearl earring and a defiantly Scottish accent \u2013 and this is all soundtracked by the falsetto of Freddie Mercury and Queen at their most metal. This is the kind of bold nonsense we\u2019re dealing with here. But it has a fantastic concept, some amazing action sequences and some breathtaking highland scenery to bathe in, enough to make it a cult classic and guilty pleasure.",
    "Its one undeniably excellent element? Yep, you guessed it \u2013 the Kurgan. Equal parts Conan The Barbarian, WWE\u2019s Undertaker and Motorhead\u2019s Lemmy, he\u2019s walked the Earth for millenia, a contemporary of Atilla the Hun and Ghengis Khan, chopping off heads of immortal rivals and taking great pleasure in the process.",
    "It\u2019s Clancy Brown under the gothic make-up and barbaric costuming of the Kurgan. He\u2019s perhaps better known these days for his role as prison guard Captain Byron Hadley in The Shawshank Redemption, or even the CGI monstrosity Sutur from Thor Ragnarok. Incredibly, he\u2019s also the voice of Mr Krabs in Spongebob Squarepants. But his breakthrough came as the Kurgan in Highlander, a crazed and vile character \u2013 and an absolute delight to watch.",
    "Brown steals every single scene he\u2019s in \u2013 including those when he\u2019s opposite the legendary Sean Connery. An imposing and muscled 6\u20193\u201d in height, Brown walks a fine line between driven executioner and blood-thirsty savage. One scene shows him spinning his broadsword around a dishevelled New York tenement like a ballerina, another thrashing at a fellow immortal warrior in an animalistic fury.",
    "There\u2019s a ludicrous viciousness to Brown\u2019s performance which he obviously relishes, a cruel smirk on his face even when impaling a helpless victim on his claymore. The Kurgan loves being a shit, basically, and you can tell that Clancy Brown loves being the Kurgan, being a shit.",
    "Here\u2019s some of the gnarly stuff that the Kurgan does in the Highlander:",
    "See? A proper bastard. All this while being about 3,000 years old.",
    "But it\u2019s the little things too. While chasing McLeod\u2019s love interest Brenda Wyatt through her apartment building, he\u2019s also enjoying a popsicle. He stubs out the flames of prayer candles in a church, all for a laugh. He really doesn\u2019t give a crap \u2013 having lived as long as he has, morality, and humanity, civilisation is all just a big meaningless joke. He\u2019s a true nihilist, playing chicken in a stolen car along the sidewalk, running down pedestrians with his hands off the wheel and his fingers over his eyes. As he screams to the parishioners of the Big Apple church he\u2019s taking refuge in (before a pantomime twirl), \u201cI have something to say! It's better to burn out than to fade away!\u201d",
    "For years now a Highlander reboot has been in the works, with John Wick director Chad Stahelski leading the project since the end of 2016. Previous rumors saw Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s Dave Bautista linked with the infamous Kurgan\u2019s rebooted role. He\u2019s definitely got the brawn, but can he pull off the unhinged nastiness of the Kurgan, should that casting rumor prove true? Here\u2019s hoping.",
    "Whatever is next for the Highlander franchise, there is one thing for certain \u2013 they\u2019re going to have a hard time finding a bad guy as deliciously evil as Clancy Brown\u2019s Kurgan."
