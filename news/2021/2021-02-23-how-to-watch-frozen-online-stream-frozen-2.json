    "Disney changed the game yet again in 2013 when it released the instant animated classic Frozen. Kids and adults alike were enthralled by the magical wintery world inhabited by princesses Elsa and Anna, with equally popular sequel Frozen 2 following in 2019. Featuring reindeer, snowmen and singalong songs galore, the two movies are festive favorites that can be enjoyed all year round, so read on as we explain how to watch Frozen online today.",
    "Featuring superb voice acting by Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel and Josh Gad among others, the only spoiler we'll give you about the two Frozen movies is that they're available exclusively for streaming on one platform: Disney Plus. That means in just a few moments, you can be watching Frozen 1 or Frozen 2 online, as the service is super easy to get started with.",
    "Disney Plus is available in many countries around the world, including North America, most of Europe, Australia and Oceania, and large parts of Asia and Latin America. It's cheap, too, with a month's subscription costing just $6.99 / \u00a37.99 / AUD$11.99 - and has much more in addition to the Frozen movies.",
    "It's also the place to watch Home Alone online, as well being home to every Simpsons episode ever, the complete Marvel movie canon, Pixar's latest and greatest, exclusives like Hamilton and The Mandalorian, and so much more.",
    "Convinced? Sign up for Disney Plus today or keep reading for even more information the streaming service and how to watch Frozen online in 2021.",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck in to we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at $69.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN+ to your subscription price. The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as The Great, Upload, Helstrom and Normal People. While ESPN+ brings tonnes of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $12.99 a month.",
    "Disney Plus is showing no signs of slowing down since the service first launched last November and in addition to being the exclusive release platform of new Pixar movies like Soul, subscribers can look forward to Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian, Mulan, Hamilton, WandaVision, and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "Now that Disney has set the precedent of releasing its live-action Mulan remake on the service instead of in theaters through its Premier Access program, expect the company to keep bring more blockbuster films that were originally intended to be shown on the big screen to Disney Plus in 2021.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star on Disney Plus payload that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy. It costs a tiny bit more, but is worth it based on our initial impressions - and you can still save big by going with an annual subscription.",
