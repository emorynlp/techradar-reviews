    "Car maker Ford has released details of a \u201cMindfulness Concept Car\u201d to tackle the stress of being on the road.",
    "The car design, which is based on a Ford Kuga SUV, makes use of a variety of stress-reducing technologies that Ford hopes will \u201creduce symptoms of stress and anxiety\u201d in its customers.",
    "Those technologies include ambient lighting LEDs along the car\u2019s skylight, and \u201ctailored playlists\u201d paired with a \u201cB&O Beosonic equaliser\u201d for soothing sights and sounds, as well as a \u2018power nap\u2019 setting that adjusts the driver\u2019s seat to lie down flat like a bed (though we\u2019d only recommend using this when you\u2019re safely parked).",
    "Other features include fresh air being circulated as you enter a vehicle, and \u201cpremium air filters and UV-C lighting to remove dust and bacteria\u201d \u2013 a notable addition in a time where many of us are fearful of contagions.",
    "A paired wearable, too, would \u201cmonitor the driver\u2019s heart rate\u201d to help keep track of your state on the dashboard, or even \u201csynchronize\u201d your heartbeat with the car\u2019s lighting and vibrating actuators in the seat. You can see a video for the concept car below.",
    "A press release for the announcement states that \u201cExperts believe that mindful driving can enhance awareness and reduce distraction, as well as increase empathy for other road users, making journeys safer and more enjoyable for all\u201d \u2013 so there\u2019s definitely a case being made for calmer drivers making traffic jams a bit less terrible for everyone, and possibly even reducing on-road accidents.",
    "Cars can be incredibly stressful things, as anyone with a license can attest \u2013 so it\u2019s unsurprising that a more mindful approach might help make it more of a pleasurable and calming activity. And we\u2019re seeing many car makers start to see their models more as destinations in themselves, with Tesla vehicles even getting in-car gaming systems (again, when you\u2019re parked please).",
    "This mindfulness concept car likely isn\u2019t landing anytime soon, for those of you jumping at the chance to buy a car that could reduce your cortisol levels \u2013 but we expect to see more features like these creep into Ford\u2019s designs down the road."
