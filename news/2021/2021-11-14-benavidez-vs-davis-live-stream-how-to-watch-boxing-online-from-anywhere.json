    "Undefeated two-time world champion David \"El Bandera Roja\" Benavidez has made no secret of his appetite for a title showdown with king of the ring Canelo Alvarez. But he first needs to prove his worth against Kyrone \"Shut It Down\" Davis, a late substitute who's making a name for himself. Read on as we explain how to watch a David Benavidez vs Kyrone Davis live stream today and catch all the boxing action online from anywhere in the world.",
    "Davis (16-2-1) has stepped in for Jose Uzcategui, who was withdrawn after failing a drugs test. The 27-year-old caught the eye by holding two-time super-middleweight champ Anthony Dirrell to a split decision draw in his first ever fight at 168 pounds in February, before a slightly hairy unanimous decision victory over Martez McGregor in September.",
    "He's certainly not afraid to come out swinging, but Benavidez (24-0) represents a major step in quality. The 24-year-old is The Ring magazine's top-ranked boxer at 168 pounds, and he'll want to put on a show in front of his home crowd, and with his brother Jose on the undercard. There's also the small matter of a potential shot at Canelo.",
    "There's plenty at stake, so follow our guide below to watch a Benavidez vs Davis live stream online from anywhere.",
    "Sadly there is no confirmed broadcaster for Benavidez vs Davis in either region at the time of writing. The only alternative is to use one of the best VPN service and watch the coverage from another nation as described above.",
    "The software is generally ideal for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. But do bear in mind that most paid streaming services do require a credit card based in the country the service is from.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream boxing from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone."
