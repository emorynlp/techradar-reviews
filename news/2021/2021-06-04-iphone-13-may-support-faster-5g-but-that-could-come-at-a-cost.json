    "If you have a recent phone then there\u2019s a good chance you can connect to 5G networks, but on most phones, in most places, you won\u2019t be getting the best possible speeds from 5G, and the iPhone 13 could take steps to fix that.",
    "That\u2019s according to a report from DigiTimes Asia, which states \u2013 citing industry sources - that over 50% of iPhone 13s will support mmWave 5G. It\u2019s not talking about models here, but rather total numbers. So in other words, over 50% of the iPhone 13s sold across the world will apparently support mmWave.",
    "That\u2019s a big change, because with the iPhone 12 range only US models support mmWave, with the rest of the world just getting sub-6GHz 5G support (in the US you get both). DigiTimes also claims that Android phones are likely to follow Apple\u2019s lead here, as currently most of them only support sub-6GHz too.",
    "For those who aren\u2019t up to date on 5G lingo, these terms refer to the frequency of the radio bands that 5G signals are carried on. Sub-6GHz means frequencies below 6GHz, while mmWave (standing for millimeter wave) means higher frequency bands.",
    "Those higher frequency bands have more data bandwidth and support for potentially much higher speeds, but they also don\u2019t carry a signal as far (meaning more cell towers are needed), and they\u2019re not as good at penetrating walls and other obstacles.",
    "So there are upsides to sticking with lower frequencies, and that\u2019s what most of the world \u2013 including the UK \u2013 has done so far. That in turn is why Apple didn\u2019t offer mmWave 5G in the iPhone 12 range outside the US \u2013 because you wouldn\u2019t be able to make use of it anyway.",
    "It sounds like this could be changing with the iPhone 13 range though, and this is a claim we\u2019ve heard more than once. The exact regions that could get mmWave models aren\u2019t mentioned here, but it\u2019s entirely possible that the UK and Australia will be among them.",
    "Of course, we\u2019ll still need mobile networks to start supporting mmWave before this is helpful, but at the very least it could future-proof the iPhone 13 range, as it\u2019s likely only a matter of time before mmWave is made more widely available.",
    "However, the downside to this move is that it could also mean price rises, as incorporating both mmWave and sub-6GHz support is more expensive than sub-6GHz alone. So it\u2019s possible that Apple\u2019s very expensive phones could get even more expensive this year.",
