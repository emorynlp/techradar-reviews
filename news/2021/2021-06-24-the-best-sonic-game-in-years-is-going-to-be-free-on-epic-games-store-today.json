  "article": [
    "Sonic is 30-years-old \u2013 well, the blue hedgehog had that milestone birthday yesterday \u2013 and the latest freebie from the Epic Games Store celebrates this in style.",
    "Sonic Mania is, in our opinion, the best outing for the franchise in recent times, and unsurprisingly it featured on our list of the best Sonic games ever, which was compiled in honor of the hedgehog\u2019s anniversary.",
    "So, to get it free is pretty cool to say the least, and it adds more weight to the towering pile of top-notch freebies that Epic has given away in recent history (including critically aclaimed Control earlier in June).",
    "Sonic Mania is a retro platformer in classic Sonic style, starring the titular hedgehog plus two companions Tails and Knuckles. It features that classic Megadrive/Genesis look and the same iconic environments, but delivered alongside some fresh zones and featuring some excellent graphics.",
    "You even get the original sounds \u2013 with a great soundtrack \u2013 and the feel of a classic Sonic game is perfectly captured, so this truly is a nostalgia-laden treat. However, it\u2019s also a superb platformer in its own right, so you\u2019ll enjoy this even if you\u2019ve never dipped a toe in Sonic waters before (unless you really detest platform games, that is).",
    "Sonic Mania will be available to grab for free on the Epic Games Store later today (it\u2019ll soon replace Overcooked 2, so if you want that, move quickly)."
