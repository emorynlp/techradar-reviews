  "article": [
    "A useful new security feature is set to be included with Windows 10X that makes it much more difficult for thieves to wipe a stolen device. The new streamlined version of Windows 10 is expected to launch in spring this year and come with a number of handy additions.",
    "When it arrives, Windows 10X will have a new \u201canti-theft protection\u201d solution built-in that prevents thieves from restoring a device to factory settings and selling it on. With Windows 10, this is currently easy to achieve simply by accessing \u201csettings\u201d and clicking \u201cReset this PC.\u201d However, with Windows 10X, anti-theft protection means that any individual attempting to wipe a device first needs to enter the device PIN or the Microsoft account credentials previously associated with the device.",
    "\"Anti-theft protection prevents someone else from resetting your device and re-using it,\u201d the settings page for the new feature reads. \u201cWhen anti-theft protection is on, you will need to enter your PIN or Microsoft account password before resetting and re-using this device.\"",
    "The new security feature makes a lot of sense given that it is currently extremely easy for thieves to resell stolen Windows goods. Microsoft previously had a similar feature for its Windows Mobile operating system but there are no concrete plans to bring anti-theft protection to the regular Windows 10 platform.",
    "Windows 10X is designed to be a modular, lightweight version of the Windows 10 operating system, specifically designed for portable devices \u2013 which is perhaps why Microsoft has prioritized the platform for its new security offering.",
    "Among the other new changes announced for Windows 10X, the Start Menu is set to be replaced by a static app launcher, rounded corners will be returning, and it looks like Cortana will no longer be supported.",
