  "summary": "What does The Clone Wars spin-off have in store for Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Echo and Crosshair?",
  "article": [
    "The Clone Wars may be over but Clone Troopers still have a major role to play in that galaxy far, far away. The Bad Batch season 2 will continue the adventures of Clone Force 99, a ragtag group of unique troopers genetically engineered to possess traits that make them superior soldiers.",
    "While the first run of 16 episodes took a while finding its reason to exist, the show eventually carved out its niche in Star Wars canon, with potentially significant implications for The Mandalorian. The Bad Batch season 2 seems set to expand the mythology further, as Hunter, Tech, Wrecker, Echo, Crosshair and their young sidekick Omega try to find their place in a universe where the newly formed Empire is starting to throw its weight around.",
    "So, with the show\u2019s return confirmed for 2022, we\u2019ve sent our troopers on a covert mission to tell you everything you need to know about The Bad Batch season 2 release date, story, cast and more. Spoilers follow for season 1.",
    "Release date: The show\u2019s been confirmed for a 2022 return. If we were gamblers like Lando Calrissian, we\u2019d bet on a May debut.",
    "Cast: Dee Bradley Baker will return to voice the main cast of characters Hunter, Tech, Wrecker, Echo, Crosshair and any other clones they might encounter. We wouldn't bet against seeing the return of Ming-Na Wen as Fennec Shand \u2013 and maybe some other deep cuts from Star Wars lore will turn up.",
    "Story: With the Clones being phased out by the end of season 1, we expect to see the galaxy changing further around our characters in season 2. What happens to the dispossessed Clones is likely to come up more in future seasons, too.",
    "On August 5, just ahead of the two-part season 1 finale, Disney Plus confirmed confirmed (via StarWars.com) that the show will return. All we know for sure about The Bad Batch season 2 release date is that it will be some time in 2022. But, seeing as the first run kicked off (rather appropriately) on May 4 (aka Star Wars Day), we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if season 2 debuts on the same date \u2013 not least because it falls on a Wednesday in 2022, which (after Loki and What If\u2026?) now appears to be Disney Plus\u2019s new favorite day for original launches.",
    "It\u2019s still early days for a proper Bad Batch season 2 trailer. The first season 1 teaser didn\u2019t appear until late March, just over a month before the show\u2019s debut, and we\u2019d expect to see a similar pattern for the follow-up. In the meantime, you can enjoy the announcement teaser that debuted on Instagram in August 2021.",
    "Spoilers follow for The Bad Batch season 1. If you're yet to watch it on Disney Plus, proceed with caution.",
    "Like its counterparts at Marvel, Lucasfilm isn\u2019t in the habit of giving away major story details ahead of a Star Wars movie or TV show\u2019s release. It would be a massive surprise, however, if The Bad Batch season 2 didn\u2019t pick up where its predecessor left off.",
    "Following the Imperial fleet\u2019s brutal destruction of Tipoca City and the cloning facilities on Kamino, Hunter, Tech, Wrecker, Echo and Omega parted ways with ex-Clone Force 99 member Crosshair. Even though Crosshair told the Bad Batch that his Order 66-initiated inhibitor chip had been removed \u2013 a fact confirmed by head writer Jennifer Corbett in an interview with StarWars.com \u2013 his allegiance remains with the Empire.",
    "As he\u2019s so fond of reminding his brothers, \u201cgood soldiers follow orders\u201d, but the question remains: will the Empire value his services now that Clones are being phased out in favour of conscripted TK Troopers, the forerunners of Imperial Stormtroopers?",
    "The Bad Batch, meanwhile, are likely to have some big decisions to make after they\u2019ve departed Kamino in their ship, the Havoc Marauder. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have everyone\u2019s purpose locked in at the end of season 1,\u201d supervising director Brad Rau told StarWars.com. \u201cIt\u2019s something that they deal with in a big way as we move into season 2. What is their purpose from all of their different points of view? It\u2019s going to be a big deal, something we really wanted to dig into.\u201d",
    "Although the Bad Batch are on the run from Imperial forces, they\u2019re yet to take up arms in earnest against the Emperor\u2019s totalitarian regime. As they see more and more of the oppressive tactics employed against the populace, however, it seems unlikely they\u2019ll continue doing odd jobs for former Jedi informant/information broker Cid when they could be joining the fight.",
    "So will Clone Force 99 have a role to play in establishing the Rebellion against the Empire?",
    "The Martez sisters\u2019 appearance in season 1 strongly hinted the duo are involved in some kind of resistance movement, and their contact looked a lot like Rebel Alliance bigwig (and Leia\u2019s adopted dad) Bail Organa. (That said, we know from Star Wars Rebels that the Alliance won\u2019t come together for over a decade, so there\u2019s a limit to how pivotal the Bad Batch can be in its formation.)",
    "We also expect The Bad Batch season 2 to tell us more about the backstory of Omega, the unique female clone of Jango Fett who\u2019s become Hunter, Tech, Wrecker and Echo\u2019s travelling companion. Although still a child, she\u2019s actually older than the members of Clone Force 99 who \u2013 like their Clone brothers \u2013 had their growth rate accelerated by the Kaminoans. Omega knows that the Batch were created with \u201cdesirable\u201d genetic mutations to make them into superior soldiers \u2013 and there\u2019s surely more to learn about her own origins.",
    "We can also expect to learn more about the Clones spread throughout the galaxy in the wake of the Clone Wars. \u201cWe will not let that storyline go undiscussed, for sure,\u201d confirmed Rau. It remains to be seen, however, whether that means Clone Wars veteran Rex and his future Rebels sidekick Gregor will see more action, or the introduction of new Clones.",
    "The Bad Batch may be animated but it\u2019s just as important to Star Wars canon as its live-action counterparts. As the first TV show or movie to dive into the early days of the Galactic Empire, it\u2019s travelling to previously unexplored regions of the Star Wars timeline \u2013 and has surprisingly major implications for The Mandalorian season 3.",
    "The final scene of The Bad Batch\u2019s first season saw chief Kaminoan scientist Nala Se arriving at an Imperial outpost \u2013 concept art suggests this is Mount Tantiss on Wayland, a planet that appeared in the (now non-canonical) expanded universe. Intriguingly, the Imperial scientist who greets Nala Se is wearing the same uniform as Dr Pershing, the geneticist who used Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) as a test subject in The Mandalorian.",
    "It\u2019s long been speculated that Pershing\u2019s experiments are part of Palpatine\u2019s long-standing plan to clone himself \u2013 a project that came to fruition in The Rise of Skywalker \u2013 so there\u2019s a good chance Nala Se will be laying the groundwork for the Emperor\u2019s nefarious schemes. \u201cWhere Nala Se is, what Nala Se is doing, should be a mystery to the audience,\u201d Corbett told StarWars.com, \u201cand we hope to explore that in the upcoming season.\u201d",
    "Bounty hunters \u2013 always integral to the Star Wars mix \u2013 also help to tie The Bad Batch season 2 into existing canon.",
    "In the first season, Kaminoan prime minister Lama Su hired The Clone Wars\u2019 biggest Clint Eastwood fan, Cad Bane, to track down Omega, prompting Nala Se to dispatch Fennec Shand to protect her. Shand\u2019s presence is unlikely to be a coincidence.",
    "The infamous Boba Fett saved her from death by on the surface of Tatooine in the first season of The Mandalorian, and the bounty hunting duo subsequently became associates \u2013 to the point that they\u2019re the two leads in spin-off show The Book of Boba Fett. Could The Bad Batch \u2013 set more than 20 years earlier \u2013 detail the beginnings of their friendship?",
    "With Fett still in his teens at this point in the Star Wars timeline, they\u2019ll both be young bounty hunters making their way in the universe. We also know from The Clone Wars that the young Fett had associations with other representatives of the trade, including Dengar, Bossk and Aurra Sing.",
    "Assuming he does turn up in The Bad Batch season 2 (Fennec Shand actor Ming-Na Wen was cagey when TechRadar asked her about his return back in June), Fett is likely to have a particular interest in Omega. After all, like him, she\u2019s an unaltered clone of their father, Jango.",
    "With the show set between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy, most of the major characters in the franchise are potentially in play. While it\u2019s unlikely Han Solo, Luke and Leia will make an appearance (the twins are just infants at this point in the timeline), the cargo bay doors are open for the likes of Darth Maul, Grand Admiral Thrawn and even Darth Vader to cross paths with Clone Force 99.",
    "Official confirmation of The Bad Batch season 2 cast is yet to emerge, but it would be a surprise of Death Star-shattering proportions if the headliners don\u2019t look something like this:",
    "Put simply, there would be no Bad Batch without Dee Bradley Baker. Having voiced legions of Clone Troopers throughout The Clone Wars, the actor plays the five lead roles in the show, giving unique personalities to Hunter, Tech, Wrecker, Echo and Crosshair. He also voiced additional Clones in season one, including a couple of veterans of The Clone Wars and Rebels, Rex and Gregor.",
    "Michelle Ang is likely to be back as the Bad Batch\u2019s \u2018sister\u2019 Omega, and we\u2019d be surprised if Cheers\u2019 Rhea Perlman doesn\u2019t return as Cid. With Kaminoan scientist Nala Se now working at an Imperial facility, we\u2019d expect to hear more from Gwendoline Yeo, while Noshir Dalal is likely to lead the Empire\u2019s pursuit of Clone Force 99 as Vice Admiral Rampart.",
    "Beyond those regulars, we\u2019re into less predictable guest star territory.",
    "On the bounty hunter front, we\u2019re predicting returns for Ming-Na Wen and Corey Burton as Fennec Shand and Cad Bane, respectively. And if Boba Fett does make an appearance in The Bad Batch season 2, that could mean a return for Daniel Logan, who played the young version of the bounty hunter in both Attack of the Clones and The Clone Wars.",
    "As for the Imperials, it\u2019s likely Stephen Stanton will crop up again as future Grand Moff Tarkin. A Palpatine cameo, meanwhile, would probably prompt the return of Sam Witwer, who voiced the character in Rebels and later episodes of The Clone Wars \u2013 as well as playing Darth Maul. (While Ian McDiarmid reprised his live-action role as Palpatine in the first episode of The Bad Batch, the scene was lifted from his performance in Revenge of the Sith.)",
    "Part of the fun with any of the Star Wars animated shows, however, is listening out for big-name actors cropping up in the soundtrack, whether they\u2019re Star Wars legends (Billy Dee Williams appeared as Lando in Star Wars Rebels), or simply fans of the franchise (Simon Pegg cropped up as bounty hunter Dengar in The Clone Wars). The Bad Batch\u2019s first season featured a cameo from Fleabag\u2019s Sian Clifford as a protocol droid.",
    "Behind the camera, the principal production team remains largely unchanged, with Jennifer Corbett as lead writer, Brad Rau as supervising director, and Dave Filoni (a veteran of The Clone Wars and Rebels, the creator of The Bad Batch, and Lucasfilm\u2019s executive creative director) serving as executive producer."
