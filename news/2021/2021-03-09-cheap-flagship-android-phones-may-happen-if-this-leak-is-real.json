    "Qualcomm is one of the most renowned brands out there when it comes to developing chipsets for Android mobile devices, and it looks like it could be expanding its roster with a variant on its powerful Snapdragon 888 processor.",
    "This rumored chipset would, however, lack an integrated 5G modem, which could allow the company to provide high-end processing power at a lower cost.",
    "Leaker Roland Quandt brought the rumor to attention on Twitter, where he suggested that Qualcomm has a \u201clower end derivate\u201d of the Snapdragon 888 processor in the works. Its model number, SM8325, suggests only a slight downgrade to the Snapdragon 888, the model number of which is SM8350.",
    "Nothing\u2019s been confirmed on Qualcomm\u2019s end as of yet, but if there\u2019s credence to the rumors, this could mean that manufacturers will have the option to make their future flagship devices more affordable while sacrificing little to no processing power found in current high-end Android mobile devices.",
    "Chipsets are often one of the most expensive components in a mobile device, and are one of the driving forces behind why high-end smartphones and tablets come with such high price tags.",
    "While Qualcomm\u2019s rumored SM8325 chipset could drop the integrated 5G modem, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean 5G support is omitted entirely. What\u2019s more likely is that 5G integration isn\u2019t mandatory, instead offering manufacturers the option to exclude 5G in order to keep costs down.",
    "It\u2019ll be worth keeping an eye on Qualcomm\u2019s announcements in 2021; if the company is indeed working on a lite version of the Snapdragon 888, then Android devices launching in the future could provide some much-needed competition for the best and priciest hardware available on the market, with comparable performance at a lower cost. That\u2019s great news if you\u2019re not all that bothered about losing 5G."
