    "Kape Technologies, which owns multiple VPN services, including Private Internet Access (PIA), has acquired privacy and security content specialist Webselenese in a mixed cash and share deal.",
    "Besides PIA, UK-based Kape operates CyberGhost VPN and Zenmate VPN services, which it has inherited through previous acquisitions. Webselenese, which is based in Israel, runs vpnMentor, which provides reviews, tips, and other specialist content related to VPNs and various related services.",
    "\u201cThe acquisition of Webselenese is highly strategic for Kape, providing us with one of the most respected and far-reaching consumer privacy and security content businesses globally,\u201d said Kape\u2019s CEO Ido Erlichman as it informed the London Stock Exchange of the deal.",
    "Kape also mentions that the take over provides it direct access to an audience interested in digital privacy and security. It hopes Webselenese will help the company keep its ear to the ground in order to shape its product offerings in the future.",
    "Webselenese will operate as a new separate division under Kape.",
    "Notably however, the mention of vpnMentor is conspicuous by its absence in the announcement. However, Kape assures that its newest acquisition will continue to enjoy complete editorial independence, despite being under the direct control of a VPN operator henceforth.",
    "\u201cHaving worked in partnership with Kape for the last three years, we are delighted to join forces,\u201d said Ran Greenberg and Ariel Hochstadt, the co-founders of Webselenese, who\u2019ll continue to run the company's operations."
