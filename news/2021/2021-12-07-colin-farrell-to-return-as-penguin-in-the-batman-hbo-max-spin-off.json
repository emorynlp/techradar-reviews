    "Back in September, reports emerged confirming that Warner Bros. is currently developing a Penguin-focused The Batman spin-off series for HBO Max \u2013 but Colin Farrell\u2019s return to the role wasn\u2019t guaranteed.",
    "Now, though, Variety has confirmed the Irish actor\u2019s involvement in the project. As well as reprising his role as Oswald Cobblepot, Farrell will also serve as executive producer on the series.",
    "Details are thin on the ground as to what the upcoming HBO Max show will cover, but those early reports suggest it\u2019ll delve into Penguin\u2019s rise to power in Gotham. We may get a better idea of the plot once we\u2019ve seen Farrell in action for the first time in Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman, which is due to be released on March 4, 2022.",
    "We do know Lauren LeFranc has signed on to write the script for the series, with Reeves and The Batman producer Dylan Clark also in tow as additional project executives.",
    "The move to grant Penguin his own spin-off show marks another piece in WarnerMedia\u2019s plan to launch its own interconnected Batman universe in the vein of Marvel\u2019s cinematic universe.",
    "The studio already has a Gotham-set police drama in development, with British screenwriter Joe Barton attached as showrunner. Several other DC shows \u2013 like the Suicide Squad spin-off Peacemaker and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Justice League Dark series \u2013 are also in the works.",
    "As for whether The Batman itself will mark the first instalment in a handful of Robert Pattinson-led caped crusader movies, we\u2019ve spotted a few clues hinting at the possibility.",
    "Back in March, when filming officially wrapped on Matt Reeves\u2019 Dark Knight project, actor Jeffrey Wright \u2013 who plays Commissioner Gordon in the upcoming movie \u2013 tweeted a cryptic message to fans that suggests he\u2019ll be reprising the role in the future.",
    "Of course, \u201c...for now\u201d may instead refer to a separate TV or movie led by Gordon himself, rather than a direct sequel to The Batman, but given the scale of Warner\u2019s investment in DC IP over the next few years, we\u2019d be surprised if Pattinson doesn\u2019t don the cowl for a second time.",
    "Besides, if Penguin is returning to the small screen, it's only right that Batman gets more than one chance to beat him to a pulp."
