    "It may still be October but we're already starting to see some killer laptop deals that would rival anything over Black Friday. If you're after a brand new machine in this year's sale and are ready to buy now then you'll want to check out these early reductions on a range of Dell laptops \u2013 including one incredible value for money machine.",
    "Leading the way is this Dell Inspiron 15 3000 laptop for $699.99 (was $854.98), featuring an Intel i7 processor, 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD. We track loads of cheap laptop deals every week and it's practically impossible to find one at this price featuring all three of these top-end components at once. Let's be clear: this is one of the best Black Friday laptop deals out there right now. Altogether, you'll find this to be a fast, responsive and capable all-around machine for any task you want to throw at it.",
    "However, if you do want to spend a little less, you can choose to downgrade on a few components in order to save money and build a laptop that's better suited to your needs. We've picked out two more of these options for you below from these early Black Friday deals.",
    "The first is a mid-range choice for $499.99 (was $604.98) that has an i5 processor, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. That's still going to be an exceptional performer and excellent multitasker thanks to the processor and a healthy amount of RAM.",
    "The last is a budget option for $379.99 (was $534.98) that comes with an i3 processor, 8GB RAM and a 128GB SSD. While you definitely lose out on a fair chunk of speedy storage space here, the fact it keeps the 8GB of RAM will maintain a strong level of performance for general everyday browsing and some light work.",
    "Overall, then, there are some solid choices for those after a Dell Black Friday deal before we've even entered November. These offers are only live until Saturday so you will need to act fast to avoid missing out on the laptops we've highlighted. However, you can find further reductions across the entire Dell range should you be after something slightly different.",
    "While there are definitely some powerful machines in here we'd strongly suggest taking a look at all the best gaming laptop deals instead if that's what you'll mainly be using it for. These laptops are excellent but lack the graphical power behind them to support high-end end games effectively."
