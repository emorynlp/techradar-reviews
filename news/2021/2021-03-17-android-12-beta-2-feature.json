    "The second Android 12 Developer Preview \u2013 the Android 12 developer beta, as it were \u2013 is here, bringing smoother picture-in-picture transitions, additional privacy settings for notifications on lockscreen, and other perks.",
    "While this preview does, as the name suggests, have a ton of things that only concern app developers, some perks should excite every Android user, as laid out in an Android Developers Blog post. When swiping up-to-home while watching media, the transition to picture-in-picture mode happens while you\u2019re making the gesture, for instance.",
    "Users also get expanded privacy and security controls for which notifications show up on lockscreen, and should expect better UX experiences on round-edged phones as devs get better tools to adapt their apps.",
    "Other perks are strictly behind-the-scenes, like letting developers make sure their apps aren\u2019t interrupted by overlay alerts (helpful if you\u2019re in the middle of making a transaction or sending money over Venmo, say).",
    "Developers also get better access to app digests, can keep companion apps awake when linked wearables are near, and add more blur and color filters in complex combinations \u2013 including sweet \u2018frosted glass\u2019 effects like this:",
    "As always, to get access to a Developer Preview you\u2019ll need to download the Developer Preview SDK (get started here) on a compatible device \u2013 basically a Google device ranging from the Google Pixel 3 to Google Pixel 5."
