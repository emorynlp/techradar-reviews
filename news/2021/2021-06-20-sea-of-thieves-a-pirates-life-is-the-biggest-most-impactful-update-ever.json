    "Rare\u2019s swashbuckling online pirate adventure game, Sea of Thieves, certainly has the wind in its sails at the moment. After three years of substantial updates \u2013 which have added new gameplay mechanics, islands, emergent events, pets and countless cosmetics \u2013 it\u2019s hard to remember what the game looked like when it was released in March 2018.",
    "And that\u2019s a good thing, because Sea of Thieves launched in a rather barebones state. The foundations were obviously there, but the game was severely lacking in content and enough variety to keep all but the most dedicated players engaged.",
    "Now, though, Sea of Thieves\u2019 unpredictable nature is where the game truly shines. A simple voyage can often turn into something completely unexpected, which can lead to some unforgettable stories full of spectacular highs and lows. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the game has amassed over 20 million players.",
    "However, on June 22, Sea of Thieves is set to get even better thanks to the upcoming Sea of Thieves: A Pirate\u2019s Life update. Creative director Mike Chapman describes it as the game\u2019s \u201cbiggest, most impactful ever\u201d, and after attending a sneak peek at what awaits players in this ambitious crossover with Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise \u2013 which won\u2019t cost a single doubloon to experience \u2013 the open seas have never looked so inviting.",
    "Sea of Thieves: A Pirate\u2019s Life takes inspiration not just from the films, but also from the historic attraction at Disneyland. Eagle-eyed fans will spot many nods and creative twists that resemble moments from the classic ride, and those who were hoping to meet more than just Jack Sparrow from the crew of the Black Pearl will also be delighted to hear that more Pirates of the Caribbean characters will be in the game. The films\u2019 famous soundtrack will also be present.",
    "Players will get to experience five Tall Tales that tell an epic original story where you team up with the trickster Captain Jack Sparrow. Unlike with previous Tall Tales, however, you won\u2019t be interrupted by other players. It means that Rare has been able to craft \u201cthe most cinematic Tall Tales we\u2019ve ever done\u201d, said Chapman, and include more set pieces and mechanics that might not have been included due to the possibility of intervening players. Checkpoints are also available, which means you won\u2019t have to rush through the eight to 12-hour core story in one go.",
    "But how did the world\u2019s most recognizable pirate end up in the Sea of Thieves? Well, Jack has stolen the greatest treasure of all time \u2013 a golden key to other worlds. Upon entering the Sea of Thieves, he discovers that it's a paradise for pirates, where death is only a formality before you\u2019re back in the land of the living, ready to set sail again.",
    "That\u2019s not the case in Jack\u2019s world, of course, as Davy Jones has dominion over the seas. However, unfortunately for Jack, the tentacled terror Davy Jones has followed Jack into the new world, and the world of Sea of Thieves is now under threat.",
    "Players will visit all-new locations such as the supernatural world of the Damned and the Sunken Kingdom in this Sea of Thieves: A Pirate\u2019s Life, and there are countless secrets and Easter eggs to find. You\u2019ll dive deeper than you ever have before, wield a new weapon called the Trident of Dark Tides, use Jack Sparrow\u2019s famous compass that points to the thing you want most in the world, and encounter brand new enemies such as sirens, phantoms, and ocean crawlers \u2013 all of which will also be available in the game\u2019s main sandbox.",
    "Captain Jack Sparrow will be on hand to help, of course. He\u2019ll man the cannons when you\u2019re fighting Davy Jones\u2019 Flying Dutchman, and when he\u2019s not in combat, you can find him hanging around the ship for the odd selfie. It\u2019s clear that the utmost care and attention went into making Sparrow as convincing as possible, too, as Rare hired actor Johnny Depp\u2019s stunt double from the film (complete in costume) to play out key cinematics. Sparrow is also voiced by Jared Butler, who voiced the legendary Captain in the Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s End video game.",
    "This has clearly been a dream project for so many at Rare, and both Chapman and Sea of Thieves\u2019 executive producer Joe Neate could barely contain their excitement as they spoke about how the partnership between Disney and Rare\u2019s seafaring adventure came to be.",
    "Apparently, Disney recognized the tone, humor and fantastical nature of Sea of Thieves, and Rare has worked hard to try to tap into the feeling of what it means to be a pirate, and the enduring appeal of what makes pirates such a fascinating part of history.",
    "The overriding message that seemed to be integral to Rare and Disney\u2019s partnership coming to fruition, though, was one of respect \u2013 both for Sea of Thieves\u2019 and Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019s lore and universe. And, from what we\u2019ve seen so far, it appears that Rare has achieved that balance with aplomb.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to play Sea of Thieves,\u201d said Chapman, and it\u2019s honestly hard to disagree. To paraphrase Captain Jack Sparrow: if you were waiting for the opportune moment to play Sea of Thieves, this is it.",
    "Sea of Thieves: A Pirate\u2019s Life is available on June 22 as a free update for Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC players. The game is also available on Xbox Game Pass."
