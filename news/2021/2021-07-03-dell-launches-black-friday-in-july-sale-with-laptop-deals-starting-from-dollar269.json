    "Dell has launched its own answer to the 4th of July sales, with a 'Black Friday in July' event that's offering big discounts on everything from cheap everyday browsing machines to the most powerful of gaming laptops. That means there's something for everyone on offer right now - perfect if you need to upgrade your PC without breaking the bank. We wouldn't wait too long, though - some of these offers are limited in quantity, so if a price looks right, we'd take advantage of it soon.",
    "The cheapest offer in today's Dell laptop deals is this $269.99 (was $368.99) Inspiron 15 3000. Whereas we usually expect budget machines like this to come with 64GB of storage, you're actually still picking up a 128GB SSD under the hood here, as well as an Intel Pentium Silver N5030 processor.",
    "That's excellent value for money, but if you need a little more power, the 11th generation i3 configuration is now down to $379.99 (was $518.99) and manages to pack a 1TB hard drive into that price as well.",
    "Highlights also include the new touchscreen 15-inch machine, sporting an impressive 1TB SSD and Ryzen 7 processor as well as a massive $249 discount down to $799.99 (was $1,048.99) as well as a 17.3-inch Dell G7 taking a $400 price drop down to $1,099.99.",
    "You'll find all our top picks just below and plenty more cheap laptop deals further down the page as well.",
    "We're rounding up plenty more 4th of July laptop deals and you'll find all the latest prices on a range of Dell machines with our dedicated Dell laptop deals roundup as well."
