    "Google officially revealed the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro via a series of tweets, and it looks a lot like leaks had suggested. But the tech giant confirmed another long-rumored bit of info: the phones would be powered by a chipset built in-house, which has officially been named Google Tensor. So what can this new silicon do?",
    "We\u2019ve broken down what we\u2019ve heard in the first day after Google formally introduced its new system-on-a-chip, which was previously known by its supposed codename, Whitechapel.",
    "In short, the Tensor chipset should improve plenty of ordinary things Google\u2019s Pixel phones do, from browsing around the Android interface to shooting photos, as well as give faster Google Assistant results and other voice recognition tasks \u2013 the new silicon is expected to do all this on-device rather than need to send the query to Google servers and back.",
    "We\u2019ve already seen this effect in Apple\u2019s A-series Bionic chipsets, which have software so tightly tailored to hardware that the company\u2019s flagship phones routinely top the benchmark rankings of our best phones with comparatively minimal RAM.",
    "Google listed several ways the Tensor chipset will empower the Pixel 6 phones in a tweet, including with its camera, speech recognition, and other features \u2013 but mostly in performing AI and machine learning processes on the device, which should improve voice commands, translation, captioning, dictation, and other speech recognition tasks.",
    "This should assist plenty of leading Pixel 6 features typically showcased at Google IO, from Live Transcription in its Recorder app to Live Translation to Live Captioning to Google Assistant and more. We\u2019d bet there are perks the company is keeping up its sleeve to reveal with the Pixel 6, too.",
    "Thanks to Tensor, Google has also tuned up its rear cameras, with better sensors that wouldn\u2019t fit in the four-lens block of the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4, according to an official blog post laying out the silicon\u2019s advantages. Hence the new camera bar, as it\u2019s called.",
    "The phone series had been using the same-size sensors since the Pixel 2, YouTuber Marques Brownlee explained in a new video made after he claimed to have handled the new Pixel 6. But with the new Tensor SoC, Google finally had the opportunity to use bigger sensors that the tech giant\u2019s software could harness \u2013 so we\u2019re genuinely eager to see what they\u2019re capable of. Google even teased \u201centirely new features, plus improvements to existing ones,\u201d and we can\u2019t wait to see what that means for its photo capabilities.",
    "The Material You development coming in Android 12, which radically re-tunes the interface to a color and tone palette using new animation and design frameworks, will be powered and made smooth by Tensor, Google affirmed in its blog post.",
    "Security-wise, Google assures that Tensor will have its own security core with a new Titan M2 chip combined. Google claims the Pixel 6 will have the \u201cmost layers of hardware security in any phone,\u201d whatever that means.",
    "While the Pixel 6 announcement is a welcome surprise, it wasn\u2019t the reveal we were expecting \u2013 that would be the mid-range Pixel 5a, which a Bloomberg report had suggested would launch this month. Why does that matter? It raises the question of whether the Pixel 5a will get Tensor, too.",
    "Our guess is: no, primarily because Google is pitching Tensor as a generational leap in tech that it\u2019s integrating first in its top-end phones. We don\u2019t have any pricing info for the Pixel 6, so we can\u2019t say that the Tensor is positioned only for premium devices, but we\u2019d expect the company needs some time (and phone generations) to optimize its hardware and software. Heck, Apple\u2019s cheaper phones didn\u2019t get a leading A-series chipset until the iPhone SE 2020.",
    "Given all the rumors pointing to a nearly finished Pixel 5a, it would make sense for it to be powered by the silicon that had previously powered Google\u2019s phones: Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets. What about future mid-range a-series Pixel handsets? Those could be Qualcomm-powered, too, per a Walter Bloomberg tweet citing a Qualcomm spokesperson as saying that \u201cQualcomm will continue to work closely with Google on existing and future products based on Snapdragon platforms.\u201d",
    "But we\u2019re still waiting to see what the Tensor does for the Pixel 6 \u2013 and doesn\u2019t do, given this is Google\u2019s first SoC. For instance, will it have its own 5G modem, or will that be provided by a different chipmaker, as analyst Anshel Sag wondered in a tweet \u2013 especially since Google didn\u2019t mention 5G once in its blog post.",
    "In any case, Google has made a bunch of claims about Tensor that we\u2019re excited to see backed up by the device when it lands in \u2018fall 2021\u2019 in the US (Q3 2021). Whether Tensor gives the Pixel phones their edge to claw some market share away from Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi and the other big names in the phones game is anyone\u2019s guess."
