  "article": [
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy is a sequel 25 years in the making. The original movie retains a cult following to this day, and we can finally enjoy the new Looney Tunes basketball adventure in theaters and on HBO Max later this week.",
    "The follow-up film will star legendary basketball player LeBron James alongside some familiar faces \u2013 both human and cartoon \u2013 as Warner Bros. looks to bring its Space Jam series to a new generation.",
    "With the movie dropping very soon, we thought you'd want to know everything that's been revealed about Space Jam: A New Legacy.",
    "Below, we'll discuss the movie's release date, cast, plot details, other potential cameos, trailers and more. It\u2019s a slam dunk of an article, if we say so ourselves \u2013 so read on to find out what's worth knowing about Space Jam 2.",
    "Space Jam 2 is getting a simultaneous release in theaters and on HBO Max on July 16, 2021.",
    "A New Legacy will follow in the footsteps of other 2021 Warner Bros. movies, including Godzilla vs Kong and Mortal Kombat, in launching on the company's streaming platform as well as the big screen. Well, in the US and other territories where HBO Max is available anyway.",
    "However, it\u2019ll only be available for a month on HBO Max following its release. If you plan on catching it at home rather than in a cinema, you\u2019ll need to do so before August 16.",
    "HBO Max subscribers (with an ad-free plan, that is) can watch Space Jam: A New Legacy for no additional cost, too, so it\u2019s well worth checking it out if you currently have a subscription to the streamer.",
    "A new trailer for Space Jam: A New Legacy was released on June 9, and gave us another look at the film..",
    "There's new footage, some humorous moments and a better look at the Looney Tunes in CGI form. Admittedly, some look better than others, but we're hoping that we'll be used to their new aesthetic by the time that Space Jam 2 launches.",
    "The first official Space Jam 2 trailer was released on April 3. It offered curious viewers a proper look at the movie's plot, which Looney Tunes characters will join LeBron on screen, and which other Warner Bros. properties are making an appearance in the film (more on these later):",
    "Warner Bros. have released a couple of teaser clips of the movie in the run up to release, too, which give another look at the film's surreal humor.",
    "The first is a spoof on The Matrix starring Granny and Speedy Gonzales:",
    "The second, meanwhile, shows Porky Pig rapping. Yes, rapping. It's as silly as it sounds, too:",
    "Space Jam: A New Legacy follows LeBron's journey to rescue his youngest son Dom (Cedric Joe) after the latter becomes trapped in a virtual world by an evil AI program called Al-G Rhythm (Don Cheadle).",
    "Despite the pair being reunited, however, LeBron is told by Al-G Rhythm that he must lead the Tune Squad \u2013 comprising characters like Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny and Daffy Duck \u2013 to victory over the AI\u2019s digital basketball champions, known as the Goon Squad, before the duo can return to the real world.",
    "The Goon Squad are digitized versions of professional basketball players, so LeBron and the Tunes Squad will have their work cut out for them. If the first film was anything to go by, LeBron and his animated pals are bound to find some funny ways to get one over their opponents, rescue Dom and help the James family to return home.",
    "As we've mentioned, we know several of the human and cartoon characters who will feature in Space Jam 2:",
    "NBA players including Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis, Daminan Lillard, Diana Taurasi and Nneka Ogwumike are also set to appear. They will play the Goon Squad's characters Wet-Fire, The Brow, Chronos, White Mamba and Arachnneka respectively.",
    "As for which Looney Tunes characters will feature in some capacity, see the list of these \u2013 and their voice actors \u2013 below:",
    "Lola Bunny is undergoing a big character change for A New Legacy. Director Malcom D. Lee watched the original film for the first time in 2019, and was put off by the overly sexualized nature of Bugs\u2019 love interest.",
    "Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Lee said: \"Lola was very sexualized, like Betty Boop mixed with Jessica Rabbit. Lola was not politically correct.... This is a kids' movie, why is she in a crop top? It just felt unnecessary, but at the same time there's a long history of that in cartoons.\"",
    "In a bid to better reflect more contemporary approaches to female character designs, Lee revealed that Lola\u2019s new look is about \u201cmaking sure she had an appropriate length on her shorts and was feminine without being objectified, but gave her a real voice\u201d.",
    "While Lola has undergone a makeover, there\u2019s one Looney Tune who has been omitted from Space Jam 2 entirely. According to Deadline, Pepe Le Pew, the group\u2019s French skunk, was eliminated from the sequel after Lee joined the project. A scene involving the character had been filmed before Lee\u2019s arrival but, in the wake of criticism about consent that the cartoon has received, the sequence was removed from the film\u2019s final cut.",
    "The official trailer for Space Jam: A New Legacy wasn\u2019t well received by every Space Jam or movie fan when it was released.",
    "Some onlookers took exception to the sheer amount of iconography from other Warner movies, and criticized the studio for shoehorning various series into Space Jam 2 when they have no business being there. It\u2019s a particularly contentious issue, too, when you consider that mature films, such as A Clockwork Orange, will feature in an upcoming film aimed at kids.",
    "Either way, Warner Bros. won\u2019t remove those other properties so late into development. If you\u2019re curious about which Warner Bros. IPs will show up in some capacity, check out the list below of those confirmed by the trailer:",
    "Spoilers for Space Jam's ending follow from this point on.",
    "While those references aren\u2019t overly necessary, there are a couple of cameo appearances that we\u2019d really like to see.",
    "For one, it would be really cool to see Michael Jordan, the protagonist of Space Jam, show up.",
    "We had suspected that he wouldn\u2019t, given that he didn\u2019t want to return for Space Jam\u2019s planned sequel in the 1990s. Now, though, we have confirmation that he will be appearing in some capacity.",
    "Speaking to Access Hollywood about Space Jam 2 (skip to the 9:58 mark in the video below), Don Cheadle revealed that Michael Jordan was \u201cin the movie\u201d, but not in the manner that fans would expect him to be. Will he be a hologram of sorts? Or could he appear in a flashback sequence involving Bugs, Lola and the rest of the Looney Tunes? We\u2019ll have to wait to find out.",
    "As well as Jordan's return, how about Bill Murray and Wayne Knight turning up for a scene or two? Murray appeared as one of Jordan\u2019s golfing friends, and helped the Tune Squad win their climactic battle, too.",
    "Knight, meanwhile, was cast as Stan Podolak, Jordan\u2019s publicist and assistant. Neither has been confirmed for A New Legacy yet, but it would be cool to see them bridge the gap between these two movies.",
    "Finally, it would be intriguing to see the Monstars appear in the sequel. This group, who were originally known as the Nerdlucks, stole the basketball abilities of several real-life stars at the time, including Charles Barkley, to turn themselves into the superpowered Monstars and take on Jordan and the Looney Tunes during their basketball showdown.",
    "The Monstars end up being defeated but, after some wise words from Jordan, they turn on their former boss before handing their basketball talents back to the players they'd stolen them from. Returning to their Nerdluck personas, the group are recruited by the Looney Tunes before the movie ends.",
    "It doesn't look like the Nerdlucks will feature in Space Jam 2, judging by the official trailer. We had hoped that their reveal was being held back for the movie's final cut, but it doesn't sound like they'll be making a cameo appearance in A New Legacy after all.",
    "That's according to LeBron, who told the Road Trippin' podcast (via MovieWeb) that the Goon Squad were replacing the Monstars as the sequel's antagonists.",
    "Of course, LeBron may be trying to throw us off the scent so that any Monstars reveal is a surprise. We aren't holding out much hope on that front, though.",
    "Yes, it would appear so. Warner Bros. recently released a trailer for the film's officially licensed soundtrack (as well as the track listing for the album), which suggests that \"We Win\", performed by Lil Baby and Kirk Franklin, will be the film's primary song, given that it's the first song on the LP.",
    "Lil Baby and Kirk Franklin are joined by the likes of John Legend, the Jonas Brothers, Brockhampton, Chance the Rapper and Anthony Ramos on the album, which is available to buy now.",
    "Check out the official announcement trailer below to find out which other artists will feature on the album:",
    "As for Space Jam: A New Legacy\u2019s original score, it was initially worked on by legendary movie composer Hans Zimmer, but When They See Us composer Kris Bowers was brought on board to work alongside Zimmer in April 2020.",
    "Good question. As with any movie production, hurdles needed to be overcome before Space Jam 2 could see the light of day.",
    "The movie was originally announced way back in 2014, even though a sequel has been planned ever since the first film\u2019s 1996 release. Since 2014, Space Jam: A New Legacy has gone through three directors, three screenwriters and two cinematographers, which is an indication of the difficulties that its development has faced.",
    "Even before work began on A New Legacy, there were other Space Jam spin-off movies in development, too. According to legendary skate star Tony Hawk, discussions between Warner Bros. and Hawk\u2019s team in 2003 almost saw the studio greenlight Skate Jam \u2013 a skateboarding offshoot starring Hawk and the Looney Tunes. As Hawk reveals in his tweet, though, Skate Jam was shelved after 2003 flick Looney Tunes: Back in Action bombed at the box office.",
    "That\u2019s not the only potential Space Jam spin-off that Warner Bros. considered either. In 2001, Jackie Chan was in talks to star in Spy Jam, while Race Jam \u2013 a NASCAR-centric movie starring professional racer Jeff Gordon \u2013 also almost happened.",
    "It\u2019s unclear why development on Race Jam and Spy Jam ended, but Warner Bros. will be hoping that Space Jam: A New Legacy puts those failed projects to bed by performing well on HBO Max and in theaters later this year."
