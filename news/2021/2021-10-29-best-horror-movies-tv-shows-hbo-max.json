    "The nights are drawing in and there's something sinister in the air. It can only mean one thing. It's time to grab a bowl of popcorn (and a cushion to hide behind) and watch a horror movie or two to celebrate our favorite holiday of the year - Halloween.",
    "Thankfully for dedicated streaming service subscribes, HBO Max has a plethora of ghoulish content to see you through. From psychological thrillers to comedy horrors, classic movies and modern reboots, it's all readily available for a sleepless night.",
    "Below you'll find our top 10 horror movies and TV shows on HBO Max for you to pick from this Halloween. Now all you need to do is lock the door, turn off the lights, and prepare to stream!",
    "Saw co-creator Leigh Whannell took the premise of the 1897 sci-fi novel by H.G. Wells and turned it into a brutally resonant, #MeToo-inspired masterpiece. It\u2019s packed with chilly tension from the start as Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) escapes from the clutches of her millionaire boyfriend \u2013 optics expert Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) \u2013 only to find herself, her family and friends being victimized by an invisible entity.",
    "Unlike the entertainingly camp original, this lean, muscular thriller is full of creeping paranoia in which threat lurks just out of sight \u2013 shockingly demonstrated during a crowded restaurant scene. It\u2019s brilliantly executed, and superbly acted by Moss as a woman whose transformation from traumatised victim to vengeful femme fatale is thrilling to watch. Perhaps the most impressive aspect, though, is the repurposing of H.G. Wells tale into a timely commentary on coercive relationships and patriarchal power structures.",
    "Nothing screams \u201cHalloween\u201d like a loosely linked compendium of terrifying tales in the vein of Creepshow, and Trick \u2018r Treat is a one of the best examples of the genre.",
    "This 2007 horror anthology movie from director Michael Dougherty tells four unique but interlinked tales, all taking take place in the town of Warren Valley, Ohio one Halloween night. In each segment appears the mysterious figure of Sam \u2013 his head shrouded in a burlap sack \u2013 who attacks those who break the sacred \u201crules\u201d of All Hallows Eve.",
    "This jet-black horror comedy is bursting with seasonal ambience and features a modestly A-list cast. Dylan Baker (Happiness) is a principal with a dark secret buried in his backyard; Brian Cox (X2, The Ring) is bad-tempered old neighbour Mr Kreeg, who finds himself grappling with a demonic entity, while True Blood\u2019s Anna Paquin gives a serial killer more than he bargained for. It\u2019s gleefully ghoulish, entertainingly creepy, and full of subversive twists \u2013 a real Halloween treat!",
    "Diabolique follows the kind but frail Christina and the strict Nicole, two teachers at a run-down Paris school bonded by their hatred of the same man, the cruel headmaster Michel. Tired of his abuse, both wife and mistress plot his murder \u2013 drowning him in a bathtub and dumping his corpse in the school\u2019s neglected pool. But when the body fails to surface, they\u2019re haunted by the suspicion that he might not be dead after all.",
    "This moody black and white French shocker from acclaimed director Henri-Georges Clouzot was considered the most artful and frightening horror movie ever, until Psycho slashed its way into screening rooms in 1960. Fiendishly plotted with an atmosphere of dread, and featuring one of cinema\u2019s most memorable endings, Diabolique proved to be hugely influential \u2013 particularly on the \u201cMaster of Suspense\u201d himself, Alfred Hitchcock.",
    "\u201cOne, two, Freddy\u2019s coming for you.\u201d Wes Craven reinvigorated the tired slasher movie sub-genre with this tale of razor-gloved, pizza-faced Freddy Kruger, a child murderer immolated by vigilante parents who returns to haunt the slumber of their offspring.",
    "Starring Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson and Johnny Depp in his film debut as boyfriend Glen, it follows four young friends terrorised in their dreams by a disfigured man with \u201cknives for fingers\u201d. One by one, and in a number of imaginative ways, they literally succumb to sleep \u2013 being dragged across ceilings or pulled down into their bed \u2013 until only resourceful Final Girl Nancy remains to face off with Freddy in the real world.",
    "Nightmare\u2019s success helped established a film studio (New Line Cinema was called \u201cThe House that Freddy Built\u201d) and led to six lucrative sequels, a remake, and a crossover with Friday the 13th (Freddy vs. Jason). And although few of those captured Freddy\u2019s initial malevolence, or the original\u2019s surreal confusion between reality and fantasy.",
    "Before finding mainstream success with comic book movie Spider-Man, Sam Raimi was best known for his gory Evil Dead movies \u2013 the first entry being made on a tiny budget of $375,000 and becoming notorious as an X-Rated \u201cVideo Nasty\u201d.",
    "The bare bones of it concerns five university students visiting an isolated cabin in the woods on vacation. There they discover the ancient Book of the Dead and an audio recorder, which when played recites an incantation that exhumes evil spirits from the surrounding woods. As each of the students gets possessed, Ash \u2013 played with manic energy by cult actor Bruce Campbell \u2013 must defend himself from the demonic onslaught and survive until sunrise.",
    "Despite the tiny budget, The Evil Dead remains a propulsive thrill-ride. Cameras hurtle through the trees and shiver down windows from the \u201cdeadites\u201d POV, with wildly tilted camera angles implying a full-on assault against reality. It\u2019s a splatter-fest, but its bloody excesses \u2013 exploding organs and severed limbs \u2013 are tempered by the movies OTT absurdity.",
    "This original HBO Max show won acclaim for its imaginative depiction of America\u2019s Jim Crow past, with its human characters usually more terrible than the abysmal Lovecraftian creatures that occasionally feature.",
    "Based on Matt Ruff\u2019s 2016 novel of the same name, H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s literary legacy provides an imagined geography in which to explore the harsh reality of Black life in the 1950s, with racism manifesting itself via corrupt cops, segregated neighborhoods, and Sundown towns in which Black people are chased out after dark.",
    "Produced by Get Out's Jordan Peele, we follow Atticus \u201cTic\u201d Freeman (Jonathan Majors) and his friend Leticia Lewis (Jurnee Smollett) as they drive cross-country to uncover the mystery of Tic\u2019s recently disappeared father. The series blends multiple genres, incorporating elements of science fiction, fantasy, and horror to highlight more diverse and empowering narratives about Black life. Standout episode \u201cA Strange Case\u201d riffs off another iconic author, to provide an icky, body-horror metaphor about white privilege and power.",
    "Christopher Landon takes the core concept of family classic Freaky Friday and combines it with Friday the 13th, to hilariously subversive effect. When the notorious Blissfield Butcher (Vince Vaughan) attacks a student after a high-school football match, he stabs her with a mystical dagger that causes them to swap bodies. Now in the guise of a teenage girl, The Butcher has carte blanche to eviscerate the high school students without drawing suspicion, while Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) has until midnight to save her friends and get her body back.",
    "Like Scream before it, it\u2019s amusingly aware of the \u2018rules\u2019 of the slasher movie and full of tongue-in-cheek dialogue, which Josh articulates to his friend Nyla while fleeing The Butcher (\u201cI\u2019m gay, you\u2019re black, we are so dead.\u201d) It feels pretty progressive for a horror movie, a feat facilitated by the role reversal at the heart of the movie, allowing Landon to present identity, gender and sexuality in a refreshingly fluid way. It\u2019s a bloody fun ride \u2013 in particular Vaughan as an insecure teenage girl with a high school crush.",
    "The \u201cbased on a true story\u201d origin of this supernatural chiller only serves to heighten the frights. It recounts the supposed real-life experiences of the Lutzes, a family who moved into a home that had been the scene of a grizzly mass murder. 28 days later, the Lutz family fled the property, claiming to have been plagued by paranormal phenomena.",
    "Starring Josh Brolin and Margot Kidder, and released just a year before The Shining, this is a similar tale of a husband driven mad by a building\u2019s violent history \u2013 and crushing mortgage payments. Yet the spooky disturbances feel more troubling here, located in the ordinary suburban environment.",
    "From out of a sense of normalcy the film builds to a terrifying crescendo. George finds himself constantly freezing. He wakes up at 3.15am every night \u2013 at the same time the DeFeo family were murdered. A sash window breaks his son\u2019s hand. And the priest called in to bless the house hears a threatening voice tell him to \u201cget out!\u201d.",
    "Did we mention the walls ooze blood? Yeah, this film will definitely give you the heebie-jeebies.",
    "Rob Reiner\u2019s adaptation of the 1987 novel by Stephen King was one of the most suspenseful movies of the 90s, and this claustrophobic thriller remains a riveting watch over thirty years later.",
    "That\u2019s largely thanks to the one-two punch of Kathy Bates \u2013 who delivers an incredible, Oscar-winning performance as the frumpy ex-nurse with an explosive temper \u2013 and James Caan as wily romance novelist Paul Sheldon, who\u2019s kept captive in the home of his \u201cnumber one fan\u201d after his car careens off the road during a snow storm.",
    "It\u2019s the only Stephen King adaptation to win an Academy Award, thanks to Bates\u2019s unhinged performance as the psychologically troubled Annie, and aided by William Goldman\u2019s taut, focused screenplay. We think it\u2019s a cock-a-doodie classic \u2013 and we\u2019ll hobble anyone who says otherwise.",
    "From Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement, the Kiwi duo responsible for 2014\u2019s What We Do in the Shadows, comes the comedy TV spin-off about a top-secret division of the Wellington police department charged with investigating the city\u2019s paranormal phenomena.",
    "Inducted into this murky world are Officers Minogue and O\u2019Leary, who made their rib-tickling debut in the aforementioned 2014 movie while following up a noise complaint at the vampires\u2019 residence and oblivious to their undead tendencies. They respond to all manner of supernatural sightings here \u2013 including M\u0101ori sea monsters, werewolves, aliens and zombie cops \u2013 all of which they approach with an indifferent air of by-the-books professionalism (like when Satan is accidentally summoned to be a department store Santa).",
    "It\u2019s a drily humorous tonic to your typical horror movie mayhem. Plus, actor Maaka Pohatu is brilliant as the department\u2019s police sergeant, whose case load includes reports of a haunted sock, scary umbrellas, and a possessed futon.",
