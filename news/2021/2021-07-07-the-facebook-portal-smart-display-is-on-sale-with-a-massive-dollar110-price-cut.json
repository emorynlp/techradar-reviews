    "Connect with family and friends and save money with this fantastic deal that we've spotted on the Facebook Portal smart display. For a limited time, you can score a massive $110 discount on the first-generation Facebook Portal when you apply the code PORTALSUMMER at checkout. That brings the price down to just $89, which is a fantastic deal for a feature-rich smart home display.",
    "The 10.1-inch smart home display is part of Facebook's mission to improve video calling by making it completely hands and distraction-free. The first generation Portal features a smart camera that pans, zooms, and widens automatically, so you can move and talk freely while always staying in frame. The Alexa-enabled display also allows you to play music, make calls, and check the weather completely hands-free, and display photos from Facebook, Instagram, and your phone. This is not only a fantastic deal but also $70 cheaper than Amazon's current price on the Portal. Keep in mind, this is a limited-time offer that ends on July 31, so you should take advantage now before it's too late.",
