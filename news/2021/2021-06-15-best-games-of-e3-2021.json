  "summary": "We round up the biggest and best game announcements of E3 2021",
  "article": [
    "When it comes to new games, E3 2021 hasn\u2019t disappointed.",
    "As well as new additions to big-budget franchises like Battlefield and Far Cry, this year\u2019s event included some equally exciting announcements on brand-new titles, such as Redfall and Contraband.",
    "Movie fans should take note, too, as Hollywood heavyweights Guardians of the Galaxy and Avatar are also in line for some triple-A video game adventures very soon.",
    "And, of course, there's the long awaited gameplay reveal from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2.",
    "Below, we\u2019ve rounded up the biggest and best game announcements of E3 2021, with a brief note about each game\u2019s premise, the release date and what platforms you can expect them to arrive on.",
    "Check back to this list in the coming days, too, as we\u2019ll be adding more major game announcements as they happen.",
    "The one we\u2019d all been waiting for: Nintendo finally showed off some gameplay footage for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2, and it looked as bold and creative as Zelda ever has been. The key takeaways from this new trailer? Aerial action is on the cards as elements of Hyrule rise among the clouds; new Sheikah slate abilities will include the ability to throw flames; Ganondorf may not be the villain \u2013 or at least not the only one; and Bokoblins have now got mobile fortresses on the back of stone giants, the little rotters! There\u2019s finally a release window, too \u2013 the maddeningly vague \u201c2022\u201d.",
    "Battlefield 2042 was revealed on June 9, with a gameplay trailer dropping as part of the Xbox and Bethesda games showcase on June 13. The new Battlefield is set to take players into the near future and is being touted as \u201cthe most ambitious\u201d entry in the first-person shooter series yet. Built using the latest Frostbite engine, Battlefield 2042 will arrive packing a host of new weapons, vehicles and gadgets, as well as 128-player maps for the latest consoles and PC.",
    "Interestingly, there\u2019ll be no campaign mode for the first time, nor a much-rumored Battle Royale mode, but EA says players can expect three \u201cdistinct, standout multiplayer experiences\u201d \u2013 which sounds pretty good to us.",
    "Battlefield 2042 is scheduled to release on October 22, 2021 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One and PC.",
    "So, it may not have been Metroid Prime 4, but we\u2019ll take whatever Metroid action we can get. And this looked pretty darn cool. Metroid Dread will be the first brand new 2D entry in the Metroid Series in almost 20 years, remakes and spin-offs notwithstanding. There seems to be more of a horror vibe to this one, with Samus sporting a new-look suit, seemingly being hunted by pack of dog-like robots. This one is due out soon \u2013 October 8, 2021.",
    "In one of the most surprising announcements at E3 2021, Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Division franchise, gave us our first look at Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, a game set in the Avatar universe. The triple-A title is being developed using Ubisoft's proprietary Snowdrop graphics engine, and is expected to coincide with the release of James Cameron\u2019s Avatar 2 next year. We\u2019ve only seen a cinematic trailer so far, but it certainly looks ambitious \u2013 and beautiful, obviously.",
    "Given the game\u2019s focus on graphical fidelity, it\u2019s no surprise that last-gen consoles are being left behind on this one. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is being developed for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC and Amazon Luna, and has a tenuous release date of 2022.",
    "The sixth entry in Ubisoft\u2019s open-world adventure franchise, Far Cry 6, is on the way later this year, and we were treated to a brand new trailer at E3 2021. Set in a \"tropical paradise frozen in time\" called Yara, players will take control of protagonist Dani as they shoot, loot and crash through Far Cry 6\u2019s customary regime-crushing story. Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito stars as the game\u2019s villain, Anton Castillo, so we\u2019re anticipating some Vaas-level tyranny, but some brand new weapon customization mechanics look to keep Far Cry 6 from being the same old waypoint-chasing adventure.",
    "Far Cry 6 is being released on October 7, 2021 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.",
    "Forza Horizon 5, the fifth entry in the popular open-world driving simulator, will take players to an \"authentic\" recreation of Mexico and boast the series\u2019 largest drivable environments to date. Expect to traverse jungles, deserts, urban sprawls and ancient ruins as you tear through the rubber of the world\u2019s fastest \u2013 and prettiest \u2013 cars. For the first time, the franchise is introducing a \u201cdeep and rewarding campaign\u201d, too, where players will meet new characters and determine the outcome of their missions.",
    "Forza Horizon 5 is scheduled for release on November 9, 2021 for Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC.",
    "After years of persevering hype, we finally got the first trailer for Dark Souls 4 \u2013 sorry, Elden Ring. The Dark Souls comparison isn\u2019t just a joke, and the game looks very similar to FromSoftware\u2019s previous works - you play as a vessel sapped of spirit, there\u2019s the same weighty combat, there\u2019s cooperative play, locations look similar, even plenty of the combat animations are pinched straight from Dark Souls 3.",
    "But there\u2019s a lot more that builds on the popular stalwart Dark Souls formula - there\u2019s mounted combat, double-jumping ghost horses, an open world with wandering enemies (and buildings that literally walk around), and actual stealth combat. The trailer might not win over those who aren\u2019t a fan of the SoulsBourne series, but for people already hooked on FromSoftware\u2019s style, it\u2019s all that was hoped for and more.",
    "Elden Ring is being released on January 21, 2022 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.",
    "Now here\u2019s a franchise that\u2019s been out in the wilderness for far too long. The cartoon-y, tactical action of the Advance Wars series hasn\u2019t had any love since 2008\u2019s Advance Wars: Days of Ruin for the Nintendo DS. It\u2019s always felt like a franchise perfectly suited to the Nintendo Switch, and it\u2019s finally making a return with Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp.",
    "It\u2019s not an all-new game though. Instead, it\u2019s set to be a remake of the first two top-down strategy titles, complete with 3D maps, battle visuals, and glitzy new commander animations. It\u2019s looking like a great way to re-introduce the franchise to Switch owners, and is hopefully a sign we\u2019ll get an all new Advance Wars game in the future. This one\u2019s available for pre-order now, out in December 2021.",
    "Square Enix must have thought it had struck the jackpot when acquiring the Marvel license. But as the so-so response to its Marvel\u2019s Avengers live service game proved, you need more than just the best license in pop culture to make a great game.",
    "It came under fire for not acquiring the rights to the likenesses of Marvel\u2019s Hollywood stars, and it\u2019s an issue that\u2019s still present with the new title, the single-player Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy. But with Chris Pratt the only human-looking character in the team, it largely gets away with it.",
    "Which is good, as the game doesn\u2019t look half bad. You\u2019ll direct the Guardians whilst in the boots of Peter \u2018Star Lord\u2019 Quill, with combat looking a little like the squad-based action of the Mass Effect series. There\u2019s lots of zany shooting action, and some good banter between the rag-tag crew. It looks like classic Guardians of the Galaxy, basically.",
    "Halo Infinite returned for a mini-comeback of sorts, and it\u2019s looking a lot more promising. After a fairly uninspiring reveal before the Xbox Series X launch, we were provided with a quick aerial passover of Delta Halo, the biggest game world ever in the series. We also got to see Master Chief interacting with a new AI, in a fairly evocative scene. confirmation that both the game\u2019s campaign and multiplayer will launch at the same time, despite rumors to the contrary.",
    "While we didn\u2019t get a confirmed release date other than \u201cHoliday 2021\u201d (which falls between November and early January), we did get a proper look at Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer mode, which will be free-to-play and can run at 120fps on capable displays. We know that the legendary Halo announcer will return, equipment is coming back from Halo 3, and there will be plenty of vehicular combat across the game\u2019s new sandbox-style maps.",
    "Halo Infinite will be released on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.",
    "Finally! Warioware, simply the funniest game series there\u2019s ever been, is set to return on the Nintendo Switch. As ever, the anti-hero of the Nintendo stable headlines the game, bringing together a collection of kooky minigames designed to challenge and tickle. Whether you\u2019re squeezing toothpaste out of a tube, plucking a Greek god\u2019s armpit hairs or knocking a child's ice cream tower over, it looks madcap fun. It\u2019ll be the first time the series has offered simultaneous multiplayer, too.",
    "Ubisoft announced during its E3 2021 showcase that it\u2019s working on a sequel to Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, called Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Sparks of Hope sees the gang of Nintendo/Ubisoft mascots traveling to a new planet, with the plot revolving around Luma that has fused with Rabbid genes, granting the Rabbids new abilities as you rescue each star-like creature. Sparks of Hope will still offer a tactical combat experience, but with more of an emphasis on action this time around.",
    "Mario + Rabbids Spark of Hopes is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2022.",
    "Ubisoft finally gave us a look at the next Rainbow Six title in action during its E3 2021 conference. Rainbow Six Extraction (originally known as Rainbow Six Quarantine, then as Rainbow Six Parasite) is a 1-3 player co-op experience that sees you and your squad pitted against an ever-evolving alien species called the Archaeans.",
    "The gameplay involves plenty of twists to keep players on their toes and we can\u2019t wait to see more of what Extraction has to offer when it arrives on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Amazon Luna and Stadia on September 16, 2021.",
    "What if Fallout had never made the jump to 3D, but had instead down-rezzed to pixellated graphics, went for isometric real-time combat and mixed Lovecraftian horror with its punk-fuelled wasteland? You might, just might, have ended up with something a little like Death Trash, a wild new role-playing game headed to PC and Xbox in August 2021.",
    "\u201cMeet exciting characters, talk to the Fleshkraken, visit the Puke Bar, or descend into old temples in search of expanding your awareness,\u201d says the one-person dev team of Crafting Legends.",
    "You had me at \u2018Fleshkraken\u2019...",
    "Now this one\u2019s a real looker. Developer Slow Bros. have painstakingly put narrative adventure game Harold Halibut together using traditional stop motion animation techniques. Rela-world, physical sets and puppets have been made, captured with photogrammetry and then digital inserted into the game, giving Harold Halibut a look somewhere between a Wes Anderson film and an Aardman Animation.",
    "It\u2019s not just all about those wonderful visuals though \u2013 there seems to be a cracking story propping it all up, telling a tale about \u201cabout friendship, and life on a city-sized spaceship submerged in an alien ocean.\u201d No release date announced for this PC game yet, but we can\u2019t wait to find out more.",
    "Sea of Thieves has quietly become one of the biggest games on Xbox consoles and PC, and a new collaboration with Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean is bound to attract old and new players alike to Rare\u2019s seafaring epic. Players can look forward to five Tall Tales \u2013 the game\u2019s take on story-focused missions \u2013 which star the irreverent trickster Jack Sparrow, and the supernatural ruler of the seven seas, Davy Jones.",
    "The trailer showed off cursed crews for players to combat, bloodthirsty mermaids, and a whole host of exciting story-related moments that we can\u2019t wait to experience. The Sea of Thieves: A Pirate\u2019s Life expansion will be free to all Sea of Thieves players, and arrives on June 22.",
    "Sea of Thieves is available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.",
    "One of our biggest hopes for E3 2021 was that we would get another look at Starfield. So we were over the moon (pardon the pun) when we got not only an official teaser trailer for the upcoming sci-fi RPG, but a release date of November 11, 2022 during the Xbox and Bethesda games showcase.",
    "But it\u2019s not good news for PS5 players as Bethesda confirmed during the showcase that Starfield will be an Xbox exclusive, landing on Xbox Series X/S and PC - but not PS5.",
    "Replaced was one of the more visually striking titles shown off at E3, with its unique pixel-art style and dystopian sci-fi world immediately catching the eye. The game\u2019s story sounds interesting, too, as you play as an AI trapped inside a human body against its will.",
    "But what type of game is it? Well, it\u2019s described as a \u201csci-fi, retro-futuristic action platformer\u201d, and players will need to discover the secrets that are hidden within Phoenix-City, which takes place in an alternative version of the 1980s.",
    "Replaced is coming in 2022 to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also be available on Xbox Game Pass on day one."
