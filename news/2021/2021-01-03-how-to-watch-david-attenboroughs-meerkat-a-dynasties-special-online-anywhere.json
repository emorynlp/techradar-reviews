    "Make like a meerkat and stand to attention (or sit) for a new instalment of Dynasties, the dramatic nature documentary series narrated by David Attenborough, which follows groups of extraordinary animals as they struggle against the forces of nature, rivals and climate change to secure the future of their bloodline. Read on as we explain how to watch the David Attenborough Dynasties special online and stream the Meerkat documentary wherever you are in the world right now - including for FREE in the UK!",
    "The new special tells the story of Maghogho, a dominant meerkat queen leading her group in the face of innumerable threats, both internal and external, which include predators, food shortages, surprisingly selfish submissives and often hilariously bad decisions.",
    "However, it's oppressive weather that poses the biggest threat to the family group's survival. Botswana's Makgadikgadi Pan is one of the biggest salt flats on the planet, and in the dry season it's a cruelly hot and desolate landscape in which very little life can exist.",
    "The promise of transformative rain is what keeps the meerkats hanging on, but in order to survive the dry season they'll have to unite, overcome extreme adversity and make some painful - and I mean that in the literal sense - choices for the good of the group.",
    "Meerkat teeth and claws can inflict some serious damage, as can meerkat logic, which lands Maghogho and her group in some highly avoidable spots of bother, most notably a meerkat war with a neighbouring group.",
    "It's both joyous and heart-breaking, and you can follow our guide below as we explain how to watch the David Attenborough Meerkat: A Dynasties special online free - stream the living legend's latest documentary wherever you are right now.",
