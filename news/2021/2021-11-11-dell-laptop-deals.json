    "Dell laptop deals can offer some excellent low prices on machines with specs that outrank their price tags. That's excellent news, whether you're looking for a super cheap everyday machine or a top of the range XPS. While Dell itself is usually the best place to look for Dell laptop deals, retailers across the web have also been offering some record low prices on these powerful computers as well.",
    "Normally, then, the difficulty in finding the best Dell laptop deals lies not in the price tag - but in finding the right one for you. Dell's catalogue is fairly complex - balancing a range of models across the Inspiron and XPS line and refreshing many of them every year. Across various models, ranges, and series', then, it can be hard to pin down the very best Dell laptop deals.",
    "That's where we come in. We've broken down Dell's range so that you can easily jump straight to the best models for you. While the Dell XPS comes in a simple 13-inch or 15-inch category, the Inspiron line (where the best value is often to be found) is separated into 3000, 5000 and 7000 Series'.",
    "Head to 3000 or 5000 Series Inspiron laptops for a cheaper everyday experience, or take a look at the 7000 Series or XPS Dell laptop deals if you're looking to splash some cash on a high-end machine.",
    "To make all that easier, we\u2019ve taken care of the leg work for you, breaking down each Dell laptop deal to make sure you know the differences between each model and series, and what that means for you.",
    "You'll find a quick run down of all the latest Dell laptop deals just below, and more information on each model and which version you should be buying further down the page.",
    "You would be correct in assuming Dell's latest XPS 13 model is a beast. With up to 2TB of SSD storage space, the latest 11th generation of Intel's processors, and the potential for 32GB of RAM you can configure some seriously powerful specsheets here. The best of the best is going to cost you, though, however entry level i3 models usually sit just under $1,000 which can make for a strong mid-range purchase due to the starting 256GB SSD sizes.",
    "At the bottom end of the configuration scale, you're still getting a powerhouse here, and one that looks as good as it runs. With minimal bezels, a luxury slimline chassis, and standout battery life, there's a reason this is often hailed as the best laptop going.",
    "Dell's laptop deals do regularly hit upon this latest release, though, so you'll be able to find some discounts at the right time as well.",
    "The Dell XPS 2-in-1 brings the power of Dell's flagship laptop and the flexibility of a tablet design together for an incredible user experience. That means you can zip through work and then flip the screen over to present easily and intuitively, or simply kick back with some streaming on a Dolby Vision HDR display.",
    "Under the hood you'll find the latest 11th generation processors, with configurations available all the way from i3 to i7. Your options for RAM and storage are a little smaller than those present in more traditional builds, you can max this machine out at 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, but unless you're looking for a particularly heavy duty machine this can still handle pretty much anything you could throw at it.",
    "The Dell XPS 15 does pack the possibility for more RAM under the hood, as well as some more impressive graphics, however aside from these two components, the 15.6-inch laptop is simply a larger version of the XPS 13. The crux here, however, lies in the portability of that screen. The XPS is incredibly thin and light, allowing you to grab the best of both worlds - a backpack worthy laptop with all day battery life and plenty of screen real estate.",
    "Nevertheless, the XPS 15 does cater more towards professionals and creatives, with a considerably higher price tag to match. You'll still find Dell laptop deals on this particular model, though, so if you're after the big screen treatment you could still bag your dream configuration for less.",
    "The 3000 Series is aimed squarely at cheap computing. You'll be able to find prices ranging from $200 (during Dell laptop deals events) through to $500 here, with entry level specs on the cheapest of models and lower mid-range configurations as you creep up the scale.",
    "These machines will provide you with a cheap machine to browse the web, get some light work done, and stream some content - but don't expect the cheaper options to do much heavy lifting when it comes to demanding software.",
    "The Dell Inspiron 15 3000 is one of the cheapest Dell laptops you'll find on the market. It's surprising then, that it comes with a full 15.6-inch display. Picking up an entry level model will cost you between $350 and $450, but the best part about this machine is there's a massive range of specs and configurations on the table - all for fair price points.",
    "If you need a seriously large screen - for multi-tasking or a better streaming experience, the Dell Inspiron 17 3000 offers one of the most affordable rigs for the job. 17.3-inch displays usually carry a considerable premium, and you will find a slight uptick in price here - but you're still getting an excellent laptop for a great cost with this model.",
    "That 8GB RAM won't see you powering through many high performance programs, but it offers a good amount of memory for every day work and multi-tasking. Storage options include a 512GB SSD - a fairly large and speedy spec to find on a laptop of this price - or a 1TB / 2TB hard drive. The second option will give you plenty of space, but at the cost of a little speed.",
    "The 5000 Series sits in the middle of Dell's Inspiron range, offering up middle of the road specs that will see you comfortably zipping through everyday tasks with some impressive speed and the potential for a little more multi-tasking as well. You'll have better luck with more demanding programs like Adobe and media-editing software here, but they may still run slower on these laptops when compared to the 7000 series.",
    "Specs in the higher tiers of this series may start to muddy the waters slightly - offering 7000-level performance in a cheaper bracket. That's where Dell laptop deals really shine though, so it's in this gray area that sales-hunters will be most at home.",
    "The Dell Inspiron 14 5000 may be the best option if you're looking for an everyday machine that still offers some mid-range specs and fancy features. If you require heavy duty software and RAM-intensive multi-tasking, we might point you further down to a 7000-Series model, however there's still some considerable power packed into this machine.",
    "The latest 11th generation if Intel processors will be a standout feature for anyone looking for the best performance possible, though we'd steer clear of that 4GB of entry level RAM.",
    "What's more, you'll find regular Dell laptop deals hitting this particular configuration because it sits in the middle of Dell's lineup and can easily be discounted during sales events.",
    "If you like the look of the Inspiron 14 5000 but want a few more fancy features, the 2-in-1 model can offer a whole new way of working. The flexible design allows the hinge to flip around fully to form a tablet design, which means you can adapt your laptop / tablet to whatever you need to be doing.",
    "This feature usually comes at a considerable premium, however in the case of the Inspiron 14 5000, we sometimes see this model sitting cheaper than the standard laptop. The specs on offer remain the same between the two models, but it's worth checking both out to see if you can score some extra functionality for the same price with these Dell laptop deals.",
    "The Dell Inspiron 15 5000 offers similar specs to the 14 5000, but with a larger 15.6-inch screen. That's better if you want that little extra screen real estate for having multiple browsers open at the same time, for example. Plus, entry level models jump up from 4GB to 8GB RAM here to facilitate that a little better, but there is a slight price increase to go with those extra features and heavier specs will see you leaning into the price range of the 7000 series.",
    "The 7000 Series does muddy the waters slightly, on the lower end of the spectrum bumping into 5000-level configurations and at the other end mixing with the likes of the Dell XPS. That means those discounts do work harder for you during Dell laptop sales events, so if you are looking for a professional-worthy machine it's wise to keep an eye on these rigs.",
    "Aside from price, however, if you're going to be using power-intensive programs, and multi-tasking between them, the 7000-series is best suited to your needs. The entry level models can still fall a little short, but spending between $750 and $900 on a Dell Inspiron 7000 will yield some strong results.",
    "The only Inspiron laptop to feature a brilliantly portable 13.3-inch display, the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 is a convertible laptop that packs just as much power as it does convenience. You'll find a marked step up in price now that we're in the 7000-Series range, but considering the power and flexibility of this model, you're still getting excellent value for money.",
    "Plus, you can also configure Intel Optane memory with this model - a form of smart memory that predicts which programs you'll need and lines them up ready for you, which essentially makes for faster load times.",
    "At first glance, the Dell Inspiron 14 7000 looks similar to the 5000-Series model. However, there are two differences here that could sway you to either version. The 7000 features a slight boost in display size, jumping up from a standard 14-inch panel to a 14.5-inch on the premium model.",
    "However, the downside here is that you are locked into 8GB RAM on the standard design. That's going to sting a little seeing as the 5000 can reach 12GB RAM for a similar price point. However, if you do need more storage and a bigger processor, you'll be able to find a decent price on the 7000 model a lot easier.",
    "Similarly, opting for the 7000-Series version of the Dell Inspiron 15 will open you up to a few minor changes over the 5000 model. You're getting more storage in the entry level machine here, with those SSDs starting at 256GB and picking up a touchscreen display. Those are a nice set of features, but with the 15's still stuck on Intel's previous generation of processors, there's more power to be found in other models right now.",
    "By contrast, the 2-in-1 version of the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 has had a more recent refresh. That means you'll find 11th gen processing under the hood, with some powerful storage and RAM specs as well. Of course, you're paying for all that with another jump in pricing here.",
    "However, if you're looking for a powerful, flexible machine that just nudges the XPS's level of power without quite invoking the costs of that luxury chassis, this will do you particularly well.",
    "There's something incredibly satisfying about a 17-inch touchscreen panel, especially when it sits on a 2-in-1 laptop that can easily convert into a tablet. You're certainly paying for that premium functionality here, however, with prices surpassing those of the XPS at mid and higher range configuration levels.",
    "That said, you'll find plenty of power under the hood here - this just might not be the best laptop to sling in a backpack and carry all day.",
    "There are a lot of Dell laptop deals out there, with a massive range of models and specs to choose from. It can be difficult to work out exactly which machine is right for you, then, which is why we're going through some common usage scenarios to point you in the right direction.",
