    "When shopping for a stylus for your iPad, your first pick should be an Apple Pencil. The company's accessory syncs up perfectly with its tablet, as expected, and we are seeing loads of Apple Pencil offers popping up as Cyber Monday deals already",
    "As the Apple Pencil Black Friday deals draw to a close, you may want to wait to see the incoming Cyber Monday deals in case prices drop even lower, but if you're looking for a discount now, you'll find today's best deals below.",
    "Apple's products typically don't get discounted as much as other gadgets, but even they aren't immune from the Black Friday 2021 deals rush. These deals usually last through Cyber Monday on November 29 and maybe a little after... until supply runs out, anyway.",
    "While we don't expect these deals to heavily discount the pricetags of either Apple stylus, you should be able to save a little on a new Apple Pencil 1 or Apple Pencil 2. You may also get a Black Friday iPad deal or a Cyber Monday iPad deal, if you're looking for a new tablet.",
    "The Apple Pencil 1 and Apple Pencil 2 are different, and older iPads may not be compatible with the newer stylus (and the oldest may not support either), so it's important to check which stylus works with your tablet ahead of time before making your purchase. As a rule, older iPads support the Apple Pencil 1 while the newest iPads should work with both, but the Apple Pencil 2 has some upgrades over its predecessor \u2013 which only the best iPads can benefit from, like magnetic attaching and charging.",
    "As you'd expect, the original Apple Pencil 1 is cheaper than its successor, even if it lacks some advanced features, so make sure you're buying the right Apple stylus for your needs and iPad setup.",
    "Keep compatibility in mind when making your choice, too. The Apple Pencil 1 is compatible with these iPads:",
    "Meanwhile, the Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with these iPads:",
    "If the original Apple Pencil is still too expensive, 2020 saw deals on third-party styluses. We may see similar to this later this year, if you're looking for a cheaper alternative to the Apple Pencil.",
