    "E3 2021 is just under a month away and its organizers have now revealed the app and online portal that will allow gaming fans to attend, and participate in, the entirely digital event.",
    "Calling the online portal and app a \u201ckey hub\u201d for the show, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has confirmed they'll provide access to \u201cvirtual \u2018booths,\u2019 hosted events, video conferencing, profile and avatar creation, online forums and more.\u201d",
    "The virtual booths will be \"hubs within the portal\" where fans will be able to access \"key announcements and game information tied to each exhibitor\u201d, as well as videos, written articles and special events.",
    "The portal and app will also provide access to the main E3 live broadcast. Hosted by Alex \u201cGoldenboy\u201d Mendez, Jacki Jing and Greg Miller, it\u2019ll feature \u201cmajor publisher showcases, press conferences, industry panels, extended livestreams and special guest appearances\u201d.",
    "To encourage viewers to engage with the show, there\u2019ll be interactive overlays on the broadcast, showing viewer polls, featured tweets and other elements. Adding to this, there\u2019ll be chat room and forum elements for discussion. Each attendee will have a customizable profile and avatar, getting the chance to appear on leaderboards that track interaction with the show\u2019s gamified elements.",
    "\u201cFrom the moment we decided to host E3 virtually, we\u2019ve been focused on providing an interactive experience for fans around the globe that goes beyond the typical livestream,\u201d said Stanley Pierre-Louis, President & CEO of the ESA. \u201cThe result is a bespoke online portal and app that will allow fans, media and industry professionals to have an E3 experience designed to run parallel to the four-day broadcast, laying the foundation for interactive E3 elements to continue beyond this year\u2019s all-virtual show.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s worth noting, if you just want your more traditional E3-at-home experience without the virtual bells and whistles, that the main broadcast of the show will also be viewable via the E3 channel on platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.",
    "The public will be able to access the portal on June 12, the start date of E3, but it\u2019ll be possible to set up a free account from later this month (an exact date is yet to be confirmed) so that you\u2019re ready to go.",
    "E3 2021 is set to take place between June 12 and June 15 and we\u2019re expecting announcements from some of big names such as Microsoft, Nintendo, Square Enix and Ubisoft, all of whom are on list of attendees. So far, only Ubisoft has confirmed an exact date for its press conference, Ubisoft Forward, which is to take place on June 12 at12 pm PT / 8pm BST / 3pm ET (or June 13 at 5am AEST).",
    "A notable absence this year is Sony, which has confirmed it isn\u2019t planning to present at the show. So, while we\u2019ll still see new PS5 games from other publishers, if you\u2019re looking for any exciting first-party PS5 news you may need to wait a little longer.",
    "It\u2019s expected to be a busy summer for gaming events. Geoff Keighley\u2019s Summer Game Fest is also set to kick off in June, as is Steam Next Fest. EA has confirmed it\u2019ll be holding its traditional EA Play event, this year on the slightly later date of July 22 and, hot on the heels of that, Gamescom 2021 will be taking place in August."
