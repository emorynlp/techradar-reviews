  "article": [
    "Nvidia could be planning to unleash an RTX 3060 Ultra with 12GB of VRAM, at least going by leaked pictures of this purported graphics card which have turned up online.",
    "Wccftech has furnished us with the images which supposedly show an Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 Ultra.",
    "The pics looks convincing enough \u2013 although as ever with leaked images, there\u2019s always the possibility they could be faked \u2013 and the box clearly states the \u20183060 Ultra\u2019 name, and that it has 12GB of GDDR6 video RAM. Apparently, it will be a 2.7-slot card using a triple-fan cooling solution, as pictured.",
    "While this is the TUF model, Wccftech asserts that Asus will make others including a more powerful ROG Strix version. The site says its sources believe that the \u2018Ultra\u2019 GPU will be above the Ti and Super models (or presumably could even replace the Super versions we saw with Turing GPUs).",
    "If true, that\u2019ll mean we will have an RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3060 Ultra, with possibly a vanilla RTX 3060 eventually nestling beneath those two cards.",
    "We\u2019ve recently been hearing a fair bit of chatter on the GPU grapevine regarding a 12GB version of the RTX 3060 \u2013 Lenovo spilled some rumored details in PC spec listings very recently \u2013 so the theory is that this could be it.",
    "Nvidia has a GeForce Special Broadcast event scheduled for CES 2021, on January 12, and this is where the RTX 3060 Ultra will purportedly be revealed with a claimed price tag of $449.",
    "However, despite the weight of rumors around all this, we should still be very careful about drawing any firm conclusions here \u2013 there are some major caveats to be aware of.",
    "For starters, other sources, such as Igor\u2019s Lab, have noted that they have been unable to get any indication that this RTX 3060 Ultra version is coming from other graphics card makers \u2013 and that seems a little odd given that the launch is supposedly so very close.",
    "Not that we can discount this speculation on that basis, by any means, but just in general terms, pushing out an RTX 3060 Ultra loaded with 12GB of memory seems rather a strange move by Nvidia.",
    "Remember, this would mean that there would be an RTX 3060 model out there with more memory than the RTX 3070 \u2013 much more memory, in fact, as the latter only runs with 8GB. And indeed, 12GB is more than the 10GB found on the RTX 3080, even \u2013 so owners of the latter could find their noses put out of joint in some respects (although the 3080 does have faster GDDR6X RAM, rather than GDDR6 in this rumored GPU).",
    "Of course, there could be Ultra variants of the RTX 3070 and 3080 in the wings, too, as seen in other rumors, such as the existence of an RTX 3080 with 20GB of VRAM (which was rumored to be happening, then not happening, and is supposedly back in the cards, so to speak).",
    "And some folks are theorizing that perhaps Nvidia needs a fresh and pepped up take on the RTX 3060 to head off AMD\u2019s incoming Radeon RX 6700 offerings, which could arrive in January \u2013 potentially with 12GB of VRAM on-board.",
    "It\u2019s a rather confusing picture of arguments and possibilities, then, but if this new RTX 3060 Ultra rumor is true \u2013 and these Asus images are genuine \u2013 we\u2019ll find out soon enough (in a week\u2019s time, in fact). Until then, the speculation will doubtless continue\u2026"
