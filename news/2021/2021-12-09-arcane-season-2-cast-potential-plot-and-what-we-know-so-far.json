    "Arcane season 2 is on the way. And, for fans of Riot Games\u2019 beloved League of Legends (LoL) gaming franchise and Netflix\u2019s animated TV adaptation, that won\u2019t come as a surprise.",
    "Since making its debut on November 6, Netflix subscribers have watched a total of 102.25 million hours of Arcane season 1. That unexpected success saw Arcane beat Cowboy Bebop and Tiger King season 2 \u2013 two Netflix heavyweights \u2013 for the top spot in Netflix\u2019s TV rankings in mid-November. No small feat for a TV series that wasn\u2019t on many people\u2019s radars ahead of its release.",
    "Now, though, Arcane season 2 is one of Netflix\u2019s most hotly anticipated shows. Its gorgeous graphics, pulsating action sequences and stellar soundtrack wowed fans and critics alike. Add in its emotionally resonant storylines, unique spin on treasured LoL characters, and its accessibility to established fans and newcomers, and Arcane\u2019s second season can\u2019t come soon enough.",
    "You may wonder, then, when Arcane season 2 will be released. And you\u2019re probably dying to know which characters will return, what season 2\u2019s plot will entail and more. Below, you\u2019ll find out everything you need to know about Arcane\u2019s second season on Netflix. So let\u2019s waste no more time and find out.",
    "There\u2019s no official release date for Arcane season 2 yet. We know it\u2019s on the way, though, after the show\u2019s return was announced following the season 1 finale:",
    "The above teaser doesn\u2019t give anything away, apart from revealing that season 2 is in production and that three season 1 characters will return (more on this later). Still, we\u2019re delighted that Arcane is getting a second outing. It certainly deserves one and, if its final episode is anything to go by, there are plenty of plot threads that need to be picked up (or resolved) in Arcane season 2.",
    "But when will it return to Netflix? Right now, that\u2019s hard to say as we don\u2019t know how far along season 2 is. But don\u2019t expect it to arrive in 2022, according to Riot Games CEO Nicolo Laurent, who tweeted that the next entry in the series won\u2019t be ready for next year:",
    "Expect Arcane season 2 to drop sometime in 2023, then. We\u2019re happy to wait, though: the show evidently needs lots of care and attention to make it as good as it is, and rushing it will only make for a poor follow-up. Hopefully, season 2 will be with us in early 2023 but, even if it isn\u2019t, we\u2019d happily wait until December 31, 2023 for the season 2 premiere.",
    "Spoilers follow for Arcane season 1 episode 9. You have been warned.",
    "If you\u2019ve watched Arcane\u2019s first season, you\u2019ll know that some characters may not be back for its next batch of episodes. That\u2019s because, during the season 1 finale, Jinx fired an arcane crystal rocket at Piltover\u2019s council chamber with many main and supporting characters trapped inside. Those present in the chamber when the rocket exploded included Jayce, Mel, Cassandra, Hoskel, Bolbok, Shoola and Salo.",
    "And we don\u2019t expect all of those individuals to survive. If we had to guess, we\u2019d say Mel and Cassandra, at the very least, will have perished or been severely injured. That would give Jayce and Caitlyn a major incentive to pursue Jinx, as Mel and Cassandra are Jayce\u2019s partner and Caitlyn\u2019s mother, respectively.",
    "So we suspect that Arcane season 2 will see Jayce walk back on his promise to give Zaun its independence from Piltover, especially now that Jinx (a Zaun citizen) carried out a terrorist attack on the latter\u2019s council.",
    "Caitlyn, too, could be out for revenge if her mother was hurt or killed, which would put her at odds with Vi, whom Caitlyn had become close with. The latter is Jinx\u2019s sister, after all, so Vi will likely be caught in a difficult situation: help Caitlyn and Jayce to bring her sister to justice, or try to \u2018save\u2019 Jinx from herself, which would put her in opposition with Caitlyn and Jayce.",
    "Suffice to say, expect the brewing war between Piltover and Zaun to take center stage in Arcane season 2. Tensions were already simmering between the two nations throughout the show\u2019s first season, and we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a full-blown conflict begins as a result of Jinx\u2019s attack on Piltover\u2019s council.",
    "As for other story threads that Arcane season 2 will need to deal with, we\u2019re expecting to see Heimerdinger and Ekko continue to work together to help the undercity. With the former voted off Piltover\u2019s council in season 1 episode 7, he bumped into an injured Ekko on the streets of Zaun in episode 8. The pair bond over their shared love of technology and, after Heimerdinger helps Ekko to return home, the duo decide to collaborate and try to ease Zaun\u2019s suffering.",
    "We\u2019ll also need to see whether Viktor will completely lose himself completely to his Hextech research. He\u2019s already inadvertently murdered his childhood friend Sky as a result of his Hexcore studies, and it appears that he\u2019ll walk a darker path in season 2. If we know anything about LoL lore, there\u2019s every chance that we could see Viktor use Hextech to cybernetically enhance his body further and become the LoL champion that diehard LoL fans know him to be.",
    "Again, there\u2019s no confirmation on this front. But, based on the teaser above, we\u2019re confident that a trio of female characters will be back for Arcane\u2019s sequel:",
    "As the above tweet\u2019s video suggests, Vi, Jinx and Caitlyn will all be back for Arcane season 2. We hear the trio\u2019s voices at various points in the teaser and, given that all three watched on during that explosive season 1 finale, rather than being present in the room, we know that they\u2019re safe from harm and should return for season 2.",
    "So who else may return? That\u2019ll depend on who survives the Piltover council chamber attack. As we said earlier, we think that Mel and/or Cassandra could be casualties of Jinx\u2019s strike, while any of the other council members may die or be injured, too. We would expect Jayce to survive, though. He has a bigger role to play, in our view, and he\u2019ll no doubt want to bring Jinx to justice for her crimes.",
    "Additionally, we think Ekko, Heimerdinger and Viktor will be back for season 2. The trio weren\u2019t part of the council chamber attack, so they should return and we\u2019ll see how their character arcs progress in Arcane\u2019s second season.",
    "There are likely to be new faces introduced in season 2 as well. There were plenty of deaths in Arcane\u2019s first outing \u2013 Silco, Vander and Marcus to name three \u2013 so there\u2019s a need for new supporting characters. We have no idea who might show up, but there are lots of LoL heroes and villains that Riot, Netflix and Fortiche Productions can pull from the game franchise\u2019s universe and use for the animated series.",
    "No, and it\u2019ll be a while before we see one. Once one is released, we\u2019ll update this section.",
    "Yes, clearly. The show holds a 100% \u2018fresh\u2019 rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes among critics, while it also has a 97% \u2018fresh\u2019 rating based on audience reviews, too.",
    "Given its critical acclaim and popularity, Arcane season 2 was a formality. That may not have been the case ahead of release but, as soon as Netflix saw how well it was performing, it was only a matter of time before the company renewed it for a second outing.",
    "There\u2019s plenty of story left to tell, character arcs to tie up, and new individuals and champions to introduce, so Arcane will never be out of ideas from plot or character development perspectives. We\u2019re also big fans of Fortiche\u2019s visuals for the animated series, too, so we\u2019d be happy to see many more instalments in the TV show."
