    "The season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals often include plenty of gadgets, which often get discounted by device manufacturers themselves. But one of the biggest names in phones, Apple, is rarely generous with its discounts this time of year \u2013 so we\u2019ve put together a guide on what iPhone you should look for on Black Friday to get the best savings.",
    "We\u2019ll also clarify which iPhones you won\u2019t be seeing heavily discounted. Don\u2019t expect to see any significant price drops on the new iPhone 13 models, especially from Apple itself, which rarely participates in deals seasons. If there are any slight Black Friday deals on the latest iPhones, they\u2019ll be from online retailers or carriers.",
    "But to make room for the new phones, expect to see some Black Friday iPhone deals on last year\u2019s flagships and older models. Given the small number of changes from the iPhone 12 line, we still recommend them as alternatives if the newest Apple phones are out of your budget.",
    "That goes for the iPhone 11, too \u2013 though they don\u2019t have MagSafe or the neat flat-edged design of the newer iPhones, they\u2019re still good quality, with ultra-wide cameras and enhanced night photography over their predecessors.",
    "That leaves the iPhone XS, iPhone X, and iPhone XR, which are both still respectable given their full-screen designs and upgrades to iOS 15. If you want to stay with the iPhone 8 or iPhone SE and their home button with Touch ID, there will be plenty of deals on those handsets, too.",
    "Here\u2019s our advice on what iPhone you should look for on Black Friday, and what to expect at each level.",
    "As stated above, we don\u2019t expect the iPhone 13 line to be discounted much at all during the Black Friday season. Given the phones launched in September, we expect Apple to keep them at full price.",
    "That said, some online retailers may offer slight discounts on the iPhone 13 line \u2013 we\u2019d expect 5% to 10% off the list prices. Given the cheapest model in the range, the iPhone 13 mini, starts at $699 / \u00a3679 / AU$1,199, we could expect a 5% cut would knock around $35 / \u00a326 / AU$48 off. It\u2019s better than nothing, but we wouldn\u2019t expect much more during Black Friday.",
    "Carriers are another story, and regularly embrace deals seasons. They may augment their trade-in deals with a bit higher discounts over Black Friday, and we\u2019d expect those to reach peak value on the day of and through Cyber Monday \u2013 but they\u2019ll probably explain their offers ahead of time with dates when the deals kick in, so expect to have plenty of notice on what they\u2019re offering.",
    "Keep in mind that these discounts may combine with price cuts when trading in an old phone, so take note of which deal conditions stack up to get the best price.",
    "Here\u2019s where the deals really kick off. When Apple launched the iPhone 13 line in September, they immediately discounted the iPhone 12 range by $100 / \u00a3120 / AU$150, and we expect the prices to drop even more on Black Friday. Not on Apple\u2019s website, of course, but retailers and carriers may introduce their own discounts.",
    "These Black Friday iPhone 12 deals should be more substantial than those on the newest Apple phones. We wouldn\u2019t expect these to get as heavily discounted as flagship Androids during Black Friday, but it should be a much-needed price drop \u2013 especially for those trying to decide between iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 12.",
    "There\u2019s not much difference between the two, but the newer iPhone 13 has a smaller selfie camera notch, a higher maximum brightness in the display, slightly improved camera hardware and software, and slightly better specs with larger baseline storage capacity, as well as a noticeably larger 3,240mAh battery over the iPhone 12\u2019s 2,815mAh capacity one.",
    "We expect Black Friday iPhone 12 deals from retailers and carriers, especially with the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max \u2013 both of which are no longer officially sold by Apple, which only keeps the latest extra-small and extra-large models in its official lineup. That means you\u2019ll see them sold only by retailers and carriers, and probably at a discount. Expect around 10% discounts on current list prices, but not much better, as Apple phones still command a premium.",
    "The iPhone 11 range has had two notable price drops in as many years as it\u2019s been superseded by newer iPhones. You can still buy the standard model from Apple, and for good reason: it\u2019s still powerful and has big upgrades on its predecessors, including an ultra-wide camera and much-improved night photography. (The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are only sold by carriers and retailers.)",
    "The standard iPhone 11 now costs $499 / \u00a3489 / AU$849, which is $200 / \u00a3240 / AU$350 lower than its launch price, but expect higher than 10% off discounts for Black Friday.",
    "Note the differences in iPhone 12 vs. iPhone 11. If you opt for the latter, you\u2019ll miss out on the flat-edged redesign that makes the phone pack the same-size 6.1-inch display in smaller dimensions, an OLED display, the MagSafe wireless charging and magnetic accessory mount, slightly better specs, and night mode in all three cameras (including the selfie shooter). It\u2019s not a monumental difference, but important to consider what you\u2019re trading for value.",
    "The remaining iPhones will all likely see good discounts during Black Friday, including popular handsets like the iPhone SE 2020, iPhone XR, and others. These aren\u2019t the most advanced Apple handsets, but they\u2019ll still serve as great phones \u2013 and should see big discounts during Black Friday.",
    "Just note that older iPhones may not have many more years of software upgrades left. Apple has generously included the 2016 iPhone 6S as its oldest model getting iOS 15, but we have no idea if it will get iOS 16 next year. There\u2019s no telling which phone Apple will set as the cutoff model, but we\u2019re reasonably confident than the 2017 iPhone 7 and newer phones will get new versions of iOS for years to come.",
    "That said, if you wanted to be safe, opt for the iPhone SE 2020 or the iPhone XR for your affordable phone choice. Curiously, we still see the iPhone XS and iPhone X priced high, but all should get decent Black Friday discounts. That leaves the iPhone 8 as the reliable middle-of-the-road, which should get discounted well \u2013 but if you want to future-proof your affordable Apple phone choice, we recommend the iPhone SE 2020."
