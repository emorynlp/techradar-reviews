  "article": [
    "Apple\u2019s new MacBooks are out and reviews are glowing, especially with the return of ports that\u2019s sure to help pros in their workflows.",
    "However, a big bone of contention for many has been the notch. It\u2019s at the top of the display which houses the camera while not getting in the way of you doing work.",
    "While we didn\u2019t see an issue with it in our MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) review, some are still wanting to find ways to hide the notch regardless, which is where a few apps have appeared to grant this wish. But it doesn\u2019t seem needed in the long run.",
    "The MacBooks have only just been released, and yet there\u2019s apps that already hide the notch. The menu bar takes care of this by blending in with the notch, while it disappears when an app switches to full-screen.",
    "When I upgraded to an iPhone X in 2017, it took me a few weeks to ignore the notch. Now, it\u2019s something I accept.",
    "With a notch on a 14-inch or 16-inch display, it\u2019s something you\u2019re barely going to notice. But, there are two apps that can hide the notch if you really want to.",
    "However, you may still want something to hide it completely.",
    "Forehead is a utility that can make the Menu Bar black, and a future update will even add a virtual notch if you\u2019re feeling left out on your older Mac. This is free but the developer does have a donation option.",
    "TopNotch also tries to fix the notch problem by making sure that the Menu Bar stays black across any window that you\u2019re using. It runs in the background so if you change your wallpaper, the app will adjust the notch accordingly. It\u2019s also another free download.",
    "The notch is an example of not knowing how something truly is until you see it in person. You\u2019ll be able to test out the new MacBooks at your nearest Apple Store, or another authorized vendor to judge for yourself.",
    "But I suspect that the MacBook Pro notch will eventually be accepted as much as the notch on the iPhone was. There\u2019s an argument for why FaceID isn\u2019t on the new MacBooks, which is valid. But if you want a screen with a thin bezel, this is the compromise that Apple argues needs to be made.",
    "There\u2019s undoubtedly going to be improvements in the future where the notch is reduced in size, similar to the iPhone 13 Pro. However, it\u2019s not something that should make you hold off from purchasing if you\u2019ve been waiting for these new machines.",
    "These are the best MacBooks that Apple has designed in years, with a new focus on what makes a great professional laptop. For a bigger display that also has ProMotion at 120Hz, it\u2019s a small price to pay for what you\u2019re getting overall."
