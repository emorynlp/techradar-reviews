Read on as our guide explains how to get a Scotland vs Japan live stream and watch this rugby match online today.",
    "Japan's head-to-head with Scotland is a very lopsided affair, but the Brave Blossoms dealt a huge blow in their most recent encounter, knocking Gregor Townsend's men out of the 2019 World Cup.",
    "It was a humiliation that Scotland will want to seek retribution for and all recent evidence suggests that they should. Japan have lost four in a row since that famous triumph, while Scotland now have designs on cracking world rugby's top five.",
    "Their defeat to the Springboks was disappointing but not without merit, and to lift the gloom before it settles they'll need to display a level of mental fortitude that matches their ambitions.",
    "With skipper Stuart Hogg on the verge of becoming the national team's outright top try scorer, and both teams favouring a brand of dynamic rugby, this should be a real feel-good occasion.",
    "Follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a rugby live stream, including ways that you can watch Scotland vs Japan for FREE.",
    "If you're abroad right now and try to stream the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
