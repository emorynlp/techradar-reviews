    "Joaquin Phoenix has weighed in on the possibility of a sequel to 2019\u2019s Joker.",
    "In a recent interview with The Playlist, the actor confirmed that, while he\u2019s interested in developing the eponymous anti-hero further, he doesn\u2019t know whether a follow-up movie will ever happen.",
    "\u201cThere are some things we could do with this guy and could [explore] further,\u201d Phoenix said, \"but as to whether we actually will? I don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s clear, then, that development on a second Joker movie hasn\u2019t yet gotten underway.",
    "The movie\u2019s director, Todd Phillips, originally said that he and his team have \u201cno plans for a sequel,\u201d though reports emerged earlier this year suggesting that Warner Bros. had indeed given Phillips the green light for another Joker instalment.",
    "Nothing has yet been confirmed officially, though, with those rumors coming primarily from a blink-and-you'll-miss-it quote in a THR article on attorney Warren Dern suggesting that Phillips (one of Dern's clients) had \"struck a deal to co-write the next Joker.\"",
    "Phillips has also been quoted as implying that any potential sequel would be dependent on Phoenix's involvement, telling IGN in 2019 that \u201cif we can figure it out, and if Joaquin's down to do it, we would do it.\u201d",
    "Given the actor\u2019s recent comments to The Playlist, then, it looks like a Joker follow-up has got the seal of approval from both its would-be leading man and filmmaker. In theory, it\u2019ll now be up to Warner Bros. to \u201cfigure it out,\u201d as Phillips puts it.",
    "Put simply, we expect it would \u2013 especially if Phoenix is up for it, which was perhaps the biggest question mark over a potential sequel.",
    "Joker was a huge \u2013 and likely unexpected \u2013 financial success for the studio, raking in a whopping $1 billion from a reported budget of less than $70 million, so it figures that Warner Bros. would jump at the chance to cash in on a follow-up movie.",
    "Part of the original\u2019s appeal, though, was its stripped back approach to telling the origin story of a character so often accustomed to big-budget superhero productions. Not to spoil the ending of Phillips\u2019 Joker, but any potential sequel seems unlikely to be capable of matching that same character-driven narrative interest.",
    "Joker is a character study that intimately follows the life of a downtrodden individual on his way to becoming the face-painted villain popularized by the original comics \u2013 that\u2019s what made it such an interesting, if divisive, take.",
    "Any sequel, though, would be forced to either pick up almost immediately after the original\u2019s ending, or some years down the line \u2013 but either way, it would struggle to carry the same emotional power as the original movie, simply because there\u2019s very little room left for further developing the Joker as a character.",
    "Still, that\u2019s unlikely to deter Warner Bros. from heading back to Gotham City. Money talks, after all, and having Phoenix return to the role would almost certainly prove a profitable move for the studio.",
    "Should there be a Joker 2? Probably not. Will there be? It\u2019s looking likely, at this point. Given Phoenix\u2019s supposed lack of knowledge around the whole project, though, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a sequel arrive any time soon."
