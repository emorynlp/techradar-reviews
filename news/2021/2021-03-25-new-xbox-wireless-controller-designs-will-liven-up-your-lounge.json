    "Microsoft has announced that not one, but two new Xbox Wireless Controller designs are on the way \u2013 and they\u2019re the first piece of Xbox hardware to use post-consumer recycled (PCR) resins.",
    "Joining the Carbon Black, Robot White, Shock Blue and Pulse Red controllers are Electric Volt and Daystrike Camo Special Edition. Electric Volt will release on April 27 in most Xbox markets worldwide for $69.99 (\u00a359.99 / AU$89.95) while the Daystrike Camo Special Edition will arrive on May 4 for the same price.",
    "Both controllers will come with a 14-day trial for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate in select territories, too, so you give Microsoft's subscription service a go if you haven't already.",
    "You'll get the same benefits that the new Xbox Wireless Controller brings to the table on these special designs: a hybrid D-pad, dedicated share button, textured grip on the bumpers, triggers and back case, as well as a more ergonomic design. Both controllers also support Bluetooth, so you can connect them to your PC or mobile phone.",
    "The Electric Volt design reminds us of the beautiful ARMS Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch that were released back in 2017 with its vibrant neon yellow shade, while the Daystrike Camo Special Edition is another take on the popular camouflage designs we\u2019ve seen from Microsoft in the past.",
    "The new controllers are also far more sustainable to produce, too. Both the Electric Volt and Daystrike Camo Special Edition incorporate PCR resins, a first for any piece of Xbox hardware.",
    "In a post on Xbox Wire, director of product marketing Navin Kumar said: \"Both controllers will contain a portion of resins made from recycled materials like automotive headlight covers, plastic water jugs and CDs. We expect no compromises from these recycled materials either, as our testing shows the materials provide the same controller durability or performance you have come to expect.\"",
    "While the Xbox Wireless Controller was criticized for playing it rather safe compared to the innovative PS5 DualSense controller, one advantage of sticking with a familiar design appears to be that Microsoft can create more custom special editions. PS5 owners still only have the one DualSense design to choose from: the two-toned black and white one that comes with the console.",
    "The new Xbox Wireless Controller can also be used on Xbox One, Xbox One S and Xbox One X as they\u2019re backwards compatible with Microsoft last-gen consoles. But collectors will no doubt simply want to add these striking designs to their growing collection."
