  "article": [
    "It\u2019s a great time to be checking out gaming laptop deals in the US and UK right now thanks to a couple of great sales at the official Dell store, Walmart, and Currys yielding some superb options.",
    "For those who are on a budget, we especially recommend this Dell G5 15 SE for $685.99 (was $929). This one in particular has an AMD Ryzen 5-4600H processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, an RX 5600M graphics card, and, put simply - the cheapest price we\u2019ve seen so far for this spec. For 1080p performance without breaking the bank this is easily the top choice this weekend since you normally see this type of laptop go for around $799 at least.",
    "That said, if you do happen to have a little bit more cash to spend with your gaming laptop deals shopping, then we also recommend this 15.6-inch Evoo at Walmart for $899 (was $1,199). While an own-brand Walmart laptop, this one has some really incredible specs for the money with its RTX 2060 graphics card, AMD Ryzen 7-4800H, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. If you\u2019re looking for something that will handle high settings on games with good frame rates at 1080p then this is a particularly fine choice - if you can handle the rather bland aesthetic that is.",
    "And finally, for our UK readers, we\u2019d recommend this 15.6-inch Lenovo Legion 5 for \u00a3999 at Currys. While this one doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious gaming laptop deal since it doesn\u2019t have a discount, we think you\u2019re getting a lot for your hard-earned cash here. Not only does this one have a brand new RTX 3060 graphics card, but it\u2019s also got an AMD Ryzen 7-5800H, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Put those together and you\u2019ve simply got a great machine for just shy of a grand - and one that will push out some serious performance.",
