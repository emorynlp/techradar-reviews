In this guide, we explain how to watch The Sopranos online - all six seasons and 86 episodes of the HBO classic. After you're done, you can then watch The Wire online and see where you stand on this issue of international importance.",
    "Winner of 21 Primetime Emmy Awards and five Golden Globes, The Sopranos revolves around Italian-American gangster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his two New Jersey-based families - the wife and two kids he has at home, and the one that oversees various criminal enterprises sipping espresso outside a butcher's shop.",
    "What sets The Sopranos apart from other gangster shows is that - while it's got its fair share of shootouts, hits, and rats being whacked - its story is often told through the lens of Tony's sessions with his psychiatrist, Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), who he reluctantly turns to for help after suffering panic attacks. Because being a mob boss isn't easy, ya know?",
    "The focus on Tony's therapy, as well the insecurities and emotional difficulties of a number of other main characters, saw The Sopranos highlighting important mental health issues well before they entered the wider public eye. It's not just a brilliant show, it's an important and in many ways groundbreaking one.",
    "The work of premium US network HBO like so many other great shows, that makes HBO Max the obvious place to watch The Sopranos online - but there are loads of ways to stream Sopranos wherever you are. Read on for all the details you need."
