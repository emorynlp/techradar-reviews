    "What time is Dune streaming on HBO Max today? Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi epic has been brought forward by a day to match its release date in theaters \u2013 so Dune is now coming to HBO Max on Thursday, October 21 at 6PM EDT. That's only for subscribers on the $14.99 monthly tier, however. Scroll down a little, and we'll explain how that translates wherever you live.",
    "Update: Dune has been released and can now be streamed - head to HBO Max to watch it or sign up.",
    "You should check out our review of Dune, where we praised the film for its scale and ambition \u2013 though you're only getting one half of the story in this film. An adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, which hasn't ever hit the screen in the form it deserves, the film focuses on Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as he heads to the threat-heavy planet of Arrakis to secure the future of his family and people against difficult. The impressive ensemble cast also features Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa and Rebecca Ferguson, among others. Expect to hear people mention 'spice' a lot.",
    "Below, we'll explain when to watch Dune on HBO Max today, and explain which other premieres are coming to the service before the end of 2021.",
    "Dune lands on HBO Max today \u2013 on Thursday, October 21 at 6PM EDT/7PM CDT/9PM PDT, a day earlier than expected. Note that you'll need to be on the $14.99 ad-free subscriber tier to get Dune and any other premieres coming to the streaming service this year \u2013 the $9.99 tier won't get the film. You'll have 31 days to watch Dune, then it'll leave HBO Max.",
    "You can also go see the movie in theaters at the same time around the US. If you live in the UK, you can watch it this weekend. Australian readers will have to wait until December 2 to see it on the big screen.",
    "There are other reasons to stay subscribed to HBO Max this year. Will Smith Oscar contender King Richard arrives on the service on November 19, the same time it hits theaters. Finally, the last big movie of 2021 to hit the service will be The Matrix Resurrections on December 22, marking the return of the sci-fi series after 18 years.",
    "After that, HBO Max's day-and-date experiment will be over \u2013 2022 movies like The Batman will be theatrical-first releases."
