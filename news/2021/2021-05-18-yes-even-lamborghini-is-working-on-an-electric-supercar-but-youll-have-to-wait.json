    "Lamborghini has unveiled its electric car plans for the next decade, which include hybrid versions of its entire gas-powered lineup and the launch of an all-electric supercar before 2030.",
    "As with the rest of the world\u2019s largest automakers, the Italian performance car manufacturer is responding to tightening global emissions regulations which could see companies face sanctions for not embracing electric vehicle technologies.",
    "As such, plug-in hybrid versions of Aventador, Hurac\u00e1n and Urus models will be arriving on roads within the next three years, along with a select number of Si\u00e1n roadsters. In an exciting move for the future of supercars, Lamborghini will also unveil a completely new all-electric fourth model within the next decade as part of a $1.8 billion move away from traditional combustion engines.",
    "Naturally, it\u2019s likely that this all-electric Lambo has only just entered development, and so there\u2019s little to no information regarding what sort of performance we can expect from the battery-powered supercar.",
    "Back in 2017, the company did share a concept image of the tentatively-named Terzo Millennio, though, which offers a \u201ctechnological demonstrator\u201d of what an electric Lamborghini might look like. A Blade Runner-inspired Batmobile, is the answer.",
    "The Terzo Millennio was designed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which, at the time, included whacky ideas like a self-repairing process to help prevent cracks in the car\u2019s body (a feature we\u2019ve seen on a small scale in products like the LG Flex 2).",
    "Automotive technology has come a long way since 2017, but don\u2019t expect an all-electric Lamborghini to be self-healing.",
    "On the question of what customers would find appealing about an electric supercar, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said \u201cfor sure, it\u2019s the torque and the acceleration, and also [the reduction of] gaps when you shift gears. In my opinion, they\u2019re the things that customers are going to appreciate the most.\u201d",
    "Lamborghini hasn\u2019t said whether it plans to completely phase out production of its gas-powered vehicles, but Winkelmann said the company is targeting a 50% \u201cor more\u201d reduction of its CO2 emissions by the beginning of 2025. \u201cWe are speaking about the biggest investment ever done at Lamborghini,\u201d he added.",
    "As luxury automakers go, Lamborghini is late to the party when it comes to the shift towards all-electric production.",
    "While mid-tier manufacturers like Audi, BMW and Mercedes are already ploughing full steam ahead with hybrid and electric lineups, the likes of Ferrari and Aston Martin have also expressed their commitment to producing electric supercars in the near future.",
    "Both manufacturers have committed to launching all-electric SUV, sports and supercar models by 2025, while Lamborghini\u2019s parent company, Volkswagen, has also set aside $19 billion to end production of internal combustion engines in favor of electric alternatives.",
    "That being said, the Italian heritage brand isn\u2019t downing tools on its gas-powered cars just yet. The company plans to spend the next two years \u201ccelebrating the combustion engine\u201d in a sort of swan song homage to the vehicles which have brought Lamborghini record financial success in recent years.",
    "If its first all-electric supercar ends up looking anything like the Terzo Millennio, though, it\u2019s unlikely Lamborghini will struggle to make ends meet in the years to come.",
