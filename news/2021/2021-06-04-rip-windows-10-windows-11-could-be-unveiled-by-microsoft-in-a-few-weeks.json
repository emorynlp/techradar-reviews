  "summary": "Rumors are flying \u2013 but how likely is a name change, really?",
  "article": [
    "Windows 11 could be the name of the next-generation of Microsoft\u2019s desktop OS, or at least a bunch of clues and rumors appear to be vaguely pointing this way \u2013 ignoring the software giant\u2019s insistence in the past that it wouldn\u2019t turn things up to \u201811\u2019 (or any other number) with Windows.",
    "We already know that Microsoft is planning to show off the \u201cnext generation of Windows\u201d on June 24, ahead of the Sun Valley revamp emerging later this year, with apparently revolutionary changes in terms of the overall look and interface.",
    "So, rather than the Windows 10 21H2 update as we\u2019re expecting, could this actually be an entirely new version of Windows with an uptick in the number? Is Windows 11 really about happen, and what evidence is there for this possibility?",
    "The main pillar of the current Windows 11 speculation is built around the somewhat tenuous observation that in the teaser for the aforementioned Microsoft event in June, which you can see tweeted below, light coming through the \u2018window\u2019 forms two vertical bars in the shadow on the floor \u2013 kind of like a very thick \u201811\u2019 \u2013 with no horizontal bar present.",
    "This could purely be the way the scene and lighting has been rendered and mean absolutely nothing, although it does seem a little odd \u2013 and the fact that Microsoft has chosen the time of 11am for the event backs up the \u201811\u2019 theory. This also isn\u2019t typical timing for a Microsoft press shindig...",
    "As The Verge points out, other Microsoft executives have been stoking the rumor flames too, with comments like this one from the VP of Modern Life, Search & Devices Group, Yusuf Mehdi: \u201cI haven\u2019t been this excited for a new version of @Windows since Windows 95!\u201d",
    "Note that it\u2019s not a new version of \u2018Windows 10\u2019 he\u2019s talking about\u2026",
    "Then some leakers are getting in on the act too, like Evan Blass, who (as spotted by Windows Latest) tweeted: \u201cFrom the \u2018Don't take screenshots of this build\u2019 department: a forthcoming Microsoft OS called Windows 11.\u201d",
    "Cue a bunch of other tin foil hat-leaning theories alongside all this, like \u2018Sun Valley\u2019 (remember, that\u2019s the codename for the 21H2 revamp) having an \u201811\u2019 in it: Sun Va11ey. (For that matter, Satya Nade11a \u2013 right!?).",
    "What to make of all this? As we said at the outset, in the past Microsoft has made it very clear that \u201cWindows 10 is the last version of Windows\u201d, and there won\u2019t be a Windows 11 (or indeed anything else, like Windows 365 to pull another idea out of the hat).",
    "But then again, originally Microsoft also promised fancy names and themes for the big Windows 10 updates \u2013 like the Creators Update \u2013 which were quickly abandoned in favor of simply dating upgrades.",
    "And besides, things will have to change eventually, right? Windows 10 won\u2019t live forever\u2026 but six years? We suppose that\u2019s certainly a good deal more than the typical lifespan of a Windows OS\u2026",
    "In a few weeks, we\u2019ll know the truth behind this, but for now, while there are admittedly plenty of clues and leaks around, Windows 11 just feels rather unlikely. Especially if macOS 12 is about to be unleashed (and Microsoft might feel that symbolically, Windows 11 could subconsciously be seen as a step behind Apple in this respect).",
    "What might be a more realistic prospect is that Microsoft might simply rename the operating system plain \u2018Windows\u2019, and ditch the numbering entirely. In a similar kind of vein to the way in which the Surface Pro 5 was simply called the Surface Pro.",
    "If the name is changed away from Windows 10 \u2013 to Windows 11, just Windows, or something else entirely like Windows 365 \u2013 that also begs another question: presumably this will be a free upgrade for everyone on Windows 10? That would surely have to be the case\u2026"
