  "article": [
    "Apple Macs with the new M1 chip which have been experiencing problems with Bluetooth connectivity are going to get a fix for macOS Big Sur \u2013 at least in theory.",
    "We say that because Apple hasn\u2019t made an official statement on the Bluetooth bug \u2013 which has apparently been affecting buyers of the new Mac mini, and MacBooks with the M1 processor according to a report by Wccftech \u2013 but rather an Apple support representative has.",
    "Ian Bogost, a contributing writer at The Atlantic, spilled the news about a macOS fix being inbound \u2013 and coming soon \u2013 but later clarified that this news was shared by Apple support, so should be taken with a grain of salt.",
    "Time will tell, but still, this is a hopeful sign. We\u2019ve got in touch with Apple to check if there is indeed a solution for this fix in progress, and we\u2019ll update this story if we hear back from the company.",
    "As you may recall, the Bluetooth issues purportedly involved with the M1 chip are quite perplexing, and some users report intermittent loss of connectivity with peripherals. The problem might go away for a few days, but then it comes back, which is obviously quite a frustrating situation.",
    "It seems to be the new Mac mini that\u2019s mainly hit here, although there are some reports from affected M1-toting MacBook owners too (but these seem to be rarer, as we made clear in our previous story on this).",
    "There are also reports of similar Bluetooth issues with the previous Mac mini from 2018, although that\u2019s seemingly a separate issue from the wireless niggles with the M1 chip. At any rate, as mentioned, hopefully we\u2019ll hear back from Apple to clarify the situation around these bugbears \u2013 fingers crossed."
