    "Warning: Spoilers follow for Dune",
    "As you\u2019ll likely have heard by now, Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune comes to a rather abrupt end.",
    "It was always known that the director would shoot his thunderous adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s sci-fi novel in two parts. But seeing this lack of finality \u2013 and arguably, drama \u2013 play out in the duology\u2019s introductory instalment might come off as disappointing, especially to those who had looked forward to Dune with inevitably ill-fated levels of expectation.",
    "By the same token, though, there is no other way I would rather have seen Villeneuve tell this tale. To those unfamiliar with the source material, which the director so meticulously adheres to throughout the film's 150-minute runtime, Dune is an intimidatingly dense story of familial upheaval, political tension and theological prophecy. In practical terms, that means it's a 20-hour audiobook, or a novel you probably wouldn\u2019t get around to finishing on a week-long holiday.",
    "As such, Villeneuve only agreed to dramatize his version of Dune if he was permitted to do so across two films \u2013 with the first laying the groundwork for a more comprehensible, exciting second. By necessity, then, Dune: Part One occasionally suffers under the weight of its expository responsibility.",
    "But Villeneuve knows this. He loves this material like a Bible, and does exceptionally well to delve into Herbert\u2019s complex lore and religious ramblings in a way that never seems inaccessible. Soundtrack and sandworms aside, Dune is far from standard blockbuster fare, and though its lack of dramatic tension means it isn\u2019t the standalone sci-fi spectacular many expected it to be, the director uses a particular plot device to hint that Dune: Part 2 will deliver on that promise \u2013 Paul\u2019s dreams.",
    "Villeneuve not only employs his protagonist\u2019s (perhaps overly frequent) visions as a narrative tool throughout the film \u2013 proof of Paul\u2019s role as the messianic \"Muad'Dib\" \u2013 but also as a means of teasing Dune\u2019s sequel. He dangles the most exciting parts of Herbert's novel in front of his audience while acknowledging that he\u2019s not yet able to showcase these sequences this early in the story.",
    "In such moments, Villeneuve is basically saying, \u201cLook, guys, this is the movie you thought you were about to see, but come back in two years and you\u2019ll get it.\u201d",
    "And you know what? That\u2019s actually okay. Sure, it was frustrating to discover that certain dramatic set-pieces teased in the trailers (the giant desert battle, for instance) remain teases (read: visions) in the film itself, but at least they're evidence that Villeneuve\u2019s hyper-faithful adaptation will crank up the action in an as-yet-uncommissioned follow-up.",
    "Paul\u2019s dreams are my dreams for what Villeneuve\u2019s Dune would turn out to be when he attached himself to the project back in 2016. And since they prophesize the events of its sequel, almost as if the director has already shot it, I am more than happy to stomach the abrupt half time whistle and look forward to Dune: Part 2 with anticipation equal to the first.",
    "It\u2019s difficult to know whether the effect of these cinematic breadcrumbs is the same to those unfamiliar with the rest of the novel\u2019s story. I watched the movie with friends who were (and still are) entirely unaware of how Dune plays out in its entirety, so it\u2019s no surprise that some felt cheated by Villeneuve\u2019s unapologetic halting of proceedings.",
    "Perhaps if Dune was more obviously marketed as Part 1 of a two-part story, those cinemagoers who hadn\u2019t immersed themselves in its press tour prior to viewing might not feel so short-changed by its lack of finality.",
    "But Jason Momoa\u2019s Duncan Idaho offers a telling epigram for the director\u2019s hopes of a sequel early on in the movie. His line \u201cdreams make good stories\u201d is intended to ease Paul\u2019s mind, though it also rather sums up Villeneuve\u2019s approach to hooking his audience on an even better film he can\u2019t yet make.",
    "It\u2019s Zendaya\u2019s Chani, however, who gets the most unmistakably direct (and very last) piece of dialogue in Dune\u2019s two-and-a-half-hour runtime. \u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d she tells us \u2013 which is absolutely true of this sprawling story, and hopefully Villeneuve\u2019s stewardship of it.",
