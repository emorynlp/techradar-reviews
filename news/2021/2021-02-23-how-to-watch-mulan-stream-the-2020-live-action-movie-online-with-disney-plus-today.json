    "The live-action Mulan movie that's out now exclusively on Disney Plus is a remake of the popular 1998 cartoon and is available in most major Disney Plus markets, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, much of the EU, and many more countries. It stars Liu Yifei as Mulan, Donnie Yen as Commander Tung, and Jet Li as the Emperor of China",
    "As we've said, you'll need to be a Disney Plus subscriber to watch Mulan online. Fortunately, Disney Plus is one of the most affordable streaming services around, costing just $6.99/\u00a37.99/AU$11.99 a month.",
    "If that seems like a lot, just remember that $20 or \u00a330 is roughly the same as the price of two cinema tickets. But instead of queuing for ages for overpriced popcorn suffocating in your face mask, you get to watch Mulan when you want, how you want, and as many times as you want.",
    "Disney's spared no effort trying to recreate the cinematic experience for home viewers, with Mulan being available in stunning 4K HDR resolution and offering support for immersive Dolby Atmos sound.

    "Mulan cost $29.99/\u00a319.99/AU$34.99 to stream on its release date after that, which might seem like a lot, but is actually less than two cinema tickets when you think about it.",

    "Perhaps best of all, you get to keep anything you buy through Premier Access and watch it as many times as you want for the duration of your Disney Plus subscription.",
