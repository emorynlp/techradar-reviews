  "article": [
    "Spoilers for the first three episodes of Hawkeye follow. You've been warned.",
    "For a TV show named after the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Marksman\u201d \u2013 though we\u2019re pretty sure Green Arrow would dispute that \u2013 the first two episodes of Hawkeye were relatively light on the bow-and-arrow stuff.",
    "That\u2019s remedied in \u2018Echoes\u2019, however, as Clint Barton and Kate Bishop deliver a spectacular audition for the US Olympic archery team \u2013 much of it while hanging out the side of a car that isn't a vintage Dodge Challenger.",
    "Their race across New York is undoubtedly one of the best action sequences to come out of any Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Disney Plus show. As the Tracksuit Mafia pile into the chase, we\u2019re treated to an infectious mix of sharp dialogue, Fast & Furious-style stunt driving, and a lucky dip of trick arrows so ingenious that Robin Hood\u2019s feud with the Sheriff of Nottingham could have been done and dusted in a matter of minutes.",
    "It\u2019s the highlight of Hawkeye\u2019s best outing yet, an episode that cements the Barton/Bishop dynamic while expanding the show\u2019s scope with the (proper) introduction of Maya Lopez, star of Marvel\u2019s upcoming Echo TV show and one of the MCU's growing list of Phase 4 projects.",
    "While previous episode \u2018Hide and Seek\u2019 lost momentum as soon as Clint and Kate went their separate ways, \u2018Echoes\u2019 makes sure they never leave each other\u2019s orbit. It\u2019s the smartest move the writing team could have made, because the chemistry between Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld is so strong you\u2019d still be hooked if none of their scenes were punctuated by blockbuster-grade stunts.",
    "Crucially, though, their friendship is given space to evolve, the cynical father figure/wide-eyed fan hierarchy gradually flattening out into something akin to mutual respect. And while there\u2019s nothing like being taped to a pair of coin-operated horses when you need to deliver some home truths \u2013 Clint still needs to remind Kate he\u2019s the one protecting her \u2013 it\u2019s also the place Hawkeye concedes there might be some talent lurking behind his sidekick\u2019s rich-kid privilege. From there, all it takes to make Clint concede she might soon be troubling the archery world rankings is a high-speed dash across the Big Apple and a daring leap off a bridge.",
    "There\u2019s a growing tenderness to the double act, a sense Clint and Kate are starting to trust one another, too. Hawkeye\u2019s admission that he felt the same buzz as Kate when he first became a superhero is a rare glimpse beyond the cynicism, sacrifice and loss that now cloud his feelings about life as an Avenger. Meanwhile, his insistence that he really isn\u2019t a role model comes loaded with subtext, whether it\u2019s guilt about his actions as Ronin, or the fact most of his career has been spent as the mortal guy standing alongside literal gods. Can firing a load of fancy arrows really cut it when a friend from work can summon thunder and lightning?",
    "\u2018Echoes\u2019 also treats Clint\u2019s hearing loss \u2013 more of a side note in Hawkeye\u2019s first two episodes \u2013 with sensitivity. Clint and Kate\u2019s out-of-sync Subway conversation about compliments and dogs skirts a fine line between tenderness and humor, while Clint\u2019s phone call with his youngest son is a genuinely beautiful piece of writing. The way Kate steps in to transcribe Nate\u2019s words shows she\u2019s got Clint's back, while Renner makes Barton's emotional shift, from confusion to frustration to sadness to joy, look effortlessly natural.",
    "Have you ever longed for anyone to make it home in time for Christmas more than you do Clint in this moment? It\u2019s a not-a-dry-eye-in-the-house moment, and anyone who claims Marvel is just about people in fancy suits blowing stuff up should watch this scene.",
    "\u2018Echoes\u2019 may be the Clint \u2019n\u2019 Kate show, but it also provides a spectacular entrance for Maya Lopez. Newcomer Alaqua Cox makes her mark on the series from her very first scene, and it feels like an important, inclusive step for Marvel to have so many scenes in American Sign Language (ASL).",
    "The episode\u2019s opening flashback deftly highlights the parallels and contrasts between two women of a similar age whose lives have taken them in very different directions. Where Kate grew up in a world of wealth and privilege, Maya was pulled into the world of organised crime \u2013 yet both are motivated by the deaths of their fathers.",
    "Indeed, Maya\u2019s desire to exact revenge on Ronin for killing her dad appears to be all-consuming \u2013 to the point it almost seems a shame that we already know she\u2019s getting her own TV show. Some kind of redemptive arc is clearly imminent, but a bit more ambiguity at this stage would surely have been better for the character.",
    "Right now, however, our biggest question concerns step-dad-elect Jack\u2019s motives, and his possible connections with the Tracksuit Mafia. Popping up in the final scene brandishing a sword rather than a butterscotch, when Clint and Kate 'break' into the home of the latter's mother, suggests he\u2019s not just popped in for a friendly chat. Hopefully, Kate\u2019s a little better at swinging through the penthouse from chandeliers than that time she broke her arm. She'll need to be if the duo are to get out of another predicament.",
    "After a promising start, \u2018Echoes\u2019 is the episode where Hawkeye establishes itself as a must-watch \u2013 with memorable action, cracking one-liners and moments of surprising tenderness.",
    "Truthfull, it\u2019s everything you could possibly want from a Marvel TV show or movie. Meanwhile, in just a few minutes on screen, Alaqua Cox\u2019s brilliant performance as Maya Lopez does more than enough to raise anticipation for her Echo TV show. And, with a tease about the series' potential villain exciting fans, it seems that the back half of the show's six episode run will be just as memorable for the right reasons.",
    "Against all the odds, Hawkeye\u2019s belated elevation to the ranks of Marvel\u2019s most beloved heroes may actually happen \u2013 if he can just deal with all that tricky Ronin-shaped baggage, that is.",
    "New episodes of Hawkeye stream on Disney Plus every Wednesday."
