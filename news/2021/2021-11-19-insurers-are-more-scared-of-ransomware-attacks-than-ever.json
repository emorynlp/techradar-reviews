    "Insurance companies have reportedly halved the coverage they provide to customers in the event of a ransomware attack.",
    "Quoting anonymous industry sources, Reuters says that the situation is so dire that Lloyd's of London, which controls around a fifth of the global cyber market, has discouraged its 100-odd syndicate members from taking on cyber business next year.",
    "Although Lloyd\u2019s declined to comment to Reuters, cybersecurity experts tell TechRadar Pro that insurance coverage has invariably led to an increase in the number of ransomware attacks.",
    "\u201cRansomware payouts are out of control and insurance is one of the driving factors behind this new phase of attacking companies.
