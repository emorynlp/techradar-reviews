    "Generally companies aren\u2019t in the habit of hiding apps from you because, after all, they want you to use them. But there\u2019s an Apple-made iPhone app that\u2019s currently lurking on your phone, yet isn\u2019t visible on the home screen or App Library.",
    "The app in question is called Code Scanner, but you won't find it by browsing app icons. You can only find it by swiping down on your home screen to bring up search, then typing its name, or just Code or Scanner.",
    "Once launched, the app \u2013 which was highlighted by Gadget Hacks \u2013 can be used to scan QR codes and the new-with-iOS 14 App Clip codes. If you\u2019re thinking the Camera app can already do this \u2013 you\u2019re right, and that\u2019s perhaps why Apple doesn\u2019t feel the need to advertise the presence of this app.",
    "But it differs slightly to the Camera\u2019s implementation as it opens the links from scanned codes in an in-app browser, while if you use the Camera it will open them in Safari.",
    "This will probably be of minimal usefulness to most people but it\u2019s an interesting find, and it\u2019s curious that Apple has doubled up on this feature \u2013 or just let it linger in the background of the phone.",
    "If you do take to Code Scanner then you can also make it easier to launch by adding it to Control Center. To do that you\u2019ll need to head into Settings, select Control Center, and drag Code Scanner up into the selection of visible shortcuts.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Code Scanner isn\u2019t a new thing though, so much as just a new name. Previous versions of this app existed in earlier versions of iOS, under the names Scan QR Code and QR Code Reader. It\u2019s speculated that the name was changed again now to remove reference to QR, since it can also scan App Clip codes.",
    "One other thing to bear in mind is that Code Scanner doesn\u2019t save your scanned codes \u2013 or the page that it opens for them in its browser. Once you close the app they\u2019re gone, so make sure you\u2019ve got what you need from them first.",
