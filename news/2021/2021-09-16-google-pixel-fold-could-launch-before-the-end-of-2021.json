    "A new rumor suggests the Google Pixel Fold release date could be in the final months of 2021, bringing the Google foldable perhaps as a surprise announcement alongside the Google Pixel 6 we expect to launch in October.",
    "A tweet from David Naranjo, Senior Director of Display Supply Chain Consultants, lists several devices arriving in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 that are rumored to use LTPO OLED panels from Samsung Display Company (SDC). The list includes the just-launched iPhone 13 Pro as releasing in Q3, while the Google Pixel 6 Pro and Google Pixel Fold are expected in Q4.",
    "Of course, it\u2019s the reference to the Pixel Fold that\u2019s exciting, especially with a release window by year\u2019s end. That it\u2019s expected around the same time as the Google Pixel 6 lineup, which we anticipate arriving in October, suggests Google\u2019s foldable is coming a lot sooner than expected.",
    "While we\u2019ve been hearing that the Pixel Fold could launch in 2021 for awhile, it hasn\u2019t been clear when the foldable would launch. There have been enough rumors suggesting its existence that it\u2019s felt more a question of when, not if, we\u2019ll see the phone. So what\u2019s the argument for seeing it in 2021?",
    "The most recent rumor compares alleged specs of the Pixel Fold against the upcoming Pixel 6 (which Google has so openly confirmed that units showed up in the windows of the NYC Google Store) \u2013 and the report suggests that the foldable might just be, well, a folding version of the tech giant\u2019s next flagship. That includes the in-house Tensor chipset as well as a modem and cameras.",
    "We could still see the Pixel Fold arrive in 2022: even though the foldable was referred to by its heavily-rumored codename (\u2018Passport\u2019) in an Android 12 beta alongside codenames associated with the Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 5a, we may end up seeing it arrive in 2022 anyway. We just haven\u2019t heard nearly enough smartphone scuttlebutt about the Pixel Fold to suggest it\u2019s rolling off production lines \u2013 not nearly as much as we\u2019ve heard about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. That said, maybe Google will still tease the device when it unveils its next flagship, just to keep us waiting for its reveal in the new year.",
