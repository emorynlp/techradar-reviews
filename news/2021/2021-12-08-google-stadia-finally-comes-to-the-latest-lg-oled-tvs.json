    "Google\u2019s cloud gaming service, Google Stadia, is finally available to download on the latest LG TVs.",
    "The South Korean manufacturer \u2013 whose OLED TVs rank among our pick of the best TVs money can buy in 2021 \u2013 pledged way back in January that Stadia access would come to its latest smart display hardware by the end of the year, so LG has fulfilled its promise by the skin of its teeth.",
    "Google Stadia is now available to download from the LG Content Store on LG smart TVs running webOS 5.0 and above in any of the 22 countries where the service is offered. In layman\u2019s terms, that means those with LG models from 2020 onwards are likely to be able to access the cloud gaming platform.",
    "Google\u2019s gaming service launched in 2019 as a way of offering players access to triple-A games without them needing to purchase expensive consoles \u2013 like the PS5 or Xbox Series X.",
    "In its base-level state, Stadia currently offers 1080p, 60fps access to over 200 games (including Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin\u2019s Creed: Valhalla), which are all playable using a variety of compatible controllers. Support is available for 4K HDR graphics and immersive 5.1 surround sound via the Stadio Pro subscription tier, too, which offers players instant access to a 40+ game library with new titles added monthly.",
    "On LG's latest and greatest OLED TVs, then, gamers can now take full advantage of the premium features Google Stadia has to offer.",
    "Google Stadia isn\u2019t the only gaming service to come to LG TVs in recent months. After being announced at the same time earlier this year, Nvidia GeForce Now arrived on compatible LG displays in November, offering gamers another route to their favorite titles.",
    "It\u2019s arguably a more accessible service, too. For starters, Nvidia GeForce Now offers a free tier enabling players to stream games they already own on Steam (without Stadia's monthly subscription fee), while the paid-for Founders edition of the service ($4.99 per month in the US) supports ray tracing \u2013 something you won't get with Google\u2019s offering.",
    "You do get 11 free games and access to trials on the latter, though, so the difference between the two platforms isn't quite as drastic as it might first seem.",
    "Whichever service you decide to go for, then, their long-awaited arrival on the latest LG displays will go some way to bolstering the brand\u2019s reputation as a manufacturer of some of the best gaming TVs on the market in 2021."
