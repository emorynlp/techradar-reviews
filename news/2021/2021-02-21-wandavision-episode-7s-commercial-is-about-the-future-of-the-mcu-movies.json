    "Spoilers for WandaVision follow.",
    "In most TV shows, commercials are an annoying interruption, the bits you want to skip through to get back to the entertainment. In WandaVision, however, they\u2019re a key part of the mystery, offering subtle clues about what\u2019s going on in Westview. The ad for Nexus anti-depressants in \u2018Breaking the Fourth Wall\u2019 (WandaVision episode 7) may be the most important of the lot.",
    "Why? In Marvel comics, \u2018Nexus\u2019 is a word loaded with meaning, opening doors to the many realities of the multiverse. That could have colossal implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, potentially providing an explanation for the events in WandaVision, while setting up the upcoming, Sam Raimi-directed Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness \u2013 and the MCU\u2019s Phase 4.",
    "So as WandaVision prepares to take the MCU interdimensional, we discuss that crucial WandaVision episode 7 commercial, and dive into Marvel comics continuity to explain why Nexus Beings and the Nexus of All Realities are such a big deal.",
    "Don't miss our analysis of the WandaVision episode 7 ending, too, if you want to learn more about what's going to happen next in the show.",
    "All of WandaVision\u2019s six in-episode commercials to date (the \u2018real-world\u2019 set episode 4 didn\u2019t have one) have had ties to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Some have been obvious (like the Stark Industries Toast Mate 2000 in episode 1), while others have been more subtle \u2013 the Lagos paper towels in episode 5 allude to an incident in the opening of Captain America: Civil War.",
    "However, none of the previous ads have quite as many potential consequences for the MCU as the commercial for Nexus anti-depressant medication in episode 7.",
    "In the commercial, a woman \u2013 played by Victoria Blade, who\u2019s appeared in every WandaVision ad except the Yo-Magic animation in the \u201990s-set episode 6 \u2013 sits alone on a park bench.",
    "\u201cFeeling depressed?\u201d asks the voiceover. \u201cLike the world goes on without you? Do you just want to be left alone? Ask your doctor about Nexus\u2026\u201d",
    "It goes on to say that Nexus is \u201ca unique anti-depressant that works to anchor you back to your reality \u2013 or the reality of your choice.\u201d The woman walks up to a pharmacy counter staffed by regular WandaVision commercial actor Ithamar Enriquez.",
    "Then the smallprint: \u201cSide effects include: feeling your feelings, confronting your truth, seizing your destiny and, possibly, more depression.\u201d",
    "And then, as the woman leaves the pharmacy: \u201cYou should not take Nexus unless your doctor has cleared you to move on with your life. Nexus: because the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Or does it?\u201d",
    "While much of the commercial focuses on Wanda\u2019s state of mind as she grieves for Vision, the references to \u201cthe reality of your choice\u201d, and whether or not the world \u201crevolves around you\u201d have multiverse-shaped implications. As does the fact this brand of medication is called Nexus\u2026",
    "The so-called Nexus of All Realities is the point where all possible realities within the Marvel comics multiverse overlap. As such, it serves as a gateway between numerous dimensions.",
    "Conveniently for Marvel\u2019s writers, this unique location can be found on Earth, in a Florida swamp, where it\u2019s generally protected by plant/human hybrid Man-Thing. The Nexus made its first appearance in Adventure into Fear #11 in 1972.",
    "As well as having their own unique powers, Nexus Beings share the ability to influence probability. In other words, they can alter the future and the flow of the space-time continuum \u2013 this means they\u2019re among the most powerful entities in the universe. Among their number are the wizard Merlin, the X-Men\u2019s Jean Grey, Reed and Sue Richards\u2019 kid Franklin, Kang the Conqueror (Big Bad in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania) and\u2026 Wanda Maximoff and Vision.",
    "In Highlander-style, there can be only one Nexus Being in each of the parallel worlds of the multiverse. Scarlet Witch (aka Wanda) is the Nexus Being (or Nexi) for Reality-616, the main continuity in Marvel comics.",
    "It could be the biggest thing to happen in the MCU since Thor\u2019s banishment to Earth revealed the existence of the Nine Realms, or the Chitauri invasion force showed the world that extra-terrestrial life is real \u2013 and can be hostile.",
    "The MCU has hinted at the existence of the multiverse in the past, not least in Doctor Strange, where the Sorcerer Supreme battled Dark Dimension resident Dormammu. We also know that the Doctor Strange sequel will be titled Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness \u2013 which is quite a big clue.",
    "If WandaVision has just confirmed the existence of a Nexus of All Realities, however, it could be the route to discovering the alternative dimensions of the MCU. The implications are huge for Phase 4 of the epic Marvel Cinematic Universe continuity.",
    "If the MCU Wanda is a Nexus Being like her comics counterpart, this could explain how she has the power to manipulate the reality of Westview, New Jersey, turning it into a total-immersion journey through US sitcom history. The WandaVision episode 7 ad\u2019s references to \u201cthe reality of your choice\u201d and the idea that the world may actually revolve around Wanda seems to be pointing the story in that direction.",
    "And even though the comics\u2019 Nexus of All Realities is located in Florida, there\u2019s no reason the MCU version can\u2019t be shifted a few hundred miles up America\u2019s East Coast to New Jersey. If Wanda wanted to bring Vision back to life, a powerful location like the Nexus seems as good a place as any to do it \u2013 especially if newly revealed antagonist Agatha Harkness had anything to do with her \u2018decision\u2019 to move there.",
    "In WandaVision terms, the Nexus could explain why Wanda\u2019s brother, Pietro, looks like the X-Men universe\u2019s Evan Peters incarnation, rather than the MCU\u2019s Aaron Taylor-Johnson version. Perhaps we\u2019re about to find out that the disparate continuities of the non-MCU Spider-Man and X-Men movies are all part of one big- (and small-) screen Marvel multiverse.",
    "There have also been plenty of rumors that the follow-up to Spider-Man: Far From Home will feature previous Spider-Men Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield \u2013 though current Peter Parker Tom Holland has denied it \u2013 and a newly opened multiverse could explain how they get together. And if Wanda truly is a Nexus Being, it could be why she\u2019s a key player in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness \u2013 perhaps the Sorcerer Supreme will utilize her ability to control reality (or realities).",
    "The Nexus may tie into the upcoming Loki TV show, too, seeing as it involves the Time Variance Authority \u2013 an organisation responsible for monitoring the timeline of the universe and Nexus Beings.",
    "So it may turn out that WandaVision\u2019s little Nexus commercial is the most important revelation in the MCU for nearly a decade.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
