    "Known simply as \u2018Doc\u2019, this Cleaner sacrificed her social life for a career in medicine. It means she\u2019s a hell of a doctor, even if her bedside manner leaves a little to be desired.

    "Mom - Instant revive - +1 support inventory - +1 team extra life",

    "There will be eight types of Ridden to survive against in Back 4 Blood, each of which poses a unique threat to you and your squad. Here\u2019s a roundup of the disfigured nasties you\u2019ll need to dispose of in Back 4 Blood.",
    "Snitcher The Snitcher will let out a deafening screech when aggravated, which will cause a fresh horde of Ridden to appear. Shut it up before it screams, or you might regret it.",
    "Tallboy An intimidating sight, the Tallboy stalks its victims but can quickly close the gap by dashing forward at speed. If the Tallboy gets near enough, watch out for its massive club-like arm as it will try to pulverize you and your team. Aim at its weak spot, the shoulder, before it can take a swing.",
    "Reeker You\u2019ll probably smell this stinker before you see it. The Reeker is a large but slow-moving enemy that explodes on death. Just make sure you keep your distance before it blows up, as the Reeker will blow players back and cover you in sticky pus.",
    "Stinger You\u2019ll need to keep your wits about you when a Stinger appears. This Ridden can traverse many surfaces and tends to stick to the shadows. If it manages to pin you with its phlegm (gross), you\u2019ll need to get a teammate to break you out or use a breakout card.",
    "We\u2019ll update this section as more Ridden are announced.",
    "PC requirements revealed",
    "Ahead of Back 4 Blood\u2019s October release, Turtle Rock has confirmed the minimum and recommended specs to play the game on PC. The good news is, the game\u2019s minimum requirements don\u2019t seem too demanding. At minimum you\u2019ll need an Intel Core i5-6600 (3.3GHz) or AMD Ryzen 5 2600 (3.4GHz), 8GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 TI or Radeon RX 570, DX12 and at least 40GB of HDD space.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for what Turtle Rock recommends to get the most out of the game then it\u2019s an Intel Core i5-8400 (2.8GHz) or AMD Ryzen 7 1800X (3.6GHz), 12GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or Radeon RX 590, DX12 and at least 40GB of SSD space.",
    "Narrative-driven replayability",
    "Back 4 Blood has a main story that players will be able to experience through the game\u2019s cinematics. However, the game\u2019s lead writer Simon Mackenzie has revealed in an interview with GameSpot that players will be able to learn more about the world and its characters by switching up their squad too. There are eight playable Cleaners in total in the game, while a squad caps out at four, so it\u2019ll be worth swapping around that structure to learn more in the game\u2019s quieter moments.",
    "\"We do have cinematic scenes, so there is a historical version of events within the game, and the characters represented in the cutscenes as they happen is my golden path,\" Mackenzie said. \"That being said, all the Cleaners, when you have them, have different stories. They talk about each other--focusing on their own character stories or the wider picture. So you'll get a different experience, and I hope people play through with different groups of Cleaners.\"",
    "\"We've got a dynamic system with the [voice-over],\u201d Mackenzie explained, \u201cso when the pacing drops, that's when the softer, more character-driven moments pop up. So we have to have several big performances because for a lot of the dialogue, we don't know whether it's going to be said as they are just walking or maybe there's one or two Ridden or maybe they're in a full firefight.\"",
    "Mod support?",
    "In a recent interview, we quizzed Turtle Rock Studios co-founder and design director Chris Ashton about mod support in Back 4 Blood, and his answer was, perhaps understandably, rather cautious.",
    "\u201cUnknown at this point in time,\u201d said Ashton. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly more challenging these days than it used to be, but you know I love mods, I love modding, it\u2019s where I got my start in games. I\u2019d love to do it if we can but it\u2019s definitely a big challenge. I\u2019d love to see it.\u201d",
    "Back 4 Blood PC features detailed Back 4 Blood on PC includes several features that will be available at launch, including 4K resolution, uncapped framerates, Nvidia DLSS support, ultrawide and multi-monitor support, cross-play, and various other graphics and visual quality options that PC players expect.",
    "The game will be available via the Microsoft Store, Steam and Epic Games Store. Always online Back 4 Blood\u2019s developer Turtle Rock has confirmed that the game is always online, meaning you won\u2019t be able to play it offline, even if it\u2019s just you and some AI. Turtle Rock confirmed this in a tweet when responding to a question about a store listing stating \"online play required\", explaining, \u201cWe're looking into ways we could support offline for the future but you will need an internet connection to play at launch.\u201d",
    "Keeping the community together In a recent blog post on keeping the game\u2019s community together, Turtle Rock has confirmed that when only one person in a Back 4 Blood party needs to own DLC for everyone to be able to play it. The post states, that in PvE, \u201cif your party leader owns a paid content drop, you will be able to play that content with them\u2014including maps, gameplay and campaign. No separation. No exclusion. No split.\u201d",
    "And to put players\u2019 minds at ease that paid content drops might make PvP play-to-win, Turtle Rock added, \u201cIn PvP, everyone who bought Back 4 Blood can get access to all additional PvP content, even without purchasing content drops. Players who don\u2019t buy the content drops can earn new playable characters and Ridden in PvP, for free, through progression. Additionally, all PvP players have access to the same cards at the start of each match regardless of whether those players have purchased content drops or not.\u201d",
    "Coming to Xbox Game Pass day one Back 4 Blood will launch on Xbox Game Pass on day one. The news was revealed at Microsoft's E3 2021 conference and means those who subscribe to Xbox Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will Back 4 Blood when it launches on October 12 for no extra charge.",
    "New boss called the Breaker Back 4 Blood showed a new Ridden at the Summer Game Fest Show called the Breaker, which is a huge rock-like zombie with glowing hotspots. The breaker can leap around the map and cause havoc, so make sure you fire and move if you want to survive.",
    "Turtle Rock has now confirmed that cross-play will be included in Back 4 Blood during the open-beta, and will hopefully be ready for launch.",
    "Cross-play support is a great addition to Back 4 Blood, as the player base wouldn't be needlessly segregated by platforms and it will ensure that the game will always have a healthy amount of players.",
    "Back 4 Blood's beta has now taken place and, as far as it's been made clear, there won't be another before the game's October 12 launch. Those who just can't wait until then will be glad to know that pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe and Ultimate Editions of the game gives 4 days early access, starting on October 8. For those who took part in the beta, nothing will carry over to the main game.",
    "Turtle Rock has said in a Q&A with fans (via VG247) that it'll be using feedback from the beta to work on improving the game's bots as well as tuning difficulty before launch. We went hands on with the game so don't miss our impressions on what we played.",
    "Nvidia has announced that Back 4 Blood will include DLSS support. PC Players with GeForce RTX graphics cards can activate Nvidia DLSS to benefit from the technology's performance boosts, which should hep you eke out more performance when playing at higher resolutions."
