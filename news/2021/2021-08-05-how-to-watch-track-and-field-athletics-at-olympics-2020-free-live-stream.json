This page will be your handbook of key dates and Olympic live streams of the track and field athletics action so you don\u2019t miss a second - including absolutely free! - including absolutely free.",
    "After rain paused play in the women\u2019s pole vault qualifying, the athletes did well to recompose and qualify for the final. Unfortunately, US favorite Sandi Morris quite literally crashed out after her pole snapped, injuring her hip and heartbreakingly ending her Olympics. This leaves pre-event tips Katerina Stefanidi, Holly Bradshaw and Anzhelika Sidorova to settle the medals amongst them.",
    "Saturday will see the climax of Sifan Hassan\u2019s unprecedented pursuit for three Olympic golds in the 1500m, 5000m and 10,000m. With the 5000m gold already around her neck, can she write her name in the history books by doing the same in the 1500m and 10,000m?",
    "The track and field action concludes with the ever-popular relays. Four athletes passing a baton around the track seems simple right? Wrong - that little metal baton can cause havoc for even the most drilled of teams. The 4x100m and 4x400m will see the best of the best from each nation, including medallists from the individual events in Tokyo, come together in the battle for those Olympic golds.",
