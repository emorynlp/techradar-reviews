  "article": [
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED is here \u2013 or at least it will be relatively soon. Nintendo surprise dropped a reveal trailer on July 6 for the revamped Switch console, which features a 7-inch OLED display instead of the 6.2-inch screen found on the original Switch.",
    "We\u2019d heard about a potential OLED display in a number of leaks and rumors, and seeing those whispers become reality is nothing short of seismic. While the LCD screen of the Nintendo Switch never held it back \u2013 having been a bestseller for the four years since its launch \u2013 this OLED upgrade is only going to elevate the kind of visual experience possible on the Switch handheld.",
    "But, most importantly, Nintendo opted for a Switch OLED instead of a 4K Switch, and that\u2019s definitely worth paying attention to.",
    "4K resolution is one of the biggest buzz words in consumer technology today. That\u2019s not to say that 4K isn\u2019t an impressive technology \u2013 it most certainly is, offering four times the number of pixels of Full HD, and therefore four times the level of detail on a TV, monitor or display.",
    "But it\u2019s also become a shorthand for next-gen, step-up hardware, despite the varying levels of quality across 4K TVs and displays.",
    "4K is, crucially, also a key feature for the latest Sony and Microsoft consoles, the PS5 and Xbox Series X, with even the Xbox Series S offering 4K upscaling \u2013 meaning it can process HD games into a semblance of 4K before outputting to a TV, even if the games themselves don't natively support 4K.",
    "Nintendo is something of an outlier in not chasing 4K gaming in the same way as its competitors, being content with HD and Full HD gaming even in a 2021 upgrade to a four-year-old console. It\u2019s easy to connect this to the company\u2019s \u2018blue ocean\u2019 strategy, which entails seeking uncharted waters where it isn\u2019t directly competing with the likes of Sony and Microsoft \u2013 and that means not trying to offer 4K gaming until it can do so with relative ease, and with confidence in consumer interest in the resolution.",
    "The Switch is a very underpowered machine compared to the other home consoles on the market, not least because it needs to be portable enough to work in handheld. While plenty of AAA games can run on the existing Switch, they largely do so at a lower resolution and frame rate than their PS5 or Xbox Series X counterparts (Doom Eternal is not pretty in handheld mode, trust me).",
    "That doesn\u2019t stop plenty of games looking great on the Switch, though. Breath of the Wild still had a gorgeous and massive open world when it launched back in 2017, and it\u2019s clear that the Switch is able to hold its own in today\u2019s console market, with the specs to play impressive and immersive games, whether that\u2019s a flagship Zelda game or the dungeon crawler Hades.",
    "OLED is a much smarter and more Nintendo-like addition for an upgraded Switch. An OLED panel on the handheld console won\u2019t change how games look when the Switch is docked \u2013 which anyway is so dependent on the quality of someone\u2019s television display \u2013 but it means portable play is elevated to new heights.",
    "OLED panels are largely superior to LCD ones, with self-emissive pixels that \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 can emit their own light without a backlight. This ensures deeper color vibrancy, as well as incredible brightness control. The ability to turn pixels off individually makes for incredibly deep blacks, with a stark contrast in comparison to bright whites and highlights on the screen.",
    "OLED is godsend for gaming, too, given high contrast levels only enhance the colors and outlines of gaming engine graphics \u2013 and given that the fast response time of OLED pixels ensures minimal lag and fast, responsive play. Whether you\u2019re shooting arrows in Breath of the Wild 2 or spraying paint at other players in Splatoon 3, the Switch OLED should only feel better to play.",
    "There's a reason OLED is used in almost every premium television range, from LG and Sony to Panasonic and Vizio. OLED images are very hard to beat, at least without very impress backlighting setups that can recreate the brightness control and contrast of an OLED screen, none of which is really possible on a display as small as this.",
    "The handheld display is something that Sony and Microsoft simply don\u2019t offer \u2013 outside of cloud gaming on mobile devices, of course, which is still dependent on the phones and tablets made by other manufacturers, or at least not in tandem with these companies\u2019 gaming divisions.",
    "So it makes perfect sense for Nintendo to lean into this unique property of its console, making it even better, leaning into the Switch\u2019s inherent strengths.",
    "Of course, an OLED panel won\u2019t fix every problem, or even be for everyone. The underlying performance of the existing Switch likely won\u2019t change much with this new iteration, and anyone with a 2017-era console may find little reason to upgrade. That\u2019s absolutely fine.",
    "But for those wanting an uptick in visuals ahead of BOTW 2, or coming to the Switch console family for the first time, the Switch OLED takes a measured look at the future and chooses sensible improvements over high-resolution races it simply can\u2019t win."
