    "It looks like God of War: Ragnarok will bring Kratos and players enjoy a little more variety when it comes to the shields that can be used in the game.",
    "The desire to offer more choice when compared to 2018\u2019s God of War was touched on by the game\u2019s director, Eric Williams, in an interview with God of War YouTuber Jon Ford.",
    "Ford pointed out to Williams that in the recent trailer for Ragnarok, there are moments where it looks like Kratos\u2019 Guardian Shield has a different design and Kratos is using it in different ways. Williams acknowledged the truth of this and said that while he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to go too deep on it\u201d, the game will have \u201cdifferent shields, and they have different defensive options and abilities.\u201c",
    "The reason for this, William explained, is because he and the team at Santa Monica Studio \u201creally want to open up expressive choice to the way that you build your Kratos, like the equipment and loadout and things like that.\u201d",
    "This, Williams added, goes \u201call the way down to the defense, so you can kind of play a little differently and enemies know how to respond to that, or force you into these different situations where you need to use different things. I think it\u2019ll be fun for players to explore that but also we want it to be more expressive, you know, your choices matter when you set him up.\u201d",
    "Unfortunately, Williams didn\u2019t go into specifics when it comes to what any of these abilities will be but watching the trailer with a beady eye does yield a couple of designs at least. Really, any attempts to make defense more varied and interesting sound worth exploring to make a more well-rounded and potentially tactically interesting combat system.",
    "God of War: Ragnarok is the game that will finish off the series\u2019 Norse saga started with 2018\u2019s God of War and, based on what we\u2019ve heard about it so far, it seems like Santa Monica Studios intends to go out on a high by building on what\u2019s come before.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time Williams has touched on giving the player more opportunities to express themselves when it comes to Kratos\u2019 loadout and abilities, either. In a recent interview with IGN, the director said, \u201cSo in Ragnarok, what we are trying to do specifically with Kratos, we're trying to give a lot more expressiveness to the player.\u201c",
    "In that interview, Williams touched on Atreus having \u201cmore follow-ups and setups for Kratos\u201c in combat, adding that \u201cthere's going to be a little bit more conversation with the enemies with all the new tools.\u201d",
    "Adding this kind of variety is partly, it seems, because it\u2019s now possible and because it improves the experience for the player. \u201cVariety for variety's sake is not a thing at all,\u201d Williams told IGN, \u201cIt's there to serve what we're trying to do. Kratos grappling up the ledge with a chain and then colliding with the enemy and going off, you couldn't do things like that [in 2018]. Most of the gameplay last time took place on a plane. Now there's some verticality to it.\u201d",
    "We were pretty happy with the combat in 2018\u2019s God of War but, hey, we won\u2019t object if Santa Monica Studios decides to take the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, improve it\u201d approach. God of War: Ragnarok is expected to arrive on PS5 and PS4 sometime in 2022."
