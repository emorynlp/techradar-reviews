    "Cyberpunk 2077 has received a new patch on PC, consoles and Google Stadia, which brings another raft of fixes, including some important solutions for crash bugs.",
    "The new hotfix takes the game to version 1.21 (following the release of the big v1.2 patch a couple of weeks back) and the devs note that it focuses on \u201cimproving the overall stability of the game and fixing the most common issues that could block progression\u201d.",
    "That means a load of fixes for quest glitches which might leave you stuck and unable to complete whatever you\u2019ve been tasked with, along with \u201cvarious memory management improvements\u201d, which should reduce the number of crashes you witness with Cyberpunk 2077 overall.",
    "Other notable changes include the interface being made less cluttered while you\u2019re scanning, and a couple of gameplay fixes, one being an issue where the police spawn right behind your back when you commit a crime on the roof of a building. A bug which stopped you from getting out of the water by climbing a ladder has also been resolved.",
    "There\u2019s some useful work here, then, and of course we can expect plenty more where that came from. As we reported earlier this week, CD Projekt Red has underlined that it\u2019ll continue to provide updates so as to \u201cbring the game to such a state that we can be proud of it and therefore successfully sell it for years to come\u201d.",
    "Which, of course, is the state it should have been in, or at least much closer to, when Cyberpunk 2077 first came out in December 2020."
