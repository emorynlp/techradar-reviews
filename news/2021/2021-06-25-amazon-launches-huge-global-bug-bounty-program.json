    "The AWS BugBust program allows developers to create and manage private events that help turn the process of fixing bugs in your software into a healthy competition.",
    "Dubbing it the \u201cworld\u2019s largest code challenge\u201d Amazon hopes to use AWS BugBust to reduce technical debt by over $100 million.",
    "\u201cToday, we are excited to announce an entirely new approach to help developers improve code quality, eliminate bugs, and boost application performance, while saving millions of dollars in application resource costs,\u201d noted Swami Sivasubramanian, VP, Amazon Machine Learning, AWS.",
    "In a blog post, AWS principal advocate Martin Beeby explains that every time a developer fixes a bug at any of the private events around the world, they are allotted points on the global leaderboard.",
