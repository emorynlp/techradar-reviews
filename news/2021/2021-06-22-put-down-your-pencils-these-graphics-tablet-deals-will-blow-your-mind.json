    "Now that Amazon Prime Day is in full swing, you might have been looking around at various art supplies to refill your kit for the coming months. While traditional mediums are still important, this year has a plethora of amazing deals on graphics drawing tablets that could change the way you breathe life into your designs. Graphics tablets are designed either with or without a display built-in, and those with screens have historically been a very expensive purchase, enough so to deter few artists from jumping into the world of digital art. Not only has technology enabled this style of drawing tablet to become more affordable and accessible, but the deals we've compiled take an additional hefty sum off the asking price. Whether you're a novice artist or a professional graphic designer, there are plenty of different products on offer from the likes of Wacom, Huion and XP-Pen for any budget. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for graphics tablets from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
