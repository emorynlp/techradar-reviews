    "Dave Rennie's revitalised side will look to end their 2021 Rugby Championship campaign with another win in Robina this evening.",
    "Read on as our guide explains how to watch an Argentina vs Australia live stream for the Rugby Championship game from anywhere in the world - including for free in Australia.",
    "The Aussies followed up beating world champions South Africa two weeks in a row but extending their winning streak with a win over Argentina last weekend and marking the first time that the Wallabies have strung together a trio of consecutive victories in four years.",
    "The 27-8 win over the Pumas in front of a near-packed out Townsville crowd, came despite the hosts being far from their best, with tries from Reece Hodge, Samu Kerevi and Andrew Kellaway ensuring the Aussies moved above South Africa in the Rugby Championship table.",
    "Julian Montoya scored Argentina's only try of the game, with the defeat leaving them without a win in five Rugby Championship matches, having lost twice to both South Africa and New Zealand before last weekend's match.",
    "With the Puma Trophy now sure to stay in Aussie hands after last week's win, Rennie may be tempted to rotate his side for this match, with one eye on the Wallabies' upcoming spring tour against Japan.",
    "Follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get an Argentina vs Australia live stream of the Rugby Championship game wherever you are right now - starting with how to watch Argentina vs Australia for FREE in Australia.",
    "If you're outside your country of residence - whether that be the UK or anywhere else - and try to start streaming the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to watch rugby from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Australia, just head to the 9Now site or app"
