    "Fashion brand Louis Vuitton\u2019s Horizon Light Up has launched a new wireless speaker, and it looks curiously like a UFO straight out of a retro science fiction flick.",
    "The Horizon Light Up wireless speaker can be pre-ordered now for the stratospheric price of $2,980 (around \u00a32,200 / AU$4,100), with the official launch set for July 31. While it\u2019s certainly expensive, that sort of price isn\u2019t unheard of for the best wireless speakers, and lands within the range of the fantastic KEF LS50 Wireless II.",
    "That being said, the Horizon Light Up does come across as something of a novelty, especially given its maker. And the wireless speaker\u2019s overall design certainly gives that impression, featuring a mix of steel, leather, glass and 35 LEDs, with the company\u2019s logo emblazoned all over the device.",
    "However, the Horizon Light Up sounds a bit more promising than the usual style-over-substance wireless speaker, featuring a 3-inch subwoofer, 0.75-inch tweeters and support for both Apple AirPlay 2 and Bluetooth 5.1.",
    "The Horizon Light Up wireless speaker also seems to have been based on the design of the company\u2019s iconic Toupie handbag, which features similar build quality and disc-like appearance, and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 comes with a similarly eye-watering price tag.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that the Horizon Light Up wireless speaker isn\u2019t Louis Vuitton\u2019s first audio rodeo. Last year, the company launched a range of fashion-focused Horizon wireless earbuds, which featured a quality stainless steel build and active noise cancelling.",
    "While these were similarly expensive at $1,000 / \u00a3955 (around AU$1,370) a pop, they must have sold well enough for the company to follow-up with another audio product. But with the Horizon Light Up costing considerably more than even those wireless earbuds, we\u2019re not quite ready to predict the wireless speaker will prove to be as popular."
