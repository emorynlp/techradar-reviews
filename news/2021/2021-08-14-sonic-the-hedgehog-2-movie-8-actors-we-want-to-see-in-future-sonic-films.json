    "It was an announcement that nobody saw coming. On August 10, Idris Elba \u2013 the award-winning actor whose credits include Luther and The Suicide Squad \u2013 unexpectedly revealed that he will voice Knuckles in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie.",
    "Unsurprisingly, the casting was met with equal parts surprise and excitement. Bringing Elba on board adds more star power to proceedings and his vocals should be a solid and amusing fit for Knuckles\u2019 serious persona.",
    "Needless to say, Elba\u2019s casting got us thinking: which other actors should voice other Sonic characters in future movies? There are plenty of iconic, unusual and silly individuals to choose from and, in our view, lots of stars who would be perfect for certain roles.",
    "Below, we\u2019ve listed eight actors who we want to appear in future Sonic films, as well as the character that we think they\u2019d be a match for. We have no insider information about future castings, but it\u2019s always fun to speculate, right?",
    "An unlikely option, given that Sonic\u2019s sidekick was portrayed by regular Tails voice actor Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey in the first film\u2019s post-credits scene. O\u2019Shaughnessey hasn\u2019t been confirmed to reprise this role in the second Sonic movie yet, but we suspect that she\u2019ll return.",
    "If Tails was voiced by someone else, though, Tom Holland seems like an ideal fit. Despite his rapid rise in recent years, the Spider-Man star comes across as good-natured and humble, so he\u2019d be perfect for playing Tails.",
    "Other roles, including Onward and Spies in Disguise, have shown that the British actor can portray innocent and inventor-type characters, too \u2013 which would help as Tails is a skilled craftsman with a pure heart.",
    "Another British star who seems like a solid fit for Sonic\u2019s primary love interest. Waller-Bridge\u2019s down-to-Earth personality, coupled with her ability to change her character\u2019s persona and mood on a whim, would suit Amy Rose well.",
    "As a Sonic character with a positive, can-do attitude who isn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind or reveal her angry side, Amy Rose is one of the Sonic series\u2019 surprisingly complex personas, and we feel that the award-winning Fleabag actress would do a stand-up job of portraying her. We'd even allow for Amy Rose breaking the fourth wall on a couple of occasions, too, in a call back to Waller-Bridge's most famous role.",
    "With his calm, disciplined and serious demeanour, the de-facto leader of the Chaotix Detective Agency needs an actor who has experience in a similar role. Step forward Chris Evans, whose decade-long spell as Captain America makes him the perfect candidate to voice Espio.",
    "Evans has shown that he can portray self-obsessed, stubborn or ruthless characters in the past, too, such as Scott Pilgrim\u2019s Lucas Lee and Knives Out\u2019s Ransom Drysdale. Embodying a character with similar characteristics in Espio, then, wouldn\u2019t be a problem for the former Marvel star.",
    "She\u2019s portrayed strong, female characters that belie her tender years in other projects, but Millie Bobby Brown as Cream is something we could see happening. Yes, she\u2019s another UK actor on our list, but how much more polite can you get (stereotypically at least) than British people?",
    "Cream may be respectful and sweet-natured, but she\u2019s also fiercely loyal, brave and combative. Bobby Brown has shown on countless occasions that she possesses such attributes in Stranger Things and other productions, so she would have no problem voicing someone like Cream. You could even hire one of her fellow Stranger Things stars, such as Sadie Sink, to voice Cream\u2019s Chao friend Cheese, too.",
    "The iconic Australian actor is no stranger to voicing animated characters (Flushed Away, Missing Link), but we think casting Jackman as Fang the Sniper would be a humorous choice.",
    "The gun-toting, flying bike-riding character (who also goes by Nack the Weasel in some countries) is a treasure hunter who longs to find the Chaos Emeralds so he can sell them on for a hefty fee. If these items make their way into the Sonic movies, especially now that Knuckles has appeared, Fang\u2019s introduction might not be too far away as well.",
    "Most movie fans will have seen Jackman in more serious roles than this, but hiring him as Fang would let him bust out his comedy acting skills and be a fun supporting antagonist to someone like Jim Carrey's Dr. Eggman.",
    "This isn\u2019t an unorthodox choice, admittedly, but only because we can actually visualize Johansson as Rouge. Her voice would fit so well with the femme fatale aspect of this character, so we can\u2019t picture anyone else taking the role on.",
    "Like Jackman, the Black Widow star has voice acting experience so this wouldn\u2019t be an alien role to her. Add in the fact that Johansson has been cast as strong, ambitious, independent female characters throughout her career, and Rouge seems like a role that is ready made for her.",
    "Given Rouge\u2019s history of switching her allegiances throughout the Sonic series, we could easily see her jumping back and forth between Sonic and Dr. Eggman\u2019s groups \u2013 and Johansson, with her capacity to embody both good and bad roles, would be great at either.",
    "A goofy, eccentric character calls for a similarly oddball actor \u2013 and there\u2019s few better suited to such a task than Jeff Goldblum.",
    "He\u2019d be a supporting character rather than a major star, but we suspect that Goldblum would revel in voicing Big if he was cast. Provided that a future Sonic film introduced Big\u2019s close friends in Amy Rose and Cream, the large, purple feline\u2019s arrival wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched.",
    "With little care for items like the Chaos Emeralds or stopping Dr. Eggman of his own volition \u2013 Big is at his happiest fishing in peaceful locations \u2013 bringing him along for any potentially world-saving quests could lead to all manner of hilarious moments. And who would be better than Goldblum to deliver on such moments?",
    "We don\u2019t feel like we have to sell this one to you. It\u2019s Adam Driver as Shadow the Hedgehog. Try and think of a downside, we dare you.",
    "Driver may not have as much voice acting experience as others on this list but, let\u2019s be honest, he doesn\u2019t need it. His deep voice is tailor-made for a brooding, indifferent and blunt persona \u2013 Star Wars' Ben Solo, anyone? \u2013 and you know he\u2019d do justice to the character if he was hired.",
    "If there\u2019s to be a Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (and the chances of this are good, in our view), Shadow would be an obvious candidate to include. He\u2019d be a worthy adversary to Sonic and, with Ben Schwartz\u2019s Sonic and Driver\u2019s Shadow battling it out \u2013 physically and verbally \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want to see that?"
