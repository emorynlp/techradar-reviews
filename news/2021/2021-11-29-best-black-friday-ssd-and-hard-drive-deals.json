    "Cyber Monday SSD and hard drive deals have finally hit the digital shelves, from all the major storage brands and retailers. If you're looking to upgrade the available storage in your current PC or laptop, or perhaps building a new system from scratch, the Cyber Monday deals are the ideal time of year to buy your storage at a tasty discount.",
    "Many of the current deals are extended bargains that have survived the Black Friday sales, but that's great news if you had your eyes on a particular deal and were worried that it may have expired. We're here to help you cut through the noise and pick out the best storage deals for every budget and need.",
    "SSDs and hard drives are actually some of the few PC components in good supply this Cyber Monday, so there are plenty of great options to choose from. But that doesn't mean you won't need to act fast. If you have other items on your virtual shopping list this year then we also have a Cyber Monday live blog running with all the latest and greatest offers to snap up, which should give you an advantage over folks hunting for deals themselves.",
    "Additionally, don't forget we also have additional guides to help you locate the best Cyber Monday laptop deals and Cyber Monday PC Gaming deals, so you can bag a new laptop for work, and some new peripherals for gaming at home.",
    "We'll be updating this page all day long with all the latest and greatest Cyber Monday SSD and hard drive deals, so keep us bookmarked.",
    "It\u2019s easy to assume that SSDs and hard drives are simple products when compared to laptops, TVs, or PCs, but there\u2019s still plenty to consider if you want to buy new storage.",
    "SSDs are more popular for a couple of crucial reasons: even affordable SSDs are far faster than the average hard disk, and they\u2019re smaller, too. The lack of moving parts also means they\u2019re less susceptible to breakages.",
    "While an SSD will always be quicker than a hard drive, different kinds of SSDs do exhibit different speed levels. The best cheap SSDs use the slower SATA connection standard, while the best M.2 drives are quicker but pricier. At the top of the tree are PCIe 4.0 drives, which provide the fastest speeds alongside the highest prices.",
    "If you\u2019re buying the best internal hard drive you can find, you\u2019ll have to accept a slower pace when compared to SSDs. Nevertheless, remember that 3.5in drives are almost always faster than 2.5in products and that 7,200rpm drives are quicker than 5,400rpm disks.",
    "Make sure you\u2019re buying an SSD or hard drive that\u2019s got enough capacity, and then think about the particular attributes of internal and external hardware. If you buy an internal SSD or hard drive, ensure you\u2019ve got the requisite motherboard connections and space free inside your machine.",
    "If you\u2019ve got external storage in your sights, check that your other hardware supports its type of connector, and consider its dimensions and weight. It could also be worth buying a ruggedized hard drive to ensure that it survives life on the road. Make sure your new drive has a top-notch warranty, too.",
    "If you want to buy a hard drive for a specialist business PC or the best gaming SSD for your entertainment, there are some additional considerations.",
    "Business buyers should buy an SSD or a hard drive that has a higher endurance rating. That\u2019s because productivity PCs and laptops tend to read and write files to storage at a greater frequency than the storage used in consumer systems. That\u2019s true for internal and external hardware in equal measure.",
    "It\u2019s also worth investing in storage with built-in backup options like cloud storage to ensure that you don\u2019t lose vital files, and if you\u2019re going to store sensitive data then many SSDs and hard drives also have encryption.",
    "Gamers need to address a different set of concerns. Speed and capacity are vital here: if the former is good, your loading times and boot speeds will be better, and if the latter is large enough, you\u2019ll never run out of room. If you want an SSD to upgrade your PS5, then make sure the console supports it before you click the buy button.",
    "If you need some inspiration on what products to keep an eye on, the following are our top choices for anyone looking to upgrade their storage.",
    "There's no guarantee that these will be discounted of course, but it's worth doing some research on what SSDs and HDDs are worth buying as there are sure to be a lot of deals across popular sites, and not every device is worth buying, even at a discount.",
    "If you can afford to spare no expense in getting a storage drive, then the Samsung 980 Pro may just be the best SSD for you. This is the fastest SSD we've ever tested, making it ideal for future-proofing your rig \u2013 especially when you get the 1TB capacity. And, while it's not the cheapest SSD on the market, it delivers that speed without substantially raising the price over its rivals. Just remember that in order to take full advantage of its speed, a Gen4 SSD is vital.",

    "It\u2019s almost impossible to talk about hard drives without mentioning Seagate\u2019s BarraCuda lineup \u2013 it\u2019s a force to be reckoned with. And, it\u2019s not hard to see why, Seagate BarraCuda drives offer a great gigabyte-per-dollar ratio and speed benefits to top it off. The 2TB model hits a sweet spot by balancing high performance and affordability. Since this drive combines 7,200rpm platters and high density data, computers outfitted with this drive will be able to read data extraordinarily fast.",
    "Samsung is no stranger to creating some of the best SSDs, so when it launched the Samsung 970 Evo Plus with higher speeds and new silicon, even we were surprised. The Samsung 970 Evo Plus is simply one of the fastest drives on the market, but the fact that Samsung is selling it at such a bargain price is just the icing on the cake. Because of how affordable this drive is, it\u2019s not hard to recommend it as the best SSD for anyone.",
