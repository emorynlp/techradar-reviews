  "article": [
    "It\u2019s quite frightening to think how integrated into my everyday life Apple and its products have become.",
    "I practically live out of my iPhone reminders, have countless midnight musings buried away in my notes app and rely far too heavily on my pair of AirPods to relax. That\u2019s not to mention the hours whiled away in front of a Mac screen, or the old iPad that sits on the kitchen table like some sort of omniscient Eye of Sauron.",
    "This big behemoth of Silicon Valley is now so embedded into my existence that it would require a serious effort to deviate from continuing to buy its products. Of course, that\u2019s just the way Apple likes it \u2013 but it\u2019s also the way I like it, too.",
    "When it comes to buying my next phone, I already know where my money is going. It was the same when it was time for a new laptop \u2013 because once you\u2019ve got an iPhone, it doesn\u2019t matter about the competition anymore. The convenience of having all your devices married up to the same OS outweighs, in my opinion, the superior performance you might enjoy from using multiple products from different manufacturers.",
    "Apple\u2019s business model thrives on the loyalty of consumers like me, and I\u2019ve become such a devoted fan of its ecosystem that I\u2019m willing to claim I\u2019ll never buy an Android phone ever again \u2013 which, you might say, is a shame, because there are some darn good Androids out there.",
    "Take the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, for example. It tops our list of the best smartphones in 2021, and for good reason. It\u2019s got one of the best cameras on the market, phenomenal power, great battery life and a design that differentiates it from its predecessor \u2013 not a claim Apple can often make of its iPhones. Then there\u2019s the OnePlus 8 Pro, the flagship of a once-little-known brand which packs arguably the best display around alongside formidable 5G speeds and, unlike the newest iPhones, reverse charging.",
    "Need I say more? The all-new Oppo Find X3 Pro equals or betters the iPhone 12 Pro in almost every department, and carries a price tag to match \u2013 meaning Apple is no longer the most expensive phone-maker by default, as was once the case. Then you\u2019ve got the Xiaomi Mi 11, Motorola Edge, OnePlus 8T and many more devices all boasting features that represent companies trying new things in the face of the decidedly unremarkable iPhone 12 series.",
    "But like I said: convenience, for me, outmuscles performance. The joy \u2013 and trust me, it is joy, having once juggled an iPhone, a Windows PC and Bose earbuds \u2013 of seeing my laptop react to happenings on my phone in real-time is enough to make me think I\u2019ll be using iPhones for the rest of my life. I can\u2019t speak for the synergy between an iPhone and Apple Watch \u2013 a personal preference for regular wristwatches means I haven\u2019t dipped my toe in the smartwatch water just yet \u2013 but I\u2019d comfortably add the latter to my basket without even assessing the competition, such is my confidence in the interconnectivity of Apple\u2019s offerings.",
    "I have willingly trapped myself in the Apple ecosystem, and I\u2019m not looking for a way out. I\u2019d wager that this is the case for a lot of others, too, given how effectively the company has managed to market itself as the home of \u2018fashionable\u2019 tech even when it\u2019s products no longer always represent the height of innovation. For my money, Apple\u2019s promise of performance, convenience and style is enough to maintain the continued loyalty of its innumerable customers, despite the leaps and bounds made by rival manufacturers that perhaps offer better products.",
    "This is the reason we at TechRadar caveat so many of our Apple reviews with lines like, \u201cthe AirPods Pro are the perfect earbuds... for Apple fans.\u201d It\u2019s as if the Cupertino giant designs its products under the assumption that its customers have already bought into the Apple ethos. Those looking for a standalone device \u2013 be it a phone, pair of earphones or smartwatch \u2013 would probably be unwise to assume Apple\u2019s offerings are the best on the market, but who\u2019s really looking for tech that doesn\u2019t get on with the tech you already have?",
    "That\u2019s been Apple\u2019s gambit for years, and it\u2019s reaped an embarrassment of riches.",
    "In this way, the question of whether Apple is truly innovative has and will continue to rage among consumers and tech experts for years to come (this is also the topic of discussion in episode one of our new Seriously? series, as it happens). Is it still a company that continues to revolutionise the world of tech in the same way as it did with the launch of the original Macintosh, iPod and iPhone? Or, having made its trillions, is Apple now happy to focus on the growth of its own ecosystem, which has expanded to streaming, banking and \u2013 in the near future \u2013 electric vehicles?",
    "Of course, it all comes down to preference. Yes, there are devices out there which scream innovation louder than any Apple product has done for several years, and I know my iPhone is far from the best around \u2013 but it\u2019s indisputably the best for me."
