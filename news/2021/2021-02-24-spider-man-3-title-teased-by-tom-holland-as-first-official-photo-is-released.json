    "Update: After some light trolling, the third MCU Spider-Man movie's official title has been revealed: Spider-Man: No Way Home is releasing later this year. Check out a short video below for more.",
    "Original story: Tom Holland has given us a first glimpse of Spider-Man 3 \u2013 and trolled fans over the movie\u2019s supposed title.",
    "Holland, alongside co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon, took to Instagram on Tuesday evening to tease fans with the first official stills from the upcoming MCU flick. As expected, the images (one of which you can see above) don\u2019t give anything away but, judging by the concerned looks on their faces, the trio have stumbled upon something worrying or huge.",
    "Zendaya and Batalon \u2013 who play MJ and Ned Leeds respectively \u2013 also joined Holland in pranking fans over the film\u2019s alleged title. The group accompanied their Instagram uploads with captions stating their delight over being able to share Spider-Man 3\u2019s title. However, fans who scrolled to the resulting images were met with humorous takes on the trilogy\u2019s previous two entries instead.",
    "You can view Holland\u2019s post below, and then check out Zendaya\u2019s and Batalon\u2019s follow-up images. Spider-Man: Phone Home, Spider-Man: Home Slice or Spider-Man: Homewrecker \u2013 take your pick.",
    "The still-untitled third Spider-Man movie is currently scheduled to arrive in December 2021.",
    "On the surface, it seems that Holland and friends are simply pranking fans with their amusing title images. Given how the other two movies had the word \u2018home\u2019 in their titles, many fans would view the trio\u2019s \u2018Phone Home\u2019, \u2018Home Slice\u2019, and \u2018Home Wrecker\u2019 inclusions as funny nods to Spider-Man: Homecoming and Far From Home.",
    "Is that simply the case though, or is there a hidden meaning within the title mock-ups?",
    "It seems strange that each title has the word \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 rocking a different color. More to the point, the hues used in Holland\u2019s and Zendaya\u2019s title image are reminiscent of the colors used by the MCU\u2019s two Spider-Man villains so far. In the comics, Vulture traditionally wears a green costume, while Mysterio\u2019s signature garb is primarily purple in tone.",
    "Based on Holland\u2019s and Zendaya\u2019s posts, could we see both bad guys reprise their roles in Spider-Man 3?",
    "Batalon\u2019s gray Spider-Man image is ordinarily associated with Rhino, but it\u2019s unlikely that this character will turn up in Spider-Man 3. With that in mind, it could be that Batalon\u2019s post is devoid of any traditional villain colors so fans don\u2019t speculate on which member of the webslinger\u2019s rogues gallery might also show up.",
    "We've heard that Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro and Alfred Molina\u2019s Doc Ock are crossing over from Sony\u2019s Spider-Verse, but Batalon\u2019s post doesn\u2019t point towards either of them. The lack of color in his image, then, could be reserved for an unannounced villain, and cause plenty of online speculation as a result. The word 'wrecker' and the color gray make us think of Rhino, who appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, played by Paul Giamatti.",
    "Or, this could all just be nothing at all, and it's merely a gentle trolling by the film's cast."
