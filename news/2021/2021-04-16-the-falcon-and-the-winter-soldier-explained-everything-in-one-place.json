    "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is Marvel's second canonical TV show on Disney Plus. On this page, we'll tell you everything we know about the show so far \u2013 listing our recaps from each episode of the series, and sharing our explainers around key moments and characters that you might want to read more about.",
    "In case you haven't seen it yet, the show brings stars two of Steve Rogers' close allies, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Set months after the ending of Avengers Endgame, where an elderly Rogers handed the Captain America mantle to Sam, the show deals with what the shield means and explores a turbulent post-Thanos world of slightly boring terrorists.",
    "The show is much more straightforward than WandaVision was, but that's actually not the worst thing in the world, given that it's been almost two years since we saw our last bit of big screen MCU action. The series actually feels like a Marvel movie in TV form \u2013 even if it's a little bit uneven overall, thanks to an overload of villains and some confusing plotting. Still, it's been fun to tune in each week, and it has its own share of mysteries to unpack.",

    "Read our reviews of each episode so far, which are accompanied by Marvel-related trivia picked out by our expert each week. New reviews will be posted every Friday, until the season's six episodes come to a close.",

    "Be warned there are spoilers in the headlines below.",
