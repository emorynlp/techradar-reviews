    "Despite making innovative and interesting phones like the LG Wing 5G and the upcoming LG Rollable, LG has struggled to compete in the smartphone market in recent years, and has now revealed that it\u2019s considering giving up on phones.",
    "That\u2019s according to the Korea Herald, which has seen a note sent to employees from the company\u2019s CEO, Kwon Bong-seok. While the note didn\u2019t go so far as to say that LG was definitely abandoning the smartphone business, it did apparently say that \u201cthe company is considering all possible measures, including sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business.\u201d",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard talk that LG might quit the smartphone business, but just a few days earlier LG's global head of corporate communications, Ken Hong, called the rumors \"completely false and without merit\u201d so this seems like quite a sudden turnaround.",
    "It would make sense for LG to mull its options though, as according to StatCounter, LG\u2019s smartphone market share in December stood at just 1.7%.",
    "While the smartphone industry might be booming, it really only seems to be a few companies that are significantly benefiting, with Samsung and Apple being among the major premium players, while Chinese brands like Oppo and OnePlus sell phones at prices that LG can\u2019t compete with.",
    "Still, it seems no decision has been made yet, so there\u2019s some hope for LG\u2019s smartphone business. Though it\u2019s unlikely the LG Rollable will be its savior, as that\u2019s sure to be a very expensive and probably very niche device.",
