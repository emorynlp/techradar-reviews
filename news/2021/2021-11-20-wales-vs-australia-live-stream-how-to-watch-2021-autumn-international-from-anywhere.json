    "It's been an autumn to forget for both Wales and Australia, the Wallabies suffering two defeats from two, while the Six Nations champs have lost two of three in front of their own fans. The heavyweights need to give their fans something to cheer about, and you can read on as our guide explains how to get a Wales vs Australia live stream and watch the Autumn International rugby match online today.",
    "Wayne Pivac's men have scored 72 points to 100 conceded over the course of this deeply unhappy autumn series, a hammering by the All Blacks preceding a late collapse against the Springboks a fortnight ago.",
    "But last weekend's highly unconvincing comeback win over Fiji was arguably the worst display of the bunch, the Pacific Islanders at times holding their own with 13 men.",
    "At least Wales won... a feat the Wallabies have been unable to accomplish so far. The No. 3-ranked team in the world now faces the humiliation of a first winless European tour since 1976, and to compound matters they'll be without injured skipper Michael Hooper.",
    "Wales, of course, are still missing their leader Alun Wyn Jones, while WillGriff John and Will Rowlands are the latest names on an increasingly grim-looking injury list.",
    "Can either team salvage some pride? Follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a rugby live stream, including ways that you can watch Wales vs Australia for FREE.",
    "If you're abroad right now and try to stream the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
