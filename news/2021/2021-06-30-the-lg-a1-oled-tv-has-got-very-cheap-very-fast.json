    "When the LG A1 OLED launched earlier this year, it already carried a great price for anyone looking for an affordable OLED. Though, it looks like LG isn't done making its budget option for 2021 an even better deal, as it has received a huge price cut in the US and UK.",
    "Over at Walmart, we've seen a deal putting the 55-inch TV down to $1,396.99 saving you just over $200, and in the UK, Currys has the OLED down to \u00a31,099 (cutting \u00a3300 off the original asking price). This is a fantastic deal on an OLED TV which, even after a few years of the technology being on the market, rarely get this low in price.",
    "Not in the US or UK? Scroll down to see the best LG deals in your region.",
    "The LG A1 OLED comes with a great image but has a few drawbacks over higher priced options. For one it comes with the a7 processor rather than the more powerful a9 Gen 4 AI chip used in the LG C1 and G1 OLEDs. This can lead to more video noise in darker scenes.",
    "It also doesn't have any HDMI 2.1 ports and only has 20W audio. If you want to know more, check out our full LG A1 OLED guide to get up to speed on this budget OLED TV.",
    "Not a fan of the LG A1 OLED TV deals above, or maybe you aren't in the US or UK? Here are the best LG OLED TV deals that we can find right now."
