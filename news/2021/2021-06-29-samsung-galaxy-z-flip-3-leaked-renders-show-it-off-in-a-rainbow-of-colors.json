    "New Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 renders give us our first potential look at the back of the upcoming clamshell foldable phone, as well as which color schemes it could come in.",
    "The news also comes with a possible Z Flip 3 release date of August 3, affirming prior rumors of a big Samsung Unpacked event on that date, as well as a US price tag of $1,400 (around \u00a31,010 / AU$1,865). That\u2019s slightly below the cost of its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5G, which had a launch price of $1,449 / \u00a31,399 / AU$2,599.",
    "Rumors of the Samsung Z Flip 3 have trickled out, but aside from fuzzy screenshots and a leaked press mock-up, we haven\u2019t had much in the way of a good look at the follow-up to the Z Flip 5G (which is, presumably, the Z Flip 2 in all but name). The renders come courtesy of GizNext, which purport to show images of what the clamshell foldable will look like:",
    "Per these renders, the Z Flip 3 won\u2019t look too different from its predecessors aside from a larger external display \u2013 which GizNext reports to be 1.9 inches, up from the 1.1-inch screen on its predecessors. The foldable also gets a bigger pair of main cameras, aligned vertically beside the display. The new renders show a bit more of the outer screen\u2019s range, like media controls while playing audio, implying it will be a touchscreen.",
    "The render leak also shows what colors the clamshell will come in: a forest-hued dark green, a light violet, a beige that looks more pastel yellow, and traditional black, though the GizNext post also suggests it will come in pink, grey, dark blue, and white. The images imply that all models will have a two-toned look, with the outer display and cameras encased in a solid, glossy black glass rectangle.",
    "As expected, rumors disagree on some aspects of the new phone \u2013 for instance, a leak suggested the external screen would be 3 inches, which would be much larger than the 1.9-inch estimation of the GizNext leak.",
    "There are other exciting rumors, too, like one suggesting the Z Flip 3 could work with the multi-device Samsung S Pen stylus, which we just heard could be coming to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 traditional foldable as well. Given the main display isn\u2019t too large \u2013 purportedly the same 6.9-inch, super thin 25:9 ratio screen as its predecessor, per GizNext \u2013 we don\u2019t know how useful it would be to make the phone compatible with the accessory, but it\u2019s exciting to hear nonetheless.",
    "In any case, we\u2019ll likely hear more about how the foldable is shaping up as the rumored August release window nears, and get a clearer idea of how the device will improve on its predecessors and stay appealing in 2021.",
