  "article": [
    "FIFA 22 will feature an all-new technology dubbed \u2018HyperMotion\u2019 that promises to overhaul the game\u2019s animation system, AI, and aerial duels \u2013 and it\u2019s only available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Stadia.",
    "HyperMotion is a new gameplay technology that promises to revolutionize FIFA 22. It uses a combination of real-time motion capture, as 22 professional footballers took to the pitch wearing Xsens suits that allowed EA to record an \u201cunprecedented volume of high-quality real-human movement data\u201d, which powers how both individual players and teams move across FIFA 22.",
    "FIFA 22 then uses \u201ca cutting-edge proprietary machine learning algorithm\u201d which learns from over 8.7 million frames of capture footage, and creates new animations in real time to create \u201corganic football realism\u201d, according to EA\u2019s website.",
    "That\u2019s not all, though. The combination of HyperMotion and Xsens suit recordings mean FIFA 22 will feature over 4,000 new animations, which should result in a more responsive and physical-feeling experience when playing.",
    "These fancy new additions are only available on next-gen consoles and Stadia, as EA claims that the power of the new systems allows more tactical AI, which means attackers can make \u201cup to 6x more decisions per second\u201d \u2013 while the defensive AI has been rewritten so that teams act more as a unit, and even retain their shape when moving across the pitch.",
    "FIFA 22\u2019s should also significantly affect aerial duels, make controlling the ball more natural and fluid and add another layer of humanization to FIFA 22\u2019s players, with more ambient behavior being visible during matches.",
    "FIFA 22\u2019s HyperMotion technology sounds mighty impressive, then, but we\u2019ve seen these types of grand promises before. EA Sports has a habit of using impressive sounding buzzwords to hype up its releases, but the prospect of machine-learning and real professionals wearing Xsens suits has a lot of potential.",
    "Unfortunately for last-gen console owners, EA Sports has confirmed that FIFA 22 won\u2019t receive a free next-gen upgrade if they buy the standard edition of the game. Only the Ultimate Edition, which costs $99.99 / \u00a389.99, comes with Dual Entitlement.",
    "As found on EA\u2019s website (thanks, VGC): \u201cDual Entitlement is only available with the purchase of the FIFA 22 Ultimate Edition. The Standard Edition of FIFA 22 does not include Dual Entitlement,\u201d it explains.",
    "\u201cThat means if you purchase FIFA 22 Standard Edition on PS4 and upgrade to PS5 later, you would need to purchase the PS5 version of the game to play.\u201d",
    "FIFA 22 will be released on October 1, 2021 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Stadia and PC."
