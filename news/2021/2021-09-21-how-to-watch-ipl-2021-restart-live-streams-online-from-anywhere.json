    "The reigning champions may be lagging behind their rivals right now, but they've got the man of the moment, Jasprit Bumrah, in their corner. The fast bowler terrorised England over the summer, and has established himself as one of the best in all formats of the game.",

    "Among the big names unavailable are Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Adam Zampa, Jhye Richardson, Riley Meredith, Daniel Sams, Kane Richardson, Finn Allen, Scott Kuggeleijn."
