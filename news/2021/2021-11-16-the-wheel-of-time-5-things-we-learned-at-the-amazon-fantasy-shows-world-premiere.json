    "After months (nay, years) of excited fanfare, Amazon\u2019s big-budget fantasy show, The Wheel of Time, finally arrives on Prime Video this weekend.",
    "An adaptation of Robert Jordan\u2019s best-selling novel series, it follows the adventures of five youngsters as they battle evil forces in an unnamed world set simultaneously in the distant past and distant future of Earth. One of these teens is also thought to be the reincarnation of the Dragon, a powerful individual prophesied to either save mankind, or destroy it.",
    "All typical fantasy shenanigans, then. TechRadar got an early look at the show during its world premiere this week, so check out our spoiler-free review for more of our in-depth thoughts. For now, though, here are five things you should know about The Wheel of Time ahead of its November 19 release.",
    "Okay, this one might seem obvious, but headlines and conversations around The Wheel of Time have been quick to draw comparisons between Jordan\u2019s work and George R. R. Martin\u2019s rival fantasy series, which itself was made into a massively successful HBO TV show.",
    "Depending on your perspective, you\u2019ll be pleased to learn that these comparisons are, for the most part, superficial. Yes, The Wheel of Time is an expensive live-action series based on a sweeping collection of fantasy literature, but the similarities really stop there. While Game of Thrones is more focused on the political warfare of multiple houses \u2013 beyond its dragons, the show could, conceivably, be historically accurate \u2013 The Wheel of Time is far more deeply rooted in high fantasy. That means you can expect magic, witches and wizards in place of silver-tongued charlatans and incestuous siblings.",
    "If reductive comparisons are your thing, though, Amazon\u2019s series more closely resembles Peter Jackson\u2019s The Lord of the Rings trilogy \u2013 it\u2019s got orcs (here called trollocs), cutesy woodland villages and a full-on quest narrative, for a start. Once it gets going, contemporary influences like The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner bare their teeth in The Wheel of Time, too, as its band of likeable youngsters find themselves forced to navigate a series of hostile environments.",
    "Those worried that the show\u2019s high fantasy would equate to a low body count need not fear. The Wheel of Time is really, really violent \u2013 but in a good way (you know what we mean). In the first two episodes alone, we\u2019re treated (or subject?) to decapitations, severed limbs, gargled blood and burning flesh. Hell, in one scene, our hero literally regurgitates a bat.",
    "This level of blood and gore won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, of course, but we felt it provided a nice contrast to \u2013 and added to the reality of \u2013 the sillier elements of the story. As the stakes get higher in the show\u2019s later episodes, too, we expect the deaths to get even more gruesome.",
    "In the violence department, then: yes, The Wheel of Time is comparable to Game of Thrones (are you happy now?).",
    "Beyond Rosamund Pike, who plays Aes Sedai Moiraine in the show, most of The Wheel of Time\u2019s cast are relative newcomers. There are a handful of familiar faces, Sophie Okonedo and Michael McElhatton among them (the latter, incidentally, starred as Roose Bolton in Game of Thrones). But its quartet of youngsters, who occupy the lion\u2019s share of screen time, are, indeed, young adults \u2013 which is to its credit.",
    "Josha Stradowski, Madeleine Madden, Zoe Robins, Barney Harris and Marcus Rutherford \u2013 performers who hail from all over the world \u2013 add a real authenticity to the strife of The Wheel of Time's central characters, and they\u2019re not hamstrung by the familiarity of roles they\u2019ve played elsewhere. Each will undoubtedly offer a different type of performance as the show moves along, but as confused teens grappling with the weight of expectation, they\u2019re a perfect fit.",
    "Side note: if an unfortunate fate should befall Hayden Christensen on the set of Disney\u2019s Obi-Wan Kenobi series, Stradowski could step in as Anakin and no one would notice the change.",
    "Like those Game of Thrones comparisons, much has been of the eye-watering budget Amazon spent \u2013 and continues to spend \u2013 on The Wheel of Time. Reports suggest season 1 cost the studio upwards of $10 million per episode (there are eight in total), with the total bill coming to just shy of $100 million.",
    "Sure, Amazon set aside $250 million just for the rights to its upcoming Lord of the Rings series, but $10 million an episode is no small change for a multi-season adaptation of a relatively unfamiliar IP (filming on season 2 is currently underway).",
    "Luckily, the expenditure pays dividends. Sweeping shots of the mountainous Czech Republic could give David Lowery\u2019s The Green Knight a run for its money, and the show\u2019s costumes, sets and visual effects are up there with the best in the business. We weren\u2019t overly fond of the skittish camerawork and squint-inducing lighting in an early battle sequence, but that\u2019s a crime committed by many big-budget historical productions, these days.",
    "Perhaps the most impressive element of The Wheel of Time, though, is its accessibility. For those going into its first episode with next to no knowledge of the source material, the show does a great job of translating the most crucial parts of Robert Jordan\u2019s story onto the screen, and new audiences will find as much to admire here as those who\u2019ve waited years to see his sprawling vision brought to life.",
    "Unfamiliar viewers looking for a grounded and intricate political epic may come out of this one disappointed, but The Wheel of Time will undoubtedly prove a journey worth taking for old school fantasy fans \u2013 as well as those who just can\u2019t wait for The Witcher season 2.",
    "The Wheel of Time's first three episodes launch exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, November 19."
