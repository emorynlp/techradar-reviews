  "article": [
    "After Nintendo threw its latest curveball at the world with the surprise announcement of the Nintendo Switch OLED, sometimes it feels almost impossible to predict what the Kyoto-based company will do next. Multiple reports pointed towards the reveal of a Nintendo Switch Pro, one that would bring the console\u2019s games into the world of 4K for the very first time, But as we should have expected by now, this wasn\u2019t the case.",
    "Nintendo had its own ideas for the next Nintendo Switch model, and rather than address genuine problems like Joy-Con drift, improve the console\u2019s graphical performance and increase battery life, we were instead presented with a modest upgrade of the original Switch.",
    "While it\u2019s Nintendo\u2019s sheer unpredictability that makes the company so special as a platform holder, it can also lead to untold frustration when the \u201cBig N\u201d stubbornly refuses to do what can often seem like the obvious thing. Sometimes its blue ocean strategy can lead to unprecedented success, like with the Wii. While at other times, we can\u2019t help but wish Nintendo would take the easy option.",
    "So figuring out which direction Nintendo will go next isn\u2019t easy. That\u2019s why we put our most pressing questions to a Magic 8-Ball, a fountain of knowledge and someone who will always provide a \u201cyes or no\u201d answer. The outcomes are just as obscure (and hilarious) as you might expect.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Most Likely",
    "We couldn\u2019t be happier with this answer. The recently announced Nintendo Switch OLED model was not the 4K Nintendo console we let ourselves believe was out there, but it sounds like the Nintendo Switch Pro might still be on its way.",
    "Unfortunately the wise Magic 8-Ball has kept us in the dark about what specs we could expect from the Nintendo Switch Pro. Many suspect the handheld will sport a full-HD OLED display, with the Switch Pro able to produce a 4K image while docked. It would likely have a more powerful processor too, and could even use Nvidia DLSS-like technology to boost its framerate. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Very doubtful",
    "Well, this has thrown us a bit. The Nintendo Switch has been widely successful because of its adaptability of being a home console and a portable system in one. But could Nintendo return to having a dedicated device that sits underneath your television? We\u2019ve seen Nintendo release the Nintendo Switch Lite to address those who only play handheld, and the Nintendo Switch OLED doesn\u2019t do anything to improve the experience when playing in TV mode \u2013 much to the annoyance of many \u2013 so maybe the idea of Nintendo creating a dedicated home console again isn\u2019t as far fetched as it first seemed.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Don\u2019t count on it",
    "This is probably one we could have answered on our own. While the Nintendo Switch has experienced incredible popularity since its launch, there are actually a couple of Nintendo consoles ahead of it in terms of sales right now. There\u2019s the Wii at roughly 101 million units sold, the beloved home console that introduced us all to motion controls (and terrible plastic peripherals), and above that we have the Nintendo DS (and its family of handheld offspring) at 154 million units sold.",
    "If the Nintendo Switch wants to take the top spot it\u2019ll need to roughly double its current sales figures (currently at 84.59 million units). The Magic 8-Ball doesn\u2019t believe the hybrid console can do it, and we\u2019d be inclined to agree.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: As I see it, yes",
    "Honestly, we\u2019re surprised this hasn\u2019t happened already. As it stands, the only Switch that comes with a dedicated D-Pad is the Nintendo Switch Lite, and that really shouldn\u2019t be the case. While we understand why Nintendo adopts face buttons for the directional pad on the left Joy-Con, there\u2019s no excuse why consumers haven\u2019t been offered a standalone controller that comes with a D-Pad. For a company that creates so many superb platformers, it would be nice to have this option on the regular Switch and Switch OLED.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Better not tell you now",
    "Playing coy with us, Magic 8-Ball? We understand - leaks always ruin the rush that comes with a surprise announcement, and for fans of F-Zero a new game reveal would be a moment they don\u2019t want spoiled. F-Zero: Climax, a Japanese exclusive, was the last game in the series to be released (it came out in 2004). 17 years later and we haven\u2019t yet had any sign that a new F-Zero will be released, with the series only making cameo appearances in the Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros. games.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Outlook good We really hope the Magic 8-Ball is right on this one. It\u2019s been an exorbitant amount of time since we last had a new Mario Kart entry, and considering that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was a spruced up version of the Wii U game, Mario Kart 9 feels long overdue. It\u2019s not like we really need more powerful hardware, either, as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe still looks glorious running on the Switch, but new tracks, characters and a fresh new gimmick would be really appreciated.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Most likely",
    "Many of you out there love to hate the Wii U, but the Magic 8-Ball has spoken. We always knew the console was misunderstood, and it\u2019s nice to finally have our feelings vindicated.",
    "The Wii U GamePad was an incredible controller, as the dual-screen experience was unlike anything a home console has ever offered before or since. And who can forget the games themselves? The Wii U\u2019s games were all so brilliant that many of them have now been remastered for the Switch so that fans don\u2019t miss out on their excellence. Writing this just makes us want to dig out that dusty console and give it another play.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Yes",
    "With the Magic 8-Ball delivering a clear and unwavering answer, we\u2019re confident that Nintendo will announce Zelda as a playable in Breath of the Wild 2, something which fans have been asking for. It\u2019s great to finally have confirmation after many months of speculation, and the decision makes sense. It is her legend after all, and being able to choose another character over the famously mute Link would only help make the game more appealing.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: You may rely on it",
    "Interesting, Magic 8-Ball, very interesting. Wii Sports was able to plant itself in the top spot because it came packaged with nearly every Wii console ever sold. That means it had a staggeringly high adoption rate that Nintendo hasn\u2019t been able to match since. We\u2019re going to guess the Magic 8-Ball\u2019s declaration means Nintendo will one day include a game with its consoles again. When that time comes, it also sounds like it\u2019ll have created an incredibly popular console; let\u2019s just hope the pack-in game is good.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Very doubtful",
    "Ok, maybe this was an easier prediction than we thought. Yes, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that Nintendo will ever merge with either Microsoft or Sony \u2013 though during the dark days of the Wii U, many believed this would be in the best interests of Nintendo moving forward. And while the idea of having Nintendo\u2019s often impeccable software on either the Xbox Series X or PS5 is certainly appealing, it\u2019s important to remember that the reason Nintendo\u2019s first-party output excels, is because they\u2019re designed around the hardware the company creates.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: Yes",
    "You heard it here first folks, the Magic 8-Ball has spoken and its words are clear. For many of us this is excellent news, though we will hold a moment of silence for all the dreams that have just been crushed by this proclamation.",
    "The game\u2019s director, Masahiro Sakurai, has confirmed multiple times that the next DLC fighter will be Smash Ultimate\u2019s last. If you were hoping for a character other than Waluigi, we\u2019re sorry to say they won\u2019t be joining the battle this time. But hey, at least the character won\u2019t be another sword fighter.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: My sources say no",
    "To be honest, we should have expected this... and we\u2019re not sure what sort of compensation would even make up for the pain we felt all those years ago. The blow of losing a Mewtwo in a freak transfer cable accident still hurts, but at least we finally have some closure on this traumatic event. Thanks, Magic 8-Ball, we can now start to heal.",
    "Magic 8-Ball says: As I see it, yes",
    "Sorry Tingle, but looks like you\u2019ve Kooloo\u2019d your last Limpah. Get outta Zelda ya\u2019 strange man; the Magic 8-Ball has spoken."
