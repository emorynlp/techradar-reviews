    "Microsoft's a Halo Infinite campaign overview took place on October 25, at 6 AM PT / 2 PM BST / 3 PM CEST / 9 AM ET, giving fans a long awaited look at the refreshed campaign after the initial showing garnered a fair amount of criticism.",
    "Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign mode hadn\u2019t been shown since August 11, 2020, where it received a mostly negative response from players due to its lackluster visuals. The reaction, along with the effects of the pandemic, ultimately led to Halo Infinite being delayed from its original launch date of November 10, 2020, to December 8, 2021.",
    "While the graphics might not have impressed everyone (and led to the discovery of Craig), the onscreen action itself looked rather fun. It was the first time we saw Master Chief\u2019s new grappling hook in action, which is a blast to use in Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer mode, as well as some of the game\u2019s new weapons like the VK78 Commando.",
    "During the fresh new look at the campaign, we got to see more of Master Chief\u2019s new fearsome foe The Banished, who first appeared in Halo Wars 2, alongside a refreshingly more polished look at the campaign overall. The live event has since concluded, but if you need to catch up, read below on how you can do just that.",
    "The Halo Infinite campaign overview aired at 6 AM PT / 2 PM BST / 3 PM CEST/ 9 AM ET on October 25, and is now available to watch via Xbox\u2019s YouTube channel, which we\u2019ve embedded below for your convenience.",
    "The overview wasn't terribly long, lasting just shy of 6 and a half minutes, but it was certainly packed with all the action and atmosphere we've come to expect from a mainline Halo title. We were suitably impressed to say the least, and certainly more excited for the campaign than we previously were.",
    "There\u2019s no doubt that Halo Infinite\u2019s delay took the shine off Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S console launch, but it appears that the delay has done 343 Industries\u2019 game the world of good. The game\u2019s multiplayer, which is free-to-play for the first time in the series\u2019 history, has been extremely well-received, but questions remain about Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign mode.",
    "The new campaign overview trailer somewhat assuaged fears that the game\u2019s single player component isn\u2019t in good shape. We know that both the campaign and multiplayer modes for Halo Infinite will launch on the same date, which some speculated wouldn\u2019t be the case.",
    "If developer 343 Industries can deliver a memorable Halo campaign, and the multiplayer continues on its promising trajectory, there\u2019s no doubt that Halo Infinite could be one of the biggest games of the year and a huge boon for Microsoft during the holiday season.",
    "Halo Infinite is set to release on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 8, 2021. It will be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers for free on day one."
