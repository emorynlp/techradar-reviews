  "article": [
    "Superhero-led TV series have been more of a rarity on Netflix recently. The successful adaptation of The Umbrella Academy aside, productions centered on superpowered people have been scarce on Netflix since it canceled the last of its interconnected Marvel TV shows in February 2019 - the odd exception like Melissa McCarthy's critically-panned Thunder Force aside.",
    "As rival superhero shows, including Amazon\u2019s The Boys and Disney Plus\u2019 WandaVision, pull in large viewing figures, Netflix required its own superhero universe. Purchasing Millarworld - writer Mark Millar\u2019s comic empire - in August 2017 was Netflix\u2019s attempt to muscle in on the increasingly congested superhero market, and its first TV offering is now ready to take flight.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy is Netflix\u2019s next post-Marvel superhero endeavour and, judging by its first season, it\u2019s a real contender. Jupiter\u2019s Legacy offers a fresh take on the established superhero formula with an unusual setting and unique characters, and does so without discarding what has made other superhero live-action adaptations so popular.",
    "Based on the comics created by Millar and Frank Quitley, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy tells the story of the Union, the world\u2019s first superhero group.",
    "After a century of protecting humanity, the Union\u2019s remaining members - the Utopian (Josh Duhamel), Lady Liberty (Leslie Bibb), Brainwave (Ben Daniels) and The Flare (Mike Wade) - struggle to hand over their responsibilities to their unprepared superpowered children.",
    "As the next generation similarly wrestles with their parents\u2019 high standards and legendary reputations, tensions arise between the groups - and it isn\u2019t long before loyalties are truly tested when a seemingly unsolvable mystery threatens to ignite a superhero civil war.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy isn\u2019t your typical superhero origins story. Yes, the series reveals how the Union came into possession of their abilities, but it doesn\u2019t do so formulaically. This part of the series is told in flashbacks, which take place around The Great Depression, and are intertwined with present day events across season 1\u2019s eight episodes.",
    "The world of Jupiter\u2019s Legacy, then, differs from Marvel, DC and other superhero movies and TV shows that audiences have become accustomed to. It\u2019s more \u2018What if Superman and Wonder Woman had kids but didn\u2019t trust them to follow in their footsteps?\u2019, rather than showing the duo at the peak of their powers. It\u2019s a distinctive angle on superheroes that, like Zack Snyder\u2019s take on Batman, shows that even superheroes can become world weary after years of fighting for the common good.",
    "While Jupiter\u2019s Legacy tells the story of its first heroes decades into their careers, it doesn\u2019t overlook themes that\u2019ll be familiar to viewers. Legacy, family and culpability are just some of the topics that the series covers, and they\u2019ll resonate with audiences regardless of its superhero slant.",
    "If there\u2019s one main problem with Jupiter\u2019s Legacy\u2019s established universe, though, it\u2019s that it throws viewers into the deep end when it comes to character introductions and setting up story threads.",
    "The series feels comic book-esque in its structuring, particularly with how its modern day events are spliced together with flashbacks, and it should be commended for that approach. This is a TV show based on a comic series, after all, so anything that harkens back to the source material\u2019s panel structure is a welcome one.",
    "Still, it\u2019s likely that many viewers won\u2019t have read, or even be aware of, Millar and Quitley\u2019s original works. The first couple of episodes may feel like a whirlwind for the uninitiated, with numerous characters introduced and a modern day plot that\u2019s pretty breathless. Things settle down as the series progresses but, even then, it can be difficult to keep track of Jupiter\u2019s Legacy\u2019s many locations - it might\u2019ve been helpful to put location names on screen - and individuals.",
    "That\u2019s especially true of its supporting cast. Most are provided with little screen time and, in some cases, superheroes are introduced in a specific scene and then never seen in the series again. True, there needs to be a balance between moving the story forward and presenting these side characters to audiences in order to flesh out the world. However, it\u2019s tough to feel for these individuals during emotional or perilous moments when you can\u2019t remember who they are, or whether they\u2019re meant to be good or bad.",
    "If the initial story or character introductions are hard to follow, what about the action? Jupiter\u2019s Legacy\u2019s set-pieces are good if not especially breathtaking, and do a fine job of exhibiting each hero or villain\u2019s unique abilities.",
    "Fights are punchy and to the point, so don\u2019t expect any third act Marvel or DC battles here. There\u2019s one lengthy fight in the first episode, which feels like Infinity War\u2019s Avengers vs. Thanos brawl, that\u2019s expertly choreographed and examines the ramifications of being a superpowered being.",
    "It\u2019s a shame, then, that this is the biggest and best fight in the series. While other showdowns make for fun watches, they feel more like skirmishes than physically demanding bouts. Sure, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy is primarily a drama, so its action is always going to be secondary, but a couple of extra set-piece moments would\u2019ve been nice to see.",
    "Accompanying its action, the show\u2019s CGI elements are largely fantastic. There are a few moments in later episodes where the use of blue or green screen technology is noticeable, but thankfully these aren\u2019t because of the superhero VFX portions. The transition from practical to superhero ability visuals is also seamless and, while that should be expected of a tentpole Netflix production, it\u2019s pleasing to see the mark being hit.",
    "The series\u2019 cast are generally marvellous, too. Jupiter\u2019s Legacy\u2019s main actors do a fine job of portraying how their individual characters are weighed down by varying expectations, with Duhamel particularly captivating as a disillusioned Superman-Captain America hybrid.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy positions itself in an intriguing space in the superhero genre. In telling a story that focuses on the twilight years of the world\u2019s most beloved superheroes, it stands apart from similar movie and TV properties. It\u2019s a welcome change, too, from the usual origin stories that audiences already know, even though it still feels familiar in a few ways.",
    "There are missteps in earlier episodes but those flaws, lack of large-scale action and character introductions aside, are ironed out as the series progresses. Once they are, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy reaches its full potential with its morally questionable characters, smart plot and philosophical themes. If a second season is forthcoming, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy could be the answer to Netflix\u2019s post-Marvel TV show prayers.",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy season 1 is now available to stream exclusively on Netflix."
