    "There are few people boxing fans would rather see knocked out than Jake Paul, but there's no denying that he's surpassed expectations in the early stages of his fighting career. That said, the undefeated YouTube star hasn't faced anybody anywhere near the caliber of former UFC champ Tyron Woodley, who's in intimidating shape. Can The Chosen One give the Problem Child a spanking? Read on as we explain how to live stream Jake Pauls vs Tyron Woodley, and watch no matter where you happen to be in the world today.",
    "Of course, boxing is a completely different kettle of fish to UFC, and the 39-year-old has seen better days, having ended his UFC career with four defeats on the bounce. But Woodley is a physical specimen and he's certainly not short of punching power - it was a jaw-rattling right hook that catapulted him to UFC glory five years ago.",
    "Paul, naturally, thinks he's the more powerful man, having knocked down Woodley's friend Ben Askren in the opening round of his last fight. But Askren was seriously out of shape and many onlookers thought the referee stepped in far too early.",
    "We've got a cracking undercard to look forward to too, as Amanda Serrano defends her WBC, WBO, IBO World Featherweight titles against Yamileth Mercado, and Daniel Dubois and Tommy Fury also in action.",
    "Love it or hate it, it's going to be a spectacle, that's for sure. Here's all you need to know about how to watch a Jake Paul vs Tyron Woodley live stream.",
    "As we say, PPV platforms have this wrapped up pretty much everywhere. But if you're abroad and discover that your coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that is showing the fight.",
    "The software is generally ideal for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream boxing from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "Jake Paul is the 24-year-old younger brother of Logan Paul, each of whom rose to fame through social media.",
    "He first gained a following on Vine, before expanding to YouTube and joining the cast of Disney Channel series Bizaardvark, from which he was later fired.",
    "He's resorted to increasingly extreme and controversial measures to further increase his profile, the latest of which is an extremely lucrative - and often farcical - fledgling boxing career.",
    "After initially serving as little more than a support act for his older brother, Jake Paul has become by far the more successful fighter, and has beaten fellow YouTubers Deji Olatunji and AnEsonGib, as well as former basketball player Nate Robinson and former Bellator champion Ben Askren.",
    "Tyron Woodley is a 39-year-old former UFC champion, who bowed out of the Octagon when his contract ended earlier this year.",
    "The reigning welterweight champion for nearly three years, Woodley ended his UFC career on a low note, with four consecutive defeats.",
    "Unlike his good friend Ben Askren, Woodley's known to pack a powerful punch, which was best demonstrated in his knockout of Robbie Lawler on the night he won the welterweight title."
