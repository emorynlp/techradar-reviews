    "A decade ago, I met my first playersexual character in Choice of the Vampire: Clotho. Clotho is an African voodoo priestess in 1800s New Orleans, who fell in love with the spunky vampire lady I was controlling. As a queer teen, I was delighted Clotho wanted to date a woman. But when I replayed the game as a male player character, I realized her dialogue was the same. Clotho doesn\u2019t love your vampire, in all their debonair or bloodthirsty or compassionate choice-based glory; she loves the thing marked \u2018Player Character\u2019, regardless of gender. That\u2019s what it means to be playersexual.",
    "That choice was\u2026 fine. For one character. For one game. In the real world, bisexuality means being attracted to genders like your own and different to your own; it\u2019s a sexuality that\u2019s up to each individual to define for themselves. But when the gender-blind, sexuality-agnostic version of player-focused bisexuality becomes gaming\u2019s default queer inclusion, it gets old fast. Games still largely imagine a world where heterosexuality is the norm, and bisexuality is an afterthought \u2013 a way for developers to make queer players feel included without having to do any of the legwork to make it feel authentic.",
    "Instead of an identity, bisexuality in games is a mechanic. If you can date, why not let you date anyone? It stops players from getting mad that their favorite character is locked behind an incompatible orientation, and it\u2019s easy to use the same dialog for everyone. But this view of bisexuality is hollow; it makes characters feel less alive if they like the player, no matter what. Playersexuality makes every relationship identical \u2013 and that makes all of them feel less special.",
    "Bisexuality, both in real life and as portrayed in media, is often misunderstood and reduced to damaging stereotypes. The first bad trope is \u2019depraved bisexual\u2019. Bisexuals are portrayed as undiscerning, omnivorous creatures full of lust. They might be greedy or promiscuous, dating multiple people at once or \u2018putting out\u2019 immediately. They might be involved in a threesome, or have way too much focus on their sex lives. Sometimes, that depravity becomes plain evil: it\u2019s suggested that bi characters are really gay or straight, so being bisexual is itself a deception that marks a character as untrustworthy or traitorous.",
    "Some of these negative tropes turn up in Fire Emblem Fates (2015), a game that\u2019s ostensibly about tactical warfare but which happens to have a deep relationship system. There are two playersexual characters in this: they can date a main character of either gender, but are otherwise exclusively straight. One of them, Rhajat, is a heavily sexualized dark mage who displays stalker-like behavior towards the main character regardless of gender, and remains obsessed with them even if she marries someone else. The other, Niles, is a sadistic rogue, whose omnidirectional flirting is a sign of his villainy: he\u2019ll hit on anyone, while threatening to torture them for fun. Both fit the \u2018depraved bisexual\u2019 stereotype, with their attraction to multiple genders used to highlight their moral ambiguity.",
    "The second bisexual flavor is \u2019not really bisexual\u2019. These characters might mention that they\u2019re bisexual, but are only even shown as being attracted to one gender. Or maybe they\u2019ll just never address their sexuality, so it seems out of the blue when a burly divorced man suddenly admits he has feelings for a handsome hunk but doesn\u2019t feel the need to comment on its novelty.",
    "In video games, characters who have heterosexual options save for the player character can feel like this: they\u2019re clearly supposed to be straight, but the power of being a protagonist makes that not matter. Crucially, in-game bisexuals never talk about being bi: they have no community, no reflection, no coming to terms with suddenly falling for someone else or discussion of when they first realized they weren\u2019t straight. Maybe there\u2019s no homophobia or biphobia to contend with, but there\u2019s also no queer joy or exploration.",
    "Fire Emblem: Three Houses (2019) is filled with characters who are straight. There are half a dozen playersexual characters, and another handful who can romance a specific partner (for example, a female main character can\u2019t date Catherine or Shamir, two powerful women knights, but those knights can end up with each other). However, you wouldn\u2019t know there were so many bisexuals running around, because all of them have far more straight relationship options than queer ones. And none of these queer characters ever talk to each other, even in passing, about their common ground of not being straight. Dorothea, who can end up with four women, has eight men she can marry. Though the game doesn\u2019t try and push specific romances for anyone, it seems that even the queerest characters are designed to be erring heterosexuali: straight, with limited exceptions. This shallow view of queerness \u2013 treating it as essentially identical to heterosexuality \u2013 means that bisexuality feels like an afterthought.",
    "Playersexuality is not necessarily a bad choice \u2013 it\u2019s just a bit lazy. But it\u2019s definitely an improvement from the olden days of no representation at all. Take the classic farming game Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town (2003), where you played as a male farmer and could romance five village bachelorettes. If you wanted to date a boy (or play as a woman), you had to buy a whole other cartridge.",
    "Cut to a decade later, and there are two games both based on that title that have queer options: Stardew Valley (2016) and Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town (2020). That progress is real, and worth celebrating. The farming sim genre often emphasizes completion; completing all of the romance events is just like growing all the crops. Dating everyone just means more content to explore.",
    "However, while Stardew Valley is a truly playersexual game, as it lets you date anyone \u2013 Leah the sculptor, Elliott the writer, Abigail the goth, Sebastian the loner \u2013 it uses the same dialog for straight or queer romances.",
    "This means there\u2019s no difference in how these characters approach you, or relate to you, or reveal their feelings for you. Elliott, for example, reads as a flamboyant dandy: what if he struggled to articulate his feelings for a woman, because he was used to being perceived exclusively as gay? Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if, in the same story events, Abigail bro\u2019d down with a boy but got tongue-tied talking to a girl?",
    "Despite the town\u2019s universally bisexual 20-somethings, the inhabitants are all hinted to have straight crushes. Leah and Elliott are implied to have feelings for each other, as are Abigail and Sebastian. If the player hadn\u2019t shown up in the village, there\u2019d be no organic queerness there at all. (Leah is sort of an exception: her ex, Kel, who is always the same gender as the player character, briefly appears.)",
    "Story of Seasons takes those crushes a step further. All the villagers are split into straight couples whose relationships actually progress if you\u2019re not chasing those romances. There are \u2018rival\u2019 events, which play out vignettes from slow-burning romances between heterosexual pairs. This adds some internal life to the characters, making them more than just objects of affection waiting to be wooed.",
    "Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age Inquisition both did a similar thing in terms of letting romance options woo each other \u2013 but in DA, you couldn\u2019t romance both parties and still have them develop feelings for each other. In Story of Seasons, nobody seems to notice if you\u2019ve seduced all 12 eligible millennials.",
    "Bisexual people come in all shapes and stripes. Some of us are more attracted to people of the same gender but don\u2019t want to discount any possibilities. Some of us are truly in-the-middle disasters with equal-opportunity heartbreak policies. Some of us only have opposite-sex relationships because it\u2019s easier to understand straight romantic cues in a world that invalidates queerness. And there\u2019s more nuance in between all of these \u2013 bisexuality is so broad and varied that you can\u2019t reduce it to a single experience. All of these are valid expressions of bisexuality, and it sucks that games almost invariably represent us with a straight-until-proven-otherwise playersexual.",
    "So what does better bisexual representation look like? I want something that doesn\u2019t play into damaging tropes; that recognizes bisexuality as varied rather than monolithic; and that lets characters connect with their fellow queer pixel-people. Bisexuals don\u2019t have to spend all their in-game dialog lusting after people of multiple genders to be authentically bisexual; they just need interest beyond the player.",
    "That isn\u2019t to say all games get bisexuality wrong. Indie games often take the lead when it comes to LGBTQ+ content, and bisexual representation is no exception. Dating sim Dream Daddy (2017) has you play as a dad dating other dads, but some of them (including potentially the player character) have dated women in the past, and it\u2019s not a big deal.",
    "That\u2019s significant, because bi men are rarely acknowledged at all in the media or real life \u2013 they\u2019re often victims of bisexual erasure, the assumption that they\u2019re either really straight or gay, and are constantly asked to prove their identity is valid; having bisexuality be accepted in such a low-key way makes for positive representation. Night In The Woods (2017) also has some very casual representation: the main character, Mae, when asked about her dream date, says \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a guy or a girl\u201d. She has also been confirmed to be pansexual by artist Scott Benson. Mae never says \u2018pansexual\u2019 or \u2018queer\u2019 in the game \u2013 but as a 20-year-old still figuring things out, that feels true to her character.",
    "Conversely, the Monster Prom series (2018-) makes its world one of high-octane bi representation. The characters are magnified caricatures of high-school tropes who feel larger than life, expressing attraction to each other without the player having to prompt them, and are omni-horny as part of their ebulliently chaotic personalities. While this kind of everything-that-moves bisexuality representation can be damaging, Monster Prom is clearly aware of this trope, and celebrates the joy and camaraderie that rampant ambi-directional lust can bring. It\u2019s deliberately silly and tongue-in-cheek, which feels very queer.",
    "Obviously, bisexuality isn\u2019t the only kind of queerness we want from games. But when playersexual, straight-coded characters are given to us as the primary form of queer representation, it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask for more. Give us more queer creators writing more queer characters. Give us more bisexuals who are in loving, committed relationships, and who don\u2019t just want to date the player character. Give us someone who just wears a bi pride flag as a shirt and actively identifies as \u2018bisexual\u2019 rather than \u2018not interested in labels\u2019. Just give us something more."
