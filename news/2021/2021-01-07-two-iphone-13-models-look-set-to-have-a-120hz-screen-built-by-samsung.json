  "article": [
    "We\u2019re a long, long way out from the likely September launch of the iPhone 13 range, but we\u2019re already quite confident about one feature the range will offer, namely a screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.",
    "Or rather, the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max will probably have such a display, as it has already been repeatedly rumored, most recently by The Elec, which claims that Samsung will be the sole supplier of screens for these models.",
    "The site claims that these two models will use LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) OLED screens that can run at up to 120Hz, while the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini will have LTPS (low-temperature polycrystalline silicon) OLED panels, much like the iPhone 12 range does.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that LTPO isn\u2019t required for a 120Hz refresh rate, but the tech is more power efficient, and allows for an adaptive refresh rate without extra hardware. So while The Elec doesn\u2019t mention what refresh rate the two cheaper models will have, it\u2019s likely to be 60Hz, like all current iPhones.",
    "The move to a higher refresh rate can make interactions feel smoother, but it\u2019s harsher on the battery, hence a display that\u2019s more power efficient is advantageous.",
    "The Elec adds that all four iPhone 14 models (or whatever the 2022 range is called) will apparently have an LTPO OLED screen, but that Apple won\u2019t be purely reliant on Samsung for the panels by then, with LG apparently supplying some.",
    "While we\u2019d still take the rumored upgrade to 120Hz with a pinch of salt \u2013 especially as a number of the leaks pointing in that direction have come from just one source \u2013 it certainly looks like one of the more likely iPhone 13 range upgrades we're hearing of.",
    "It\u2019s been a long time coming too, as the Samsung Galaxy S20, OnePlus 8T, and a number of other Android phones already have 120Hz screens. It\u2019s an upgrade that can make a notable difference, but with LTPO panels reportedly taking around two weeks longer to produce than LTPS ones \u2013 and likely costing more too \u2013 there\u2019s a worry that the iPhone 13 Pro could be even more expensive than the iPhone 12 Pro.",
