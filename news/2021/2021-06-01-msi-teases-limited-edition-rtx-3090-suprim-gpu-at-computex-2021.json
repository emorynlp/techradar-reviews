    "MSI is celebrating its 35th anniversary with a 'limited edition' upgrade to its RTX 3090 Suprim graphics card.",
    "The company teased the MSI GeForce RTX 30 Suprim 35th Anniversary Edition during the firm\u2019s Computex showcase, where the company confirmed the souped-up GPU would be launching as a limited edition product.",
    "Details about the graphics card remain thin, though MSI has confirmed that the GPU will feature its new Tri Frozr 2S cooling solution and will be powered by triple 8-pin power connectors delivering at least 350W of power.",
    "Most of the new features are aesthetic, however, with the shroud and backplate on the RTX 30 Suprim 35th Anniversary Edition featuring renders of previous MSI graphics cards.",
    "\u201cEngraved in the backplate is sketched outlines of past generations that have contributed to our company\u2019s experience and knowledge,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis anniversary edition graphics card is built upon the Suprim series foundation and retains all the same key features.\u201d",
    "While MSI didn\u2019t confirm which RTX 30-series GPU the card will be based on, the NV Link connector all but confirms it\u2019ll arrive as an upgrade to MSI\u2019s highest-spec RTX 3090 Suprim graphics card.",
    "Given its \u201climited edition\u201d status, the RTX 30 Suprim 35th Anniversary Edition - like most of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 30-series graphics cards - will likely be available in short supply at launch. MSI has yet to confirm pricing and availability details.",
    "This isn\u2019t the only new RTX 30-series GPU to debut at Computex, as Nvidia also used this year\u2019s virtual showcase to launch its long rumored RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti graphics cards.",
    "Both GPUs offer noticeable upgrades over their predecessors, with the RTX 3080 Ti boasting 12GB of GDDR6X memory up from 10GB and the RTX 3070 Ti getting an upgrade from GDDR6 to GDDR6X. According to Nvidia, both new cards will offer 1.5x better performance compared to their previous-gen counterparts."
