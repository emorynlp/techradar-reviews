    "Your HBO Max subscription could be getting cheaper if you don\u2019t mind watching advertisements, AT&T announced today.",
    "Previously AT&T (owners of WarnerMedia, which in turn owns HBO and HBO Max) announced that it would bring the service to 60 new countries in June \u2013 and when that happens, AT&T will also launch a cheaper ad-supported price tier, according to information obtained by The Verge.",
    "So what\u2019s the catch? Well, you won\u2019t be able to watch cinema releases the same day as they launch in theaters like you can with the full service. What that means, essentially, is that you\u2019ll be paying less to watch shows like Rick & Morty and Game of Thrones, but you\u2019ll be missing out on The Matrix 4 and Dune when they come to the full service and theaters later this year.",
    "As a consolation, however, you won\u2019t have to watch ads on first-party HBO content \u2013 e.g. TV shows like Game of Thrones, The Wire or The Sopranos. And there is always the chance that the movies will be available on the service sometime after the launch, too.",
    "Unfortunately, AT&T didn\u2019t disclose how much the new service is going to cost, nor did it give an exact launch date for the new tier.",
    "Traditionally, ad-supported services come in at half the cost of their ad-free counterparts (here in the US, Hulu costs $5.99 for the ad-free version and $11.99 for ad-free) so it\u2019s likely that the new tier for HBO Max will be under $10 given its base price of $14.99 per month. How much it will cost outside of the US in any one of the 60 new countries, however, is anyone\u2019s guess.",
    "So should you subscribe now or hold off? Our advice: probably hold off, if you can.",
    "Because the service will be coming out in just a few months, it might be worth holding off on subscribing , especially if you wouldn\u2019t mind watching ads \u2013 and missing a few theatrical releases \u2013 for a lower price."
