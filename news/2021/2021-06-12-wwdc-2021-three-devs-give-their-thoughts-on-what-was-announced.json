  "article": [
    "Another year and another WWDC from Apple has concluded, with announcements for iOS 15, macOS 12 Monterey, iPadOS 15 and more.",
    "However, it also means the start of what developers can work with from these new announcements, and figuring out how they can implement these new features into their apps.",
    "We followed up with three developers we talked to from last week to find out what they were excited to hear about from WWDC the most.",
    "Shortened from the term \u2018Application Programming Interface\u2019, this is what developers use to create features for their applications. For example, a new ScreenTime API allows developers to have a choice of parental controls for users to pick from, while a GroupActivities allows the new SharePlay feature to be used in other applications as well.",
    "Ben McCarthy, developer of the camera app Obscura, tells us that while there was no Night Mode API, there were some great improvements to other areas. \u201cSwift Concurrency will result in cleaner code, buttons are easier to style, and In-App-Purchases are easier to handle.\u201d",
    "Becky Hansmeyer, the developer of YarnBuddy and Scribblet, also was in praise for Swift this year, the programming language introduced by Apple back in 2014. \u201cI was glad to see a lot of great additions to SwiftUI this year such as native search bars, better accessibility support, and new button styles. I was also really impressed by Object Capture, which allows designers and developers to create photorealistic 3D models by taking a series of photos of an object from every angle.,\u201d she explains.",
    "Shihab Mehboob, developer of Vinyls, Aviary and many more applications, is tempted to drop support for older iOS versions for his apps, as there\u2019s been substantial improvements to how he codes his suite of apps.",
    "\u201cI mentioned wanting new MusicKit APIs, and we got it! Although, it is just a reimagining of the previous Apple Music web API, and doesn\u2019t add anything new.\u201d he tells us. He\u2019s already added some new features to Vinyls and Aviary. \u201cShazamKit is great! I\u2019ve already added it into my app Vinyls to recognise external music and start playback of it within the app.\u201d",
    "This API allows the Shazam app to be built into apps with iOS 15 and above. There\u2019s also a new user interface function that\u2019s been added to Aviary. \u201cNew medium sized sheet detents are great! I\u2019ve already added them to Aviary for the photo picker.\u201d",
    "Finally, Shihab is very glad that Focus and Keyboard shortcuts API\u2019s are official. \u201cThese are incredible. This saves me so much work that I was planning to do, but now I don't have to. Again, added it to Aviary already, and it was a breeze to do so.\u201d",
    "While this year\u2019s update was more of a collection of useful refinements, it didn\u2019t stop Hansmeyer from being excited for the focus of privacy and work/life balance. \u201cI loved this focus, with a lot more customization surrounding notifications, Do Not Disturb, photo memories and more.\u201d She tells us. \u201cMy favorite feature though is actually Live Text. The ability to copy text, call a phone number, or look up an address from a photo is pretty mind-blowing.\u201d",
    "McCarthy was pleased to see part of his wish come true. \u201cWe did get a new sheet style of multi-stage cards, which work like the share sheet. It\u2019s not exactly what I envisioned but this is still a nice improvement.\u201d They explain. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great for things like Colour Pickers, allowing you to select a colour without covering what you were doing. Less interrupting. Nice.\u201d",
    "Mehboob is a big fan of the new look for Maps this year, telling me, \u201cThey\u2019re also very reminiscent of a Nintendo game, but I wish Apple focused more on bringing basics to other countries before going all-in on one region.\u201d",
    "He\u2019s also a big fan of the new Focus mode for notifications, alongside Live Text. \u201cWhilst it may have existed in other formats and flavours on other platforms already, it seems much more intuitive and quicker on iOS. Coupled with the Apple ecosystem, this is a great new feature to have.\u201d",
    "He\u2019s also glad to see SharePlay arrive, with many still unable to meet family and friends during the pandemic. \u201cSharePlay seems like a big win for the social (and pandemic) era! I wish this was something that existed a while back, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got it now. Also particularly useful for screen sharing with elder family members and helping them out.\u201d",
    "While multitasking and widgets were finally updated for the iPad, it was another refinement release here, but that didn\u2019t mean that Hansmeyer wasn\u2019t glad to finally see these features redesigned. \u201cBy far, the highlight of iPadOS 15 for me is the clarity of the multitasking system,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere's an obvious focus indicator for the active app, a set of real buttons and keyboard shortcuts for arranging apps on screen, and the ability to easily drag apps from anywhere to enter split screen or replace the current app.\u201d",
    "McCarthy agrees, explaining that multitasking is certainly better than how it was before.",
    "\u201cWe didn\u2019t get the multi-display support or customisable keyboard shortcuts, but the improvements to multitasking look superb. I think the iPad still has a way to go to get me to give up my laptop, but I\u2019m more optimistic than ever about its future.\u201d",
    "Mehboob was also in agreement with multitasking in iPadOS 15, explaining how they feel much more natural this time. \u201cThey\u2019re much easier to activate and use this time, and coupled with this, we\u2019ve finally got a shelf on iPad! (Although it\u2019s just for app windows within the app itself).\u201d He was also glad to see widgets on the home screen at last explaining, \u201cThe ability to place widgets anywhere on the Home Screen is a big win, and despite it coming at the cost of reshuffled icon layout and sizing, I think it\u2019s a welcome addition.\u201d",
    "Finally, he was quick to mention Quick Notes, a feature exclusive to the iPad. \u201cLaunching this from the bottom corner of the iPad display is very reminiscent of sticky notes on other platforms, and will be great for quickly jotting things down.\u201d",
    "Another refinement release for macOS this year, which isn\u2019t a surprise after last year\u2019s Big Sur release brought a redesigned user interface, and support for Apple Silicon chips. However, for developers, Apple was sure to dedicate part of Monday\u2019s keynote to them, announcing some big features.",
    "\u201cAfter last year's big redesign, I'm glad Apple went a little lighter on the new macOS features this year.\u201d Hansmeyer tells us. \u201cBut I\u2019m also excited because I got my two big wishes, Shortcuts and TestFlight on the Mac!\u201d",
    "While there wasn\u2019t a redesign of Notification Center in macOS, McCarthy was glad to see other updates in Monterey. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think there were any changes to the layout of Notification Center, there were at least lots of improvements to notifications themselves, helping to prioritise important messages and updates,\u201d they explained. \u201cThe new Focus features seem like they\u2019ll be great and I especially appreciate that they sync across devices.\u201d",
    "Mehboob was pleased to see Low Power Mode appear in both iPadOS and macOS Monterey, but it was Universal Control that caught his eye. \u201cThis blew my mind, and looks to be another great \u2018Apple ecosystem\u2019 addition which unifies all platforms.\u201d",
    "He was also in agreement with Hansmeyer about Shortcuts, telling us that \u201cHaving them on macOS is great! I\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re finally getting them there now, and slowly phasing out Automator.\u201d",
    "Finally, seeing AirPlay on the Mac was another good feature Mehboob was pleased to see, as \u201cBeing able to AirPlay to a Mac from an iPhone or an iPad is great! I think this is the closest we\u2019ll come to Target Display Mode now.\u201d",
    "A week on, the consensus from the developers we spoke to is that we did indeed see more refinements than anything else from Apple at this year\u2019s WWDC, with a big focus on notifications and privacy. While iPadOS 15 wasn\u2019t the huge improvement some were hoping for, it did finally bring widgets to the home screen properly, while TestFlight for Mac is a big win for developers in helping their apps be tested much more easily on macOS now.",
    "As we look back on WWDC this year, it looks as though Apple is giving developers more ways to give users better privacy and refined choices in how their information is shown. Time will tell whether future beta releases between now and September will show even more refinements, or even features that could disappear, but for a year of refinements, developers have a great pick n\u2019 mix bag of useful features to now implement in their apps."
