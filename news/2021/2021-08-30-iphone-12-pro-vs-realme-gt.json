    "The Realme GT is the latest in a line of largely unrelated phones that punch well above their weight, giving much larger brands a bloody nose in the process.",
    "With top notch performance at a low price tag and a shamelessly gaudy design, it\u2019s practically giving the iPhone 12 Pro the finger. The cheeky thing.",
    "But how does the Realme GT actually compare to Apple\u2019s current flagship model? Do we really think that the iPhone 12 Pro is more than twice the phone, or should we all start reconsidering what we pay for our pocket computers? Let\u2019s take a closer look at this fascinating face-off.",
    "The iPhone 12 Pro landed in shops on October 23, 2020. Prices start from $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699 for the 128GB model, before moving up to $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,899 for 256GB and $1,299 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,219 512GB.",
    "In the opposite corner, the Realme GT was officially released in March 2021 at a price of \u20ac449. That works out to roughly $550 / \u00a3390 / AU$710.",
    "These facts and figures highlight two things. One is that the Realme GT is about half the price of the iPhone 12 Pro. The other is that the Realme GT isn\u2019t universally available, and that you may have to go through an importer if you\u2019re in the UK, US, or Australia.",
    "Early points scored by both sides, then.",
    "These two phones come from very different places when it comes to design. Apple\u2019s take is suave, classy, understated, and to borrow a popular advertising slogan, \u2018reassuringly expensive\u2019. Realme\u2019s is big, bold, and in your face.",
    "The iPhone 12 Pro measures 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.4mm, which makes it considerably smaller than the Realme GT on 158.5 x 73.3 x 8.4mm. Despite this, the iPhone is also fractionally heavier at 189g versus the GT\u2019s 186g.",
    "It\u2019s not hard to see why the iPhone 12 Pro is so comparatively dense. Its body consists of a stainless steel frame, which is a notoriously heavy material. The Realme GT, by comparison, has a plastic frame and a glass or eco leather back.",
    "Both devices have glass rear panels, but the iPhone 12 Pro is heavier to the core.",
    "In terms of looks, the iPhone 12 Pro is flat and angular, with sober color options that include Silver, Graphite, Gold, and Pacific Blue. The Realme GT is rounded, and comes in a garish gold finish, as well as silver and black alternatives.",
    "Around front, Realme goes with the tried and tested hole punch selfie camera approach, while Apple sticks with its display notch. The latter is more intrusive, but it also enables Face ID authentication. The Realme GT has to rely on an in-display fingerprint sensor, which is less advanced.",
    "The design differences continue, with the iPhone 12 Pro packing IP68 water and dust resistance. The Realme has nothing to compare.",
    "What the cheaper phone does have on its side is a 3.5mm headphone jack. With the iPhone, it\u2019s Bluetooth, a Lightning port adaptor, or nothing. Both phones pack stereo speakers, though, which is good to see.",
    "Neither of these phones packs the best screen in the business, and both have their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "The iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s 6.1-inch OLED is smaller than the Realme GT\u2019s 6.43-inch Super AMOLED, and it only stretches to a 60Hz refresh rate to its rival\u2019s 120Hz.",
    "However, the iPhone\u2019s screen gets brighter (1,200 nits to 1,000 nits) and sharper (1170 x 2532 versus 1080 x 2400). It\u2019s also simply one of the best-calibrated and just plain pleasant to behold displays on the market.",
    "Besides refreshing faster, the Realme GT also boasts a faster 360Hz touch sampling rate. By comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro only has a 120Hz touch sampling rate.",
    "Pick your display poison: size and responsiveness for the Realme GT, or brightness, sharpness, and color accuracy for the iPhone 12 Pro.",
    "If you were to name just one area where the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s extra cost really shows, it\u2019s in the camera department. It absolutely blows the Realme GT\u2019s photographic offering out of the water.",
    "Both are triple-camera systems, but that\u2019s just about where the comparisons end.",
    "The iPhone 12 Pro goes with three 12MP sensors for wide, ultra-wide, and 2X telephoto. The Realme GT goes with a 64MP wide, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 2MP macro. There is no telephoto lens.",
    "Apple\u2019s image processing wizardry is legendary these days, and the iPhone 12 Pro turns out sharp, balanced shots in all lighting conditions. AI tricks like Smart HDR 3 and Deep Fusion provide outstanding contrast in demanding lighting, while ProRAW combines the information-rich benefits of the RAW format with JPEG\u2019s auto-correction potential.",
    "Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s Night Mode is pretty much the best around at capturing bright, crisp, and balanced low light shots. This mode works across each of its cameras too.",
    "Don\u2019t get us wrong, the Realme GT takes decent shots, but it simply doesn\u2019t get anywhere near the quality of the iPhone. While these shots are bright and crisp enough, they also betray signs of over-sharpening and over-exposure. Our reviewer also found that the GT can struggle to focus on close-up subjects.",
    "Night shots with the Realme GT are instantly hampered by the lack of OIS, which is vital to keeping cameras steady during extended shutter times.",
    "And the less said about the Realme GT\u2019s 2MP macro camera the better. It\u2019s high time manufacturers ditched this pointless inclusion.",
    "Both phones shoot 4K video at 60fps, but the quality is worlds apart. The iPhone 12 Pro is pretty much the best in the business at capturing footage, alongside its fellow Apple flagships.",
    "Both of these phones are just about as fast as they could be within their own ecosystems. But the iPhone 12 Pro has the undoubted edge.",
    "Apple\u2019s custom A-series chips have been dominating their Android equivalents for a number of years now. The iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s A14 Bionic is measurably more powerful than the Realme GT\u2019s Snapdragon 888.",
    "In the cross-format Geekbench 5 multi-core test, the iPhone 12 Pro scored 4100, while the Realme GT scored 3508. Apple\u2019s chip does better when it comes to GPU benchmarks, too.",
    "Of course, in practical terms that doesn\u2019t really make a difference. Both phones run all the latest games well on top settings, and of course the Realme GT makes certain games feel faster thanks to its more fluid 120Hz display.",
    "Apple strikes back with the simple fact that the iPhone 12 Pro will feel faster for longer. Apple\u2019s level of ongoing support is unparalleled, whereas Android manufacturers typically only continue to update their phones for a couple of years at best.",
    "In terms of storage, the iPhone 12 Pro gives you a choice of 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB. The Realme GT comes in 128GB and 256GB variations.",
    "Going back to those inherent platform differences, and we have to hand Apple the win when it comes to software. While you might justifiably prefer Android to iOS, Realme UI 2.0 isn\u2019t Google\u2019s mobile OS at its finest. There\u2019s loads of bloatware, and the style of it all feels rather overbearing - especially compared to the clean, crisp iOS 14.",
    "The iPhone 12 Pro packs a 2815mAh, which seems tiny next to the Realme GT\u2019s 4500mAh equivalent. However, iOS is proven to be more energy efficient than Android, so size alone is not a sufficient comparison. Especially when you factor in a less fluid display.",
    "Both of these phones are good for a full day of usage. We found that we could easily get to midnight with the iPhone 12 Pro with more than half the battery remaining, though only with light use and a stable Wi-Fi connection.",
    "With more intensive and mobile usage, that figure will drop. We found that we lost between 10\u201315% per hour whilst out and about on unfamiliar networks, even without constant use.",
    "We\u2019d describe the Realme GT\u2019s battery life as similarly average. It would generally last a full day between charges, though with heavier use it could drop to single-digit percentages by night time.",
    "Where the Realme GT wins out clearly is with its wired charging solution. You get a rapid 65W brick in the box, whereas the iPhone 12 Pro doesn\u2019t give you one at all. And even then, it doesn\u2019t support more than 20W charging.",
    "Back in the iPhone\u2019s favor is the fact that it supports 15 wireless charging. The Realme GT doesn\u2019t support anything of the sort.",
    "The Realme GT makes a strong case that we\u2019re all crazy for spending so much money on flagship phones. It\u2019s got a great display that refreshes twice as fast as the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s. It\u2019s fast enough to run anything at top what, and it recharges at a much faster rate than the iPhone.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a fast performer for half the price of a top iPhone, the Realme GT is a great pick.",
    "Conversely, the iPhone 12 Pro does a pretty good job at demonstrating why we do like to spend that extra cash on our phones. It\u2019s in the little things, such as a premium design, classy software, wireless charging, and the fastest and most future-proof performance around.",
    "It\u2019s occasionally in the not-so-little things too, such as an awesome all-round camera system that the Realme GT simply can\u2019t hope to compete with.",
    "Ultimately it really does all come down to budget. Within their separate price categories, both of these phones make a case to be the best you can buy."
