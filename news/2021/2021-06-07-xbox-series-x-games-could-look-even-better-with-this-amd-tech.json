  "article": [
    "Xbox Series X and S gamers might soon enjoy a boost to their favorite games\u2019 visuals with AMD\u2019s Super Resolution, a feature that\u2019s part of the company\u2019s FidelityFX suite of graphical enhancements. While Super Resolution will be available for use on PC from June 22, it looks like the tech could also make its way to Microsoft\u2019s flagship consoles.",
    "What exactly is Super Resolution? According to AMD itself, it\u2019s an upscaling technology that can boost framerates and resolution for games that support it, without the need to purchase more powerful hardware such as a new console or graphics card.",
    "Speaking to IGN, a Microsoft spokesperson had the following to say about Super Resolution: \u201cAt Xbox, we\u2019re excited by the potential of AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super Resolution technology as another great method for developers to increase framerates and resolution. We will have more to share on this soon.\u201d",
    "While Super Resolution hasn\u2019t outright been confirmed for consoles just yet, then, it\u2019s entirely possible for Xbox to touch on the feature during its upcoming E3 2021 presentation, and we\u2019d love to see AMD\u2019s tech work hand in hand with other fantastic Xbox features like Auto HDR.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that Xbox Series X/S development kits already have FidelityFX built-in, complementing the AMD graphical and processing hardware that powers the consoles. Super Resolution could be yet another feature that helps boost the performance of upcoming, anticipated Xbox games like Fable, Forza Motorsport and Everwild without sacrificing precious framerate.",
    "Super Resolution would also be a huge win for gamers who own an Xbox Series S. This entry-level, digital-only machine isn\u2019t quite as powerful as the beefy Series X, but FidelityFX and Super Resolution may help to bridge the gap between the two by creating a visual experience greater than what was originally intended."
