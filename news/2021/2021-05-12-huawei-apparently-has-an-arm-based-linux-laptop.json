    "Chinese tech giant Huawei is apparently set launch a Linux laptop that sports a custom Arm-based chip.",
    "While Huawei hasn\u2019t officially announced the device, dubbed the Huawei Qingyun L410, some keep-eyed scribes found it listed on a Chinese ecommerce website, where it was apparently only available for enterprises and government agencies.",
    "Arm-based laptops aren\u2019t a novelty anymore, but this one from Huawei is important since it will be the first non-Intel, non-AMD powered laptop in the company\u2019s stable.",
    "This could also be a sign of things to come as Huawei continues to reduce its dependence on products from US-based companies following last year\u2019s trade sanctions.",
    "The Huawei Qingyun L410 is powered by Huawei\u2019s homegrown Kirin 990 processor. Designed by its HiSilicon subsidiary, the Kirin 990 is an Arm-based chip that was initially developed for smartphones and tablets.",
    "The Arm-based processor is coupled with 8GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage. The laptop reportedly runs a Linux-based operating system called Unity OS, which is another break from tradition, but in line with Huawei\u2019s efforts to move away from US-based tech.",
    "From the listing it seems the Qingyun L410 has a 14 inch 2K display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, and in typical Huawei-fashion a pop-up camera is integrated into its keyboard and the power key comes with an embedded fingerprint sensor.",
    "The laptop, reportedly based on the Huawei Matebook 14, has a metal unibody design with a deep space gray color finish and measures about 0.6 inches in thickness and weighs about 3.3 pounds.",
