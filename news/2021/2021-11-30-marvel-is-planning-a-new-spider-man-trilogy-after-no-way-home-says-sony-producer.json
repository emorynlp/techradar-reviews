    "Both Sony and Marvel are planning a second Tom Holland-led Spider-Man trilogy after No Way Home, producer Amy Pascal has confirmed.",
    "Speaking to Fandango in a recent interview, Pascal revealed that the studio is \u201cgetting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re thinking of [the Homecoming trilogy] as three films, and now we\u2019re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.\u201d",
    "While Sony insiders have attached the caveat that no plans are official just yet (per THR), the studio supposedly has a \u201cstrong relationship\u201d with Holland and Marvel boss Kevin Feige, boosting hopes that collaboration will continue between all three parties.",
    "The news comes just weeks before the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is set to hit theaters on December 15, 2021 and intended to tie up the so-called Homecoming trilogy of movies (following Homecoming and Far From Home in 2017 and 2019, respectively).",
    "In the upcoming film \u2013 which is inarguably the most anticipated Marvel movie since 2019\u2019s Avengers: Endgame \u2013 Peter Parker will, for the first time, be forced to deal with the consequences of being unmasked. In an effort to rectify the situation, he enlists the help of Doctor Strange, and the pair unwittingly trigger a series of multiverse-opening events.",
    "Sony\u2019s third Spider-Man movie will also be the final release in what\u2019s been a jam-packed year for MCU films, with Black Widow, Shang-Chi, and Eternals all arriving earlier this year. It'll be the last Marvel movie for a while, too, with Doctor Strange 2 not set to release until May 2022.",
    "It\u2019s clear that audiences have an appetite for more Spider-Man adventures \u2013 the 78 million views on No Way Home\u2019s first trailer prove that \u2013 but Holland\u2019s willingness to don the red and blue suit for a further three movies is less certain.",
    "In a recent interview with GQ, the star revealed that he still isn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019d be willing to reprise the role after No Way Home. \u201cMaybe it is time for me to move on,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cmaybe what\u2019s best for Spider-Man is that they do a Miles Morales film [next]. If I\u2019m playing Spider-Man after I\u2019m 30, I\u2019ve done something wrong.\u201d",
    "Still, Holland did allude to those aforementioned plans for a brand new Spidey trilogy: \u201cI might do Spider-Man 4, 5 and 6, finish when I\u2019m 32, and never make another. I\u2019m not sure what I want to do.\u201d",
    "The question of whether Marvel and Sony can keep their leading man, then, remains unanswered for now. We know for certain, though, that Spider-Man: No Way Home is going to take the global box office by storm."
