    "Samsung has announced it plans to offer four years of software support to most of its Galaxy phones and tablets, in an unprecedented move for the company\u2019s Android-powered devices.",
    "Typically, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy range receives two years worth of Android OS upgrades with security updates being provided for three years \u2013 but the manufacturer has committed to increasing both the pace and frequency with which it distributes updates.",
    "Now, it\u2019s Galaxy devices will receive up to three major OS updates alongside four years worth of security patches, suggesting those who decide to buy products like the Samsung Galaxy S21 will be covered, in software terms, until at least 2025.",
    "The news doesn\u2019t just apply to Samsung\u2019s newest phones and tablets, either. While its latest devices will receive monthly patches, its mid-range phones will get quarterly updates for the foreseeable future. That means devices like the Samsung Galaxy A51 will still receive continued software maintenance, even if not as frequently as newer Galaxy models.",
    "It\u2019s unclear how far back the promise goes, but it seems as though any device released prior to 2019 won\u2019t benefit from the new pledge. The company\u2019s official security update page has been updated to clarify that devices in their fourth year of life would only receive security patches biannually, meaning they\u2019d get no more than two security patches in a year. T",
    "hat suggests devices which launched in back 2017 \u2013 like the Galaxy J5, Galaxy J7, Galaxy Tab A and others \u2013 are coming to the end of their maintenance period.",
    "In a refreshing move away from the planned obsolescence we\u2019ve come to expect from premium smartphone manufacturers, it looks as though Samsung has turned its attention to encouraging consumers to stick with its devices, rather than upgrading as frequently as they might have.",
    "By extending software support, there\u2019s one less reason to trade in your old Galaxy device for a new one \u2013 which in turn makes those coming to the Samsung Galaxy product line for the first time more inclined to make a purchase. In that way, then, this looks a shrewd business decision from Samsung as well as a positive move towards more sustainable consumption.",
