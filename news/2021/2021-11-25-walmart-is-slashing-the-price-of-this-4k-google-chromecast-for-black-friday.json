    "The Google Chromecast with Google TV is now just $39.00 at Walmart in a white coloring, marking an $11 discount on this heavy-duty streamer. The blue edition appears to have been selling for just $30, but is now sold out.",
    "There's also a similar $10 discount on the older Google Chromecast (3rd gen), which carries Android TV and is now just $19.98.",
    "We were huge fans of the Chromecast with Google TV in our review, calling it \"a revelation \u2013 it fixes something that wasn't broken, and improves a nearly perfect technology in a tangible way. And it's all thanks to the remote and Google's 'new' software, Google TV.",
    "\"Combined, the two offer a massive uptick in usability over previous Chromecasts that required you to use your phone or tablet to Cast content rather than giving you an on-screen interface to interact with.\"",
    "But any of the Chromecast hardware above should serve you well, with thousands of apps on offer, a sensible and straightforward interface (Android and Google TV both), and support for Google Assistant voice commands.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for streamers from around the web right here, with offers available in your region.",
