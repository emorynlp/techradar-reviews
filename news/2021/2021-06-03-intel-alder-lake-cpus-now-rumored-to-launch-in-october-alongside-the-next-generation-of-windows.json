    "Intel\u2019s long-awaited 12th-generation Alder Lake desktop CPUs will reportedly be launching in October - alongside Microsoft\u2019s next-generation of Windows.",
    "That\u2019s according to information from leaker Moore\u2019s Law is Dead, who has tweeted that Intel\u2019s so-called Alder Lake Desktop-K series \u201ccould be released around a spooky time of year\u201d.",
    "While recent rumors had hinted at a November launch for the 12th-gen CPUs, this latest rumor appears to suggest that an October launch is on the cards.",
    "In a follow-up tweet, Moore\u2019s Law is Dead has shed some more light on the upcoming launch. The tipster claims that the next version of Windows - which Microsoft has confirmed it will show off on 24 June - will debut around the same time as Alder Lake.",
    "This is \u201cnot a coinidence\u201d, according to the leaker, suggesting that Intel and Microsoft are working to optimise the performance of Alder Lake CPUs for the upcoming build of Windows, which Moore's Law is Dead notes will feature \"massive scheduling updates\".",
    "While the launch of Alder Lake CPUs are still a few months off, we already know quite a lot about the 10nm processor series.",
    "As confirmed by Intel itself, Alder Lake will employ a combination of normal cores and low-power cores \u2013 a system similar to ARM\u2019s big.LITTLE tech. The low-power cores will be more efficient and able to run the show when the system is idling or under little stress, the idea being that battery life can be saved as a result.",
    "The CPU series, which will be Intel\u2019s first to support both PCIe 5.0 and DDR5, will also deliver a 20% performance increase for single-threaded applications and up to twice as good multi-threaded performance compared to Rocket Lake, according to reports.",
