  "article": [
    "In what is sure to be the unlikeliest Apple rumor you\u2019ll read today, tech evangelist and industry insider Robert Scoble says that a new iPod 8th gen will be unveiled alongside the Apple Glasses at WWDC 2022 that will be held in June of next year.",
    "The two will apparently have some form of connectivity to one another \u2013 though Scoble doesn\u2019t explain how or why \u2013 but goes on to say that they\u2019ll be available to buy before December 25, 2022 (Christmas of next year).",
    "As wild as this all sounds - and boy does it sound wild - we have heard rumblings of a new iPod Touch in development at Apple from MacRumors contributor Steve Moser and Twitter tipster @AppleLe257, so there\u2019s some precedent for today\u2019s rumor.",
    "That said, no one up to this point has claimed that it would be unveiled alongside Apple\u2019s still fabled AR headset \u2013 and I don\u2019t think there was anyone out there in the world who thought the two products would work together somehow. And yet, here we are.",
    "Apple hasn't released a new iPod Touch since 2019 and for the last few years hasn\u2019t really discussed refreshing the iPod. While the company hasn't said it publicly, it seems to have replaced the iPod Touch with the cheapest iPhone series, the iPhone SE.",
    "Still, there are some good arguments to be made for a standalone MP3 player. For one, it would have a headphone jack, something that\u2019s entirely disappeared from Apple\u2019s main iPhone lineup. For another, it could be an option for parents looking for an iOS device for kids who aren\u2019t ready for the responsibility of a phone with a cell phone contract and the ability to call anyone they\u2019d like.",
    "How an iPod would power or enhance an AR headset, however, is beyond me.",
    "Maybe the iPod Touch will slide in the headset and act like an Apple version of the Samsung Gear VR that offers VR in addition to AR. Maybe the iPod Touch will store apps or have a unique musical overlay that you can have playing alongside your music... or maybe they aren\u2019t compatible at all and won\u2019t ever leave Apple\u2019s R&D lab.",
    "Our money\u2019s on that, but we thought it was worth at least informing you of the rumor and its implications, as unlikely as they may be."
