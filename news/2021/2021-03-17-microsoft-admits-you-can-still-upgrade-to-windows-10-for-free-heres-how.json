    "If you\u2019ve been thinking of upgrading to Windows 10, but didn\u2019t want to pay for it, it turns out there\u2019s another way. Several ways, actually, according to a Microsoft employee who confirmed that methods still exist to upgrade to Windows 10 for free.",
    "The Microsoft employee detailed how to go about getting the Windows 10 upgrade for free in a support thread, addressing a user\u2019s question if they could make the leap from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 at no cost.",
    "The instructions provided by the employee are refreshingly simple, and there\u2019s not that many hoops to jump through in order to get yourself the Windows 10 upgrade, should you want it. However, the employee was adamant that this free upgrade path might not be guaranteed to work, urging users to exercise caution.",
    "First off, you\u2019ll need to be using a genuine copy of Windows 7 or later. If, for some reason, you\u2019re still using an operating system earlier than that, the upgrade unfortunately won\u2019t work for you.",
    "Once you\u2019ve got that confirmed, head over to the Windows 10 software download page. When you\u2019re there, download and open the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool and select the option to \u201cUpgrade this PC now.\u201d",
    "Accept the terms and conditions presented, and make sure to choose the upgrade option that lets you keep your files and information. The Microsoft employee in the support thread warned that upgrading via a fresh install isn\u2019t guaranteed to work, so be sure to stick to the former option to keep your files and avoid any potential risks.",
    "After the installation has been completed, ensure your PC\u2019s connected to the internet and open your Settings app. Scroll down to \u201cUpdate & Security\u201d and click on the \u201cActivation\u201d tab. Here, you can confirm whether or not the Windows 10 upgrade has worked. If not, there may be an \u201cActivate\u201d button you\u2019ll need to click that will establish a connection to Microsoft\u2019s servers to create a digital Windows 10 product key for you.",
    "Finally, the employee in the support thread stated that if you\u2019re unable to obtain the license, you can enter your existing Windows operating system product key to manually complete the upgrade to Windows 10."
