    "Pro14 champions Leinster have it all to do in their 2021 European Champions Cup semi-final clash with Top 14 heavyweights La Rochelle. Leo Cullen will be without captain Johnny Sexton, after he picked up yet another head injury last month, and Les Maritimes also have home advantage. It's a blockbuster match-up, so read on as we explain how to watch a La Rochelle vs Leinster live stream today and catch all the rugby union action online from wherever you are.",
    "Leinster's overcame defending champions Exeter in the last round. It was a brilliant tie, which saw the province recover from a nightmare 14-point deficit in the first 10 minutes, to win 34-22. Ross Byrne replaced Sexton midway through the first half and, along with Jordan Lamour and James Lowe, was one of the stars of the show, kicking 17 points for his team. Can he rise to the occasion again today?",
    "It was much smoother sailing for La Rochelle, who gave Sale a 45-21 trouncing. This is the furthest they've ever made it through the European Champions Cup, and another famous win would be the perfect way to celebrate Ronan O'Gara's recent promotion.",
