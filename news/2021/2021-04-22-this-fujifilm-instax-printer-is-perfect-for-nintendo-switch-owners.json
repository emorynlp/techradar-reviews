    "Fujifilm has announced that it has partnered with Nintendo to develop a new app for its Instax Mini Link smartphone printer. Announced via Fujifilm\u2019s news blog, the app will allow Nintendo enthusiasts to transfer screenshots from their Nintendo Switch games to their smartphones, and can be edited with frames inspired by big Nintendo franchises.",
    "The Instax Mini Link for Nintendo Switch app will launch on April 30, 2021 on Google Play and Apple\u2019s App Store, the same day that New Pok\u00e9mon Snap releases on the Nintendo Switch console.",
    "As part of the collaboration, Fujifilm will sell a special edition Instax Mini Link with red and blue accents for $100 (around \u00a380 / AU$169). A special edition bundle that contains the smartphone printer and a Pikachu-themed silicone case will also be made available for $120 (around \u00a390 / AU$199). Both the printer and its Pok\u00e9mon themed bundle also launch on April 30 worldwide.",
    "The Instax Mini Link for Nintendo Switch app will feature themes and frames from three popular Nintendo franchises. Pok\u00e9mon is one of these, as mentioned, but users will also find themes from Super Mario and Animal Crossing to customize their photos with.",
    "The app interacts with your Nintendo Switch screenshots via a QR code. When the code has been scanned on your smartphone, it will upload the image to it, allowing you to then use the app to crop and customize the photo, and then print it using the Instax Mini Link via Bluetooth connectivity.",
    "Of course, the app can also be used to customize any image on your smartphone, rendering your selfies, memes and memorable moments in a cutesy Nintendo aesthetic. We\u2019d love to see more Nintendo franchises added to the app down the line (it\u2019s practically screaming for The Legend of Zelda themes) but the initial selection provides great options for kids, families and gamers alike."
