    "The Nintendo Switch OLED is a fine upgrade over the original Switch model, but it\u2019s not without its flaws.",
    "The lack of enhancements for TV mode users is obviously the most glaring omission Nintendo chose to make \u2013 you\u2019re still getting the same 1080p output as the older Switch, and practically all of the Switch OLED\u2019s enhancements disappear when it\u2019s docked.",
    "But there\u2019s another baffling, simply maddening change that has been introduced with the Nintendo Switch OLED that I can\u2019t wrap my head around: the decision to make the Game Card port almost completely inaccessible.",
    "As I mentioned in our Nintendo Switch OLED review, the Game Card port is now flush with the device. There\u2019s a tiny gap present, but the handy indentation on the original Nintendo Switch, which made opening the protective flap a doddle, has now been removed. As a result, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to open the Game Card slot on the Nintendo Switch OLED.",
    "Try as I might, getting a good purchase on the Game Card port on the Nintendo Switch OLED is nigh on impossible unless you have long fingernails. If you\u2019ve trimmed your nails recently, prying open the plastic flap that covers the Game Card slot is honestly an exercise in futility.",
    "But perhaps it was just my sausage-like fingers that were the problem? To rule out that possibility, I decided to perform a quick real-life experiment. I asked my partner to first open the Game Card port on the original Switch, and then the Nintendo Switch OLED. Unsurprisingly, she had no trouble popping the Game Card slot open on the Nintendo Switch, but when it came to the OLED model, no dice.",
    "After tilting and angling the Switch OLED in an attempt to find what was clearly missing, eventually, thanks to the power of a slightly longer fingernail, my partner managed to prise the slot open. \u201cWell, that\u2019s stupid,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhy did they change this?\u201d",
    "Of course, I didn\u2019t have an answer to her question, but it\u2019s one that has been on my mind ever since I had the Nintendo Switch OLED in my possession. While I\u2019m not someone who uses the Game Card slot regularly, I\u2019ve never had any issues with the original Switch\u2019s superior design. It\u2019s always worked as intended and never became loose over time \u2013 unlike the dangly kickstand, which opens whenever I tilt my launch-day unit at a specific angle.",
    "The Nintendo Switch OLED is a curious device, then. It\u2019s the best Nintendo Switch the company has ever made, with a beautiful new display, impressive speakers, and a redesigned, wider kickstand. And while an argument can be made why Nintendo didn\u2019t enhance the console\u2019s hardware and offer a 4K output, making the Game Card slot an absolute pain to open is, quite frankly, inexcusable."
