    "Of the millions (and millions) of football fans around the globe tuning into a Super Bowl live stream this Sunday, only a tiny percentage are going to need a VPN. But if you are one of the folks who are concerned about watching on a public Wi-Fi connection or looking to get around geo-restrictions blocking you from your preferred coverage, then grabbing a suitable streaming VPN could be the perfect play.",
    "If you've already started hunting, you've probably quickly realized that there are practically more options on the market than there will be people in the crowd this weekend. So we've produced a list of five VPN deals for you to take advantage of. They combine excellent pricing with MVP-quality products. So although they may not all be the very cheapest out there, they're certainly among the best.",
    "And because each and every one of these VPNs come with free trials, you can easily grab one for the game and then cancel within 30 days to get your money back. And they say there's nothing in this life for free...",
    "There are loooooads of VPN uses - getting Super Bowl coverage on your terms is just the tip of the iceberg. Virtual Private Networks allow bypass geo-restricted content. So if you wanted to watch a Netflix show that is geo-restricted to a location, a VPN changes your IP address so your device gets tricked into thinking it's in a different location. Make sure to check out our Netflix VPN guide if your primary reason for a VPN is streaming shows and movies, while they're also brilliant for letting you watch sport and shows that are only available overseas.",
    "Some people will be more concerned about the fact VPNs help you browse the internet securely. A VPN uses encryption technology that basically means you're browsing and activity will be anonymous. So if you're worried about your cybersecurity, a VPN is definitely the way to go.",
    "Beyond that, they help get around blocked websites and apps in countries that ban them, assist in secure online banking and shopping (especially on public Wi-Fi), and have even been known to get around broadband bandwidth throttling and bag cheaper flights on comparison sites, too."
