  "summary": "Small but significant change",
  "article": [
    "The redesigned Start menu in Windows 11 has been one of the most controversial changes coming to the new operating system, but Microsoft isn\u2019t done tweaking it.",
    "The latest insider build of Windows 11, which can be installed by people who have signed up to help test out the operating system before its launch on October 5, makes a small \u2013 but useful \u2013 tweak to the Start menu, by adding \u2018Sign-in options\u2019 above the power options.",
    "Being able to quickly change how you sign into Windows 11 is certainly helpful, so we\u2019re glad to see Microsoft experimenting with easier access.",
    "Even if you\u2019re testing out Windows 11, you may not see this change just yet as the new build, 22458, is currently only out for people on the Dev Channel. This is for people testing very early versions of Windows 11, mainly to see if their apps are compatible. Most people will probably be using the beta channel instead, which offers older, but more stable, Windows 11 preview builds. If this change proves successful then it may be a few weeks before we see it in the beta channel.",
    "As Windows Central reports, this new build includes several bug fixes as well, including a fixing a Start menu bug that affected its performance. Here\u2019s the full list of fixes from Microsoft\u2019s changelog:",
    "This build also includes a new Tips app, which Microsoft says comes with over 100 tips \u201cto help you get started on Windows 11 and learn new things\u2014discover keyboard shortcuts, find ways to optimize your PC, dive into productivity tips for Office, power up your gaming on Windows, and much more.\u201d",
    "While this new app could help people get used to Windows 11, there\u2019s also concern that it could mean Windows 11 also gets more annoying pop-ups. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not the case.",
    "As we mentioned, Microsoft\u2019s tweaks to Windows 11\u2019s Start menu have provided to be rather controversial. Moving it to the center of the screen has frustrated a lot of people, who are used to it being I the far-left of the taskbar. Pinning and moving apps have also been restricted.",
    "As Microsoft found out with Windows 8, where it dropped the Start menu altogether, a lot of Windows users care deeply about the Start menu. As the name suggests, for many people it\u2019s the first thing they use when on their PC, so any changes have to be carefully thought about. After all, after the backlash Windows 8 got, the Start menu was back in Windows 10.",
    "Part of the reason why Microsoft has made Windows 11 available early to insiders is to get feedback, and if the concerns about the Windows 11 Start menu are numerous enough, it could lead to Microsoft rethinking its plans.",
    "This latest tweak also shows that Microsoft isn\u2019t finished with the Start menu, and is trying out new things, even with the final release of Windows 11 coming in a few weeks. This is good news, as it shows the company is happy to keep working on the Start menu, and will hopefully find a way to make it appeal to as many users as possible."
