    "Pull up a pew and kick back as former Entertainer of the Year Luke Bryan hosts the 55th annual Country Music Association Awards. As the show returns once more to its Bridgestone Arena home in Nashville, Tennessee., read on as we explain how to watch a 2021 CMA Awards stream from anywhere, including for FREE.",
    "Reigning Entertainer of the Year Eric Church is once again going head-to-head with Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert and Luke Combs for the night's highest honor, with Chris Stapleton completing the list of nominees.",
    "It's incredible to think that neither Lambert nor Underwood have taken the crown before. Will it be fifth time lucky for the Fastest Girl in Town, or will the All-American Girl take it at her fourth attempt?",
    "Of course, there's plenty more to look forward to besides, with a huge array of artists set to perform, with the biggest names including all of those mentioned above, plus Keith Urban, Blake Shelton, Mickey Guyton and Carly Pearce.",
    "Strap up for the coolest ride in town, and scroll down for all the ways to watch a CMA Awards stream tonight.",
    "Keep scrolling if you want to know your viewing options in the US, Canada, UK and Australia - it's absolutely FREE Down Under!",
    "But it's worth noting that if you're abroad right now and were hoping to watch your home coverage on your laptop or mobile, it will inevitably be geo-blocked. Annoying but this is easily fixed, with a VPN you can change your IP address to a location back in your own hometown or country that will then allow you to stream the event as if you were sat back at home."
