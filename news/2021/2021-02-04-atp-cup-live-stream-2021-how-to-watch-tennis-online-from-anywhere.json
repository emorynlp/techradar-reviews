    "The ATP Cup is one of the newest and most unusual competitions on the tennis calendar. Launched last year, it's a team tournament that only the countries with the highest ranking men's players can qualify for and - just like in 2020 - though we can no loinger get a pre-Aussie Open showdown between world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the final this weekend, as Rafa pulled out of his opening match injury. Read on, as we've compiled this handy guide for getting a 2021 ATP Cup tennis live stream online wherever you are right now.",
    "Russia and Italy have already sealed semi-final berths for the weekend, with Spain and Serbia expected to follow. Last year, Novak beat Rafa as Serbia overcame Spain in last year's final, but this year's competition should be much stronger, with starlets Dominic Thiem (Austria), Daniil Medvedev (Russia), Stefanos Tsitsipas (Greece) and Alexander Zverev (Germany) looking primed to challenge the ATP circuit's dominant forces.",
    "Teams Spain, Russia, Italy and Canada all feature two players ranked in the top 20 - Russia's secondary player, Andrey Rublev, is the world No. 8 - which makes them all serious contenders.",
    "However, the ATP Cup isn't just about individuals. Last year, 14 ties were decided by doubles matches and Australia, captained by Lleyton Hewitt, have some serious doubles firepower in their corner, in John Peers and Luke Saville, to complement their solid singles lineup.",

    "The 2021 ATP Cup features 12 teams, split into four groups of three, which were determined by seeding.",
    "Each team will play the other teams in its group once, with each tie a best-of-three comprising two singles matches and one doubles match. The first match will be contested by the teams' No. 2-ranked players, the second will be contested by their top-ranked players, with the doubles match to follow.",
    "Even if the tie has been decided after the two singles matches, the doubles match will be played - unless it's the final.",
    "The winners of each group will play a semi-final knockout tie to determine the final.",
