    "SAP has kicked off its virtual SAPPHIRE 2021 event with a keynote from CEO Christian Klein outlining some of the key learnings the company has experienced over the last twelve months.",
    "In what has been a challenging year for businesses of all sizes, Klein noted the three main insights that the company has divined, and how it is now looking to the future.",
    "This included a focus on the latest digital technologies, building a tech community, and sustainability, with Klein emphasising that all three points can help companies rebound from the pandemic.",
    "\u201cEvery crisis is solved by people,\u201d Klein noted in his speech, adding that technology, \u201chas helped businesses adapt, and Covid is only one of the challenges we are facing.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe most resilient companies are the ones that changed their processes...digital transformation is an overused term these days (but) it is everywhere - Covid-19 has underscored the need for every company to become an intelligent enterprise.\u201d",
    "\u201cIntelligent enterprises are enabled by integrated digitised agile business processes powered by data and embedded AI.\u201d",
    "Klein also highlighted how the pandemic has shown how companies need to work together in order to succeed, noting that, \u201cNo business does business alone - we win together as a community.\u201d",
    "\u201cOne intelligent enterprise on its own can create great things, but we live in an interconnected world.\u201d",
    "In order to facilitate this, SAP has announced an expansion to what it says is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest business network\u201d through the aptly-named SAP Business Network platform.",
    "The new release will offer customers a single, unified partner portal where they can view their entire supply chain ecosystem including logistics and traceability, equipment management and maintenance information.",
    "Users can fully customize their portal with the tools and data they need, and quickly view all their customer relationships and transactions on the network.",
    "\u201cWe believe industries will be revolutionised when businesses turn into communities,\u201d Klein stated, \u201cwe want to connect every company across the entire supply chain.\u201d",
    "\u201cThis may sound like a bold vision...and it is,\u201d he added, \u201cbut we already run the world's largest supplier network with more than 5.5 million connected enterprises.\u201d"
