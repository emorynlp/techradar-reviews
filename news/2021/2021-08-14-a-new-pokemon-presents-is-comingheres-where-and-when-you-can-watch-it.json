    "The Pok\u00e9mon Company has revealed that a brand new Pok\u00e9mon Presents will air next week, bringing updates on the upcoming games in the series.",
    "The news was announced on the official Pok\u00e9mon Twitter page, confirming that the stream will take place on August 18 at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST and you'll be able to tune in on the official Pok\u00e9mon YouTube channel.",
    "The tweet also confirmed that fans should expect to see updates on the upcoming DS remakes Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl as well as the highly-anticipated prequel Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus.",
    "This comes hot on the heels of the The Pok\u00e9mon Company\u2019s tease that more on Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus would be revealed \u201csoon\u201d so it seems they really meant it. All three titles were announced together during a February 2021 Pok\u00e9mon Presents which celebrated the series\u2019 25th anniversary so it stands to reason that we\u2019d see updates on them together as well.",
    "The release dates for all of the games are fast approaching. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are making their way onto Nintendo Switch as soon as November 19, seemingly promising a faithful recreation of the beloved Generation 4 Diamond and Pearl games which originally released on the DS back in 2006.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus is coming a little later on January 28 2022 and while Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will be treading familiar ground, Legends: Arceus is set to do something a little different, taking players into a historical Sinnoh region where Pok\u00e9mon roam freely and the world is a little more open.",
    "While the tweet confirmed that Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl as well as Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus will make an appearance during the presentation, it didn\u2019t give away any details on what exactly we can expect to see from any of the titles.",
    "With release dates for all three games already confirmed, we\u2019re not anticipating any big announcements in that area (unless a delay is imminent but that seems unlikely). Given all of the games are scheduled for release within the next six months, we\u2019d imagine The Pok\u00e9mon Company will want to dive a little deeper than it has done previously \u2013 we've only seen reveal trailers released on announcement so far.",
    "With no running time provided it\u2019s kind of hard to glean just how much detail there might be but it seems likely that there\u2019ll be some new in-game footage and more specific details on what players should expect from their returns to the Sinnoh region both past and present. Fortunately, we don't have long to wait to find out for sure."
