    "A remastered version of GTA 5 is set to hit PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles later this year, but Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive, has no interest in making it - or any other potential remasters - merely a \"simple port\".",
    "Speaking during the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, earlier this week (via VGC), Take-Two's CEO, Strauss Zelnick, explained that the company doesn't necessarily see remasters becoming a bigger part of the company's strategy going forward, and it plans to approach any potential remasters differently from its competitors.",
    "\"Remastering has always been a part of the strategy,\" Zelnik said. \"We\u2019ve done differently than the competition \u2013 we don\u2019t just port titles over, we actually take the time to do the very best job we can making the title different for the new release, for the new technology that we\u2019re launching it on.\"",
    "\"So, we improve the technology, we upgrade the visuals, and we make performance enhancements,\" Zelnik continued. \"And that\u2019s why I think our remastered titles typically do so well.\u201d",
    "GTA 5 will have released on three generations of consoles after it arrives, 'expanded and enhanced', on PS5 and Xbox Series X later this year.",
    "The remaster aims to take full advantage of the power of these new consoles, bringing with it technical improvements, visual upgrades and performance enhancements. Currently, we don't know exactly when GTA 5 will land on PS5 and Xbox Series X, or exactly what enhancements we can look forward to, but with the release window sometime in Q3/Q4 of 2021, it shouldn't be long until we find out.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve done great with the Mafia series, for example, and Grand Theft Auto [V] is now heading into its third generation which is incredible\", Zelnik said of the upcoming GTA 5 remaster. \u201cIt was a standard-bearer when it was launched, it continued to be the standard-bearer in the second generation, we\u2019ll see how Grand Theft Auto does in the next generation. Obviously, I\u2019m confident that Rockstar is going to deliver just a great experience, but you can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re just doing a simple port.\u201d"
