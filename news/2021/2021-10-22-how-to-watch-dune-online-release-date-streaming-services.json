    "Dune has finally exploded back onto screens with visionary director Denis Villeneuve at the helm of this spectacular, long awaited adaptation of the seminal science fiction work. Keep reading as we tell you exactly how to watch Dune online on HBO Max in the US and in all corners of the world.",
    "Recruiting an A-list cast on the planet Arrakis, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac and Zendaya star in the critically acclaimed Dune.",
    "Prior attempts to adapt Frank Herbert\u2019s unwieldy 1965 novel have crashed and burned - most famously the 1984 box-office bomb by David Lynch. The Blade Runner: 2049 and Arrival director, however, has proven himself highly adept at juggling visual spectacle and narrative complexity, while keeping audiences emotionally engaged, too.",
    "With Chalamet leading a magnificent cast, Dune also stars Jason Momoa, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, Benjamin Clementine, Javier Bardem and Charlotte Rampling. Expect it to be packed with epic battles, rousing emotion\u2026even some timely environmental commentary - Villeneuve has described the film as a coming-of-age story meets \u201ca call for action for the youth\u201d.",
    "So, locate the largest screen with the best picture quality available (you can enjoy it in 4K HDR on HBO Max) as we break down how to watch Dune online and stream Warner Brother\u2019s latest blockbuster.",
    "Dune is being released all over planet Earth, but it\u2019ll only be available to stream at home outside of the US after its standard theatrical window.",
    "So, international audiences will need to flock to theaters to see Dune. UK and Canadian viewers can watch it from Thursday, October 21, the same day as in America.",
    "Indeed, October 21 is the general global cinematic release date. Sadly Australians will have to wait until December 2 to be awed by giant sandworms at the cinema, because ongoing lockdowns have pushed back a number of film releases in that part of the world.",
    "As well as instant access to new Warner Bros. blockbusters \u2013 the Will Smith-starring sports biopic King Richard arrives on November 19 and the new Matrix film in December \u2013 you\u2019ll get over 13,000 hours of prime content: choice picks from the Warner Bros. archive and subsidiary companies like New Line Cinema, Studio Ghibli\u2019s animated masterpieces, DC Entertainment blockbusters like Wonder Woman: 1984.",
    "And \u2013 the clue's in the name \u2013 watch every iconic HBO series ever made. Enjoy The Sopranos, Euphoria, Mare of Easttown and The Wire, plus all 10 seasons of iconic sitcom Friends, addictive HBO Max Originals like Gossip Girl, and so much more.",
    "Set in the year 10191, Dune begins with Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) handed control of the Spice mining operation on the desert planet Arrakis, with \u201cspice\u201d being a valuable commodity harvested in large amounts for its youth enhancing and prophetic properties.",
    "But after arriving with his son Paul (Chalamet - read about how he bagged the lead role) and the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), the Atreides family are threatened with annihilation by their enemies, the House Harkonnen. And, forsaken in the desolate, sandworm strewn environment, they find allyship with the planet\u2019s native Fremen.",
    "And unlike the 80's version, it looks like Villeneuve's Dune is set for critical acclaim - the 5-star reviews are already piling. You can read TechRadar's thoughts on the film with our Dune review."
