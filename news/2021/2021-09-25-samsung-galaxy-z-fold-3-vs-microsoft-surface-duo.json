  "article": [
    "Samsung has come to dominate the fledgling foldable phone format, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 representing one of two third-generation foldable devices from the brand.",
    "But it isn\u2019t the only hinged phablet in town. Last year, we received the Microsoft Surface Duo as a bold new attempt at smartphone legitimacy from the Windows maker.",
    "Microsoft has just announced the Surface Duo 2, but that's not out yet so here we're focusing on the first-gen model. So how do these two smart hybrids compare? Does Samsung\u2019s iterative headstart show in the final reckoning?",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 hit shops on August 27, 2021 in the US and UK, and September 10 in Australia. Prices start at $1,799 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,499 for the 256GB model, while $1,899 / \u00a31,699 / AU$2,649 gets you 512GB of storage.",
    "The Surface Duo was made available on September 10, 2020 in the US and February 2021 in the UK. Prices started at $1,399 / \u00a31,350 (about AU$1,930) for 128GB of internal storage, moving up to $1,499 / \u00a31,449 (about AU$2,080) for 256GB.",
    "That\u2019s already a fair bit cheaper than the Galaxy Z Fold3, and we\u2019ve only seen that Surface Duo price drop since launch. In fact, we\u2019ve seen the device go for as low as $700 / \u00a3680 for the 128GB version and $750 / \u00a3730 for the 256GB variant.",
    "Whatever happens over the coming sections, then (SPOILER ALERT: it really is quite a one-sided battle), remember that the Microsoft Surface Duo can be had for less than half the money of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3.",
    "These are two of the most head-turning smartphones on the market, but in terms of pure design, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 wins out. It doesn\u2019t get everything its own way, though.",
    "At 158.2 x 128.1 x 6.4mm unfurled, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a much squarer and thicker device than the 186.9 x 145.2 x 4.8mm Surface Duo. It\u2019s also a fair bit heavier at 271g versus 250g.",
    "That thickness really makes all the difference when both devices are folded. While the Microsoft Surface Duo still resembles a regular phone at less than 10mm thick, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is about 50% thicker.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s hinge system is also more subtle and pretty, with a minimal gap and an awesome feel. It\u2019s remarkably solid despite its daintiness, too. Samsung\u2019s third-gen hinge is more of a triumph of iteration, with a rather utilitarian approach.",
    "It won\u2019t open a full 360-degrees in the way of Microsoft\u2019s hinge. Samsung\u2019s device can still be used in this \u2018closed\u2019 position, but only by implementing a second external display, which feels like an altogether less elegant solution.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s foldable tablet is slightly sexier, then, but it isn\u2019t quite as rugged as the Samsung. It doesn\u2019t have the Galaxy Z Fold 3\u2019s IPX8 waterproof rating, and its front and rear are coated in Gorilla Glass 5 rather than the Samsung\u2019s superior Gorilla Glass Victus.",
    "Both phones employ two displays, although their implementation is very different.",
    "While Samsung uses one large foldable 7.6-inch AMOLED screen, and one 6.2-inch AMOLED Cover Display, Microsoft splits its 8.1-inch AMOLED into two distinct halves \u2013 hence the Duo name. These can serve as a single display, but the point is to have clear separation for the Duo\u2019s split-screen functions.",
    "Samsung\u2019s main screen is undoubtedly more of a feat of engineering. While you\u2019ll notice a ridge running down the middle, it\u2019s less obvious than Microsoft\u2019s clear separating bezel. Indeed, in general we didn\u2019t find it desirable to run cross-screen media and the like on the Surface Duo, whereas it\u2019s quite feasible on the Galaxy.",
    "At 1800 x 2700, the Microsoft screen is sharper than its 1768 x 2208 Samsung equivalent, but we\u2019re only talking a small difference in pixel density: 401ppi vs 374ppi.",
    "Both of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3\u2019s screens benefit from a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, too. Microsoft\u2019s device only hits a standard 60Hz.",
    "All in all, despite an ostensibly similar form factor, these are two very different approaches to display technology. We\u2019d have to give Samsung the nod on raw quality and media readiness, but there are one or two ways in which the Microsoft Surface Duo\u2019s dual screens prove more impressive.",
    "For two ostensibly premium, forward-thinking devices, the camera experience is universally disappointing. Still, the Microsoft Surface Duo\u2019s camera is markedly more disappointing than that of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.",
    "The latter\u2019s triple 12-megapixel camera system isn\u2019t bad at all. It just doesn\u2019t represent any real progress from the Galaxy Z Fold 2, and it fails to match up to the excellent Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra camera that wowed us earlier in the year.",
    "It\u2019s still led by a fairly large and capable 1/1.76in 12-megapixel wide sensor, though, which can capture decent images. And that\u2019s still backed up by a 12-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto sensor with a 2X optical zoom.",
    "By contrast, Microsoft\u2019s solitary 11-megapixel f/2.0 sensor is decidedly lacking. We described it as \u201ceasily the weakest point of the device\u201d in our review, although it does feature a halfway decent Portrait mode, and it can still record 4K 60fps video, just like the Samsung.",
    "The Duo\u2019s overworked camera has to pull double-duty as a selfie camera, too, and on that front at least it\u2019s a qualified success. Samsung has opted for a dedicated under-display 4-megapixel solution, which is clever. When you come down to the business of shooting selfies, however, it turns out poor results.",
    "Still, Samsung also includes a separate 10-megapixel selfie camera on the Cover Display, which is a little better.",
    "There\u2019s a full year between these two products, so you\u2019d expect the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 to be a generation ahead in terms of performance. In fact, it\u2019s actually two generations ahead of its Microsoft rival.",
    "While the Galaxy Z Fold 3 runs on the Snapdragon 888, like most other current flagship phones, the Microsoft Surface Duo runs on the creaky Snapdragon 855.",
    "Even at the time of launch, we commented that this should really have been the Snapdragon 865, which was the Snapdragon 888\u2019s immediate predecessor. Time hasn\u2019t changed our mind one bit.",
    "Samsung also packs its foldable with double the RAM of its rival: 12GB as opposed to 6GB. In devices such as these, which are built for juggling and stacking multiple applications, that\u2019s a notable advantage.",
    "You also get more generous storage with the Samsung, with a choice of either 256GB or 512GB. Microsoft only offers 128GB or 256GB. Neither packs a microSD slot, however.",
    "One other difference that hasn\u2019t helped the Microsoft Surface Duo age well is the lack of 5G connectivity. Needless to say, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 supports this next-generation \u2013 or rather current-generation \u2013 network connectivity.",
    "Both foldables support their manufacturers\u2019 advanced styluses: the S Pen for Samsung, the Surface Pen for Microsoft. Both are great, but you\u2019ll have to buy them separately, which is a shame all-round.",
    "Samsung and Microsoft both include their own custom software to take advantage of these styluses, as well as those expanded screens. Both are derived from Android, although the Samsung utilizes Android 11, while the Microsoft Surface Duo is still stuck on Android 10 at the time of writing.",
    "You wouldn\u2019t choose either of these devices if stamina was a primary concern.",
    "The Galaxy Z Fold 3 packs in a 4400mAh battery \u2013 less than even the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus \u2013 while the Microsoft Surface Duo includes an even smaller 3577mAh cell.",
    "This isn\u2019t very promising from the get-go. However, while neither device inspires confidence in daily use, only the Samsung proved a particular disappointment in this regard.",
    "We found that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 would rarely get through a full day if we hit its 5G and camera hard. Conversely, the Microsoft Surface Duo managed to get us through a full day consistently across the two weeks of our test period.",
    "Of course, much of this performance is a result of the fact that the Surface Duo doesn\u2019t include modern energy-sapping features such as 5G and a 120Hz display. We\u2019d much rather have the option to toggle these functions on and off, as is the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 3.",
    "On the charging front, Samsung wins comfortably \u2013 but it isn\u2019t a particularly impressive effort in either case.",
    "You get 25W wired charging support with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and a mere 18W with the Microsoft Surface Duo. With more traditional rivals offering 65W and 67W charging, neither is a great offering from either manufacturer.",
    "Still, at least Samsung offers 11W wireless charging. Microsoft doesn\u2019t offer any such thing, despite coating its sleek foldable in glass.",
    "In an emerging yet sparsely populated foldable phone market, Samsung is the undisputed king. Its Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the most capable and fully rounded smartphone-tablet hybrid on the market, with Microsoft\u2019s older, prototype-like Surface Duo not really able to compete in most regards.",
    "It isn\u2019t a complete whitewash, however. The Surface Duo has a more elegant and tactile design, and is significantly more affordable these days. There are elements of its dual-screen approach that we really like, too, especially when it comes to running two apps side by side.",
    "But the Galaxy Z Fold 3 blitzes its opponent in most areas. It\u2019s way more powerful, offers more fluid displays, is built a little tougher, and it has a much more capable camera system.",
    "In addition, you also get 5G connectivity and wireless charging with the Samsung \u2013 neither of which are anywhere to be found on Microsoft\u2019s foldable.",
    "In a way, this doesn\u2019t feel like a fair fight, and the real test will come when Microsoft launches its second-generation foldable. For now, however, Samsung is safely installed as the provisional king of the foldable format."
