    "The Sony WH-1000XM3 are still among the best headphones you can buy, even though they've been succeeded by the Sony WH-1000XM4 \u2013 and recently, we've been seeing some incredible deals on the noise-cancelling cans in the US and the UK.",
    "Right now, you can get the Sony WH-1000XM3 for just $184 from Amazon, shaving $165 off the original price of $349. It's worth noting, though, that this deal applies to the international warranty version, meaning you're not getting the official limited one-year warranty that's provided by Sony USA.",
    "In the UK, Amazon has slashed the price of these noise-cancelling headphones from \u00a3330 to just \u00a3224, after briefly dropping to a mere \u00a388, which was the lowest price we've ever seen for the Sony WH-1000XM3 by far. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for the best prices in your region.)",
    "The Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones topped TechRadar's best headphones list for two years running, and while that honor now goes to the Sony WH-1000XM4, they're still a great buy for anyone looking for some premium ANC cans. With noise-cancellation technology that's quite frankly outstanding, a 30-hour battery life, brilliant audio quality, and an understated design, these Sony cans are a great investment.",
    "If you're suffering from a noisy working environment or need a little bit of peace from the kids, then these cans are simply some of the best you can buy right now.",
    "If you have a little more cash to spare, then it's well worth checking out Sony WH-1000XM4 deals. These upgraded cans come with improved noise cancellation that adapts to your environment, audio upscaling, and multi-point connectivity \u2013 though they won't be as highly discounted as their predecessors.",
