  "article": [
    "Leaks surrounding the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite are rolling in rapidly, as just a day after seeing renders of the tablet, we now have a good idea of the charging speed thanks to a Chinese certification.",
    "The tablet was spotted in a listing on 3C (China\u2019s mandatory product certification system) by MyFixGuide, and the listing - which covers both Wi-Fi and LTE models, but not the rumored 5G one - mentions 44W charging.",
    "That\u2019s a huge upgrade on the 15W charging offered by the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite, and in line with the 45W charging delivered by the full-fat Samsung Galaxy Tab S7. However, based on this listing you won\u2019t get a 44W charger with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite.",
    "In fact, it\u2019s not totally clear whether you\u2019ll get any charger at all \u2013 MyFixGuide suggests you won\u2019t, with this slate following in the footsteps of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range in that sense, but the site also claims to have found reference to a 15W charger that you\u2019d be able to buy separately.",
    "We\u2019re not sure why that would be listed alongside the tablet if it\u2019s not bundled though, especially as Samsung offers faster chargers than that for sale. But that brings us to the second issue \u2013 the fastest Samsung charger you can buy is a 25W one, so to get 44W charging speeds from the Tab S7 Lite you\u2019d presumably need to buy a third-party charger.",
    "It\u2019s a strange situation, but it\u2019s understandable that Samsung would want to cut costs for a slate that\u2019s designed to be a \u2018Lite\u2019 model \u2013 and if there\u2019s really no charger bundled at all then that could be beneficial to the environment as well.",
    "While we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt for now, 3C certifications usually have accurate information, so it\u2019s likely at least that the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite will support 44W charging \u2013 and that you won\u2019t be able to get those speeds out of the box.",
    "We\u2019ll probably find out for sure soon, as the tablet is rumored to be landing in June \u2013 possibly alongside the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Lite Plus.",
