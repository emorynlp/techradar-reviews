    "Windows 10 has received an emergency patch to cure a problem hitting a minority of folks running one of the latest versions of Microsoft\u2019s OS, and it\u2019s a bug that causes the Xbox Game Pass to be seriously messed up.",
    "Microsoft deployed the out-of-band patch KB5004476 for Windows 10 May 2021 Update users, as well as those on the October 2020 Update and May 2020 Update, who are suffering from a bug that means they cannot play (or install) Xbox Game Pass games.",
    "Microsoft explains: \u201cThis update addresses an issue in which attempting to install or open an Xbox Game Pass game on your Windows 10 device, you might be redirected to the Microsoft Store page for Gaming Services.\u201d",
    "You\u2019ll also be graced with one of those fun cryptic error messages (in this case, error 0x80073D26 or 0x8007139F).",
    "Microsoft notes that only a \u2018small number\u2019 of devices are affected, but if you\u2019re hit with this problem, you need to download KB5004476 which is an optional update. Find it under Windows Update, where you can click \u2018View optional updates\u2019 (you may have to hit \u2018Check for updates\u2019 first).",
    "Those who don\u2019t have any problem with their Xbox Game Pass should steer clear, as the sole purpose of this small patch is to fix this one issue; so if you aren\u2019t affected by it, you won\u2019t gain any benefit from the update.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s latest cumulative update for Windows 10 \u2013 the monthly round of patching for June \u2013 has also been causing issues for some folks, messing up the taskbar and also interfering with the operation of printers.",
