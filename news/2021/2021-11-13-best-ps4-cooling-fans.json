    "Looking for the best PS4 cooling stations to keep your system from getting overly hot and noisy? Then look no further. As PS4 games have become more ambitious and graphically intensive, the PlayStation 4 console, more specifically its fans, has often struggled to keep up with the strain of running major AAA titles.",
    "If you\u2019re tired of your console sounding like a jet engine, then external PS4 cooling stations and fans could help keep your console quiet by increasing airflow, helping to take the strain off the PS4's internal fans. This means that noise from internal cooling components shouldn\u2019t reach absurd levels and, alongside simply keeping your PS4 well ventilated and air dusted occasionally, cooling fans and stations could lead to a potentially longer console lifespan.",
    "Generally, a good cooling station won\u2019t cost you the world but Black Friday 2021 and Cyber Monday could be a chance to pick one up for an especially low price. Or you could look out for a tempting bundle for the better-ventilated PS5 console.",
    "If you\u2019d rather stick with your PS4, though, and want to get the most of it then definitely consider an external cooling accessory. We\u2019ve put together a list of the best PS4 cooling stations, fans and stands on the market that should suit a range of budgets and needs.",
    "One of the PS4\u2019s most successful accessories has been Playstation VR. Sony has sold over a whopping five million units of its virtual reality headsets and made the once niche technology mainstream. In comparison, that\u2019s a better sales rate than the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. For such a premium device, it was sold for noticeably cheaper as well.",
    "Considering the resources needed to run games in VR, it\u2019s best to keep your PS4 and its headset processing unit as ventilated as possible. ElecGear\u2019s all encompassing cooling station is a premium accessory for a premium hardware set up. A simple off/on switch offers solid cooling through duo fans. Alongside chargers for standard DualShock 4 controllers, the station features two more chargers for Playstation Move controllers. Four USB ports at the front should be more than enough. There\u2019s even a hanger for a pair of over-the-ear headphones. The only thing that would make this absolutely perfect would be slots for game cases.",
    "Anyone looking for a fully functional PS4 cooling station with value should look toward the Kootek Vertical Stand. This vertical stand features three cooling fans that should provide plenty of extra heat dissipation. The stand also features dual-charging ports for DualShock 4 controllers and case holders big enough for twelve game cases. Too bad the USB ports don\u2019t work unless the PS4 is fully turned on. Regardless, it\u2019s probably one of the best bang-for-buck within cooling station offerings for the console and it works for all PS4 models from original to Pro variants.",
    "Those looking for something incredibly cheap in the console cooling department should look into Kingtop\u2019s stand. There\u2019s plenty to love about this incredibly affordable stand which features two fans that offer both high and low settings that doesn\u2019t require using any of the front USB ports. This means it can be powered with any standard USB port. However, the case doesn\u2019t seem too sturdy in keeping the console in place so be mindful of where the set-up is placed.",
    "OIVO\u2019s cooling stand works for all PS4 models and is feature packed. Alongside two cooling fans, the base features a metal bottom instead of plastic. This means some serious console ventilation. Instead of using the micro-USB port, the cooling stand utilizes faster charging through the Dualshock 4\u2019s EXT Port. Anyone looking for real quality within their cooling stand should look no further.",
    "PS4 Pro owners looking for a simple cooling set-up should find much usage out of the Linkstyle Cooling Fan. While most rear external cooling fans utilize the console\u2019s power-port, this one is powered through USB. This allows the five fans to run under a normal speed and faster turbo speed for games demanding more power. There\u2019s also an automatic mode for when the PS4 Pro gets too hot. The PS4 Pro already runs at decent decimals even under heavy load compared to the base model. This cooling fan might work best for those looking to preserve their console as long as possible."
