    "After many months of teases and speculation, Facebook\u2019s range of smart glasses is finally here \u2013 and as a Ray-Ban collaboration that packs a built-in camera and portable battery into the lifestyle brand\u2019s classic silhouettes, it has a level of style and prestige far beyond the clunky Google Glass models of years past.",
    "Retailing for $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$449, and launching today (September 9), these smart glasses mark Facebook\u2019s latest foray into consumer hardware, and come amid a wave of successes in that area, with the Facebook-owned Oculus becoming the de facto VR headset manufacturer for our times.",
    "It\u2019s notable, firstly, that these smart glasses are called \u2018Ray-Ban Stories\u2019 \u2013 also a nod to Instagram\u2019s Stories feature, we assume \u2013 immediately positioning them as lifestyle products first and wearables second. It\u2019s no surprise, though, that Facebook might want to piggyback the credibility of Ray-Ban rather than rely solely on its own controversial reputation as a data-hungry social media and advertising giant.",
    "There are plenty of us who have been waiting for smart glasses to catch on in the technology world, but there have always been obstacles in the way \u2013 ostensibly the indifference of everyday consumers, who largely don\u2019t see the fuss of expensive and awkward peripherals in order to enhance their digital habits.",
    "Smart glasses have long occupied a \u2018geeksumer\u2019 position \u2013 even if they\u2019re affordable to those with disposable income, they clearly mark their users out as niche technology enthusiasts rather than everyday buyers, and manufacturers generally struggle to make them feel like cool lifestyle products.",
    "But Ray-Ban Stories is well placed to change people\u2019s minds about this. A high asking price aside, these smart glasses are relatively flexible in their usage, being able to push photos and videos easily to various Facebook-owned apps (or be downloaded onto your phone for use elsewhere).",
    "A comfortable fit, intuitive inputs and decent call quality, too, will go a long way towards making the Stories feel like everyday devices rather than oddball gadgets made purely for tech obsessives.",
    "They also benefit from the design stylings of Ray-Ban, and may be able to piggyback into the mainstream through the solid reputation of the beloved and long-running sunglasses brand \u2013 especially when taking the variety of styles and even prescription lenses options into account.",
    "We go into more detail in our full Ray-Ban Stories review \u2013 but there\u2019s a big problem that needs to be addressed here, and it\u2019s that Snap has pretty much done this already.",
    "In 2016, Snap Inc released its first-ever pair of Spectacles \u2013 smart glasses with a pair of built-in cameras and a cutesy, rounded shape that you could buy in vending machines that appeared across the US, before sales kicked off online. The flurry of consumer interest around the Spectacles has all but trickled out since that high point, though, despite three successive releases in 2018 and 2019, and a firm repositioning of Snap as a \u2018camera company\u2019 rather than simply a purveyor of social media.",
    "There are some key differences between Ray-Ban Stories and the Spectacles \u2013 mostly in the latter\u2019s circular footage and VR recording capability. (As one Snap press release puts it, \u201cThe images from both cameras combine to build a geometric map of the world around you. With this new sense of depth perception, you can experience \u2013 and reimagine \u2013 your memories like never before.\u201d)",
    "But the underlying idea is the same, as a hardware peripheral that turns tinted glasses into a social-ready camera for sharing quick videos \u2013 with the \u2018Rounded\u2019 Stories design looking almost identical to the original 2016 Spectacles. Battery life is similar, offering around four hours of charge through the USB-C charging case.",
    "When pushed on this point in a briefing, Monisha Perkash \u2013 Director of Product Management at Facebook Reality Labs \u2013 asserts that \u201cWe think Ray-Ban Stories is quite differentiated\u2026 We think these will be the first smart glasses that people will want to buy.\u201d And both points may well be true.",
    "We spoke to Snap about the incoming competition from Facebook, and while the company wouldn\u2019t be drawn to comment on the matter directly, it did give some useful insight into who Spectacles are really for these days.",
    "\u201cSpecs 1 and 2 were very much seen as consumer devices. Specs 3, while available for sale, was a fashion forward, creator focused product, and Specs 4 is not a consumer product,\u201d we\u2019re told.",
    "There\u2019s been a clear trajectory, from the consumer market Facebook is still targeting, to the influencer and business-oriented gadget that Spectacles has now become. As a Snap blog post back in May states, \u201cSpectacles aren\u2019t for sale \u2014 they\u2019re for augmented reality creators to reimagine the way we communicate, live and explore the world together through AR experiences built-in Lens Studio.\u201d",
    "Facebook\u2019s smart glasses, with their mainstream design and basic in-app image/video editing capability, appear to be chasing the market Snap has already given up on.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has\u2026 paid close attention to Snapchat\u2019s releases. It\u2019s widely accepted that Facebook mimicked the Snapchat app\u2019s disappearing stories feature for both the Facebook platform itself and Instagram (whose CEO admitted as such).",
    "By all accounts, good ideas get copied all the time \u2013 especially in social media \u2013 and that stories mechanic has been so popular that even Twitter recently tried (and failed) to introduce its own \u2018Fleets\u2019 spin on it.",
    "But it also doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The Facebook-owned Oculus has been a huge innovator in the mixed reality space, leaving competitors like HTC, HP and Vive trailing behind. So it\u2019s a shame that, in the world of smart glasses, Facebook\u2019s new challenger largely redoes the first Spectacles iteration instead of bringing many new ideas to the table.",
    "Zuckerberg previously teased a lot of \u201cneat things\u201d the Ray-Ban Stories would do, but it\u2019s clear that the real potential for these devices is in the long term.",
    "Ray-Ban Stories is just the start for Facebook, especially when it comes to AR, or augmented reality, which would \u2013 in a future iteration of these smart glasses \u2013 no doubt be able to blend the digital and physical world in a more sci-fi fashion than simply recording camera footage for sharing on your social media feeds.",
    "Giaia Rener, Ray-Ban\u2019s Global Brand Director, says that \u201cwe have a multi year partnership with Facebook,\u201d so it\u2019s clear that \u2013 as fleshed-out as this launch is \u2013 there\u2019s only more to come.",
    "Facebook also tells us that \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that we want to build always-available AR glasses \u2013 but the technology to deliver true consumer-ready AR glasses is still years-off. Today\u2019s launch is about taking great glasses and style you already know and love and making them *more* useful. We really think people have a lot to gain through a device that offers hands-free capture and listening, and they\u2019ll only get better from here. We hope these are an important step toward normalizing smart glasses and addressing important questions from consumers.\u201d",
    "True AR experiences baked into smart glasses aren\u2019t here yet, then, but we can look to the Oculus Quest 2, which recently gained a firmware update to enable AR developers to start making content for the device \u2013 via the \u2018passthrough\u2019 camera tech that lets VR users look outside of the headset and see their surroundings.",
    "AR games aren\u2019t flooding the Oculus platform yet, but Facebook is preparing its vast Oculus install base for a time when they are \u2013 and it will almost certainly be the same with the Ray-Ban Stories. If these smart glasses gain any traction, Facebook will have an audience used to such devices that it can start pushing AR experiences to.",
    "It\u2019s just a shame that, after having the wherewithal and resources to launch not one, but four iterations of the Spectacles before anyone else, Snap\u2019s innovative ideas could be overwritten by its heavyweight competitor."
