    "WhatsApp may be primarily about text, video and voice-based chat, but image-based is also important. We're not just talking the photos you send back and forth with friends and family, but also the emoji and stickers that can be used to liven up a conversation.",
    "Like many messaging platforms, WhatsApp supports the sending of stickers in chats, and there are a host of these fun addition available to download from \u2013 of course \u2013 the WhatsApp Sticker Store. New sticker collections are added all the time, and now six new packs have made their way to the store for you to grab.",
    "Weighing in at less than 5MB a pack, these whimsical stickers can help you convey and idea or feeling when mere words simply won't cut it.
