    "Voice over IP (VoIP) has become the preferred method for businesses to communicate vocally, both internally and with customers and partners. So it's no wonder VoIP headsets have surged in popularity alongside this time-tested way to manage large scale business communications.",
    "Whether you\u2019re looking for yourself or for an entire team, it\u2019s important to have a VoIP headset that facilitates communication. This becomes especially important when the user is in a busy office environment or a home office prone to distraction.",
    "The best way to do this is to focus on a few key factors that can make or break a VoIP headset\u2019s overall performance. To this end, we\u2019ve tested dozens of models to find the best VoIP headsets, focusing on stable connectivity, comfort, price, and of course clear audio quality. Each of these headphones brings something to the table, so be sure to read through the whole review to find the best fit for your needs.",
    "For example, if you work in a noisy or open-office environment, check out the Jabra Evolve 75 with its exceptional noise cancellation. If you\u2019re on a tight budget, then the Logitech H600 offers great value for money, without sacrificing audio quality. And if outstanding audio and microphone quality is a deciding factor, Sennheiser\u2019s MB 660 UC MS has you covered, with 30-hour battery life to boot. Read on to discover more great VoIP headsets.",
    "We chose the Jabra Evolve 75 for a few reasons, not least because it\u2019s quite comfortable. The materials are of a high quality, and the design, while utilitarian, is smooth, streamlined, and feels agreeable in the hands and on the ears.",
    "But the Jabra Evolve 75 has more to offer than just comfort. While the audio output isn\u2019t the best in the industry (higher ranges come through a bit tinny), the noise cancellation itself is impressive. If you\u2019re looking for a distraction-free experience in the middle of a busy, open workspace, the Evolve 75 won\u2019t disappoint.",
    "The microphone is found on the right side, on a flexible boom arm that can be affixed to the band (with a magnet) when not in use. The Evolve 75\u2019s mic demonstrated excellent performance in capturing and transmitting audio\u2014a must for any VoIP headset worth its salt. There are a few missing features\u2014no play/pause/skip music control, for example\u2014but the Evolve 75 still ticks a lot of boxes, and is a solid choice in terms of comfort and noise cancellation.",
    "Read our full Jabra Evolve 75 review.",
    "The Poly Blackwire 720\u2019s design takes a departure from your standard bulky-headset-with-boom style, instead opting for a sleek and very lightweight form factor that makes it quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, even all day long.",
    "The ability to turn on and off active noise cancellation also makes it easier to keep your headphones on, as you can simply turn off noise cancellation rather than removing the headphones as needed. It\u2019s also a good set of headphones for listening to music, with full media controls: mute, play, pause, forward, and back.",
    "Despite being integrated into the body of the earpiece, the audio capture is quite good. The Poly Blackwire 7225 features four omni-directional microphones that do a good job differentiating between ambient and directed noise, so your voice comes through clearly on calls. If you keep your headphones on all day for music and calls, this is a good choice for you.",
    "Sennheiser is known for outstanding audio quality, and the MB 660 doesn\u2019t disappoint. It stands out as a truly excellent set of headphones for music, VoIP calls, and everything in-between. Built-in noise cancelling and multiple microphones make for crystal-clear VoIP calls in both directions. You can also choose between sound modes (Movie, Director, Club, and Speech) for the best sound for your environment.",
    "The foldable design makes it easy to carry in a bag or suitcase, and it\u2019s built from premium-quality materials for maximum comfort. You can easily spend all day on calls without significant discomfort. The battery will have no trouble keeping up, either: it can last a full 30 hours between charges. Those batteries are also covered by the device\u2019s two-year warranty, by the way.",
    "While the Sennheiser MB 660 UC MS isn\u2019t the cheapest VoIP headset on the market (you can expect to pay up to $350), it is one of the best, especially if sound quality is a deciding factor for you.",
    "The Logitech H600 has a simple design, is made from humble materials, and is cheap enough to fit just about any budget. That doesn\u2019t mean the H600 has made any big concessions in sound quality or functionality, though. The battery lasts for a full 6 hours, which should be enough to get most people through the workday, and the fold-up design makes it easy to take between work and home.",
    "The H600 is fully wireless, syncing through a USB dongle (nano receiver)\u2014it\u2019s small, so be careful not to lose it: the headphones can\u2019t work without it. The sound, while not exceptional, is sufficient for meetings and calls, and the headphone\u2019s drivers have been laser-tuned to minimize distortion.",
    "The Logitech H600 has fewer bells and whistles than some of the other headsets on this list, and the range isn\u2019t superb, but the price can\u2019t be beaten, and the sound quality is still respectable.",
    "Not everybody needs\u2014or wants\u2014a wireless, Bluetooth VoIP headset. If that\u2019s the case, you may want to check out the LifeChat LX-6000. The cable comes with mute and volume controls, and reaches about 7 feet (2.15m), so you can still get up and pace the room. The stereo audio quality is more than good enough for VoIP calls, and with active noise cancellation, calls come through crystal-clear.",
    "The design is simple, although the headband and ear pads may cause some discomfort after long periods of use\u2014these are good headphones for occasional calls, but if you spend all day on the phone or want to use them to listen to music, the Poly Blackwire 7225 on this list may be a better fit (literally).",
    "Nonetheless, this is a great plug-and-play budget option. It\u2019s comfortable enough if you\u2019re not wearing it all day, and it\u2019s got good sound quality to boot."
