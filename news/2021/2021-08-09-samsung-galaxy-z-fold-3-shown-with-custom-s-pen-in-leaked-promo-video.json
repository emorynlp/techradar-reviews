  "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 both leak in official Samsung video.",
  "article": [
    "If there was anything left to see of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 ahead of their very likely launches at Samsung Unpacked on August 11, well, we probably just saw it in a video leaked by the phonemaker itself. And it shows the custom S Pen that\u2019s been long-rumored to come to the Z Fold 3.",
    "Samsung Malaysia\u2019s YouTube account reportedly uploaded a short video showing off both foldables and swiftly took it down, but not before it was screencapped and posted to the r/GalaxyFold subreddit. The short video has all the hallmarks of Samsung promotional videos, so we\u2019d suspect it\u2019s authentic, though it\u2019s always possible a crafty creator went through the trouble of aping Samsung\u2019s style with very authentic-looking renders.",
    "The clip was quickly uploaded elsewhere, including on Twitter:",
    "The video purportedly shows both foldables in action for only a few seconds each, but revealed plenty in that time. It demonstrated a roulette of apps on the clamshell Z Flip 3\u2019s exterior screen (which is much larger than the outer display on its predecessors), but most of the 30-plus-second runtime was devoted to the Z Fold 3 and stylus functionality. Notably, the foldable can seemingly split apps between halves of the inner display, which is neat.",
    "There\u2019s even more detail in the video than you might think \u2013 user u/paxinfernum, who uploaded the video, noted that the fine print in the shot with the stylus reads:",
    "\u201cS Pen Pro and S Pen Fold Edition sold separately. Only use the Samsung S Pen Pro or S Pen Fold Edition designed exclusively for Galaxy Z Fold3. All other S Pens or stylus pens not designed for Galaxy Z Fold3 (including those by other manufacturers) may damage the screen. Certain applications may not support multitasking. Flex mode supported at angles between 75\u00b0 and 115\u00b0.\u201d",
    "But it\u2019s the S Pen news that\u2019s more intriguing, as the disclaimer suggests only the long-expected S Pen Pro and the S Pen Fold Edition will apparently work with the Z Fold 3 display. It\u2019s unclear why, but perhaps they\u2019re less harsh on the foldable\u2019s screen than prior styluses meant to work on glass displays. In any case, leaker Max Weinbach claimed that the Z Fold 3 itself will detect a non-compatible S Pen being used and warn users from doing so:",
    "It\u2019s nice to see some kind of confirmation that the Z Fold 3 will get its own S Pen, which is one of the top new features we\u2019ve heard about the foldable \u2013 and a reason to get this version over the Z Fold 2. Moreover, it could suggest that Samsung has custom functionality in mind for the new version rather than just adding compatibility to shoehorn the Z Fold 3 into its lineup as a Note 21 alternative.",
    "And yes, both foldables look much like they do in the myriad design leaks and rumors showing what we expect the devices to look like.",
