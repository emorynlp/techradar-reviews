    "Spoilers for the latest episode of WandaVision follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "Home video footage, a pop punk theme song\u2026",
    "Wanda and Vision\u2019s twin sons, Tommy and Billy, guide us around their house in some late \u201990s or early \u201900s-appropriate opening credits \u2013 albeit with Wanda and Vision bringing some superpowers to the conventional suburban template. \u201cDon\u2019t try to fight the chaos, don\u2019t question what you\u2019ve done,\u201d says the song. \u201cIf it\u2019s all an illusion, sit back and enjoy the show. Let\u2019s keep it going through each distorted day.\u201d Wanda\u2019s brother, Pietro, also gets an \u201cas himself\u201d credit.",
    "It\u2019s Halloween, and Billy \u2013 dressed in a red cape \u2013 talks to the camera. He\u2019s discussing the joys of dressing up and pretending to be someone else for a day. Tommy \u2013 dressed in standard \u201990s attire \u2013 counters that Halloween is all about candy. And scaring people.",
    "Billy asks where Tommy\u2019s costume is. He says he\u2019s wearing it, he\u2019s the cool twin, after all. \u201cWhat does that make me?\u201d Billy asks. A flashback shows the boys dancing to a dancing game. Tommy calls his brother a \u201cdorksaurus rex\u201d.",
    "Pietro is snoring on the sofa \u2013 at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Tommy says Billy is scared that their uncle might secretly be a vampire. Pietro leaps up from the couch at super-speed, pretending to be a bloodsucker, chasing them around the living room.",
    "Wanda comes downstairs dressed in Scarlet Witch\u2019s traditional comic book costume. The boys ask if she\u2019s Old Red Riding Hood \u2013 Pietro just snorts. She says she\u2019s a Sokovian fortune teller. Pietro says the look is lame and worse than the costumes their mother made when they had typhus. Another flashback shows Wanda and Pietro being given a fish \u201cto share\u201d when trick or treating, though Wanda says that\u2019s not exactly how she remembers it\u2026",
    "Billy tells the camera that mom has been weird since Uncle Pietro arrived. \u201cI think it\u2019s because she hasn\u2019t seen him in a long time, and he\u2019s what you\u2019d call \u2018a man child\u2019.\u201d",
    "Vision comes downstairs dressed in his traditional costume from the comics \u2013 Pietro suggests he\u2019s come as a \u201cbooger\u201d.",
    "Vision points out that Wanda never told him much about her brother. As Pietro plays videogames and downs cans of soft drinks, Vision says he never knew he was so good with kids. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s just full of surprises,\u201d says Wanda.",
    "Vision leaves, telling Wanda to \u201chave fun tonight, darling\u201d. She had no idea he had other plans, but he says he\u2019s working for the Neighborhood Watch tonight.",
    "Billy tells the camera that \u201cMom and dad have been, not fighting, just, like, different.\u201d",
    "Wanda tells Vision he has to be there for the boys\u2019 first Halloween. \u201cUncle P\u201d says it\u2019s no problem, he can fill the hole. Vision leaves, saying he can \u201csmell crime\u201d.",
    "Pietro sneaks up on Wanda, asking for water balloons to fill with shaving cream \u2013 before sprinting off and instantly returning in his comic book costume. Tommy is dressed identically, like a Quicksilver Mini-Me. \u201cJust remember that this is a respectable family,\u201d Wanda reminds them.",
    "Outside the \u2018Hex\u2019, Hayward asks for a \u201cfull work-up\u201d on the armed drone Wanda carried beyond the energy field. Rambeau confronts him, saying he cut them off at the knees by sending in the missile. He says they now know what they\u2019re dealing with. Darcy calls Hayward, \u201cthe guy who almost got murdered by his own murder squad\u201d. Hayward asks if she works for him. She replies that she isn\u2019t sure, but Rambeau says Darcy is with her. \u201cAnd which one of you is the sassy best friend?\u201d Hayward taunts.",
    "Hayward says that Wanda is never going to negotiate, that the only way to end the Westview situation is to take her out. Monica points out that they don\u2019t know what will happen if Wanda dies, and that they can\u2019t outgun her. \u201cIf Wanda is the problem she has to be our solution.\u201d",
    "Hayward tells Rambeau she\u2019s become an impediment to the mission, \u201cconstantly advocating on behalf of super-powered individuals\u201d. He acknowledges her history with Carol Danvers, but says that those who \u201cleft\u201d during the Blip don\u2019t know what it was like keeping things together during that five years, and still \u201chave the luxury of optimism\u201d.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t use the last five years as an excuse to be a coward,\u201d Monica tells him. Hayward says it\u2019s a good job she wasn\u2019t here when her mother died, \u201cbecause clearly you don\u2019t have the stomach for this job\u201d. He orders the removal of Rambeau, Agent Woo and Darcy.",
    "As they\u2019re escorted off the base, Rambeau says Hayward was looking for an excuse to remove them \u2013 he\u2019s up to something. Woo and Rambeau take down their guards, completely surprising Darcy. They dress in the soldiers\u2019 uniforms and head back onto the base.",
    "In Westview, the family take to the packed streets for trick or treating. Wanda asks Pietro about a kid in the orphanage who had \u201cthe skin thing\u201d. Pietro says she\u2019s testing him and that he knows he looks different. Wanda asks why he looks different. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d he responds. \u201cIf I found Shangri-La, I wouldn\u2019t want to be reminded of the past either.\u201d",
    "Pietro offers to help the boys maximize their \u201ccandy acquisition\u201d at superspeed. \u201cKick-ass!\u201d says Tommy \u2013 confusing Wanda.",
    "Wanda approaches Herb, who\u2019s dressed as Frankenstein\u2019s Monster. He\u2019s on Neighborhood Watch patrol \u2013 and completely misses Pietro and the boys stealing candy, smashing lanterns and covering everyone in silly string. He tells Wanda that Vision isn\u2019t on duty today. \u201cIs there something I can do, Wanda?\u201d he asks. \u201cDo you want something changed?\u201d",
    "Vision walks into the outskirts of town. He sees one a couple decorating their front garden but they\u2019re behaving weirdly, repeatedly carrying out the same motion \u2013 as if they\u2019re automated.",
    "COMMERCIAL BREAK! An animated child sits alone on a desert island, saying \u201cI\u2019m so hungry, I\u2019d eat anything.\u201d A shark jumps out of the water on a surfboard, offering a pot of Yo-Magic. Over time, the kid struggles to get into the dessert, wasting away to the point where he\u2019s a skeleton. \u201cYo-Magic! The snack for survivors!\u201d",
    "Back in the show, Wanda has told the boys to return all the candy. She tells Pietro she can\u2019t believe what a bad influence he is. He says he\u2019s trying to do his part: \u201cCome to town unexpectedly, create tension with the brother-in-law, stir up trouble with the rugrats, and ultimately give you grief. That\u2019s what you wanted, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
    "Wanda asks what happened to his accent \u2013 he asks her the same question. He says details are fuzzy \u2013 he remembers being shot and the next thing he knows, Wanda is calling him. Tommy runs off at super speed to grab more candy \u2013 he has his uncle\u2019s powers. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna break the sound barrier, take your brother with you,\u201d says Wanda, before reminding them not to go past Ellis Avenue.",
    "In the outside world, Woo, Rambeau and Darcy break back into the SWORD base. Darcy starts hacking into Hayward\u2019s devices. She discovers that Hayward has discovered a way to look past the boundary \u2013 the program is tracking the decay signature of Vision\u2019s vibranium body. He can also monitor the Westview residents in Vision\u2019s immediate vicinity. Woo notices that the people near the edge of town are barely moving. \u201cAre they alive?\u201d he asks.",
    "Back in Westview, Vision continues his exploration of the outskirts of town. The people here are completely stationary. He asks a woman staring at her children if she\u2019s waiting for something.",
    "Vision transforms himself into his true form and flies into the sky, looking down on the town. He spots a car waiting at the junction of Ellis Avenue and Rolling Hill Road. It\u2019s Agnes \u2013 she\u2019s lost, even though she\u2019s lived in Westview her whole life. She\u2019s also behaving like a robot \u2013 with none of her usual larger-than-life spark.",
    "He touches her head to \u2018wake\u2019 her. Agnes instantly recognizes that he\u2019s one of the Avengers \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re Vision!\u201d She asks if he\u2019s here to help them. He says he is Vision, he wants to help, but has no idea what an Avenger is. Agnes asks if she\u2019s dead. When Vision asks why she\u2019d think that, she replies \u201cBecause you are.\u201d \u201cDead!\u201d she says repeatedly.",
    "He tells her that it\u2019s his intention to reach those outside Westview and make sense of what\u2019s going on. Agnes tells her nobody leaves, that Wanda won\u2019t even let them think about it. \u201cAll is lost!\u201d she laughs. He returns her to normal and promises to fix it. Agnes drives away from Ellis Avenue \u2013 seemingly the barrier of Wanda\u2019s influence. Vision walks off into the distance.",
    "Monica checks her messages and says her way back into the \u2018Hex\u2019 will be there in an hour \u2013 she\u2019s going to meet her guy over the ridge. Darcy says Monica can\u2019t go back into the \u2018Hex\u2019, however. Monica thinks the worst-case scenario is that, \u201cWanda removes my free will and puts me in ultra-low rise jeans\u201d, but it\u2019s worse than that. Darcy says that going through the barrier twice has re-written her cells on a molecular level twice. \u201cIt\u2019s changing you.\u201d",
    "Monica says she knows what Wanda is feeling, and won\u2019t stop until she helps her.",
    "Rambeau and Woo leave but Darcy says she\u2019s not going \u2013 she believes there\u2019s something big on Hayward\u2019s computer she hasn\u2019t found yet.",
    "Pietro says their parents would have loved it in Westview, before asking where Wanda was hiding all the kids until now. He says she was always the empathetic twin, and says she handled the ethical implications of the scenario as best she could \u2013 keeping families and couples together, most personalities aren\u2019t far from what\u2019s underneath, people got better jobs\u2026",
    "\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks. He says he\u2019s impressed, that \u201cit\u2019s a pretty big leap from giving people nightmares and shooting red wiggly-woos out of your hands\u201d. He asks how she even did all this, emphasizing that she can trust him. She says she doesn\u2019t know how she did it, that she only remembers feeling completely alone and empty: \u201cEndless nothingness\u201d.",
    "She looks at Pietro and he\u2019s suddenly walking corpse, bullet holes and bloodstains on his outfit.",
    "When she looks back he\u2019s back to normal.",
    "Darcy finds Hayward\u2019s \u2018Eyes Only\u2019 files \u2013 \u201cCataract: Classified Weapons Intel\u201d. She sees Vision approaching the perimeter and wonders what he\u2019s doing. Hayward orders his troops to move out.",
    "Vision forces his way through the energy field. SWORD agents are waiting for him. Darcy runs out of the base to see him struggling. \u201cHe really does want out, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d says Hayward.",
    "Darcy notices that Vision\u2019s body is disintegrating and tells SWORD to \u201cStop! He\u2019s coming apart!\u201d She\u2019s taken into and handcuffed to a vehicle.",
    "Billy hears the conversation and unexpectedly uses telekinetic powers to stop Tommy running around. He calls for Wanda, telling her he hears his father\u2019s voice in his head. Vision tells SWORD the people inside the boundary need help.",
    "Pietro tells Wanda not to worry. \u201cIt\u2019s not like your dead husband can die twice.\u201d She throws him out of the way with an energy burst. Billy says he sees soldiers and believes Vision is dying.",
    "Wanda freezes the town residents and directs her powers elsewhere. Woo notices that the energy field is expanding, so Rambeau puts her foot on the accelerator. The SWORD agents on the perimeter retreat. The energy field engulfs Vision, restoring his usual form, before surrounding Darcy. A helicopter is turned into a hot air balloon and the SWORD tents turned into circus tents \u2013 its agents are now clowns. Hayward speeds away, asking if anyone reads him \u2013 no response.",
    "Wanda\u2019s red eyes power down.",
    "PLEASE STAND BY.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Anyone expecting instant answers about Wanda\u2019s brother, Pietro, turning up on the doorstep, is going to be disappointed. While the fact he looks entirely different is acknowledged \u2013 original MCU Quicksilver Aaron Taylor-Johnson even appears briefly in the \u2018Previously on WandaVision\u2026\u2019 recap \u2013 no explanation is given on screen. In fact, \u2018All-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u2019 revels in posing more and more questions \u2013 luckily, it\u2019s built around the sort of mysteries that make you want to come back for more.",
    "Who precisely is this Pietro Maximoff? Is he an artificial construct Wanda has created, to act as a confidant in her simulation? Or is he something more sinister, an entity designed to infiltrate her world and eliminate her as a threat? The fact he\u2019s asking so many questions about what\u2019s going on suggests there\u2019s more to this Quicksilver than zany comic relief. Could he have something to do with Cataract, the classified weapons intel Darcy finds on Hayward\u2019s computer? Or is Wanda just a big fan of the X-Men movies?",
    "Vision\u2019s journey into the outskirts of Westview also adds to the growing sense of intrigue, as he meets zombie townsfolk behaving like robots \u2013 seeing Agnes with her personality removed is particularly jarring. It\u2019s enough to drive him to make a suicidal bid for freedom, his heroic impulse to save the Westview residents overcoming any sense of self-preservation. He\u2019s unfortunate that this brings him face to face with Hayward, a man whose conscience seems to be slowly ebbing away \u2013 though we do get a glimpse of the resentment Blip survivors might feel towards those who skipped five years of hardship on Earth.",
    "With Wanda expanding the \u2018Hex\u2019 to rescue Vision, the key battleground is now outside the energy field, where Rambeau and Woo are racing to find the mystery scientist friend who may be able to help her get back inside Westview. But should she risk it? While she\u2019ll undoubtedly be eager for a Westview-based reunion with Darcy \u2013 who's already more than quippy enough to hold her own in a snarky sitcom environment \u2013 it looks like another trip into the Hex could be extremely dangerous for her. It\u2019ll either kill her or turn her into a superhero\u2026",
    "This is the sort of episode that doesn\u2019t function at all in isolation, yet is a necessary part of any serial arc. It\u2019s a precision-engineered bridge that serves as the perfect set-up for the final act of the WandaVision story.",
    "And besides, Halloween is a brilliant excuse to get Marvel superheroes in their classic, cheesy comic book outfits.",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
