Now though, the Korean hardware giant has increased its size substantially with a new 43-inch model. The 43-inch M7 features a 4K Ultra-High Definition (UHD) display that can seamlessly switch from a work from home device to a 4k entertainment hub with built-in streaming apps, speakers and HDR10 capabilities.",
    "Samsung has also updated its M5 Smart Monitor range with a new sleek and stylish white design for both its 27- and 32-inch models. The new design will help the business monitor blend in and add a finishing touch of color to any interior aesthetic. Those looking for a more compact monitor with the same smart features are in luck as Samsung is launching a new 24-inch version of its M5 Smart Monitor designed to be more accessible in terms of both size and pricing.",

Finding something to watch will also be easier as Samsung's Universal Guide now offers content recommendations based on user preferences and viewing patterns.",
    "While Samsung's original smart monitors only supported Bixby as a voice assistant, the company's new models also support Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The company's smart monitors also support Microsoft 365 applications so that users can view and edit documents and even same them to the cloud without a PC connection.",
    "When it comes to connectivity, the Samsung Smart Monitor Lineup features numerous options for connecting PCs and smartphones.
