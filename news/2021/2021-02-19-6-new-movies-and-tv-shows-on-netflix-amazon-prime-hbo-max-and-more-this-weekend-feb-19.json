    "This is a pretty busy week for streaming services, with Netflix, Apple TV Plus, HBO Max and Hulu all having something new to check out. We've trimmed down this weekend's streaming offerings to six highlights, and below we'll let you know how to stream each of them in the US and the UK (wherever possible).",
    "From historical dramas to psychological thrillers and even a potential Oscar Best Picture winner, there's a lot that's worth adding to your watch list over the coming few days. This isn't the busiest time for big new TV shows \u2013 ongoing episodes of WandaVision are keeping us occupied \u2013 but in the golden age of streaming, it's never truly quiet.",
    "Here's what you can stream this weekend.",
    "While it may have a love triangle at its core, this new miniseries is definitely one for the weekend after Valentine\u2019s day. Based on the novel of the same name, this twist-heavy psychological thriller tells the story of Louise \u2013 played by Simona Brown \u2013 who finds herself caught between her new boss and lover David, and an unlikely friend in David\u2019s wife Adele.",
    "The critical response has been pretty mixed, but if you like twists that will have you screaming at the TV screen, this is one to consider.",
    "Now streaming on Netflix",
    "\"What if the space race had never ended?\", asks this solid, well-cast alternate universe series from Battlestar Galactica overseer Ronald D Moore. Set in a world where the Soviet Union landed on the moon first, season 2 of For All Mankind jumps forward a decade, and takes the Cold War to a moon on the brink of armed conflict.",
    "Episodes of season 2 are rolling out weekly, and season 1 is already available to stream. There's also an AR story app set before season 2, if you've got an Apple device.",
    "Now streaming on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes releasing each week",
    "State guardianship isn\u2019t a topic many of us have thought of since that Last Week Tonight episode in 2018, but this dark comedy thriller from J. Blakeson thrusts it right back into the spotlight. Rosamund Pike stars as the utterly wicked Marla Grayson, an exploitative guardian who has bogus dementia diagnoses thrust on elderly patients and drains their bank accounts when she is trusted with their care. Her latest target might not be the typical \u2018sweet old lady\u2019 victim she\u2019s used to, however.",
    "The film currently sits at a healthy 84% score on Rotten Tomatoes, at the time of publication. If you live in the US, it's streaming on Netflix, but UK viewers can watch it on Amazon Prime Video.",
    "Now streaming on Netflix (US) and Amazon Prime Video (UK)",
    "Already touted as an Oscar contender, this feature film from Chlo\u00e9 Zhao \u2013 who's next directing the Marvel movie The Eternals \u2013 is about what it's like to be nomadic in the United States, adapting the nonfiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. Mixing both fictional characters and real-life nomads playing versions of themselves, we follow Fern (Frances McDormand), who has hit the road after losing her husband and job in a story that many might find relatable.",
    "This is a big coup for Hulu, which often has great original movies to watch, but sadly it won't be released in the UK until April.",
    "Now streaming on Hulu",
    "If you\u2019re looking to do a little learning this weekend, this new docuseries on the Fourteenth Amendment of the US constitution should do the trick.
