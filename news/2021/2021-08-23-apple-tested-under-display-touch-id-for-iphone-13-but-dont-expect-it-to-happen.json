  "article": [
    "Earlier this year we heard rumblings that Apple was working on an under-display fingerprint scanner, and the latest news suggests those rumblings were well founded \u2013 but that this feature might not ever make it onto an iPhone.",
    "That\u2019s according to Mark Gurman (a journalist with a good track record for Apple information). In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter for Bloomberg, he claims that Apple had been testing under-display Touch ID for the iPhone 13 range, but that it won\u2019t make the cut this year.",
    "In fact, Gurman went so far as to say that \u201cI believe Apple is all-in on Face ID for its higher-end iPhones and its long-term goal is to implement Face ID in the display itself.\" So that suggests we probably won\u2019t see under-display Touch ID on any iPhone if he\u2019s right, but that Apple will instead offer under-display Face ID \u2013 which is something else we\u2019ve heard rumored before.",
    "Presumably that would also mean the selfie camera going beneath the display, something we've seen on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean Face ID in its current visible form is going anywhere though, as Gurman suggested that lower-end iPhones \u2013 such as perhaps the iPhone SE 3 or future models in that range \u2013 would get the current version of Face ID, while high-end models, such as perhaps the iPhone 14 range, would get an under-display version.",
    "That suggests the days of Touch ID in any form could be numbered, since the iPhone SE (2020) for example has a home button with a Touch ID scanner built in, but if future models move to Face ID, they\u2019ll probably lose that feature. Of course, we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt for now, but Gurman tends to be fairly reliable.",
    "Face ID is great, and moving it under-display would eliminate the main downside of it \u2013 the need for a notch \u2013 but that\u2019s not the only downside.",
    "As many have discovered during the pandemic, it doesn\u2019t work so well when you\u2019re wearing a mask, prompting Apple to devise a workaround for Apple Watch owners. But those who don\u2019t own an Apple Watch are still out of luck here, and mask-wearing to some extent might well be here to stay.",
    "There are other situations where Face ID doesn\u2019t work perfectly either; some sunglasses can interfere with it for example.",
    "So while we don\u2019t want Face ID to go anywhere, having a convenient alternative for those times when it\u2019s not doing its job would be ideal. And no, entering your PIN is not what we consider convenient in 2021.",
    "So under-display Face ID coupled with an under-display fingerprint scanner would give you the best of both worlds, and should have no impact on the visual design of the phone.",
