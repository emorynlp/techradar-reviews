  "article": [
    "Google has been found to have misled Android mobile users in Australia around the collection of their location data, according to Australia\u2019s Federal Court.",
    "The court has ruled that when a new Google account was set up on an Android device between January 2017 and December 2018, users were misled into thinking that disabling \u2018location history\u2019 would completely stop the collection, storage and usage of their location data.",
    "This was despite the fact that a separate Google account setting, \u2018web and app activity\u2019, would still continue to collect, store and use personal location data. The \u2018web and app activity\u2019 setting was also switched on by default.",
    "The case was originally brought to court by Australia\u2019s consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), for what it deemed as deception to Google\u2019s users.",
    "In handing down his judgement, Justice Thomas Thawley told the court, \u201cI am satisfied that Google\u2019s conduct assessed as a whole was misleading or deceptive of, or likely to mislead or deceive, ordinary members within the class identified by the ACCC, acting reasonably.\u201d",
    "In a statement, the ACCC\u2019s Chair, Rod Sims said, \u201cThis is an important victory for consumers, especially anyone concerned about their privacy online, as the court\u2019s decision sends a strong message to Google and others that big businesses must not mislead their customers.\u201d",
    "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step to make sure digital platforms are up front with consumers about what is happening with their data and what they can do to protect it,\u201d he said.",
    "Penalties are expected to be determined at a later date. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the tech giant rejects many of the claims and, \u201care currently reviewing our options, including a possible appeal.\u201d",
    "According to Google, it collects your data to provide \u201cuseful, meaningful experiences\u201d. When Google says this, it\u2019s largely talking about tailoring its services to provide more personalized features.",
    "When it comes to your location data in particular, it isn\u2019t just used to help you with directions. Google might also use it to ensure your search results include places near you, or showing you what times your local restaurants are typically busy. Google can also infer your location using your recent search history, for example, if you were to search for \u2018bars in London\u2019.",
    "On your smartphone, Google does this by constantly \u2018talking\u2019 to nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, and using this information it can keep a very detailed and accurate timeline of your movements.",
    "If you want to stop Google from collecting location data, you\u2019ll need to check your Google account settings.",
    "To do this, head to myactivity.google.com. Then, check the settings in the \u2018location history\u2019 and \u2018web and app activity\u2019 section of your Google Account. You\u2019ll have the choice of switching off certain activity, or disabling them entirely.",
    "Google also advises that users can delete any personal data that\u2019s already been collected through their Google Account."
