  "article": [
    "At long last, Peaky Blinders season 6 is just around the corner. New episodes are expected to drop early next year, with a supposedly \"f**king strong\" script ready to tie up the many loose ends left by season 5's cliffhanger finale.",
    "Peaky Blinders Season 6 will also be the final TV outing for showrunner Steven Knight's beloved BBC period drama, although the story will continue through a feature-length movie \"set and shot in Birmingham\" intended to mark the Blinders' end.",
    "Before that, though, we've rounded up everything we know so far about Peaky Blinders season 6 \u2013 from its expected release date to new cast members.",
    "It goes without saying, but proceed with caution if you want to avoid big spoilers for seasons 1 to 5. You can still catch up on the Shelby gang's adventures via BBC iPlayer in the UK and Netflix internationally.",
    "Release date: Peaky Blinders season 6 doesn't have an official arrival time just yet, but creator Steven Knight has hinted at a Spring 2022 release date.",
    "Cast: Most of the Shelby clan will be returning to the fold, with the likes of Cillian Murphy, Paul Anderson and Sam Claflin all reprising their roles. Tom Hardy will be returning, too, while Stephen Graham has joined the cast. Scroll down for more on who's been added to the show for season 6.",
    "Story: We expect to see some familiar faces picking up the pieces left by Tommy's failed assassination attempt on Sir Oswald Mosely, while we'll also be seeing a lot more of Gina and her family. We also know the plot will also be taking take place in the shadow of a \"looming Second World War.\"",
    "What comes after season 6? \"My plan from the beginning was to end Peaky with a movie... this is what's going to happen,\" Knight has said. What exactly comes after this final season of the show is a bit of a mystery, though: just know that the story won't end here.",
    "Shooting on Peaky Blinders season 6 has finally wrapped after a year of pandemic-hampered filming, and showrunner Steven Knight, speaking at October's London Film Festival, has since hinted at a tentative Spring 2022 release date \u2013 meaning March, April or May next year.",
    "Evidently, that wasn't the original plan. As with most shows whose new series were expected to arrive between 2020 and 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic put a pin in filming of Peaky Blinders season 6, with director Anthony Byrne telling Digital Spy that the intention was to begin shooting in March 2020 and end in July after a 78-day run.",
    "Naturally, that didn't happen, but relaxed restrictions on UK television and film production at the beginning of 2021 meant filming did eventually begin in January this year.",
    "\u201cPeaky is back and with a bang,\u201d Byrne said earlier in 2021. \u201cAfter the enforced production delay due to the Covid pandemic, we find the family in extreme jeopardy and the stakes have never been higher. We believe this will be the best series of all and are sure that our amazing fans will love it.\"",
    "Thankfully, it would seem the plan to shoot the entirety of Peaky Blinders season 6 in less than three months endured, though the show still requires \"another six months of editing,\" according to its director, hence the latest Spring 2022 estimate.",
    "Still, early promotional material like the teaser below has seemingly confirmed \"early 2022\" as a release date, so we definitely don't have long to wait.",
    "So, with Peaky Blinders season 6 just around the corner, what do we know in terms of its cast and story?",
    "Well, expect to see some familiar faces tying up the loose ends left by Tommy's failed assassination of Sir Oswald Mosely. Speaking of the slimy Blackshirts founder, we know from a BBC Sounds podcast that Sam Claflin will be returning for the role, and that the first episode of season 6 is called Black Day. The official Peaky Blinders account also tweeted his involvement back in February 2021, so this isn't new news.",
    "We know, unsurprisingly, that Cillian Murphy is returning as Tommy, too, along with the other usual Shelby suspects. Granted, season 5 ended with the show's main character looking rather distressed in a field with a gun to his head, but we know he'll live to fight another day \u2013 especially since we spotted Murphy in several set images way back when.",
    "Those psychological troubles also triggered the ethereal apparitions of Tommy's dead wife, Grace Shelby, so we'll likely see Annabelle Wallis again.",
    "More of a surprise is the confirmation that Tom Hardy will be reappearing as Alfie Solomons, following his miraculous season 5 return after being shot in the head the season before that. The official Peaky Blinders Twitter account recently shared a teaser (with the caption \"look who's back\") showing Solomons meeting Tommy face-to-face for the first time, which you can watch below.",
    "We also know that Paul Anderson will be returning as Arthur Shelby, as well as Natasha O'Keeffe as Lizzie Stark, after the show confirmed as much on Twitter. Charlie Murphy, who played unionist leader Jessie Eden, won\u2019t be re-appearing in season 6, though. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m done now,\u201d she told Digital Spy in March. \u201cBut it was a lot of fun.\"",
    "But what of Michael's mysterious partner, Gina, played by The Queen's Gambit's Anya Taylor-Joy? Were the scheming couple behind the assassination's failure? Michael's bid to take charge of Shelby Company Ltd certainly raises our suspicions.",
    "Regardless, we do know we'll be meeting more of Gina's family in season 6 \u2013 director Anthony Byrne told GQ in August 2019 that, \"Gina, and whoever her family are, will make themselves known.\"",
    "It's looking like the murky machinations of the interwar elite will become clearer in the next season, then, but when it comes to Gina, specifically, \"there's a lot to be revealed about her next series. She's a player, she's a manipulator. She's part of a wider plan,\" Byrne said.",
    "He also confirmed, on the BBC\u2019s Obsessed With\u2026 Peaky Blinders podcast, that Stephen Graham will make an appearance in season 6 \u2013 though not as Al Capone, who he played in the similar-but-not-the-same Boardwalk Empire series. The Chicago mob boss was referenced at the end of Peaky Blinders' fifth season, so it makes sense that fans had drawn the false conclusion.",
    "In a particularly exciting rumor, Julia Roberts has also been tipped to join the show's cast \u2013 though it's unclear who she'd play. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that got out,\" Byrne told the BBC (via Esquire), \"but, yeah, fingers crossed on that.\u201d We haven't heard any more on that front, though, so we're not getting our hopes up.",
    "Based on the activity of the show's official Twitter account, other actors confirmed to be entering the fray for season 6 include Rebecca Keatley \u2013 who is set for a major change of scenery from her role as a CBeebies presenter \u2013 Australian actor James Frecheville and Brits Amber Anderson and Conrad Khan.",
    "The latter has earned major plaudits of late, including a nomination for BAFTA's Rising Star Award, and so proves another exciting addition to an already-stellar cast.",
    "When it comes to Billy (Emmett J. Scanlan), who may or may not have been the person who betrayed Tommy and the gang at the end of season 5, Scanlan told Digital Spy that he hopes, if Billy was the rat, that he stands up to the Blinders in future. He also mentioned that the season 6 scripts are \"so f**king strong.\"",
    "\"It won't disappoint, I promise you,\" Scanlan added. \"Steven [Knight] is a master.\"",
    "We know we'll be finding out who the rat is, at least. In fact, the show's director, Anthony Byrne, told Digital Spy that those who paid \u201cclose attention\u201d should already be able to see who back-stabbed Tommy. \u201cYou certainly find out,\" he added \"but we cut stuff around that end section to make it more oblique.\" Exciting stuff.",
    "After the sad passing of actress Helen McCrory, we also don't expect Aunt Polly to re-appear in season 6. During a BFI Q&A prior to her death, showrunner Knight was asked if Aunt Polly would survive until the very end of the show, to which he simply replied: \"Yes.\"",
    "McCrory had also previously expressed her desire to return for the final series, eager to \"see it through to the end\". It's unclear how the show will address this loss, though tributes were paid by the show's cast and crew on social media.",
    "As for its setting, we know World War II will start to loom over the story in Peaky Blinders season 6. \"Because of the nature of the decade, the 1930s, we know what happened at the end \u2013 that war began. There are rumblings and rumors of war and that's overshadowing the whole thing. It makes the stakes higher,\" Knight told the Press Association in 2020.",
    "That timeframe would fit with the show's signature time jumps from season to season, with its debut outing set back in 1919 amid the lawless neighborhoods of post-war Birmingham.",
    "How far it's come, eh?",
    "Five seasons in, and Peaky Blinders remains essential viewing. It's a rare thing for a UK-made show to develop the credibility of a bigger-budget US drama, and it's no wonder that more and more big names are showing up in every season.",
    "In the UK, viewing figures for new episodes have tripled since the show began \u2013 so don't be surprised if Peaky Blinders season 6 isn't the last we'll see of the Shelbys.",
    "We do know this upcoming season will be the finale for the show in its original guise, but Knight has confirmed that \"while the TV series will be coming to an end, the story will continue in another form.\u201d",
    "We also know Knight has long hoped to \"end Peaky with a movie,\" something that is \"going to happen,\" according to a recent Deadline report, so we'd anticipate seeing a feature-length Peaky Blinders adventure in the near future.",
    "Don't expect it to arrive any time soon, though. Speaking at the London Film Festival in October, Knight confirmed he plans to work on a Peaky Blinders movie \"set in and shot in Birmingham\" after season 6's release \u2013 meaning full-scale development on the project isn't likely to begin until the middle of next year.",
    "Let's get Peaky Blinders season 6 out the way first, shall we?"
