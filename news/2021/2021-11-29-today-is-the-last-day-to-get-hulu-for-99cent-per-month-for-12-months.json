    "We're nearing the end of Cyber Monday and when it ends, so does this fantastic deal on Hulu that offers new and valid returning customers 12 months of access for $0.99 per month versus the streaming service's regular price of $6.99 per month.",
    "The deal went live a few days ago, but it's now in its closing hours \u2013 making it one of the last chances you'll get to subscribe at this price for another 365 days.",
    "The obvious caveat here is that you\u2019re subscribing to the Hulu with Ads service, rather than the ad-free service that typically runs you $12.99 per month.",
    "Admittedly, the ads are frequent and annoying, but being able to watch hit shows from NBC, ABC and Fox one day after they air is really nifty, especially at this price point.",
    "Want to see how much Hulu's other plans cost? We\u2019ve included the pricing on all three services down below."
