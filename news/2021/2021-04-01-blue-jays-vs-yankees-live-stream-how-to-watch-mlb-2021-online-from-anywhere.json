    "It's MLB Opening Day, and what a game we've got to begin the new season with. The Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees both had their World Series hopes crushed by eventual runners-up the Tampa Bay Rays last year, and the pressure is on for the AL East rivals right from the off. Read on as we explain how to watch the Blue Jays vs Yankees game online and live stream today's MLB action from anywhere in the world.",
    "The Yanks have home-field advantage, though Yankee Stadium is being limited to 20% capacity. Still, that's something the Blue Jays won't be able to enjoy for some time yet.",
    "The Blue Jays were a lot more active than their opponents in the off-season, targeting more young blood in George Springer and Marcus Semien to add to their youthful core.",
    "Meanwhile, New York will be without Luke Voit, who hit a league-leading 22 home runs last season. The first baseman has had to undergo knee injury, and may not return to the diamond for some time.",
    "It's a huge game, so whether you\u2019re a Blue Jays fan in Toronto, a Yankees fan in New York or just an MLB follower wanting to watch the baseball at Yankee Stadium today, we\u2019ll show you how to get a high-quality MLB live stream of the Blue Jays vs Yankees game from anywhere.",
    "If you're abroad right now, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you re-position your device of choice to a location of your choosing, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred MLB live stream.",
    "This functionality also means that VPNs are great for getting around in-market black out restrictions, making them something every MLB fan should have in their bat bag.",
