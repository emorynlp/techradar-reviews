    "Microsoft has released a new preview build of Windows 11 that makes it even easier to share content from other apps to Microsoft Teams with attendees while in a meeting.",
    "With the release of Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22499 to the software giant's Dev Channel, Microsoft is rolling out a new feature that allows Teams users to quickly share content from open app windows directly from Windows 11's taskbar to their video calls.",
    "This new update builds on another recently released feature that introduced the ability to quickly mute and unmute active meeting calls right from the taskbar.",
    "By making it easier to share content during Teams calls, Microsoft will eliminate the need to switch back and forth between apps just to share or reshare a window. With less interruptions, meeting attendees will have a much easier time focusing on their meetings in Teams.",
    "Windows 11 Insiders can now test out this feature after downloading the latest preview build of Microsoft's new operating system.",
    "When in a meeting in Microsoft Teams, users can share content from their open windows by hovering over the apps in their taskbar. A new \u201cShare this window\u201d button will appear underneath an app's preview and by clicking on it, they can share their open windows with other attendees in a video call. By hovering over the window again and clicking \"Stop Sharing\", users can stop Teams from showing content on their PC or they can also choose another window to share content from it instead.",
    "This new feature also works while presenting full screen presentations in PowerPoint and by moving your mouse to the bottom, the taskbar will pop up so that users can share or stop sharing their presentations without interrupting attendees.",
    "According to a new blog post from Microsoft, the company is rolling out this new feature to a subset of Windows Insiders with Teams for work or school installed though it will be rolled out to even more users at a later date. The software giant also plans to bring this functionality to Chat from Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams for Home) at a later date.",
