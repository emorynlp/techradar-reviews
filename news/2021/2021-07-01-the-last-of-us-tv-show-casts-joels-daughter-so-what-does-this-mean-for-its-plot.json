    "HBO\u2019s upcoming The Last of Us TV show has cast Joel\u2019s daughter \u2013 and she\u2019s an exciting newcomer.",
    "Nico Parker, best known for her role in 2019\u2019s live-action Dumbo adaptation, has signed on to play Sarah, who first appeared in the traumatic opening scene of the celebrated 2013 survival game.",
    "Parker will join the likes of Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, Gabriel Luna and Merle Dandridge in the miniseries, which is expected to arrive on HBO Max in 2022.",
    "As well as her lead role in Dumbo, Parker has already appeared in another HBO series, The Third Day, and will be joining Hugh Jackman in the upcoming sci-fi mind-bender, Reminiscence (alongside her actual mother, Thandiwe Newton, too).",
    "Given that we expect The Last of Us TV show to mirror the original game in terms of its timeline, at least, Parker will likely appear in a series of flashbacks, rather than acting alongside the likes of Bella Ramsey, who will play Ellie. That\u2019s because her character, Sarah, dies 14 years prior to the game\u2019s setting, after being shot by a soldier when fleeing her home with her father.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean her role will be any less important, though. Throughout the game, Sarah\u2019s memory simultaneously haunts and motivates Joel in his quest to bring Ellie to safety, so we\u2019re likely to see Parker in much more than a simple bit part.",
    "Recent comments made by the show\u2019s writer, Neil Druckmann \u2013 who also penned the script for the Naughty Dog games \u2013 confirmed that some episodes will \u201cdeviate greatly\u201d from the source material, though only in terms of their focus on drama over hardcore action.",
    "That suggests The Last of Us TV show will borrow heavily from the original game, meaning we can likely expect it to tell the same (or similar) plot.",
    "Druckmann also revealed that, for himself and showrunner Craig Mazin, the \u201cphilosophical underpinnings of the story\u201c were the essential aspect they wanted to get right with the adaptation.",
    "\u201cAs far as the superficial things, like should [a character] wear the same plaid shirt or the same red shirt?\u201d he said. \u201cThey might or might not appear in it, that\u2019s way less important to us than getting to the core of who these people are and the core of their journey.\u201c",
    "Pre-production for the show is currently underway, and while we haven\u2019t yet had an official release date, we don\u2019t expect to see Joel and Ellie\u2019s small-screen debut until at least 2022."
