    "If you\u2019re one of the many people who owns an iPhone but doesn\u2019t use Apple Music, then iOS 14.5 looks set to have a feature you\u2019ll find useful \u2013 the ability to switch to a different default music player.",
    "It\u2019s a feature that has been spotted by Reddit users in the iOS 14.5 beta, and specifically it will ask what app you want to use the first time you request a song from Siri, then whatever you select will be set as the default, meaning in future you can just ask Siri to play a song without specifying the app.",
    "Users who don\u2019t have Apple Music installed noted that it didn\u2019t even ask them which app to use the first time they requested a track, instead just defaulting to the main music player they use, be that Spotify or anything else.",
    "This is a feature that\u2019s previously been announced for HomePod, but not yet fully rolled out, as at the time of writing Pandora is the only player you can switch to. But perhaps the support for Spotify and other default players here means more will be added to HomePod too.",
    "That said, at the moment this feature sounds a bit buggy. Some users have reported that it only works if you phrase your song request in specific ways, or that it will sometimes just revert back to Apple Music. But hopefully that\u2019s just because it\u2019s still in beta. Bugs are forgivable and expected there, we just hope it works smoothly by the time iOS 14.5 launches.",
    "This isn\u2019t the only new feature coming with iOS 14.5 either, as we already know that both mask support for Face ID, and an App Tracking Transparency feature are in the works too, so this looks set to be a bigger update than some of the 14.x ones have been.",
    "As for when the iOS 14.5 update will actually land, that we\u2019re not sure of, but with it in beta now we wouldn\u2019t expect the wait will be too much longer.",
