    "Running Android apps in Windows 11 through Amazon was brought to the Insider program last week, and already a developer has unlocked Google\u2019s Play Store for you to run any apps on Microsoft\u2019s operating system instead.",
    "While you can currently run apps from Amazon\u2019s Android Store, you were limited to what was available on there, compared to the thousands of apps on Google\u2019s store.",
    "From games to productivity tools, and other social media apps, there\u2019s thousands to choose from to run on your laptop or tablet, thanks to a guide that the developer has released over the weekend.",
    "However, the benefits of what a larger app store could bring to Windows 11 may show greater opportunities to both Microsoft and Google in the future if users embrace Android on their Windows 11 devices.",
    "A developer by the name of ADeltaX on Twitter has been documenting their efforts in getting the Play Store to work, and over the weekend they achieved it.",
    "The YouTube tutorial they give is easy to follow, and you\u2019ll be able to run your Android apps alongside Paint, Snipping Tool and other Windows 11 apps in no time.",
    "But we should state that this may not be available for long, as Microsoft will most likely revoke access to the store. Currently, the only way to use Android apps will be through the Microsoft Store and the library of Amazon\u2019s App Store.",
    "However, this does open up the avenue for games and productivity apps to be used on tablets and laptops alike running Windows 11 that aren\u2019t available through Amazon.",
    "It\u2019s no secret that the Google Play Store is less regulated than Apple\u2019s App Store when it comes to the types of apps available to install. From emulators that can run consoles from years ago, to ports of games that are unauthorized by the teams behind the originals.",
    "Being able to run these on your Windows 11 device is going to be a tempting prospect to many. There\u2019s around 60,000 apps available on Amazon\u2019s Store, compared to over three million apps on the Google Play Store. With games, media apps and other categories available to download compared to what\u2019s on Amazon\u2019s store, it may tip the scales as to what users want to install on their machine.",
    "But it could also bring an added benefit where Microsoft and Google partner up and make this method official in the future. Microsoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella has been a big proponent of making Windows and the company\u2019s other apps as a service on other devices, so this only makes sense.",
    "Especially when the Surface Duo 2 is running Android, there\u2019s no obvious disadvantage here for both companies.",
    "However, it may be a question of waiting to see how users around the world will react to Android apps in the Microsoft Store, and if there will be enough of a positive reception for a partnership to occur.",
    "But regardless, it\u2019s an interesting time to see the worlds of Microsoft and Google collide. It will ultimately be up to users if they want to see more of their favorite Android apps on Windows 11 devices soon.",
