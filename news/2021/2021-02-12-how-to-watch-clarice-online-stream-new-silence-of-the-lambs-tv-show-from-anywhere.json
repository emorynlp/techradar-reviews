    "It's 1993, a year on from the Buffalo Bill ordeal, the trauma of which is weighing heavy on Clarice's mind. But Attorney General Ruth Martin (Jayne Atkinson) wants her back in the field, to work exclusively on cases that require a cast-iron constitution and an even stronger psyche.",
    "Undermining her from the get-go is Clarice's boss Paul Krendler (Michael Cudlitz), who's still furious about her breakthrough and hell-bent on trashing her reputation and breaking her resolve. But Clarice has more insidious forces to tackle than the jealousy of her colleagues.",
    "There are, as Ruth says, monsters at large that need hunting down, and Clarice has the courage and resilience to push open doors to deeper, darker places than anyone else is willing to venture into.",
    "But the twisted nature of the crimes and perpetrators she's been assigned to leave their mark, and with Clarice trying to fend off her own demons, it's a matter of time before something gives.
