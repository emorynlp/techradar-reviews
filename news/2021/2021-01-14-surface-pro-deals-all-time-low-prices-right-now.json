    "Surface Pro deals are offering some excellent discounts on powerful Windows tablets this week. Both Amazon and Best Buy have marked the convertible devices down, resulting is some of the lowest prices yet for the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro X.",
    "The i5 Surface Pro 7 is the cheapest model on offer right now, with the 8GB RAM / 128GB spec coming in at just $789.90 at Amazon. That's a fantastic price considering the cheapest we've ever seen it was over Black Friday - and even then it was at $799. You're getting a full 12.3-inch tablet here, with the keyboard accessory to turn it into an extremely flexible laptop as well.",
    "However, if you need the big screen treatment and the power to go with it, Best Buy has cut $200 off the price of its selection of Surface Pro X machines. These turbo charged tablets carry more RAM and storage options as well as a larger 13.3-inch display and usually come in at around $1,000 and up.",
    "Best Buy's latest Surface Pro deals have dropped those costs as low as $899.99 this week, however, offering up the cheapest prices yet.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Surface Pro deals in your area.",
    "Unlike the Surface Pro 7 deal above, the following Surface Pro X sales don't include the keyboard accessory in the price, so it's worth noting that for the full Surface experience you'll need to pick up this piece of kit separately.",
    "If the Surface Pro is still looking a little pricey, you can often find Surface Go deals for a lot less cash. Plus, iPad Pro deals can also offer a premium tablet experience at a similar price point as well. If you're looking to spend significantly less on a new PC, however, there's always plenty of cheap laptop deals to choose from for a more traditional experience as well."
