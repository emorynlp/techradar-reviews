    "The Xbox Series X UI has often been criticized for being overly convoluted. And with its myriad of tiles, menus and submenus, it\u2019s easy to see how new players might find the experience rather daunting at first. There\u2019s a lot of information squirreled away.",
    "Personally, though, I\u2019ve always enjoyed the granularity that the Xbox UI offers. Sifting through the menus to find exactly what I want to tinker with is a strangely satisfying experience, and sometimes, it can even lead to an unexpected discovery.",
    "Case in point: notifications. During an evening of messing around with the Xbox\u2019s personalization options (yeah, I\u2019m a riot), I decided to delve into this long-forgotten submenu just for kicks. Cue my surprise, then, when I found out there\u2019s a feature that I never knew existed.",
    "Now, this might not have the type of seismic impact on your life as it did mine, but I found out there\u2019s an option to move the classic notification pop-up that appears whenever you unlock an achievement or a friend comes online to entirely new locations. Mind blown.",
    "For someone who has always had notifications appear in the bottom center of the screen, having the ability to move the pop-up around is surprisingly liberating after all these years of living in the dark. Some games have implemented this feature in the past, and I\u2019d always wondered whether this was only available to developers, but no, it turns out it\u2019s been available all this time, just waiting to be found by a curious dashboard explorer like myself.",
    "If you\u2019d like to witness this magic of moving the notification pop-ups yourself, simply head to \u2018Settings\u2019, scroll down to \u2018Preferences\u2019 and click on \u2018Notifications\u2019. From here, head to \u2018Default notification position\u2019 and you can select exactly where you want those handy pop-ups to appear. There are five positions to choose from, so take your time and experiment with each one (I know I did, because again, that's kind of fun that takes place in my life).",
    "Of course, you could point the finger at Microsoft and argue that if the Xbox UI wasn\u2019t so overwhelming, I\u2019d have discovered this option far sooner. The fact it\u2019s taken so long is a testament to how badly the user interface is designed. To that I say\u2026 yeah, fair enough.",
    "Sometimes, though, Microsoft doesn\u2019t do itself any favors by failing to highlight genuinely cool features. It\u2019s only just come to light that you can switch between an Xbox console and PC or phone simply by tapping the sync button, and did you know that the Xbox Series X dashboard and achievements take advantage of spatial audio like Dolby Atmos? Probably not.",
    "Nevertheless, whenever I hear that soothing \u201cachievement unlocked\u201d sound, I\u2019m now treated to a lovely pop-up in the top left corner of the screen, which believe it or not, combined with the dynamic backgrounds on Xbox Series X, helps make Microsoft\u2019s next-gen console feel a little bit more fresh and new. The future is now, people, and I\u2019m living in it."
