    "Last season was one to forget for both teams, who ended up propping up the NL East with the same 26-34 record. The Nats put in the worst showing from a defending champion since the Marlins' infamous '98 season, but they still got the better of the Mets, beating them 6-4. Read on as we explain how to watch the Mets vs Nationals game online and live stream today's MLB action from anywhere in the world.",
    "There are high hopes surrounding both teams going into this season, with the Nationals surely set to bounce back from last year's horror show, and the Mets confident that they have what it takes to end their four-year playoff drought.",
    "They've drastically overhauled their lineups, with the Mets signing James McCann, Trevor May, Francisco Lindor, Carlos Carrasco and Marcus Stroman (again), while the Nats have strengthened with the additions of Jon Lester, who's won the World Series three times, plus Kyle Schwarber, Josh Bell and Brad Hand.",
    "Max Scherzer will be Washington's Opening Day pitcher for the sixth time in seven seasons, while Jacob deGrom will be taking the mound for New York for the third time in a row.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a Mets fan in New York, a Nats fan in Washington or just an MLB follower wanting to watch the baseball at Nationals Park, we\u2019ll show you how to get a high-quality MLB live stream of the Mets vs Nationals game from anywhere.",
    "If you're abroad right now, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you re-position your device of choice to a location of your choosing, thereby allowing you to globe trot and still access your preferred MLB live stream.",
    "This functionality also means that VPNs are great for getting around in-market black out restrictions, making them something every MLB fan should have in their bat bag.",
