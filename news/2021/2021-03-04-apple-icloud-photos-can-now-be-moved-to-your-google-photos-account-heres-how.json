    "Apple has discreetly added a new way for you to transfer photos from your iCloud account over to Google Photos. If you\u2019re thinking of switching from an iOS to an Android device, then it could be a handy new tool.",
    "Apple mentions on its support page that certain formats, like Live Photos, Smart Albums or \u201csome\u201d raw files, might not be eligible for transfer. However, most common file types are supported, including JPEG, PNG, MP4, WEBP and GIF, among others.",
    "There are some caveats to keep in mind, though, chiefly that data transfers, according to Apple, can take anywhere between three days to a week to complete. The transferred files are also copies, meaning that they\u2019ll remain on your iCloud account after the transfer to Google Photos is complete. That\u2019s useful for those who want to make use of both apps, but perhaps less so for those looking to save storage.",
    "You\u2019ll have to jump through some hoops in order to transfer your files from Apple iCloud to Google Photos. Firstly, you\u2019ll need to make sure your Apple ID has two-factor authentication. Then, check that your Google Photos account has enough storage space for a successful transfer.",
    "Now you\u2019re ready to start the transfer process. To do so, sign in with your Apple ID at Apple\u2019s privacy portal. Then, select the option to \u201ctransfer a copy of your data.\u201d From there you can choose to transfer your files to Google Photos.",
    "Once Apple has prompted you to sign in to your Google account, you\u2019ll then receive an email confirming the transfer request. You\u2019ll receive another email when the transfer has been completed. If you don\u2019t see that email for a few days, remember that the transfer can take up to a week to finish.",
    "That\u2019s all there is to it. Sure, it\u2019s not the simplest way to transfer your photos, but we\u2019re glad Apple has allowed the option to exist at all. If you\u2019re planning on switching from an iOS device to an Android \u2013 and you make frequent use of your iPhone\u2019s camera \u2013 then this transfer method might be something to look into."
