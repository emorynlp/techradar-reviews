    "While there has been a gradual drip feed of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 leaks, suddenly three different leaks have emerged at once: they give us a much clearer idea about some aspects of the phone, including the build, battery, and chipset.",
    "First up, both the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 will apparently have an IP rating, meaning some official amount of resistance to water and dust. That\u2019s according to \u201cpeople in the know\u201d speaking to SamMobile, though sadly they don\u2019t know enough to be specific about what rating the phones will have.",
    "Still, any amount of protection is a great upgrade as far as we\u2019re concerned. After all, foldables are among the most expensive phones you can buy, so it\u2019s especially desirable for them to be durable \u2013 yet so far none of Samsung\u2019s have an IP rating. That\u2019s perhaps understandable given all the moving parts, but we\u2019re hopeful that this leak is right and the company has found a way to add water resistance.",
    "Next up, the battery for a phone believed to be the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 has been certified in China, as spotted by MyFixGuide. The certification reveals that the phone has two batteries, one of which is 2,215mAh, and the other 2,060mAh, combining for a total capacity of 4,275mAh.",
    "That\u2019s not particularly big for a foldable phone, and is actually slightly smaller than the 4,500mAh one in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2, but a previous leak also suggested the battery would be smaller than in the Z Fold 2 (though not quite by this much). While we\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt, information in certifications tends to be correct, so the battery likely is 4,275mAh.",
    "Finally, @UniverseIce (a leaker with a reasonable track record) has said that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a Snapdragon 888 chipset and is about 13g lighter than the Z Fold 2 (which would make it about 269g).",
    "The reduction in weight would make sense if the battery is going to be smaller \u2013 especially as we\u2019ve also previously heard that the screen might be a bit smaller too.",
    "As for the chipset, that\u2019s no surprise really either since the Snapdragon 888 is the main flagship chipset of the year and was used by the Samsung Galaxy S21 range in some regions.",
    "That said, not so long ago the same source suggested that the Z Fold 3 might have a \u2018top secret\u2019 chipset that would be something other than the Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 (the latter of which being another likely candidate). So we\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt too, but the 888 would always have been our best guess.",
    "We might be waiting a little while until we know the details of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 for sure \u2013 rumors suggest it\u2019s landing in July \u2013 but stay tuned to TechRadar for all the credible leaks and rumors until then."
