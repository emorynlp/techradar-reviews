    "Lots of people are no doubt wondering whether it\u2019s possible to install Hulu on Fire Stick, essentially pairing one of the best streaming services around with an outstanding portable smart TV device. In short, it\u2019s up there with the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.",
    "Together, Hulu and Amazon\u2019s Fire Stick make a formidable team, combining a top-notch streaming service full of exclusive content with a portable TV dongle that enables you to watch your favourite shows on the go. Read on to find out how to get started.",
    "Yes, it is. Hulu is fully compatible with Amazon\u2019s Fire Stick. In fact, it only takes a few minutes to download the app and get started.",
    "As existing Fire Stick users will know, this compact smart TV device is incredibly quick and easy to use. When you combine this technology with Hulu, you have a huge amount of TV content in a pocket-sized device that you can take with you wherever you go.",
    "Presuming you\u2019re already signed up to Hulu, before you start the process of installing it on your Fire Stick, the first thing to do is to make sure your device is plugged into a HDMI socket and the power is turned on.",
    "Next, open up the Fire Stick dashboard, locate the Find button on the home screen, and then click Search. After this, type Hulu into the search box. You can either use the on-screen keyboard or the voice search feature to do this.",
    "Now, click Hulu when the search term appears on the screen. Navigate to the Apps & Games section and click the Hulu app logo. If this is the first time you\u2019re downloading the app, you\u2019ll need to click Get on the next screen that appears. Otherwise, you can reinstall it by clicking Download.",
    "Click Open when the download is complete and you can start browsing the Hulu content you wish to watch.",
    "Despite being owned by Disney, Hulu is very different from the media giant\u2019s other popular streaming service Disney Plus, which is definitely more child-oriented. Although there is a kids section, Hulu is packed with grown-up content from multiple networks, including Starz, ABC, Fox, ESPN, and more.",
    "There are thousands of viewing options to suit every taste, from award-winning films like Parasite and American Animals, to TV dramas like 9-1-1, documentaries like I am Greta, and popular shows including Shark Tank and Last Man Standing.",
