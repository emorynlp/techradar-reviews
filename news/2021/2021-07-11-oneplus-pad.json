    "After years of making impressive Android smartphones, it looks like OnePlus is ready to branch out into tablets, as there\u2019s evidence that it\u2019s working on a slate called the OnePlus Pad.",
    "So far we don\u2019t know much about it, but as soon as we learn anything we\u2019ll update this article, so keep checking back to stay in the loop.",
    "In the meantime you\u2019ll find the few things we have heard below, along with release date and price predictions. Then further down we\u2019ve included a list of all the key things we want from the OnePlus Pad, to make it a competitive Android slate.",
    "All we know about the OnePlus Pad so far is that the company has filed trademarks for the name in both Europe and India. So based on that it\u2019s likely that the slate will launch in both regions, though whether it will also land in the US is unknown. An Australian launch is unlikely, as the company doesn\u2019t have a presence there right now.",
    "But given that these trademarks were only filed in July 2021 and that we don\u2019t know anything else about the slate at the time of writing, it\u2019s likely a long way off launching. If we were to guess, we\u2019d say don\u2019t expect it before 2022 \u2013 perhaps alongside the OnePlus 10 range, which is likely to land in or around March.",
    "You never know though, it could still land in 2021 - potentially at the same time as the OnePlus Nord 2 or OnePlus 9T, both of which are expected before long.",
    "We can\u2019t even begin to guess at a price yet, as we don\u2019t even know which segment of the market the OnePlus Pad will be aiming for. All we can say is that it\u2019s likely to be competitively priced, as the company\u2019s phones tend to be.",
    "As noted, the only news of the OnePlus Pad comes in the form of trademark filings for the name. Technically we don\u2019t even know that the OnePlus Pad is a tablet, we just assume so from the name.",
    "It\u2019s also possible that OnePlus has simply trademarked the name in case it wants to use it in future \u2013 so there\u2019s no guarantee the company actually has a tablet in the works.",
    "Assuming there is a tablet in the works, it seems a safe bet that it runs Android, since the company's phones do, but even that isn't certain.",
    "Even saying what we want from the OnePlus Pad is tricky when it\u2019s the first slate from the brand, and when we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s cheap, mid-range or premium, but we\u2019ve put a few suggestions below.",
    "While we have no idea which segment of the market the OnePlus Pad will be aimed at, we hope that it\u2019s priced lower than its main rivals. This is a realistic hope, given that OnePlus phones tend to be priced either in line with or slightly below phones with similar specs from big brands.",
    "Doing this could give OnePlus an immediate foothold in the tablet market, and make the OnePlus Pad a real alternative to the iPad Pro 12.9 (2021), the Amazon Fire HD 10 (2021), or whatever slate its specs are most in line with.",
    "To make the OnePlus Pad a more compelling purchase, we\u2019d love to see it support \u2013 and be bundled with \u2013 a stylus. This would be ideal for anyone who wants to sketch or write by hand on the slate, among other things, and a big tablet screen is a great fit for such an accessory.",
    "We\u2019re not sure how likely this is, but Samsung and Apple both offer styli for their slates, and the former even bundles them sometimes, such as with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7, so it\u2019s certainly possible.",
    "As well as a stylus we\u2019d also love an official keyboard case to be offered for the OnePlus Pad. This could allow you to use it more like a laptop, which is great for productivity purposes.",
    "We wouldn\u2019t expect OnePlus to throw this in with the tablet, but hopefully the price will at least be kept low \u2013 no Apple Magic Keyboard pricing here please.",
    "A good screen is vital for a tablet, arguably more so even than for a phone, since you\u2019re more likely to watch movies and edit photos on a slate. So that\u2019s exactly what we want to see from the OnePlus Pad.",
    "How good it could realistically be will depend in part on how OnePlus plans to price and position this slate, but if it\u2019s a top-end tablet then we want a QHD+ AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and hardly any bezel.",
    "Good speakers are another important element of a tablet \u2013 and again, these are more important on a slate than a phone, since there will probably be more occasions when you don\u2019t reach for headphones here.",
    "The size of a slate also makes packing in good speakers \u2013 and lots of speakers \u2013 more viable than with a phone. So we want quality sound here, and if this is an expensive slate then we want at least four speakers included, for loud, crisp audio without headphones."
