    "Sony\u2019s disc-based PS5 console is no longer selling at a loss, according to the company\u2019s chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki.",
    "Bloomberg reports that Totoki shared the news at Sony\u2019s recent earnings briefing, which comes shortly after the Japanese tech giant confirmed the PS5 is now the fastest-selling PlayStation system of all time.",
    "For the first time since its November 2020 release, the PS5 is covering its own manufacturing costs, though the less expensive and disc-less Digital Edition is still losing money for Sony.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t making a profit, though. Bloomberg reports that the losses incurred by the PS5 Digital Edition continue to be offset by the enduring sales of hardware like the PS4, and it\u2019s normal for games consoles to sell at a loss in the early months of their life cycle.",
    "The PS4, for instance \u2013 which has now sold over 116 million units worldwide \u2013 didn\u2019t turn a profit until six months after release.",
    "There are exceptions to the rule, of course. The Nintendo Switch began making money from the get-go, but it\u2019s rare that consoles form the biggest part of a company\u2019s sales.",
    "Microsoft has famously never turned a profit on any of its Xbox hardware, for example, with most revenue coming instead from game sales or subscription services like Xbox Game Pass.",
    "Eventually, maybe. But not for a long time.",
    "Despite taking a little longer to cross over into the green (or orange, at least), meteoric sales of the PS5 have ensured Sony\u2019s latest console looks set to make a financial impression comparable to its predecessor \u2013 but the global chip shortage means the company is struggling to manufacture enough PS5 systems to meet global demand.",
    "With millions still wondering where to buy a PS5, there\u2019s no denying the interest in Sony\u2019s product, but there\u2019s little sign that manufacturing speeds will begin to match those of the PS4 any time soon.",
    "Still, Sony has managed to sell 10 million PS5 consoles in the same time it took to sell 7.8 million PS4s, so if demand is sustained, there\u2019s every chance that \u2013 in the next six or seven years \u2013 the PS5 could outmuscle its older sibling for total units sold.",
    "Until then, though, we\u2019ll keep waiting in the restock queues.",
