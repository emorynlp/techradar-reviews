    "Solos is a marked departure from David Weil\u2019s debut Amazon Prime TV series. The writer-director\u2019s previous production for the streamer, the Al Pacino-starring Hunters, was a violent, revisionist take on the hunt for Nazis in 1970s America.",
    "Solos, by contrast, is a tender, modern day exploration of what it is to be human and the universal connections we share. Billed as a dramatic anthology series, Solos follows seven individual stories that explore the wonderful, heartbreaking and humorous aspects of what makes us human, albeit through a sci-fi perspective.",
    "Ahead of Solos\u2019 May 21 launch, TechRadar sat down with Weil to discuss why Solos is the thematically relevant TV show that viewers need right now. We also found out what inspired the series and how Solos\u2019 stories were elevated by its all-star cast.",
    "The idea for Solos\u2019 collection of short stories, albeit one with a loose narrative running throughout, Weil explains, stems from his memories of family members sharing emotive tales with him.",
    "\u201cI fell in love with storytelling through my grandmother recounting a story around her kitchen table,\u201d he says. \u201cOr my brother telling me a ghost story while we were camping up in Massachusetts. They were the kinds of stories told by one person in one environment. Because of the pandemic, I felt, as so many of us did, loneliness and solitude and, based on that, a desire for connection and hope. Those two ideas merged together and became Solos.\u201d",
    "That \u2018one person, one environment\u2019 approach to storytelling is evident throughout Solos\u2019 separate narratives.",
    "Set in the present day or near future, each tale examines universal themes such as belonging, fear of the unknown, finding purpose and death through a sci-fi lens. Topics including time travel, space exploration and cloning act as a base for each episode\u2019s plot, while also providing a distinctive aesthetic to their story\u2019s environments.",
    "Finding the right production designer to bring each episode\u2019s set to life, then, was vital. Locations had to feel warm or cold, lived-in or brand-new, well lit or dark, and natural or manufactured based on their instalment\u2019s main idea. Step forward Ruth Ammon, whose work on other anthology productions, including Dirty John, gave rise to each of Solos\u2019 unique locales.",
    "\u201cWhen Ruth and I discussed what each environment needed, we knew they had to tell their own stories,\u201d Weil says. \u201cI love sets that are incredibly dense, where there's so much storytelling populating it, that they really tell a tale of a life well lived. So, for the story concerning Sasha [starring Orange is the New Black\u2019s Uzo Aduba], it was really important that you could feel the different pockets of her home. \u2018Where was her sofa situated?\u2019, or \u2018Where did she erect that wall five years ago?\u2019, so every part of that set told the story and the evolution of living inside this fictional home.\u201d",
    "Aduba is far from the only recognizable name in Solos\u2019 stellar cast. Legendary actors Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren, plus the likes of the MCU\u2019s Anthony Mackie and Interstellar\u2019s Anne Hathaway, also star in the series - and Weil still finds it difficult to wrap his head around working with such esteemed talent.",
    "\u201cIt's a dream come true,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt's very surreal for me to look at the incredible actors we have on board and be like \u2018Oh my, they're saying the words I wrote\u2019. All of them bring their humanity to Solos, so it was a pleasure to hear that they were interested in doing something as challenging and unique as this.\u201d",
    "The challenge that Weil refers to is based on the show\u2019s format. Its final episode aside, which features Freeman and Downton Abbey\u2019s Dan Stevens, Solos\u2019 individual tales star a single actor. Some stories, such as Hathaway\u2019s, require their actor to embody the roles of multiple characters, but they\u2019re still the only star on the screen.",
    "For Weil, that creative decision was not only born out of the series\u2019 title, but his desire to use an often underused literary device - the monologue, which has its roots in Ancient Greece and Italy - as each episode\u2019s driving force.",
    "\u201cI've always loved monologues,\u201d Weil muses. \u201cBut you never really get the opportunity to do a 15 to 30-page, uninterrupted story with one person in one room. I\u2019ve wanted to explore the possibility of doing that for a long time, whether it was through film or TV, so having our incredible writers and actors bring all of themselves and their humanity to Solos was a joy.\u201d",
    "Solos\u2019 premise is one that currently hits close to home. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to millions of people feeling isolated from family and friends for over a year, losing loved ones and struggling to make ends meet. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that scientists are predicting a mental health timebomb in the wake of the pandemic as people begin, or continue, to notice a downturn in their mental wellbeing.",
    "Weil, whose wedding was pushed back due to the pandemic, says creating Solos was his way of cathartically dealing with the current situation, but understands that some people don\u2019t have the luxury of channeling their energies into creative endeavors. In those instances, he believes people should seek professional help if they\u2019re struggling mentally.",
    "Weil, though, thinks that audiences will gain some comfort from Solos. Despite its fictitious tales, he hopes that the series, as a whole, will serve as a reminder of the universal connections that we share as humans and, ultimately, who and what are the most important people and things in our lives.",
    "\u201cSolos became these love letters to different human experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cI started writing them as a way to connect with my family back in New York [amid the pandemic], who I hadn\u2019t seen in months. I hope people allow themselves 30 minutes to go along with each ride and, at the end, reflect on their own lives and relationships. After the past year, I think people are tuning into their feelings more, so I think they\u2019re primed for a very human experience like Solos.\u201d",
    "Solos launches exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, May 21."
