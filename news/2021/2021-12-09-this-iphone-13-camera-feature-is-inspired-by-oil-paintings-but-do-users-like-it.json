  "article": [
    "When Apple designed the new iPhone 13 camera app, it hoped to improve on past handsets by learning from oil painting techniques \u2013 but did it really make things better?",
    "In an interview with Wallpaper* magazine, the Apple design team explained the interdisciplinary approach of their Cupertino studio \u2013 described once by designer Jony Ive as a place where \u201cindustrial designers sat next to a font designer, sat next to a sound designer, who is sat next to a motion graphics expert, who is sat next to a colour designer, who is sat next to somebody who is developing objects in soft materials.\u201d",
    "That cross-medium approach clearly informs even the processing techniques used in the iPhone camera app, too. Wallpaper* writes that \u201cThe iPhone 13\u2019s camera represents a substantial upgrade, with Pro models getting a triple-lens system with a macro mode and 6x optical zoom.",
    "\"As UI designer Johnnie Manzari explains, the camera now has a new portraiture mode for photos and a cinematic mode for movies. Both exploit the emotional aesthetics of shifting depth perception.\u201d",
    "Manzari adds, \u201cWe did a lot of research into the history of portraiture as an art form and a craft, going back to oil painting and how they informed photographic traditions.",
    "\"The insights we got were about the importance of the focus on the eyes, the treatment of the background and lighting. These led to the features we\u2019ve added to the iPhone over the years, which balance these timeless principles in a way that\u2019s accessible and more intuitive.\u201d",
    "Alan Dye, VP of human interface design at Apple, adds that \u201cIt feels much more human and there\u2019s more of a connection to it, even though it\u2019s an artefact of analogue photography.\u201d",
    "The potential to capture a more analogue, old-timey feel for modern, digital photography is certainly intriguing \u2013 and there\u2019s certainly some demand for it. The original Instagram logo was based off a Polaroid camera, while popular photography app Dispo enables users to take photos that don\u2019t \u2018develop\u2019 until the day after.",
    "However, there may be something of a divide between Apple\u2019s intentions and the way users are experiencing them.",
    "Since the iPhone 13 has launched, a number of users have taken to forum threads to express their discontent with the photos taken by the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max \u2013 largely around processing that smoothes out the picture and loses important detail.",
    "One Reddit post with thousands of upvotes complains about the \u201coil painting\u201d effect on the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s photographs, comparing side by side with more \u201cnatural\u201d iPhone 11 Pro camera snaps.",
    "The top comment on the post reads, \u201cI don't know why modern smartphone cameras are prefering (sic) the oil painting look rather than having some noise on the picture but retaining some details.\u201d",
    "Another thread on the MacRumors forum is titled \u201cReally bad photos with iPhone 13 Pro (+Max) Merged\u201d, where users decry the inability to turn off this processing. Comments say \u201cI tried everything and there no way to avoid this\u201d, or \u201cAt least give us the option to turn off Smart HDR.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s a whole thread on Apple\u2019s support site of users begging for the option to turn it off, which appears to have been possible on previous iPhones but hasn\u2019t been carried through. The Apple support website says that, \u201cBy default, the HDR version of a photo is saved in Photos. On iPhone X and earlier models, you can also save the non-HDR version.\u201d",
    "So newer models appear to be restricting the ability to go without this particular processing enhancement.",
    "Apple\u2019s design team knows how to make a good product, and how to draw from countless disciplines \u2013 but it\u2019s easy to forget that, more than anything else, users like control over what features they have to use."
