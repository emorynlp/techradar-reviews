    "Geraint Thomas and Nairo Quintana are two of the elite riders in contention at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, restored to its traditional eight-stage format after last year's abridged edition. The individual time trial is also back!",
    "Three-time winner Chris Froome is another big name who'll be looking to impress in south-east France. Froome knows better than anyone just how important a strong Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 showing can be to your Tour de France prospects, having won both races in 2013, 2015 and 2016.",
    "The action starts in Issoire and concludes in Les Gets, encompassing 1,205.2km, two flat stages, three summit finishes, a 16.5km ITT, and three consecutive mountain stages to really test the legs.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a 2021 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 live stream from anywhere, as well as the countries where you can watch absolutely free.",
    "You can watch a FREE Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 live stream in a few different places. In Australia, for instance, SBS Viceland is providing free coverage of the race.",
    "Or you could dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book, because anyone in Italy can watch for free on Rai Sport, cycling fans in France can get the race on France 3, and fans in Belgium can watch on Sporza.",
    "If you're a resident of Australia, Italy, France or Belgium and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "As discussed above, if you're desperate to watch the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
    "Use a VPN to get a Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 live stream from anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, streaming VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone."
