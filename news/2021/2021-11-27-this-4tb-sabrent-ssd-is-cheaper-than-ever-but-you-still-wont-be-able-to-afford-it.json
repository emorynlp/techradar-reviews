  "article": [
    "One of the world\u2019s fastest and most capacious SSDs is available right now at a whopping 25% discount as part of Amazon\u2019s Cyber Monday sales, but you probably still won\u2019t be able to afford it.",
    "The 4TB Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus SSD can currently be purchased for $749.99, which is eye-wateringly expensive, but down significantly on the original $999.99 asking price.",
    "If money is no object and you\u2019re after the best performance and most storage space you can get from a single SSD, this is the Cyber Monday deal for you.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for SSD deals available in your region.",
    "Short of getting your hands on a new graphics card (which is much easier said than done at the moment), picking up a shiny new SSD is pretty much the best way to upgrade your gaming PC.",
    "There\u2019s no denying the quality of this market-leading SSD from Sabrent. Slotted into a motherboard with PCIe 4.0 support, the Rocket 4 Plus achieves blazing sequential read speeds of up to 7,100MB/second and write speeds of up to 6,600MB/s.",
    "It doesn\u2019t take the title of world\u2019s fastest SSD, an honor currently held by Adata\u2019s XPG GAMMIX S70, but it\u2019s not far off at all. And the Sabrent drive is obviously far faster than a traditional hard disk drive or SATA SSD, and consumes much less energy too.",
    "Of course, the 4TB Rocket 4 Plus will be way out of budget for most people - this writer most definitely included. A more economical way of doing things, then, would be to compromise on capacity (the 1TB Rocket 4 Plus currently costs $159.99 at Amazon) or opt for a slightly less performant drive (like the Sabrent Rocket Q4).",
    "If you\u2019re after a new storage drive that\u2019s equally pacey, but won\u2019t break the bank, check out these alternative SSD deals available in your region:"
