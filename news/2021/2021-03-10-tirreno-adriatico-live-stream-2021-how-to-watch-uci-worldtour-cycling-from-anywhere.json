  "article": [
    "Restored to seven stages and its traditional mid-March slot, the 56th edition of the Race of the Two Seas - those being the Tyrrhenian off Italy's western coast and the Adriatic in the east - once again serves as the preparation ground for the prestigious La Classicissima next weekend. The race has attracted star sprinters and Grand Tour specialists, with Simon Yates (Team BikeExchange) down to defend his crown. Join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Tirreno-Adriatico live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online wherever you are right now.",
    "The 1,104.1km route cuts through the central Italian regions of Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio, Abruzzo and Le Marche, beginning with a 156km sprinter-friendly opening stage that both starts and finishes at the Tuscany beach resort of Lido di Camaiore, a regular feature on the Giro d'Italia. The Slovakian speedster Peter Sagan is one of the star names on the start list, and will be making his long-awaited first appearance of 2021 because of Covid.",
    "The terrain gets lumpier and hillier over the next few days, with Stages 4 featuring a summit finish at Prati di Tivo, a 14.5km ascent with an average gradient of seven per cent - and that's after the riders come over the top of Forca di Arrone, Sella di Corno and Passo Capannelle.",
    "Some of the elite talents challenging Yates for GC supremacy are Tadej Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates), Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers), Nairo Quintana (Arkea-Samsic), Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ), Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck - Quick-Step), Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) and Jakob Fuglsang (Astana-Premier Tech), making for an incredibly strong lineup.",
    "Read on for everything you need to know to watch a Tirreno-Adriatico live stream from anywhere in the world today.",
    "Best of all, you can watch a FREE Tirreno-Adriatico live stream in loads of countries, but prepare to dust off that Lonely Planet phrase book.",
    "Anyone in Italy can watch for free on RaiSport, cycling fans in Belgium can tune in for free on Sporza, and those in France can get the race on L'Equipe TV.",
    "If you're a resident of Italy, Belgium or France and you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing the action - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage.",
    "Our latest 2021 testing showed our recommended VPN working well on these platforms from abroad, and we'll be sure to confirm for this race as soon as it's underway.",
    "If you're desperate to watch every stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
