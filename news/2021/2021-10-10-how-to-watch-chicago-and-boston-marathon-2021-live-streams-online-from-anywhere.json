    "The first ever World Marathon Majors double-header takes us to Beantown from the Windy City in 24 hours. Both races had to be cancelled last year, snapping a 43-year streak for the Chicago event and a historic 123-year streak for Boston, home of the world's oldest annual marathon. So read on as our guide explains how to watch a 2021 Chicago and Boston Marathon live stream from anywhere in the world on Sunday and Monday.",
    "The Chicago and Boston courses could barely be more different: the Chicago Marathon is run in a loop and on largely flat terrain, whereas the Boston Marathon's most famous feature is Heartbreak Hill - the last of the brutal Newton hills that come into play from the 16-mile mark and bring many races to a painful and premature end.",
    "15 years on from Deena Kastor's American record-setting performance at the 2006 London Marathon, could Sara Hall be the woman to break it? The 38-year-old came within a minute of Kastor's time in London last year, and has a job on her hands closing the gap in Chicago.",
    "Meanwhile, the elite names will be out in force in Boston, Des Linden, Edna Kiplagat and Mare Dibaba the headline names in the women's race, and Lemi Berhanu, Lelisa Desisa, Yuki Kawauchi and Geoffrey Kirui set to go toe-to-toe on the men's side.",

    "If you're abroad right now, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual marathon coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking \u2013 best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
    "Fortunately, there's a convenient way around this in the form of a VPN. This is a nifty bit of software that lets you whizz around these digital borders, thereby allowing you to globe-trot and still access your preferred Chicago & Boston Marathon live stream. It's a very affordable workaround that's super easy to use.",

    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open up the app, choose the location that corresponds to your country, and hit the 'on' button",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - you'll now be able to watch on Sling or on Fubo on your USA server"
