    "Dyson really does make the best vacuum cleaners - and that\u2019s official. Its newest floor cleaner, the Dyson V15 Detect Absolute, has taken the number one spot in our list of the best vacuum cleaners for 2021.",
    "We\u2019re constantly putting new vacuum cleaners to the test, adhering to strict protocols that can assess just how well these floor cleaners suck up everything from fine dust and biscuit crumbs to larger debris like cereal. We then compare the results to our existing picks and in our latest round of testing floorcare stalwart Dyson has emerged as the clear winner with its laser-toting V15 Detect Absolute cordless vacuum cleaner.",
    "Not only did the V15 Detect Absolute impress us with its powerful suction and its maneuverability, but we found its handy laser feature that highlights microscopic dust particles only visible to the human eye, an invaluable addition if you want to be assured that you have thoroughly cleaned your home.",
    "A relative newcomer to the floorcare market, Roidmi, is snapping at Dyson\u2019s heels however, as the Roidmi R10 (previously known as the Roidmi S1E) retains the number two spot. Founded in China in 2015, and thanks to investment from smartphone brand Xiaomi, its cordless vacuums have similar high-end specs but with more affordable price points - and the S1E is no exception. top of its offering",
    "Below you can see 2021's top five best vacuum cleaners, with a short summary of why we rate them so highly. Scroll down for a more detailed explanation of why Dyson has taken the title of best vacuum cleaner...again!",
    "Dyson has occupied the number one spot in our charts for several years now, and the same reasons apply now, as they did then.",
    "To begin with, Dyson\u2019s vacuum cleaners offer some of the most powerful suction on the market. Whether our testing floors are covered by fine dust, have clumps of biscuit crumbs or an entire bowlful of cereal tipped on them, the brand's floor cleaners suck up anything in their path with ease. The Dyson V15 Detect was no exception here, even when we used the least powerful setting.",
    "Another thing we love about Dyson\u2019s is its ability to innovate and create handy features we never knew we needed. From the High Torque cleaning head that debuted on the Dyson V11 range and converses battery power by automatically adjusting the suction level to suit the floor type, to the laser and piezo sensor on the Dyson V15 Detect that help show you how thoroughly you\u2019ve cleaned your home. Of course, Dyson vacuums aren\u2019t perfect - unless you opt for an Outsize model, which currently only exists on the V11 range - the dust canisters are of average capacity - so chances are you will need to interrupt your cleaning session to empty the dust bin. And they don\u2019t come cheap - with the Dyson V15 Detect setting you back a hefty $699.99 / \u00a3599.99 / AU$1,399, but in our eyes they\u2019re worth the price tag if you want to thoroughly clean your home, and have the evidence to prove it."
