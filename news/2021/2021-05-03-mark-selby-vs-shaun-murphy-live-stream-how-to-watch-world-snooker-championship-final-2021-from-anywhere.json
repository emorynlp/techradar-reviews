    "Having gone 10-4 down, Murphy looked set to sink without a trace, but he burst into life in the third session and ended up romping his way to what had looked a most unlikely victory, eventually winning by five frames.",
    "He could become the first player to triumph at the World Snooker Championship as both a qualifier and a ranked player, but standing in his way is a three-time world champion who's in formidable form. After hammering Mark Williams 13-3, Selby had to dig deep to get past Stuart Bingham, edging a tactical war of attrition that overran its allotted time and had to be concluded after hours on Saturday night.",
