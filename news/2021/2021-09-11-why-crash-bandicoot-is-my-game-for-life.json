  "article": [
    "It\u2019s May 1997 and a most un-British sense of optimism is hanging in the air, mingling with the sticky aroma of Impulse O2 body spray. Tony Blair is the new prime minister, the UK has won the Eurovision Song Contest, and the Spice Girls have announced an upcoming film, Spice World. Nobody yet knows it\u2019ll be a rapid tumble downhill from here for all concerned. Life is good.",
    "Life is bloody great, in fact. At the age of 11 I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m Dux of my primary school, which is the dweeb equivalent of being crowned Gala Queen. My entire body trembles with glee when I learn the news, my shell suit gently rustling in delight.",
    "Partly because I\u2019m proud, but mostly because it means I\u2019ll get a present. I\u2019m finally going to have the one thing I\u2019ve been dreaming of for the best part of a year: Crash Bandicoot.",
    "Rewind a few months and I\u2019m in my friend Jenny\u2019s kitchen, the two of us perched on stools in front of a compact television hooked up to a dove-grey console. She\u2019s the first of my friends to get a PlayStation and I\u2019m politely straining at the leash for a shot.",
    "My gaming life thus far has been a steady diet of MS-DOS games played on my dad\u2019s best friend\u2019s hand-me-down computers \u2013 Invasion of the Mutant Space Bats of Doom, Prince of Persia, Zork \u2013 with monochrome displays and pixels so big you could eat dinner off them. I have a Game Boy for which I own two games, Tetris and Super Mario Land. At night I sneak it out and play it under the duvet with a torch illuminating the screen.",
    "Kids at school chat about their Mega Drives and Sega Saturns, their Ataris and Super Nintendo consoles, and I can\u2019t even visualise what they are and how they work. I\u2019ve only heard boys talk about them, boys with grubby Sonic school bags and spiked-up hair, so subconsciously I think they must not be for girls.",
    "But then Jenny gets a PlayStation.",
    "The disc whirs and Crash Bandicoot bounces onto the screen in glorious, saturated technicolour. My friend expertly navigates to N. Sanity Beach and the room fills with the optimistic, tribalesque music that will become the soundtrack to my summer. She talks me through the controls \u2013 X is jump, Square is spin \u2013 as she weaves through the jungle, bopping crabs and smashing Wumpa-filled crates. \u201cOoga-booga!\u201d booms an Aku Aku mask, and we turn to each other grinning and parrot it back. \u201cOOGA-BOOGA!\u201d",
    "Then it\u2019s my turn. I grip a controller for the first time. I play in colour for the first time. I feel the giddy elation of getting three Aku Aku masks and racing invincibly through a level, my heart fluttering as I obliterate everything in my path.",
    "I walk home and tell my parents I really, really want a PlayStation. But what I really, really want is Crash Bandicoot. And then, in the summer of 1997, as a gift for being an unbearable little swot, I get both.",
    "A heat wave descends that summer. The tiny Scottish village I live in smells of hot concrete and cut grass. I don\u2019t go outside much, though, because after considerable begging and pleading my little sister and I have been allowed a small TV in our room. It sits on a shelf with my new toy plugged in below, and me plugged in on a bean bag on the floor.",
    "My rollerblades gather dust, the bike tyres sink and hours dissolve every day as I journey through N. Sanity Island. I munch through packets of Tangy Toms that rim my mouth with dusty crumbs the same lurid orange as my bandicoot chum.",
    "Try as I might, I can\u2019t get beyond Native Fortress at the end of the first island \u2013 those shield guys do me dirty every time \u2013 so I circle back to the beginning and lap my favourite levels. A round of Boulders floods my body with adrenaline as I swap chasing my pals outside for running away from a rolling rock. I ride the pig in Hog Wild so many times that every leap and dodge is committed to muscle memory. You know that video of the ballerina with Alzheimer\u2019s who can remember how to dance? If I ever suffer the same fate, Hog Wild will be my Swan Lake.",
    "As a not very seasoned gamer in a pre-internet age, I don\u2019t understand why I reach the end of a flawless play in some levels, only to be smashed over the head with the boxes I apparently missed. \u201cMy game must be broken,\u201d I think. I express this thought out loud on a rare outing to the swing park and a classmate laughs. \u201cNah, you need to get the gems. It\u2019s really hard, though. Do you want a cheat code?\u201d",
    "The code, scribbled in pencil, doesn\u2019t magically reveal the hidden boxes. It goes one better and unlocks every single level in the game.",
    "I jump between the three islands in awe, unable to believe my eyes. There are levels shrouded in darkness! Robots! Slime! The bongo drums give way to electro and filthy basslines. I die almost immediately in every level because, well, I\u2019m rubbish, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m just happy to be here, spending my summer holidays pootling around on the Wumpa Islands.",
    "I flirt with Crash over the subsequent years, but when life simultaneously blesses and curses you with the internet, boys and booze, it\u2019s easy to forget your humble roots. I smile fondly when I hear the trilogy has been remastered in 2017, but it\u2019s not until the end of 2018 that I play.",
    "I\u2019ve been driven to seek solace in it after receiving bad news. The kind that winds you. I\u2019m pit-deep in winter and already in hibernation mode; how do you bury yourself when you're already hiding?",
    "In nostalgia, it turns out. Some people have childhood teddies or a well-worn film they turn to in times of trauma and distress. Familiarity is soothing; a cuddle from an old friend. I discover my emotional comfort blanket in the video game I'd fallen in love with 21 years earlier, and dive in headfirst.",
    "This time I'm not messing about. I'm going to complete it. A bit of me is playing for pleasure but overwhelmingly I am seeking something that feels absent from my life: a sense of control. And while Crash seemed to be the master of me when I was 11 years old, I feel that 32-year-old me has a chance of beating it. Especially now the internet exists.",
    "I understand how the first game works now \u2013 that I get crystals for getting all the boxes, but some boxes will elude me until I've snared the coloured gems. I know I have to complete certain levels without dying to obtain the coloured gems, and that while Crash might not die on successful attempts, my soul will in the process of getting there.",
    "I become obsessed with the gems; they are my precious, I am Gollum. Every night I come home from work and play intensively until I achieve something; anything. When I discover I can walk the ropes on the bridge levels I want to phone everyone I know, then remember nobody cares because it\u2019s not the 90s any more and they\u2019re all married with kids.",
    "Entire days are spent sliding around in the pissing rain of Slippery Climb on a mission to get the red gem, the most challenging of all. When I make it unscathed past the revolving platforms and flapping birds to the sweet, succulent ruby at the end, my dopamine centre lights up like an arcade.",
    "By January 2019 I can look in the mirror and say: \u2018Crash? Completed it, mate.\u2019 Well. The first one, anyway.",
    "Look, we\u2019re in the midst of a pandemic: of course I have returned to the furry ginger embrace of Monsieur Bandicoot. Alongside wearing my pyjamas all day and being able to fetch Magnums from the freezer during meetings, working from home has bestowed on me the greatest blessing of all: Crash breaks.",
    "Between lockdowns and deadlines, new jobs and old wounds, I\u2019ve slowly made my way through the entire trilogy and the fourth game now lies in sight. I\u2019ve cursed the arsehole bees in Diggin\u2019 It, rode to victory on the baby polar bear in Totally Bear and pulsated with rage throughout every gimmicky level of Warped. When I realised I had to get the relics to complete the third game, I almost flushed my controller down the toilet in a huff. But then I persevered, because I\u2019m an adult lady and not a big baby.",
    "My therapist tells me it\u2019s important for anyone\u2019s mental health to have a sense of mastery in life, whether it\u2019s from learning an entirely new skill or completing a piece of work. For me, it has come from Crash. That feeling of ticking off a level, a crystal, a relic, whatever it is, brings a sense of achievement, even if the rest of the world has gone to muck.",
    "It\u2019s strange; I\u2019ve never really been one to reread books or rewatch films because I\u2019m constantly overwhelmed by how much new art there is to discover. Yet I\u2019d happily never play another videogame but Crash. It is my comfort food, my safety net, my virtual holiday home. And I still don\u2019t even know what a bandicoot is.",
    "The original games were developed by Naughty Dog. Activision Blizzard now owns the IP for Crash Bandicoot, and produced the remastered collection, and is currently embroiled in ongoing litigation in regards to claims reporting a workplace culture that allegedly enabled acts of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination.
