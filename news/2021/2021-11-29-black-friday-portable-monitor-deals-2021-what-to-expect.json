  "article": [

    "This time of year is perfect for tech upgrades. Prices are never lower and all of the big manufacturers have released their latest products in time for the festive season, so you\u2019ll get loads of choice.",
    "We\u2019re going to keep our eyes on every portable monitor or laptop monitor deal from every big retailer so you don\u2019t have to. If you want a new portable monitor on Cyber Monday 2021, bookmark this page so you can stay up to date.",
    "We'll be updating this page regularly to include any new deals we find. But for now, these are all the best portable monitor deals out there \u2013 and there already some fine offers that are worth snapping up.",
    "Whether you just want the cheapest portable full HD monitor, the one with the brightest screen (QLED or OLED), a 4K portable monitor, a 4K touchscreen one or the biggest portable monitor around, we've gone one for you.",
    "Also check out our list of Cyber Monday monitor deals as well as our best gaming monitor deals.",
    "We understand if you want to do your own deal-hunting, though, so we\u2019ve compiled this list of our favorite retailers. Here you\u2019ll find the best buying options in the US and the UK, and we\u2019ve highlighted their strengths too.",
    "US:",
    "Amazon: the biggest range, and often at the best prices",
    "Adorama: a broad range that includes creative, pro, and niche options",
    "B&H Photo: the best site if you want creative products",
    "Best Buy: broad range and good prices, especially if you\u2019re a member",
    "Newegg: a good option if you want a portable monitor for gaming",
    "Walmart: a broad range with Amazon price-matching \u2013 but be aware of marketplace sellers",
    "UK:",
    "Amazon: great prices and an unbeatable range from the retail giant",
    "Box: mainstream options at good prices, with frequent deals on offer",
    "Ebuyer: a computing specialist with a good range of key products",
    "Laptops Direct: a portable specialist that has monitors from every big brand",
    "It\u2019s entirely understandable if you don\u2019t want to wait for Cyber Monday before you take the plunge and buy a new portable monitor \u2013 especially if you need one immediately. If that\u2019s the case, you can already find plenty of great deals around. We\u2019ve rounded up some of the best options right here, and head here to see our verdict on the best portable monitors of 2021 if you\u2019d like some more inspiration.",
    "As you'd expect most vendors will carry Black Friday sales over to Cyber Monday and even beyond. Those crucial Cyber Five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday will all see retailers unveil great offers, and Adobe found that Cyber Monday was bigger than Black Friday in sales terms in both 2019 and 2020.",
    "It\u2019s not just about those five days, either. We\u2019ve noticed that the best deals tend to appear right from the start of Thanksgiving week, and you can even find good deals begin to appear from the middle of October if you look around carefully. If you want a new portable monitor but don\u2019t want to wait until Black Friday itself, the expansion of the shopping season could be a boon. Alternatively, prices will remain low right up until Christmas and beyond. With staffing and supply issues still affecting most retailers, it\u2019s no wonder that the shopping season has stretched.",
    "The growth in working from home and portable monitor popularity means that we expect more portable monitor deals to be available this year than ever before, so it\u2019s a wonderful time to buy. After all, regular home working has increased in popularity by 173% since 2005, and 98% of people would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers.",
    "Portable monitors are peripherals that are available at a wide range of mainstream prices. Given their growth in popularity and enthusiasm around electronics, you\u2019ll be able to find portable monitor discounts from late October, all the way through the Cyber Five, and then up until the New Year.",
    "If you want to track the best portable monitor deals on Black Friday 2021, then we\u2019ve got one simple solution for you: keep this page bookmarked and check back regularly.",
    "Whether you want to buy a portable monitor or another bit of tech on Black Friday, there are some simple and effective rules that you can follow to ensure you get the best deals.",
    "The first thing you should do? Plenty of research. There are loads of intriguing and effective portable monitor products around, but you\u2019ll need to know what you want to buy in advance so you can jump on deals as soon as they appear. If you want a portable monitor, that means you\u2019ll need to consider their screen sizes, connectivity options and attributes.",
    "You\u2019ve got to do your research on the various retailers out there, too. Positively, all the big retailers watch each other\u2019s prices and match as often as they can, so you\u2019re likely to get a good deal no matter where you shop. But plenty of retailers also offer free gifts, discounted delivery, and product bundles to get an edge over the competition. Discover this information before you sit down to shop, and you can get even better value.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, be prepared to look for great deals from the end of October right through November and December. The Cyber Five days may usually hold the best prices, but the discount season lasts for weeks. And, as ever, keep this page bookmarked for the latest information on all the best portable monitor discounts.",
    "There are plenty of other tips to bear in mind when you head online. It\u2019s worth using sites like PriceRunner to see if products are genuinely available with good discounts, and you can also create alerts for discounts on many sites, so you\u2019ll get an email if prices plummet.",
    "Create your online shopping accounts in advance so you\u2019ll be ready to buy as quickly as possible, and consider leaving your new hardware in the box after you buy \u2013 you could find it cheaper later in the shopping season and return the original product for a refund.",
    "Portable monitors have loads of different uses, so they\u2019re extremely versatile, but they have many key attributes that you\u2019ll need to know about before deciding which one to buy.",
    "A portable monitor is the perfect option for adding a second display while you work on the move \u2013 if you work remotely, for instance, or if you hot-desk at the office. They can even add full-screen functionality to mobile devices like smartphones or tablets, and they\u2019re handy if you want a second display but don\u2019t have the room for a full-size monitor. The extra screen can dramatically improve your productivity and make your computing life easier, so it pays to get the right hardware.",
    "First, consider the size of screen you need. You can find portable monitors that range in size from 11.6in and 13.3in right up to 15.6in and 17.3in options. Portable panels generally mirror the size options you\u2019ll find on modern laptops, and you need to think about how and where you\u2019ll be using the display. You may have the space for something bigger than your notebook\u2019s screen, but you might need something smaller and more portable too.",
    "Increased size will lead to increased weight and dimensions, too, so that\u2019s worth considering if you want something that\u2019s particularly portable.",
    "The level of quality on offer from the display could be crucial. If you only plan to use the portable monitor for web-browsing, communication tools and running Office apps then you can afford to buy a cheaper display that doesn\u2019t have great color or contrast performance. But if you want to run creative and color-sensitive tasks on your portable panel, you\u2019ll need to spend more for a display that can produce a broader range of accurate colors.",
    "Similarly, examine the display\u2019s resolution: a 1080p screen is fine for everyday work and mainstream creative tasks, but a 4K panel will always supply a crisper and more spacious experience. Also consider if you need a touchscreen or not.",
    "Beyond the screen, consider how the product will connect to your laptop or mobile device. Some have USB-C, others have HDMI or DisplayPort, but you\u2019ll need them to match up.",
    "You should also consider if a portable display can work in portrait mode if you\u2019ll find that useful, and bear in mind which displays come with the best ergonomic stand options \u2013 the ability to adjust the panel\u2019s position and angle is a huge boon. Others can attach to the back of your laptop screen with magnets, so you\u2019ll only have to carry one device around.",
    "Electronics are some of the most in-demand products on Black Friday, Cyber Monday and beyond, and portable monitors are a fast-growing part of the industry. That means you should expect to see a huge array of portable monitor discounts at this crucial period of the year.",
    "Happily, you\u2019ll be able to find almost all kinds of portable monitors with discounts. The best new mainstream portable displays from big-name companies should all be available at reduced prices, and you\u2019ll be able to make savings on more affordable products too, albeit with smaller reductions due to their lower original prices.",
    "Indeed, the only portable monitors that won\u2019t have Black Friday discounts are likely to be any high-end and brand-new products from the bigger brands. We also don\u2019t expect big reductions on specialist displays for high-end creative work.",
    "One thing to bear in mind: portable monitors are currently affected by component shortages like most other electronics, so don\u2019t be surprised if you find that your favored portable monitors quickly go out of stock once prices start to fall."
