  "article": [
    "Halo Infinite won\u2019t launch with a couple big features when it arrives later in 2021, according to a new Bungie update video \u2013 and it still doesn\u2019t have a release date.",
    "In addition, the game will launch without co-op for the story campaign as well as the Forge level editor. Both will still come to the game via free updates \u2013 co-op will be added to the game three months after launch in a \u2018Season 2\u2019 update, while Forge is coming six months after launch with \u2018Season 3,\u2019 according to WindowsCentral.",
    "Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten explained that the features wouldn\u2019t be ready by launch: \u201cOur number one priority is making sure whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar. Across all platforms, Xbox devices, PC, and all of its different configurations.\u201d",
    "Here's the video \u2013 skip to 16:20 to hear it straight from Staten:",
    "There\u2019s still no official release date, and Bungie\u2019s devs reiterated that the game is coming \u2018holiday 2021,\u2019 which is typically in November or December. Delaying the entire game was considered, but the team considers Halo Infinite to be a \u2018Living Game,\u2019 as Staten put it: because they\u2019re going to keep adding more to the game, they decided temporarily sidelining co-op campaign and Forge until after launch to be a better solution.",
    "Halo Infinite was originally slated to be a launch title with the Xbox Series X in November 2020, but was delayed to 2021 to continue development and give players the \u2018game you deserve,\u2019 as one developer put it at the time. While the release window was announced to be during \u2018Holiday 2021,\u2019 it hasn\u2019t been narrowed down further \u2013 at least to the public, as Microsoft has trimmed the launch date to within \u2018a few weeks\u2019 internally.",
    "In the meantime, a limited Halo Infinite beta activated for a short time in July, giving lucky players hands-on time with the gameplay to come (or at least a stable build that was months old at that point), and we\u2019ve heard other info dripped out like this leaked multiplayer map and rumors of a battle royale mode.",
    "Today\u2019s update video didn\u2019t include any new video of the game \u2013 just devs chatting on the couch \u2013 but they promised campaign gameplay footage would be released before launch. We\u2019ll just have to wait patiently as we hope the release date sticks to this year."
