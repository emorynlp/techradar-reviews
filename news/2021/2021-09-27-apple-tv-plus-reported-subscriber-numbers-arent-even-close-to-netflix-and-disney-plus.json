    "Apple has been fairly guarded when it comes to revealing subscriber numbers for its Apple TV Plus streamer, so it may come as a surprise to learn that the platform allegedly has fewer than 20 million paying users in North America.",
    "Last week, CNBC reported that a spokesman for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees said Apple told the union of its subscriber count as of July 2021, a figure which, by law, would allow the company to pay behind-the-scenes production crews lower rates than those working on Netflix or Disney Plus shows.",
    "That\u2019s because both of those rival streamers boast around 74 and 38 million subscribers in North America, respectively, meaning they\u2019re obliged to pay production teams a wage that meets a certain threshold.",
    "The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (which Apple is a part of) \u201cdoesn\u2019t create carve-outs for specific companies,\u201d according to a spokesperson for the industry group mentioned in the report, and Apple itself has since claimed that the company pays rates equivalent to those paid to workers on other streamers.",
    "Union negotiations aside, though, this mysterious \u201cless than 20 million\u201d figure reveals a relatively new streaming service in uncertain health.",
    "Obviously, less than 20 million paying subscribers in the US \u2013 which could conceivably mean anything from one to 19 million \u2013 isn\u2019t anything close to Netflix, and Disney Plus\u2019 38 million-person equivalent figure might as well be double that of Apple TV Plus, but the playing field isn\u2019t a level one.",
    "The former, for instance, spent nearly a decade building its now-impressive library of content on the back of existing pedigree in the DVD rental market, while the latter coughed up eye-watering sums of money on perhaps the two most valuable IPs in the history of filmmaking (Star Wars and Marvel, for reference), which all-but guaranteed a large number of paying subscribers at launch. Unleashing the Disney animation library, too, offered Disney Plus tremendous value and an easy sell.",
    "By comparison, it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple TV Plus is built upon original content exclusively. That means there\u2019s no old movies or existing TV shows in its library, rather completely new (read: completely untested) content like Ted Lasso, Mythic Quest and Foundation.",
    "We recently dug into the importance of Apple TV\u2019s newest shows in more detail, and though these subscriber figures arguably don\u2019t reflect the quality of the streamer\u2019s content, it\u2019s still mightily impressive to see a platform less than two years old (it launched in November 2019) boast such a varied library of original properties.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely that Apple TV Plus will ever catch up with Netflix when it comes to subscriber numbers, that much has long-been clear, and even with Disney Plus reportedly struggling to add more American customers in 2021, its slate of upcoming movies and TV shows will ensure there\u2019s hysteria-level interest in its content for years to come.",
    "That being said, Apple deserves credit for getting its burgeoning streamer as far as it has done in so little time, and the impending arrival of even more original content should see its subscriber numbers become a little easier on the eyes in the not-too-distant future."
