  "article": [
    "Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass has had a seismic impact on the video game industry. It\u2019s been the driving force behind the early success of the Xbox Series X, and made the more affordable Xbox Series S a tempting proposition for those looking to enter the Xbox ecosystem for the very first time.",
    "But even though the value proposition Xbox Game Pass has been well documented, Microsoft\u2019s subscription service has also provided a terrific platform for independent developers to shine \u2013 one that feels like a match made in heaven.",
    "We spoke to \u201cAgo\u201d Agostino Simonetta, director of the ID@Xbox global partnership team, about how Microsoft\u2019s program has helped bring more independent games to the Xbox platform, the power of Xbox Game Pass, and the importance of Microsoft\u2019s more affordable new current-gen console, the Xbox Series S.",
    "Independent games have continued to rise in prominence since the Xbox 360, which was a platform that Ago admits was \u201csuper close to the development community\u201d. From the popular Summer of Arcade event, which used to celebrate and highlight a selection of exciting new titles, to the Xbox Live Indie Games initiative, Microsoft made great strides in championing independent developers.",
    "But when it came to Xbox One, Ago conceded that Microsoft lost its way a little. \u201cI think at one point, the evolution of the program kind of froze for a bit. There was a moment of freezing...and not being perfectly in line with the market and where it was going. ID@Xbox was the answer.\u201d",
    "The ID@Xbox program was Microsoft\u2019s big push to bring independent developers back to the Xbox platform, and was designed to reflect how the market had evolved. As Ago explained, \u201c...we were ready to go to the next level and effectively open up [Xbox] to [developers] to completely self publish.\u201d",
    "He also admitted that due to how the labelling of independent games has changed, and how these games are perceived among gamers, it\u2019s unlikely that a Summer of Arcade-style event will return.",
    "\u201cNow we have hundreds of millions of people, billions of people \u2013 they're more than comfortable engaging with independent titles, right. So I think as much as I missed those [Summer of Arcade] days...we need to have a new outlook in terms of how we promote content, how we distribute content... the Summer of Arcade was a very important milestone in the evolution. But I think the market is very different today.\u201d",
    "And he\u2019s not wrong. Independent games now garner the same type of respect, excitement and commercial success that was previously only available to the annual blockbuster titles that are typically developed by hundreds of people and backed by the biggest publishers in the world. ID@Xbox helps bring more independent games to the Xbox platform, shines a spotlight on them, but also avoids pigeonholing them as just indies.",
    "\u201cI think we need to go beyond those labels,\u201d Ago said. \u201cThe market has evolved so much...we treat games as games. We don't even say [which games] are ID@Xbox partners because the audience does not care. The title is [why] they love it.\u201d",
    "With Microsoft offering a cheaper entry point into next-gen gaming with Xbox Series S, what do independent developers think of the more affordable system, and is it having the impact Microsoft desires? Ago believes it is.",
    "\u201cI think if you're a partner of a platform...and you're a content creator, you are very excited the moment the platform [holder] gives you tools to reach the largest possible audience. And I think with now with the launch of the Xbox Series X and S, you start seeing the validation of the strategy, how Xbox Series S is delivering a next-gen experience for people that don't need top performance,\" Ago said. \"A lot of people want to come to experience next-gen, but quite often they wait a bit longer. But actually, at that price point, I can jump in and get that experience.\u201d",
    "Ago is also aware that a lot of gamers own multiple consoles, and that the Xbox Series S could be seen as a great alternative. \u201c...let's face it, in a world where people play on multiple consoles, it\u2019s great. You might not be an Xbox player by default, but actually, with the power of Xbox Game Pass and the [price of the] Xbox Series S\u2026people might think for a second. I have friends that have other consoles, but they're playing on Xbox Series S today, and they\u2019re probably in the Xbox Game Pass program.",
    "\u201cSo I think it's been a very powerful [option] and again, yes, the reaction from the developers was pretty positive. Developing for the platform as a whole has also been relatively straightforward...we always say we are successful if we make the transitions [from a console generation] as boring as they can be. So yeah, I think the feedback has been super positive. And you know, you're on the media...you see a lot of fan reaction. I don't know what your point of view is. But I think it's landing pretty well.\u201d",
    "And so do we, to the point where we stated that the combination of Xbox Series S and Xbox Game Pass could make Microsoft\u2019s sleek all-white Xbox a real threat to the PS5.",
    "But Microsoft\u2019s subscription service isn\u2019t just a hit with gamers \u2013 independent developers are excited too. When asked whether Xbox Game Pass has driven more developers to the ID@Xbox program, Ago was under no illusions about the impact the service has had.",
    "\u201cYes, totally. We actually had a developer come to us and say \u2018I used to be PC-focused, but obviously, you guys have Xbox Game Pass across the two platforms [Xbox and PC]. I'm interested in exploring this value, do you like my game? Can we figure something out?\u2019. So yeah, I think in general, the community response has been one of excitement. And then when you look at the positive impact Xbox Game Pass is having on [developers'] games, I think it has really helped.\u201d",
    "Xbox Game Pass is great for independent developers, then, but Ago stressed that Microsoft has worked hard to \u201cpartner up with more and more studios\u201d and also tried to \u201cimprove our dev tools and processes\u2026we try to make people\u2019s lives easier. Xbox Game Pass has been received extremely well by the development community, but also what we try to do to make their life easier. It's helping in these conversations.\u201d",
    "One question that\u2019s often leveled at Xbox Game Pass is that it\u2019s too good to be true. But as Ago admits, while \u201cit does seem to be good to be true\u201d he reiterates \u201cthat, actually, it is true, and it\u2019s only getting better.\u201d He also explained how it's become a discovery engine for gamers, who are playing more games, different genres, and sharing their new favorite titles with others.",
    "\u201cWhat we are seeing with Xbox Game Pass, is that the moment you remove spending on an individual title from the equation \u2013 obviously, you're still paying a subscription \u2013 but the moment that happens it affects the decision,\u201d Ago explains. \u201cI don't like puzzle games and, for example, Human Fall Flat is a puzzle game. I'm not gonna buy it no matter what the price point is. But the moment it\u2019s on Game Pass? We know that a large percentage of the people that have engaged with Human Fall Flat in the past have never played a puzzle game on our platform. So effectively, we think of Xbox Game Pass as a discovery engine \u2013 it breaks those barriers.\u201d",
    "Ago went on to provide another example, one that might resonate specifically with a number of European Xbox owners. \u201cI played MLB: The Show 21 recently from our friends at Sony San Diego and MLB. It's on Game Pass, and I know so many people that never played MLB. I care about soccer and F1. But\u2026 I think it\u2019s in Game Pass...why not? Why not play MLB? Even if you don't care about baseball, because you might not enjoy it. So I think it's a discovery engine like that.\u201d",
    "So what\u2019s next for Xbox Game Pass and ID@Xbox? Well, there are some big hitters on the way. The Ascent, Edge of Eternity, and 12 Minutes are but a few of the games coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox consoles through the program which look seriously impressive, and two of them launch on Xbox Game Pass on day one. Ago and the ID@Xbox team continue to \u201cfind content, talk to and manage partners\u201d and he encourages everybody to \u201cflag\u201d games that the community would like to see.",
    "With Xbox Game Pass and the ID@Xbox program, it\u2019s clear that Xbox has re-established itself as an enticing platform for independent developers to develop for \u2013 and more importantly, thrive."
