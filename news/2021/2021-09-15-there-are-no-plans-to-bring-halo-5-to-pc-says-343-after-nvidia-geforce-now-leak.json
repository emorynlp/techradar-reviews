    "343 Industries has spoken out to say that Halo 5: Guardians will not be coming to PC following a leak from the Nvidia GeForce Now database that suggested it could be a possibility.",
    "The leak earlier this week uncovered potential listings for many seemingly unannounced PC games, including several PlayStation exclusives and, of course, the much-desired Halo 5.",
    "In a statement to Wccftech, Nvidia confirmed the leak but said that \"released and/or speculative titles\" on the list were \u201cused only for internal tracking and testing\u201d and that \u201cinclusion on the list is neither confirmation nor an announcement of any game.\u201d",
    "This didn\u2019t stop hopeful Halo fans from speculating that Halo 5 might finally be making its way to PC. However, Halo Community Director Brian Jarrard has now spoken out to say that will not be the case.",
    "Responding to posts about the matter on Twitter, Jarrard said that the listing was \u201cmaybe...for H5: Forge\u201d but added there are \u201cno plans\u201d for a Halo 5 PC port. Jarrard acknowledged fan demand for the port but said \u201cthe studio is fully focused on Infinite and MCC [Master Chief Collection]\u201d.",
    "Jarrard was careful to say \u201cnever say never\u201d but it looks like there\u2019s definitely nothing in development at the moment, nor will there be in the near future.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time that 343 Industries has had to deny plans to bring Halo 5 to PC. It was only last year that Halo community manager John Junyszek confirmed during a stream to celebrate the game\u2019s fifth anniversary that the game wouldn\u2019t be coming to PC, even as part of the Master Chief Collection.",
    "Halo 5 probably won\u2019t be the last game on the leaked Nvidia list the existence of which a developer or publisher will have to step forward and deny. In fact, this early denial is probably a pretty good sign that we should take the list with a massive vat of salt, even when it\u2019s a title that seems like it could be a realistic candidate for a PC port.",
    "Admittedly, there were some pretty questionable and even outdated items on the list but there were also some listings that weren\u2019t totally outlandish. Halo 5 was one of them and some ports of exclusive PlayStation games were others.",
    "Sony has said that it\u2019s planning to bring more of its games to PC which lends credence to their appearance on the list but that doesn\u2019t mean we can be sure that the specific games that were part of the leak\u2014Returnal and Demon\u2019s Souls among others\u2014will definitely come to PC and/or Nvidia\u2019s streaming service.",
    "As Nvidia said in its statement, many listings were \u201cspeculative\u201d and, as Jarrard\u2019s statement has shown, it\u2019s probably safest to wait for an official announcement before feeling too hopeful about any of them.",
    "So, Halo 5 still isn\u2019t coming to PC, then. However, Halo Infinite is. The next Halo game is coming to PC and Xbox very soon, in fact, with its release date finally confirmed to be December 8. 343 Industries has promised that Halo Infinite will be a \u201cfirst class\u201d experience on PC and that \u201cit\u2019s not a port, it\u2019s built with PC in mind.\u201d"
