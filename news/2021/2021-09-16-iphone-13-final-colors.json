    "If you\u2019re planning to buy one of the iPhone 13 phones, it\u2019s not just the model that you\u2019ll need to choose. Beyond picking between the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max, you\u2019ll also need to decide on the color.",
    "This year there are nine colors to choose from, some of which are new and some of which return from the iPhone 13 range. However, not every color is available for every model \u2013 the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini come in the same five shades as each other, while the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max come in the other four shades.",
    "Below we\u2019ll run you through all the options, from Starlight to Sierra Blue and beyond, so you\u2019ll have a better idea of what to buy.",
    "The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini both come in the choice of Product Red, Starlight, Midnight, Blue or Pink. The only one of these that the iPhone 12 was offered in is Product Red, though some of the other shades are still similar to those you could get the iPhone 12 in.",
    "This red shade returns from the iPhone 12 range, though it appears to be slightly darker here. In any case, it\u2019s a bold color that\u2019s sure to stand out from the crowd. In fact it\u2019s arguably the most showy of all the iPhone 13 shades.",
    "Apple calls this color Starlight, but that seems to basically be a fancy way of saying white or off-white. It\u2019s similar to the white iPhone 12 (which didn\u2019t get a fancy name) and it\u2019s one of the more ordinary colors available for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini. That said, it looks classy.",
    "This is another case of Apple giving an ordinary color a fancy name, as the Midnight shade is basically just black, which is also a color you could get the iPhone 12 in.",
    "It\u2019s a classy, understated shade for anyone who doesn\u2019t want their phone to look brighter than the sun.",
    "There\u2019s no confusion about what this color is \u2013 it\u2019s blue. That said, blue is a slightly unusual choice for a phone, so it will stand out a bit more than the Starlight or Midnight shades above.",
    "It\u2019s a fairly muted blue shade \u2013 it\u2019s not bright or shiny, so it should still look classy, just a bit different from the norm. The iPhone 12 also came in blue, but a slightly darker shade than you\u2019ll find here.",
    "Finally for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini we have pink, and this is quite a pale pink, so fans of hot pink will have to look elsewhere. This is the one shade that doesn\u2019t have a similar color in the iPhone 12 range, so if you want something different from last year\u2019s offerings, this is the one to go for.",
    "The Pro models in the iPhone 13 range come in a slightly smaller selection of colors, with buyers having the choice of Graphite, Gold, Silver or Sierra Blue. Below we\u2019ll run you through all four of these shades.",
    "Graphite is an understated, greyish shade, and it\u2019s one that we previously saw offered for the iPhone 12 Pro range. It\u2019s not the most exciting option but if you want something that\u2019s dark but not black (a shade that isn\u2019t available for the iPhone 13 Pro anyway) then it\u2019s a good choice.",
    "The gold model of the iPhone 13 Pro takes a very different approach, as it\u2019s possibly the most bright and showy of all the iPhone 13 Pro shades.",
    "It\u2019s a little bit bling, but Apple has opted for a fairly classy shade of gold, so it doesn\u2019t look crass. The iPhone 12 Pro was also available in this shade.",
    "Here\u2019s another color that was available for the iPhone 12 Pro too \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need too much introduction, as silver is almost as common on phones as black and white. It\u2019s shiny but subtle, doing a good job of taking a middle ground between the Graphite and Gold shades in terms of how showy it is.",
    "This year\u2019s new Pro shade is Sierra Blue, which replaces Pacific Blue from the iPhone 12 Pro range. So it\u2019s still blue, but this time it\u2019s slightly lighter and doesn\u2019t have the greenish hue of the old version.",
    "It also appears lighter than the blue of the standard iPhone 13, but it\u2019s not at all bright, so this wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a boardroom."
