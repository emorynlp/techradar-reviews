    "VZR, a company co-founded by Apple\u2019s former Lead Audio Engineer Vic Tiscareno back in 2014, has just debuted its new rival for Razer and Turtle Beach headsets: the Model One.",
    "The new headphones will be the first to feature the company\u2019s new trademarked CrossWave technology that uses an acoustic filter that \u201cselectively and strategically reshapes audio waves to emulate the way one would perceive the sound in real life without headphones\u201d.",
    "The result, VZR says, is a headset that has the fidelity and detail of a studio reference speaker system when critically listening to your favorite music, and accurate 3D spatial positioning when playing your favorite games, all without any software modulation.",
    "The wired headset comes with a detachable boom mic and is slated for launch in Q2 2021 \u2013 between April and June of this year \u2013 for $349 (around \u00a3250, AU$450), a price comparable with other audiophile headsets like the Audeze Mobius.",
    "In a video on VZR\u2019s website, Tiscareno says he was hand-picked by Steve Jobs to be an audio engineer on a number of Apple\u2019s most successful audio gear \u2013 including the iPod, iPhone and pack-in EarPods \u2013 and yet, he says the VZR Model One is \u201cas innovative as anything I\u2019ve ever made at Apple\u201d.",
    "While open-back gaming headphones are nothing new (just look at the Audeze Mobius and Sennheiser Game One Gaming Headset) the CrossWave audio lens could be a real game-changer as the industry pushes toward 360-degree spatial audio. Being able to get spatial audio-like effects without software upscaling is a huge step up from a lot of the solutions we\u2019ve seen from Dolby and Sony that require specially mastered audio tracks.",
    "That said, without hearing them for ourselves it\u2019s hard to know how well that claim holds up. The idea of an audiophile-grade gaming headset is definitely intriguing, but the execution is really all that matters.",
    "If you're ready to go hands-on with them yourself, VZR says it will opening up pre-orders on its website soon and will have more news to share about the headset before it officially launches later this year."
