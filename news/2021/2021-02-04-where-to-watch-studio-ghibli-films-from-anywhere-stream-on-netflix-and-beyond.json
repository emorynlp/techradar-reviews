    "Streaming services haven't always let you watch Studio Ghibli and its weird and wonderful back catalogue. But after years in the wilderness, HBO Max and Netflix agreed deals last year allowing them to stream the company\u2019s entire ouevre - and that's still the case in 2021. This collection of critically-lauded, record-breaking hits from the Japanese animation powerhouse wasn't available to stream or download digitally in the West until only last year, so fans have plenty to catch-up on now the catalogue is out in full.",
    "Netflix now has exclusive streaming rights for all territories except the US, Canada, and Japan. Meanwhile, HBO Max is the home for Studio Ghibli content for the North American market. With these services providing easy access to 20+ feature films, lesser known fare like Pom Poko and a TV movie called Ocean Waves, it gives them a competitive edge over rival platforms Disney Plus and Apple TV - certainly if you're an anime fan.",
    "Co-founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, Studio Ghibli has left an indelible impression on the cinematic landscape. Their highly imaginative, morally complex and humanistic films have endeared themselves to audiences and critics alike across the globe. Princess Mononoke won Japan\u2019s Best Picture award in 1997, and was the first animated film to do so. Four years later, Spirited Away received the Best Animated Feature at the Oscars while also knocking Titanic from the top spot of Japan\u2019s highest-ever grossing film.",
    "So, are you ready to soar with porcine pilot Porco Rosso or join Totoro and his forest-dwelling friends? Then we\u2019ll break down for you where to watch Studio Ghibli content based on your location, and let you enjoy some of the finest anime cinema has to offer - including how to watch Earwig and The Witch online, which is the legendary outfit's latest release and still in theaters in many countries.",
    "If you find yourself away from home for whatever reason, you don\u2019t have to skip your audio-visual visits to the wonderful world of Ghibli.",
    "Utilizing a VPN will allow you to watch these anime masterpieces no matter where you are. This basic bit of software alters your IP address, giving you access to regional content that you\u2019d usually be watching on your Totoro bedspread at home.",
    "Listed below \u2013 with breathless excitement \u2013 are the dates that each Studio Ghibli feature became available on Netflix:"
