    "Marvel Studios\u2019 Kevin Feige has confirmed the next Deadpool instalment will be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe \u2013 and remain R-rated.",
    "In an interview with Collider, Feige put to bed fears that Ryan Reynolds\u2019 foul-mouthed superhero had been kept in its own lane, given the predominantly PG-13-rated nature of the existing MCU. Marvel Studios is currently working on a script overseen by Reynolds himself.",
    "Feige said: \u201cIt will be rated R and we are working on a script right now, and Ryan\u2019s overseeing [it]\u201d, adding that, despite being green-lit, Deadpool 3 won\u2019t begin filming this year. \u201cRyan is a very busy, very successful actor. We\u2019ve got a number of things we\u2019ve already announced that we now have to make, but it\u2019s exciting for it to have begun. Again, a very different type of character in the MCU, and Ryan is a force of nature, which is just awesome to see him bring that character to life.\u201d",
    "\u201cA force of nature\u201d is something of an understatement considering the mindless profanity and penchant for violence of Marvel\u2019s now-iconic masked superhuman. But Reynolds\u2019 charisma \u2013 coupled with the less family-friendly approach to storytelling afforded by being a Fox production \u2013 meant the first Deadpool movie was an unexpected hit, and it\u2019s no surprise that Feige and company are committed to retaining Wade Wilson\u2019s trademark humor.",
    "Late last year, it was reported that Bob's Burgers writers Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin were co-writing the script for Deadpool 3.",
    "Deadpool as a character offers a refreshing antidote to the squeaky clean heroism of Marvel\u2019s other properties. His existence in the MCU could be explained in a number of different ways: Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking humor means he lives outside of his own universe, to some extent, while the possibility of a Marvel multiverse also offers a window to bring the character across from the Fox movies.",
    "Naturally, it comes as no surprise that production on Deadpool 3 isn\u2019t yet underway. Feige and Marvel have enough on their plate as filming kicks off for Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange 2, Black Panther 2, Captain Marvel 2, and so on (see what we mean?). It\u2019s unlikely, then, that we\u2019ll see Ryan Reynolds\u2019 masked vigilante on our screens any time before 2023.",
    "That said, it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility to expect Deadpool to crop up in one of the studio\u2019s many Disney Plus projects \u2013 it\u2019s not as though he\u2019s short of entry points. But regardless of his ETA, it\u2019s good to see Marvel has a plan for the Merc with a Mouth."
