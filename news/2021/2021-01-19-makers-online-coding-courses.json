    "Makers has earned a good reputation as one of Europe\u2019s best courses for learning code. The Makers coding bootcamp isn\u2019t designed for absolute novices but for those who know a little bit of code and want to advance in skill. The physical building is based in Shoreditch, at the heart of London\u2019s tech industry, but if you can\u2019t make it to the Big Smoke for a 12-week course, remote learning courses are available.",
    "In this evaluation, we\u2019ll assess if Makers is one of the best online cloud learning platforms for coding available today. By examining Makers\u2019 pricing, services, and support options \u2014 before comparing it to the competition \u2014 we\u2019ll help you decide if Makers is right for you.",
    "Makers promises participants a new career within four months for an \u00a38,000 fee, which is reduced to \u00a37,500 if you\u2019re a woman or a gender minority. However, having the money in your pocket isn\u2019t enough to be accepted onto the bootcamp. All applicants have to go through a selection process.",
    "First, you must send a written application, and if your application demonstrates you have some coding experience, Makers will invite you to an interview. The next stage of the process is an interview and pair-programming session with a Makers coder. If you demonstrate sufficient skill in the programming session, you\u2019ll be invited to pay a deposit to reserve your place on the course. Be sure to pay your deposit ASAP, as the course places quickly fill up.",
    "Makers are clear that if you fail the selection process, you\u2019re able to try again at a later date.",
    "Courses at Makers last three months, from Monday to Friday, full-time, and most weekends require you to complete a coding challenge. Makers promise that the average graduate earns \u00a335,000 as their starting wage. As Makers is both a coding bootcamp and recruitment agency for top brands, you can be assured that your course guarantees some level of employability. Makers proudly advertise that they\u2019ve placed graduates with over 300 companies.",
    "Your coding bootcamp begins with a pre-course that ensures every developer in the class has the same knowledge base prior to starting. The aim of the Makers\u2019 program is to produce \u2018language agnostic developers\u2019 who can acquire new languages in weeks. However, first, they want you to develop a good knowledge of the back-end coding language, Ruby.",
    "After Ruby, you\u2019ll progress to Rails, then Javascript and front-end development. From the beginning, Makers bootcamp aims to recreate the atmosphere of a real office by encouraging team collaboration on projects. Makers train would-be developers in agile software development to increase their employability among organizations that require coding team collaboration and individual flexibility.",
    "The final assessment is in Week 11. You\u2019ll be asked to produce a portfolio that reveals the goals you\u2019ve achieved on projects throughout the course and explains how you achieved them. A coach will assess your portfolio and then schedule a meeting with you to determine whether you\u2019re employable or not. If you fail your review, you can resubmit a different portfolio for assessment. If you pass, you\u2019ll be encouraged to apply for vacancies with Makers\u2019 hiring partners.",
    "Makers distinguishes itself with a collaborative learning process which creates employable developers with flexible thinking and team collaboration skills.",
    "Makers acts as a recruitment agency for big-name brands and has placed graduate developers with over 300 businesses, including Tesco, Starling Bank, and the BBC. Because Makers must guarantee graduate quality to maintain relationships with hiring partners, you know they\u2019ll train you to the highest standard.",
    "Makers developers are encouraged to take command of their own learning as they would in a coding team. Learners are encouraged to solicit help and clarification from their coaches, instead of their coaches coming to them with advice. In addition to that, learners are encouraged to pursue their own side projects, which will be assessed positively during their final review.",
    "Agile Software Development is taught to produce team players and adaptive problem solvers. Over the 12-week course, Makers developers will have to submit a minimum of two team projects, during which they\u2019ll have to navigate communication and leadership dynamics with other developers in training.",
    "Makers aims to produce \u2018agnostic language\u2019 developers who\u2019ll always choose the best language to meet the demands of their current project. Learners will be trained in Ruby, Javascript, and Rails so that they can understand the fundamentals of programming languages and then apply that knowledge to mastering others.",
    "The year 2020 saw Makers change its guaranteed job offer upon program completion to a guaranteed career support program. Every developer who passes the Makers course is still able to apply for vacancies at hiring partners through the Makers career service, as previously. However, now Makers cannot guarantee you\u2019ll be hired at the close of the process due to increased economic uncertainty.",
    "Every graduate gets personalized career support, and they\u2019re expected to share evidence of applications with the Makers Career team. Regular check-ins with career team personnel aim to keep Makers developers motivated during the job application process. If graduates experience difficulty getting hired, they\u2019re placed with a Career Coach, who\u2019ll set tasks to improve their employability.",
    "One of Makers\u2019 fiercest competitors is Bloc. Whereas Makers only teaches you Ruby, Rails, and Javascript, Bloc also educates students in HTML, CSS, Heroku, and Git. Another way Bloc improves upon Makers is with price, as Bloc only charges \u00a32,499 for online learning in comparison with Makers\u2019 \u00a38,000. However, Bloc does not have a career support program, which puts it at a disadvantage.",
    "DevPointLabs is another rival and improves upon the Makers by offering part-time courses better suited to those working alongside coding training. The scholarships DevPointLabs offers reduce the $5,500 tuition by 50%, which is more generous than the \u00a3500 Makers (and Bloc) deduct from their price. DevPointLabs scholarships are available to people of all minority backgrounds, not just gender minorities.",
    "Makers is a great choice for a novice coder who wants to acquire technical expertise and become attractive to hiring managers. As the Makers mimics an in-house agile software development team, employers take a pass as an indication you\u2019re able to conduct yourself professionally.",
    "Course participants can feel confident their course is of quality as the success of Maker\u2019s recruitment arm depends on keeping hiring partners happy."
