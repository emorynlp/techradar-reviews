  "article": [
    "Thanks to its once-every-four-years status, there\u2019s always been something a little odd about February 29. The 2004 vintage was even more unconventional than usual, however, because of what happened at that year\u2019s Academy Awards.",
    "The Return of the King, the third and final movie in Peter Jackson\u2019s epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings, took home a whopping 11 Oscars, equalling a record previously set by Ben-Hur and Titanic. As well as being just the second sequel in history (after The Godfather Part II) to claim Best Picture, it was particularly notable because the Academy \u2013 traditionally rather conservative in its tastes \u2013 had wholeheartedly embraced epic fantasy for the first time.",
    "While the Oscars haven\u2019t jumped on the high-fantasy wagon train since \u2013 the closest Best Picture voters have come is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s fishy love story, The Shape of Water \u2013 Peter Jackson\u2019s victory was something of a game-changer. Nearly two decades on, big-budget screen versions of epic fantasy novels are commonplace, from the all-conquering Game of Thrones, through to Netflix\u2019s The Witcher, Shadow and Bone, and the short-lived Cursed. Amazon\u2019s also taking a new shot at Tolkien with an implausibly big-budgeted adventure set during the Second Age of Middle-earth.",
    "Things are rather different, however, in the many worlds of space opera, where fantasy\u2019s planet-hopping cousin is still waiting for the sort of Lord of the Rings-type moment that can turn classic novels into big players on screen.",
    "There\u2019s clearly a huge appetite for space-set action in movies and TV, whether it\u2019s Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy, or one of the numerous Star Trek TV shows \u2013 whether you want cute green alien sidekicks, bunches of a-holes, or copious amounts of boldly going, you\u2019re very well covered.",
    "But when it comes to adaptations of classic science fiction authors \u2013 SF\u2019s answers to JRR Tolkien and George RR Martin \u2013 Hollywood has a massive blind spot. In fact, at present, The Expanse is the highest profile take on a series of space-set novels.",
    "Amazon\u2019s take on James SA Corey\u2019s book series is brilliant \u2013 the closest thing to a new Battlestar Galactica \u2013 yet its appeal is way too cult to follow Game of Thrones into zeitgeist-grabbing crossover territory. Indeed, The Expanse was cancelled after three seasons by original network Syfy when it didn\u2019t attract a big enough audience, leaving Amazon Prime Video to step in and continue the story \u2013 it doesn\u2019t hurt when Jeff Bezos, a man rich enough to take a trip into orbit, is reportedly a fan.",
    "Change may be afoot, however, now that a pair of prestige adaptations of classic sci-fi novels are poised to catapult book-inspired space opera into the mainstream.",
    "Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune is allegedly the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and undoubtedly one of the most influential. Featuring a desert world, a chosen one and an evil dynasty in need of overthrowing, it shares plenty of DNA with Star Wars, yet Dune\u2019s association with the screen is rather less glorious. David Lynch (who was once in contention to direct Return of the Jedi) famously disowned his 1984 adaptation, and though it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as some make out, you do have to look past some rushed storytelling and the fact that the effects of the era can\u2019t match the ambition of the epic novel. There was also a mini-series made for the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) in the early 21st century.",
    "Dune 2021, however, should see the story given the sort of loving treatment The Lord of the Rings trilogy received under Peter Jackson\u2019s watch. At the helm is Denis Villeneuve, a director with undeniable sci-fi credibility from his work on Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, and he\u2019s brought on board a truly A-list cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd.",
    "Crucially, Warner Bros is throwing serious quantities of cash at the movie, and splitting the book across two films to give the story the chance to breathe. This all adds up to one of the big-hitters of science fiction literature being given the respect it deserves. There\u2019s also an HBO Max TV series spin-off, The Sisterhood, in the works.",
    "By the time Dune lands in cinemas (and HBO Max in the US), we\u2019ll already be several episodes into Foundation on Apple TV Plus. From Servant to The Morning Show and For All Mankind, Apple has established itself as a destination for big-budget, prestige TV, and it\u2019s clearly pulling out all the stops to bring Isaac Asimov, one of the godfathers of science fiction, to the screen.",
    "While Foundation\u2019s cast isn\u2019t as high-profile as Dune\u2019s \u2013 the biggest names are Chernobyl\u2019s Jared Harris and The Hobbit\u2019s Lee Pace \u2013 this millennium-spanning tale of a Galactic Empire looks extremely ambitious, with showrunner David S Goyer (Batman Begins, FlashForward) telling The Hollywood Reporter that: \u201cIt\u2019s a 1,000-year chess game between [Harris\u2019s character] Hari Seldon and the Empire, and all the characters in between are the pawns, but some of the pawns over the course of this saga end up becoming kings and queens.\u201d",
    "In other words, Warner and Apple are giving their high-profile SF adaptations every chance to succeed, taking them as seriously as the BBC would a slice of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. If they\u2019re a success Hollywood will surely take notice the way they have of fantasy since The Lord of the Rings. This could be the start of an exciting new age for movies and TV, if creatives start to plunder the rich back catalogue of science fiction literature \u2013 a source of ideas potentially as rich as Marvel and DC Comics.",
    "Now that technology has caught up with imagination, making even the grandest of interstellar action possible on screen, everything is theoretically filmable \u2013 especially now that television budgets are as big as their movie counterparts. Perhaps we\u2019re finally entering an era when Iain M Banks\u2019s Culture (which was, until 2020, in development at Amazon), Peter F Hamilton\u2019s Commonwealth Saga, Larry Niven\u2019s Ringworld, Joe Haldeman\u2019s The Forever War (not to be confused with The Tomorrow War) or Alfred Bester\u2019s The Stars My Destination could realistically make it to the screen.",
    "Of course, if either Dune or Foundation disappoints, then Hollywood could just as easily decide there\u2019s no market in adapting science fiction novels, and go back to the tried-and-tested safety net of comic-book action. But at least they\u2019ll have given it a go.",
    "Foundation debuts on Apple TV Plus on September 24. Dune is in cinemas (and on HBO Max in the US) from October 22."
