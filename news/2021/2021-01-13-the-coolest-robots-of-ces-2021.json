    "Spare a thought for the robots of CES 2021. This year\u2019s all-virtual event means the vegetable-chopping, spring-cleaning, joke-telling animatrons we\u2019ve come to expect on the show floor have been forced to work from home like the rest of us, performing through Zoom feeds and promotional videos as if they\u2019re merely machines created to serve humanity\u2026 wait?",
    "But despite the technical difficulties facing this year\u2019s crop of quirky machines, it\u2019s actually a pretty good time to be a robot. The world is a tough place right now, and despite supposedly giant leaps in AI, it\u2019s hard to imagine a mechanised butler having sleepless nights over the global pandemic and general political instability that rages around them. We\u2019re all in need of a little TLC in 2021 \u2013 which is handy, because the robots of this year\u2019s CES are much less HAL and far more helpful. There\u2019s robots to keep us safe, robots to help around the house, robots to entertain, robots to educate, and robots to do some of life\u2019s (really) heavy lifting.",
    "We\u2019ve picked out some of the coolest \u2013 from the super useful to the downright adorable.",
    "As expected, Samsung debuted its latest slew of home-improving robots at this year\u2019s show \u2013 the most interesting being the Samsung Bot Handy. Capable of loading the dishwasher, doing the laundry and even pouring a bottle of wine and bringing it to you on cue using its giant robot arm, the Bot Handy is a moving extension of your kitchen should you need \u201can extra hand in your home.\" Expect the next version to come wearing black tie.",
    "Getting one up on the Samsung Bot Handy is ITRI\u2019s Dual Arm Robot System, which has (you guessed it) not one, but two (!!) mechanised arms to help it perform smaller, gentler human tasks like playing the piano or opening a water bottle. The DARS is equipped with five-fingered, human-like hands which allow it to overcome the limitations of traditional robotics' grippers. It\u2019s still in the prototype stage, but the DARS looks ready-made to become a dexterous bartender.",
    "More than ever, personal hygiene is at the forefront of our day-to-day lives, and it\u2019s an anxiety that will persist as we return to the workplace. LG\u2019s CLOi UV-C (pronounced \u201cChloe bot\u201d) aims to ease those concerns by patrolling high-traffic areas in classrooms, offices, hotel lobbies etc. and eliminating harmful germs using its dual UV lights. In previous years, it\u2019s a robot that might have gotten buried beneath the noise of flashier products \u2013 but Covid-19 has meant the \u201cChloe bot\u201d can\u2019t come soon enough.",
    "Perhaps not exactly what you have in mind when you think of the term \u201crobot\u201d, but John Deere\u2019s X Series combine harvester is just that. Autonomous, camera-laden and capable of machine-to-machine communication, this giant hunk of metal looks set to change the future of agriculture. Farmers everywhere, rejoice! Manual crop pickers... not so much.",
    "Likely the robot on this list with the most immediate application, the Samsung JetBot 90 AI Plus is a smartvac that patrols your home using object recognition technology to decide the best cleaning path. It also uses LiDAR sensors (the lasers used in autonomous vehicles to determine depth and distance) to get up close to objects like toys while avoiding more fragile items like vases \u2013 and smellier numbers like pet poop (sorry, \u201cwet messes\u201d). Although we\u2019ve seen smartvacs before, the JetBot 90 AI Plus aims to be the first to never, ever get stuck. We'll believe that when we see it.",
    "CES wouldn\u2019t be complete without the customary announcement of the latest pet-like emotional support device \u2013 but damn, Moflin is cute. Created by Vanguard Industries with a successful Kickstarter campaign, Moflin is an AI pet robot with \"emotional capabilities\" which supposedly learns to love you using an algorithm and a set of built-in sensors. It\u2019s essentially a fluffy gray guinea pig with black beady eyes and soft fur that also makes a series of misty-eye-inducing gurgles. That comment about all needing a little TLC in 2021? This is what we mean.",
    "Similar to Moflin, this fur-covered robot from Japanese company Yukai Engineering is a lap cat designed to soothe and relax without the penchant for scratching and pooping. The smaller companion to 2020\u2019s Qoobo, the Petit Qoobo will pur, wag its tail and (supposedly) induce a state of calm and serenity. While it\u2019s not the most groundbreaking of bots at CES 2021, the Petit Qoobo is certainly up there with the weirdest."
