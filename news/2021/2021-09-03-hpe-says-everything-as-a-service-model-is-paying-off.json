    "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has presented its Q3 2021 financial results, saying it delivered an \u201cimpressive\u201d performance in which the \u201ceverything-as-a-service\u201d approach seems to be paying off.",
    "\u201cWe delivered a very impressive Q3 performance, marked by strong order growth, expanded margins and record free cash flow,\u201d said Antonio Neri, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. \u201cI am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market, and our edge-to-cloud strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses.\u201d",
    "The company increased its net revenue by 3% relative to Q3, and 1% year-on-year, up to $6.9 billion. Its annualized revenue run-rate (ARR) was $705 million, up 33% year-on-year, while its total as-a-service orders were up 46% in the same period.",
    "GAAP gross margins were also up 34.5%, up 420 basis points year-on-year, while non-GAPP gross margins rose 34.7%, also up 420 basis points from the prior-year period. GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) was $0.29, compared to $0.01 in the prior-year period, while non-GAAP diluted net EPS was $0.47, compared to $0.36 in the same time period.",
    "Just a day before publishing the results, HPE announced a $2 billion contract with the US National Security Agency, lasting a decade. It will provide the agency with high-performance computing as a service, using its GreenLake platform.",
    "According to Silicon Angle, Neri said the deal was \u201cmore than just selling infrastructure\u201d.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a true as-a-service model and management where we are operating the whole environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is very different from what it was in the past.\u201d",
    "And while the company keeps its positive outlook, fueled by stabilizing buying patterns after what was a highly volatile year, supply chain shortages continue to be a nuisance and probably won\u2019t go away for as long as a year.",
