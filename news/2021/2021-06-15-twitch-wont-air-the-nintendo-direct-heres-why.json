    "You won\u2019t be able to watch Nintendo\u2019s E3 showcase on Twitch this year after the streaming giant confirmed it won\u2019t be hosting the event.",
    "The decision was made after Nintendo announced that creators wouldn\u2019t be able to co-stream the Nintendo Direct, which takes place today at 5pm BST / 9am PT / 12pm ET (or June 16 at 2am AEST).",
    "In response, Twitch said that even though it had received permission to stream Nintendo\u2019s show, it won\u2019t be airing the event because of the company\u2019s decision.",
    "In a tweet from Twitch\u2019s official account, it said: \u201cNintendo tweeted from their official account that co-streaming today\u2019s event is not allowed, differing from years past. While /twitchgaming has permission to air the show, we won\u2019t be airing the event because all creators can\u2019t co-stream.\u201d",
    "If you want to tune in for Nintendo\u2019s E3 showcase, then, you\u2019ll have to go to YouTube to watch the event in full (we've also added the video above). The show will focus on new and previously announced Nintendo Switch games, so we\u2019re not expecting Nintendo to reveal the widely-rumored Switch Pro."
