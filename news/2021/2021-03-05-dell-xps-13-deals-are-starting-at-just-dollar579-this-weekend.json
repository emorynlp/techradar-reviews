    "Dell XPS laptop deals can offer some truly premium machines without breaking the bank. The XPS is Dell's shining jewel, but suffers from some pretty high price tags on the latest releases. Browsing through older models, however, can yield some excellent value - especially if you're after a high end laptop capable of storming through more demanding workflows.",
    "That's the story this week, as a number of slightly older Dell XPS deals have hit the official Dell storefront just in time for the weekend. At just $579.99, however, this i3 configuration has to be one of the cheapest Dell XPS laptop deals we've ever seen.",
    "You're saving $170 over the original $749.99 sales price on this model, and while it'll serve those looking for a lower performance better, there's some stunning value packed into this premium chassis. That 10th generation i3 processor and 4GB RAM will limit you a little, but an excellent 256GB SSD is sitting particularly pretty at this price point.",
    "However, you can also upgrade to an i7 build for a full $300 off right now. Previously available for $1,049.99, this 10th gen i7 / 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD configuration is on the shelves for an excellent $749.99. That's the perfect price point for anyone looking for a zippy PC for everyday work and the odd high intensity program.",
    "For those who need the power for media editing or more complex workflows, we'd recommend taking a look at this 512GB model, complete with 16GB RAM. There's plenty of power stored away in here, and at just $899.99 (was $1,249) it's not too much of a jump from the 256GB configuration above.",
    "We're rounding up all these Dell XPS laptop deals just below.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for more Dell XPS deals in your region.",
    "These Dell XPS deals are certainly pricey, but you can find plenty more cheap Dell laptops on sale right now as well. Or, if you're not sold on Dell's offerings, check out all the best laptop deals we've found this week. We're also rounding up all the cheapest MacBook sales as well."
