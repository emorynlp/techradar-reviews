    "The votes have been cast, counted, audited and placed in envelopes ready to be announced - it's time for the 93rd Academy Awards. The biggest celebration of cinema in Hollywood has arrived and you're in the right place to discover how to get a 2021 Oscars live stream - including the best FREE options.",
    "For fans of massive movies, glorious gowns and Hollywood brouhaha, events don't come much bigger than Oscar night! And whether you've been systematically working your way through all this year's nominees or just enjoy revelling in tearful speeches, all eyes will be on those little gold men.",
    "Once again, the Academy Awards will rely on award presenters to propel the ceremony forward throughout the night, with the Oscars remaining hostless since 2018. This year the ceremony will predominantly take place outdoors to comply with Covid-19 guidelines, and you can expect to see this year's nominees in the courtyard of Los Angeles' downtown railway station, Union Station.",
    "While this year's ceremony will be a far more intimate affair than previous years, there will still be many of your favorite stars in attendance, including Zendaya, Regina King, Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and others lined-up to present awards to this year's winners.",
    "Be in the front row as the likes of Nomadland, Sound of Metal, Promising Young Woman and five other titles hold their breath for that Best Picture winner announcement. Pop on your party gear and get yourself an Oscars live stream tonight.",
    "Keep scrolling if you want to know your viewing options in the US, Canada, UK, India and Australia (pssssst, it's absolutely FREE Down Under!).",
    "But it's worth noting that if you're away from your country this Oscar night and were hoping to watch your home coverage on your laptop or mobile, it will inevitable be geo-blocked. Annoying but this easily fixed, with a VPN you can change your IP address to a location back in your own hometown or country that will then allow you to stream the event as if you were sat back at home.",
    "We're delighted to say that it's now looking very likely indeed. Yes, it's been pushed back a couple of months from its usual slot on the awards circuit. But, unless something major happens, the 93rd Academy Awards will happen on Sunday, April 25.",
    "The big prize of the night is the Best Picture award - and here are the eight nominees competing for it:",
    "If you want the full Oscar experience, you're better off choosing one of the live stream options above to catch every moment of the 93rd Academy Awards. That said, if you just want to see the highlights, you can head to the official Oscars YouTube channel to get videos hot off the Oscar red carpet.",
    "For those in the US looking to livestream the 2021 Oscars, there are plenty of ways to watch ABC via cord cutting services. You can choose between FuboTV and AT&T TV Now, as well as YouTube TV and Hulu's Hulu + Live TV package.",
    "FuboTV costs $64.99 for its Starter package and comes with a 7-day free trial. Alternatively, get AT&T TV Now for $69.99 a month.",
    "Depending on where you are in the world depends on whether you can secure a free live stream of the 2021 Oscars.",
    "Those are in Australia, benefitting from a completely free way to watch the 93rd Academy Awards through Channel 7 on the TV, or through its app 7Plus on compatible devices.",
    "Sadly, Australia is the only country with a completely free-to-watch option for the Oscars. That said, there are other options for those elsewhere looking to avoid dropping a penny. In the UK, new customers can get a 7-day free trial for the Now Entertainment pass.",
    "Alternatively, in the US FuboTV also comes with a 7-day free trial. With both, you can be fairly calculated, timing your the start of your subscription just right to encompass the Oscars and cancel before you're charged within the 7-day free trial period.",
    "Not going to be in the country when the Oscars is taking place? Get a VPN and you can watch your native broadcaster with ease."
