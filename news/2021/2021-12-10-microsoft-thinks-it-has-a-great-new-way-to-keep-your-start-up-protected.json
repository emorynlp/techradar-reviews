    "Now officially in preview, interested businesses can sign up now to be one of the first to get Microsoft Defender for Business, ensuring they stay protected from all the latest threats.",
    "First announced at Microsoft Ignite 2021 back in November 2021, Defender for Business will launch with an initial set of scenarios, Microsoft's Jon Maunder announced in a blog post announcing the news.",
    "\"As an endpoint security solution, Defender for Business is more than just traditional anti-virus,\" he noted. \"It delivers next-generation protection, endpoint detection and response, threat and vulnerability management, and more. It offers simplified configuration and management with intelligent, automated investigation and remediation. Defender for Business helps you to protect against cybersecurity threats including malware and ransomware across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.\"",

    "Businesses will need to be activated within an existing Microsoft 365 Business Premium tenant, or as standalone with the appropriate testing prerequisites in place for mobile scenarios.

    "Once the tool is available, customers will be able to buy it as a standalone offering costing $3 per user per month. It will also be included as part of Microsoft 365 Business Premium accounts and can be integrated with Microsoft 365 Lighthouse."
