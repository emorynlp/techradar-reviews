    "A match-up that rarely disappoints, Ireland host the All Blacks in Dublin today for what should be an unmissable Autumn International rugby union clash. Read on as our guide explains how to get an Ireland vs New Zealand live stream and watch the huge rugby autumn international online - including how to watch the game absolutely FREE.",
    "For the Irish, a 60-5 thrashing of Japan last week was a nice way to warm up both the playing personnel and the Aviva for this heavyweight encounter, and they need no reminders of their historically lean record against the All Blacks.",
    "However, two wins from four makes for rather better reading than two from 32, and the Men in Green Ireland, will be desperate to prove those weren't flukes.",
    "It's not often that a team gets slammed for only winning 47-9, but that's the position the All Blacks are in after an underwhelming showing last weekend. Ian Foster's second string side made a meal of Italy, but the big guns will be back for this one. Their line will be led by the one and only Beauden Barrett, who's been full of praise for fellow centurion fly-half Johnny Sexton ahead of what might turn out to be their final battle in the trenches.",
    "It's a game of the highest order, so follow our guide as we explain all the ways to get a rugby live stream and how to watch Ireland vs New Zealand for FREE.",
    "If you're abroad right now and try to stream the rugby via your native broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to watch rugby from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Ireland or the UK, just head to RTE Player or Channel 4's All4 service"
