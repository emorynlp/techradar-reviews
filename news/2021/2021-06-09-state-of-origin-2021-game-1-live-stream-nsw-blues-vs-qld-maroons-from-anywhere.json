    "It\u2019s Origin time! Kick-off for this year\u2019s State of Origin series opener is not far off and we\u2019ll soon find out if the NSW Blues are as good on the field as they look on paper.",
    "Game 1 of the 2021 State of Origin series is tonight at 8:10pm AEST in Townsville, Australia, and if you want to watch the game\u2019s biggest rivalry, here\u2019s how you can get a live stream of the first match no matter where you are.",
    "Following Melbourne\u2019s recent Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, Origin\u2019s Game 1 has been moved to much-less neutral territory in Townsville, Queensland \u2013 giving the Maroons the home-team advantage.",
    "Despite this setback, the NSW Blues are looking strong. The team is stacked with players from the Penrith Panthers, who have dominated the NRL series this year. Panthers making their Origin debut in the series opener include Brian To\u2019o, Jarome Luai and Liam Martin.",
    "Blues coach Brad Fittler will be looking to make the most out of these players\u2019 familiarity with each other\u2019s style of play. They\u2019ll also be joined by their Panthers teammate Nathan Cleary on the field.",
    "The NSW Blues have certainly got star power in their Origin lineup, including Latrell Mitchell, Josh Addo-Carr and James Tedesco. Queensland\u2019s coach, Paul Green, conceded that the Maroons have had disrupted preparation, and the Blues were, \u201con paper, a better team\u201d.",
    "But as we know, Origin is a different kind of beast and anything can happen. Queensland won last year\u2019s State of Origin series in what was a huge upset for the NSW side, who were again the more experienced squad in 2020, though it never paid off.",
    "Tonight, the NSW Blues will be looking to turn their fortunes around, while Queensland will be hoping to put on a powerful performance for the home crowd, despite being plagued by injuries during preparation.",
    "Want to see the series opener? Here\u2019s how to watch State of Origin Game 1 live no matter where you are.",
    "All three State of Origin games will be shown live and free on Channel 9 in Australia. You can watch Game 1 tonight, Wednesday, June 9 at 8:10pm AEST. You can also live stream the game from Channel 9\u2019s streaming platform, 9Now.",
    "It will also be aired on a delayed broadcast on Fox Sports and streaming service Kayo after the game is over.",
    "Fans living outside Australia, New Zealand or the Pacific Islands can catch the State of Origin online with the Watch NRL streaming service.",
    "Watch NRL requires a subscription and has three different plans to choose from:",
    "Weekly: US$17 / \u00a313 / \u20ac17 / AU$20 Monthly: US$33 / \u00a325 / \u20ac33 / AU$39 Annual: US$165 / \u00a3130 / \u20ac155 / AU$199",
    "If you\u2019re an Aussie that wants to catch that free Channel 9 coverage but are currently abroad, then you\u2019ll discover that the access is geo-blocked. It\u2019s annoying, but not unsurpassable, as you could try using a VPN to set the IP address of your laptop, phone or streaming device back to one in Australia and watch as if you were in the country.",
