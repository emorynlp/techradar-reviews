    "Windows 11 is already getting some useful third-party apps \u2013 including one that ditches the new Start menu \u2013 and another fresh piece of software now promises to optimize the operating system, remove bloatware, and more.",
    "This (unofficial) suite of tools is called ThisIsWin11 and it offers a convenient way in which to fine-tune the OS right off the bat, even for those unfamiliar with Windows 11. In fact, for the uninitiated the app comes complete with an introduction to the new OS, taking you through optimizing the system step-by-step.",
    "That includes giving you an overview of pre-installed apps and letting you easily remove any you don\u2019t want, and then configuring various settings \u2013 like enabling Dark Mode, or disabling new features like snap assist \u2013 with a minimum of fuss.",
    "There are also set profiles, including a gaming one which \u201cadjust[s] some Windows 11 settings for a better gaming experience\u201d according to the dev, and a Windows 10 profile that applies settings to left-align the Start menu, and disable various Windows 11 features like widgets. Essentially, it allows those who hanker for Windows 10 to go back to a more familiar interface.",
    "All these options are certainly useful, and there\u2019s a whole lot of functionality packed into ThisIsWin11 by all accounts. The developer has previously built apps for Windows 10, including one to remove bloatware (Bloatbox).",
    "It\u2019s pretty handy to have a freebie app that facilitates the configuration of Windows 11 settings by the bucketful in one simple process, and more besides.",
    "However, obviously be careful around unofficial third-party software which is still in the early stages of development. While the developer says the app has left \u2018preview status\u2019 and is obviously now released, it\u2019s only a couple of weeks old, and still on version 0.70.",
    "Given that it\u2019s still an early version, and Windows 11 itself is in beta, who knows if you might encounter some nasty glitches when this app is doing its configuration thing (or there\u2019s also the prospect that optimization measures may not perform as expected). It goes without saying that you almost certainly won\u2019t be using a Windows 11 testbed system for your daily work (or serious use) anyway, but be prepared for the possibility of things going awry at any rate.",
    "In short, this looks to be a useful \u2013 if rough around the edges at this point \u2013 tool, but it\u2019s still early days for ThisIsWin11, and we\u2019d temper any expectations with that in mind.",
