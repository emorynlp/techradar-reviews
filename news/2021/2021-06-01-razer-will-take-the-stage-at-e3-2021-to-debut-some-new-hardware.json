    "Razer says it will join Microsoft, Bethesda and Ubisoft with an E3 2021 keynote of its own this year that\u2019s set to take place on Monday, June 14 at 3pm PDT / 6pm EST / 11 pm BST.",
    "At the virtual event we\u2019ll see Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan on-stage unveiling what he says will be \u201ccutting-edge innovation and hardware that will support the best that PC gaming has to offer\u201d which, we assume will include the usual mix of mice, keyboards, headphones and laptops.",
    "Razer says this will all happen in \u201can all-new extended reality format\u201d that combines a livestream and virtual space into a more immersive experience than a traditional livestream.",
    "Why E3? A few years back, Razer used E3 to launch an updated version of the Razer Blade Stealth as well as the Razer Mamba back in 2015, so it\u2019s no stranger to the one of the world\u2019s largest video game conferences.",
    "That said, this is the first time Razer\u2019s holding its own keynote at E3 \u2013 taking place a few hours after Microsoft and Bethesda\u2019s joint showcase that\u2019s being held early Monday morning \u2013 so it's a big step forward for the company and a way to get out in front of the audience it cares most about.",
    "For PC gamers, Razer\u2019s event will certainly be worth watching. It\u2019s a chance to see what the company is up to first-hand through the virtual exhibit, and is likely to provide some good information on Razer's next mice, keyboards and headphones.",
    "Of course, it's just one of many events targeting the PC gaming crowd this year. Together with the PC Gaming Show from TechRadar\u2019s sister site PC Gamer and the Steam Next Fest that\u2019s happening between June 16 and June 22, there\u2019s going to be lots of good stuff at E3 for folks who prefer a mouse and keyboard over a controller.",
    "While there's unlikely to be any games unveiled at Razer's event, there is a chance the hardware maker could be talking about some of the other new games announced at the show and show them running on Razer laptops.",
    "It could also just be 60 minutes of Razer talking about mice and keyboards \u2013 so, you know, temper your expectations.",
    "We\u2019ll be watching along as well and will be covering the entire show as it happens, so stay tuned here on TechRadar as we approach the start of E3 2021."
