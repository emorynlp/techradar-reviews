    "Would you spend hundreds on a high-tech VR headset just to restore your hacked Facebook account?",
    "That\u2019s a method some Facebook users are resorting to, after becoming frustrated by the social media platform\u2019s seemingly unresponsive complaints system and attempting to gain access to their locked accounts by other means \u2013 namely, by buying an Oculus Quest VR headset.",
    "The news comes from NPR, which spoke to a man with a hacked Facebook account unable to reach customer service via the company\u2019s standard complaints channels. Brandon Sherman, of California, then purchased an Oculus Quest 2 headset \u2013 which costs in the region of $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$479 \u2013 quoted its serial number, and \u201cheard back right away.\u201d",
    "That\u2019s because the Facebook-owned VR company has its own customer support system, but one which ultimately remains tied to the larger Facebook infrastructure. After contacting Facebook customer service via Oculus Support, Sherman was able to restore his locked social media account.",
    "He plans to return the unopened Quest 2 device, NPR says, but the loophole \u2013 which surfaced on a Reddit forum \u2013 doesn\u2019t seem to have worked for everyone, so that\u2019s worth bearing in mind before you, too, shell out big money for the sake of a dastardly Facebook hacker.",
    "The fact that some Facebook users are forced to take such desperate \u2013 and expensive \u2013 measures speaks to the inadequacy of the platform's automated complaints procedure, and reflects similarly-impersonal assistance systems in place within other large corporations.",
    "At present, should Facebook users wish to regain access to a locked account, they\u2019re asked to upload a copy of their driver's license or passport to prove their identity. But after doing so multiple times, \u201cnobody got back\u201d to Sherman and multiple other NPR interviewees.",
    "What\u2019s more, Facebook doesn\u2019t offer phone support, so users seeking help with issues like hacked accounts are left with few options.",
    "On its own support site, Facebook claims the Covid-19 pandemic has played a part in its poor response rate of late. \u201cWe have fewer people available to review IDs because of the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d it says, adding that those reviews \u201cmay take longer than usual\u201d as a result.",
    "But that\u2019s not the only issue at play here. Why are so many people in need of Facebook support in the first place, and why are there so many hackers?",
    "Though Facebook doesn\u2019t publish figures on the issue, it\u2019s thought that hackers have increased in the years following recent US elections and the global pandemic, with individuals attempting to steal Facebook accounts to spread disinformation.",
    "How the company deals with the growing issue remains to be seen, but it\u2019s clear that Facebook\u2019s current complaints procedure isn\u2019t fit for purpose \u2013 even if we are big fans of the Oculus Quest 2.",
