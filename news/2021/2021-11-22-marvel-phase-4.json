  "article": [
    "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is getting ready to become the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse. (MCM). We've already seen the multiverse's effects on the MCU through projects including What If...? and Loki.",
    "But, with Spider-Man: No Way Home set to introduce it fully when the movie arrives in December, things will never be the same again for Marvel's live-action universe \u2013 or viewers, for that matter. When No Way Home does arrive, we'll have another film to add to our 'how to watch the Marvel movies in order' article.",
    "There's plenty to look forward to in 2022 and beyond, too. Marvel is showing no signs of slowing production down on its multiple TV shows and movies, and it recently announced a slew of new projects that will arriving post-2023, too. Those reveals were delivered as part of Disney Plus Day, and you can learn more about them below.",
    "If you're after a full rundown of to Marvel\u2019s Phase 4 schedule, we're here to help. Below, you'll find more information on every forthcoming MCU movie and TV show, including any recently changed release dates, multiversal crossovers, cast additions and more.",
    "Many of Marvel\u2019s forthcoming productions have official launch dates, though some key releases are ambiguous for now.",
    "Below, you\u2019ll find a list of confirmed launch dates for 2021's remaining releases, the changed release dates for 2022's projects and tentative launch windows for future films and TV series.",
    "Release date: December 17, 2021",
    "Is there a more highly anticipated Marvel movie than Spider-Man: No Way Home? The release of the threequel\u2019s first trailer almost broke the internet in late August, and the hype hasn\u2019t died down amid the potential returns of previous Spider-Man actors and their series' villains.",
    "Picking up sometime after the second MCU Spider-Man flick, No Way Home will see Peter Parker (Tom Holland) seek the help of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to restore his secret identity. That\u2019s after Mysterio revealed who he was in Far From Home\u2019s post-credits scene.",
    "Things don\u2019t go to plan, however, and the duo help to bring about the multiverse\u2019s arrival. Alfred Molina\u2019s Doc-Ock, Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro and Willem Dafoe\u2019s Green Goblin, among other rumored villains, are all expected (or likely) to reprise their roles. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are also believed to be returning as their Spider-Man iterations, too, while Charlie Cox\u2019s Matt Murdock \u2013 last seen in his Netflix Daredevil series \u2013 might cameo. That's a lot of unknowns about one movie.",
    "Suffice to say, we\u2019ll be strapping ourselves in for a mind bending, action-packed and potentially emotional ending to the MCU\u2019s Spider-Man trilogy.",
    "Release date: May 8, 2022",
    "Speaking of the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange 2 arrives in theaters five months after No Way Home. It\u2019s likely to provide us with a clearer look at, as well as a better understanding of, the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse (MCM).",
    "Cumberbatch will reprise his role as Stephen Strange, and he\u2019ll be joined by Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s Scarlet Witch, Benedict Wong\u2019s Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor\u2019s Baron Mordo and Rachel McAdams\u2019 Christine Palmer from the first movie. Newcomer Xochitl Gomez will also portray America Chavez, a relative newcomer to Marvel comics' superhero line-up.",
    "Little is known about Doctor Strange 2\u2019s plot, save for a brief synopsis (per Backstage.com), which suggests we\u2019re in for a mind-boggling, horror-style superhero flick that\u2019ll reshape everything we thought we knew about the mainline live-action universe. All signs, then, point towards a shake-up in how the MCU and its inhabitants operate.",
    "The film is currently undergoing six weeks of intense reshoots, which is why its release date was recently pushed back. It's unclear how much of this is due to additional pick-ups so the movie flows better during the editing process, or whether some last-minute plot revisions have been made.",
    "Release date: July 8, 2022",
    "The only Avenger to receive a fourth solo movie (so far, anyway), Thor\u2019s MCU arc will continue in July 2022. Thor: Love and Thunder will be a mini-Avengers movie of sorts. It also stars the Guardians of the Galaxy, Tessa Thompson\u2019s Valkyrie and sees Natalie Portman\u2019s Jane Foster return as alter-go Mighty Thor.",
    "Like Doctor Strange 2, we don\u2019t know much about its plot. According to director Taika Waititi, it\u2019ll draw inspiration from Jason Aaron\u2019s Mighty Thor comic series, which sees Foster gain superpowers similar to Thor while undergoing cancer treatment. We also know that Christian Bale (The Dark Knight, Vice) will portray Gorr the God Butcher, the movie\u2019s antagonist, while Waititi calls Thor 4 the \u201ccraziest film [he\u2019s] ever done\u201d. Fingers crossed that\u2019s genuine and not hyperbole.",
    "Release date: November 11, 2022",
    "Perhaps the most poignant Marvel film currently in production, and with good reason. Black Panther\u2019s MCU journey will continue without the iconic Chadwick Boseman, who passed away in August 2020 after a four-year battle with cancer.",
    "With Marvel Studios choosing not to recast T\u2019Challa in honor of Boseman\u2019s portrayal, Wakanda Forever\u2019s plot has since been reshaped five times by director Ryan Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole. Filming is currently underway, so it seems that the duo have found a way to preserve Boseman\u2019s legacy while moving Black Panther\u2019s story forward.",
    "So what do we know so far? Lupita Nyongo\u2019s Nakia, Letitia Wright\u2019s Shuri, Angela Bassett\u2019s Ramonda and Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye are all returning from the first film. Martin Freeman and Winston Duke, too, are back as Everett Ross and M\u2019Baku respectively. I May Destroy You\u2019s Michaela Coel has also been cast in an undisclosed role.",
    "Finally, Wakanda Forever will introduce a live-action version of Ironheart, aka Riri Williams, a genius inventor and MIT student who creates her own Iron Man-style armor suit. Expect Tony Stark\u2019s MCU successor to play a big role in proceedings, then, as well as one of the established cast assuming the mantle of Black Panther at some point.",
    "Filming is currently on hold after Letitia Wright suffered numerous injuries on set, but is expected to start up again in the New Year.",
    "Release date: early 2023",
    "While technically a Captain Marvel sequel, this Nia DaCosta-directed Phase 4 film will see a trio of female superheroes team up on the big screen for the first time.",
    "Brie Larson\u2019s Carol Danvers will reunite with Teyonah Parris\u2019 Monica Rambeau, the daughter of Danvers\u2019 best friend Maria (Lashana Lynch) from the first movie. The last time we saw Rambeau, she had acquired her own superpowers in WandaVision, so expect an awkward family-style reunion between the pair.",
    "Elsewhere, Iman Vellani\u2019s Ms. Marvel will also make her live-action movie debut. Vellani\u2019s Kamala Khan will star in her own Disney Plus show first, which is apparently slated to release in early 2022. So we\u2019ll be introduced to her before her appearance in The Marvels.",
    "Zawe Ashton (Velvet Buzzsaw) has been cast as the movie\u2019s villain, with filming currently taking place in the UK after stints in Los Angeles and New Jersey. After Marvel moved its release schedule around, though, The Marvels doesn't have an official release date anymore.",
    "Release date: May 5, 2023",
    "One of three movies that are now set to arrive in 2023, Guardians 3 will bring the curtain down on the trilogy that James Gunn has helmed since 2014.",
    "Guardians 3 will be set after Thor: Love and Thunder and the Guardians\u2019 forthcoming Disney Plus Holiday special. But, outside of some potential line-up changes \u2013 David Bautista won\u2019t return as Drax after Guardians 3, while Gunn has teased some major character deaths in the threequel \u2013 we don\u2019t know much about this flick.",
    "Filming began in November 2021 and is expected to end in April 2022, so some things may leak out during this period. Thankfully, Guardians 3's release date wasn't moved as part of Marvel's schedule restructuring, so it's still slated to arrive in May 2023.",
    "Release date: July 28, 2023",
    "Another production that\u2019s shooting in the UK right now, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania could properly introduce us to the MCU\u2019s next big bad after Thanos in the Infinity Saga.",
    "Again, little is known about this film\u2019s plot, but we do know that its antagonist will be none other than Kang the Conqueror. The time traveling genius will be played by Jonathan Majors, who portrayed one of Kang\u2019s time variants \u2013 He Who Remains \u2013 in Loki season 1. And his official arrival could have huge repercussions for the MCU moving forward.",
    "Majors\u2019 Kang aside, Ant-Man 3 will also see the return of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathryn Newton as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, Hope van Dyne/Wasp, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne and Cassie Lang. Peyton Reed, who directed the first two Ant-Man flicks, also returns in the hot seat and has hinted that the Quantum Realm will play a big role in proceedings.",
    "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will now arrive after Guardians 3, too. It's unclear if this is due to scheduling issues or if the latter's plot will tie into this somehow. Either way, watch this space.",
    "Release date: TBA",
    "This Phase 4 movie is a biggie. That\u2019s right, a Fantastic Four MCU film is on the way, but there\u2019s very little in the way of information surrounding it at the moment. And that includes when it'll be released.",
    "Jon Watts, who has directed all three Spider-Man MCU films, will take charge of its production. There are no other official announcements outside of Watts\u2019 hiring but, hopefully, that\u2019ll change once he\u2019s finished conducting press for Spider-Man: No Way Home later this year.",
    "Release date: TBA",
    "Currently, we don't know much about Blade's MCU movie. It'll star Mahershala Ali as the titular vampire hunter, will be directed by Bassam Tariq (Mogul Mowgli) and is being written by Stacy Osei-Kuffour (Watchmen, Hunters). Delroy Lindo (Da 5 Bloods, The Harder They Fall) was also recently added to its cast.",
    "That aside, though, there's no word on when filming will begin and when the movie will be released. Hopefully, it won't be much longer before Marvel reveals more details about its Blade flick.",
    "Release date: Summer 2022 (July to September)",
    "Originally expected in 2021 but now set to land in summer 2022 (that's between July and September in Disney's fiscal year), Ms. Marvel introduces Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) to the MCU \u2013 its first Muslim superhero, and also the breakout star of the Marvel's Avengers game released last year.",
    "She's a breath of fresh air as superhero characters go, with a Spider-Man-like origin story that makes her feel very complete from the off. As mentioned, this show will tie in to The Marvels, with Vellani reprising her role in that movie.",
    "Filming concluded in May 2021 but, save for some brief snippets at Disney's Investor Day in December 2020 and during the recent Disney Plus Day reveals, we haven't seen anything of the series. Fingers crossed we get a trailer soon.",
    "Release date: 2022 (expected)",
    "Moon Knight is about Marc Spector, a superhero dealing with dissociative identity disorder. The big news here is that Marvel has landed superstar Oscar Isaac for the role, with Ethan Hawke playing the show's villain. Expect Isaac to inhabit multiple versions of his character, and expect Egyptian iconography to play a big part in the show's visual direction.",
    "Production wrapped on Moon Knight's TV show in mid-October, and we were finally given our first glimpse of the series during November's Disney Plus Day celebrations. It looks like Moon Knight could be a more mature, violent offering from Marvel, which we expect to see arrive in 2022.",
    "According to Kevin Feige, the character will appear in future MCU films, too. We're waiting to hear more on this front, however.",
    "Release date: 2022 (expected)",
    "She-Hulk should bring a different flavor to the MCU. Tatiana Maslany plays Bruce Banner's cousin, Jennifer Walters, in what's been described as a half-hour legal comedy, similar in vein to the Dan Slott comic from the mid-2000s that drew a lot of acclaim.",
    "Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk will turn up in this new series, too, along with Tim Roth's Abomination. Don't be surprised if more deep cut MCU characters arrive to be put on trial, based on how the comic went down. Jameela Jamil will also play the show's villain Titania who, like Abomination, is a perfect match up for Walters' She-Hulk.",
    "Like Moon Knight, we received our first look at the show during the Disney Plus Day announcements. And, hopefully, we'll see more soon.",
    "Release date: 2022 (expected)",
    "This show could be huge. Secret Invasion will focus on the Skrulls, as seen in Captain Marvel, with Ben Mendelsohn's Talos and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury being the show's leads. Kingsley Ben-Adir, Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke are all part of the cast too, according to reports, and we expect this to mark the next Avengers-level event in the MCU.",
    "\"It's about a sect of Skrulls who have infiltrated every level of life on Earth,\" Kevin Feige said about the series back in December 2020. According to Jackson, filming has begun and, during Disney Plus Day, we were treated to a brief shot of a grizzled-looking Fury, complete with grey beard and no eye patch. Excited for this one, we are.",
    "Release date: December 2022",
    "Expected to be under 40 minutes long, this special will likely evoke the notoriously bad Star Wars Holiday Special from 1978, of which writer and director James Gunn is a fan. The main Guardians cast will feature, and it sounds like it's going to be canon \u2013 it's set before the third Guardians movie and after Thor: Love and Thunder.",
    "Filming is taking place alongside Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, so we can expect principal photography to begin soon. If it does, the Guardians' Holiday Special should arrive in time for December 2022.",
    "None of these projects have release dates yet, but they're all confirmed to be in the works:",
    "Its release date is yet to be announced, but an Ironheart Disney Plus series is on the way. The six-episode TV show will be written by Chinaka Hodge (Snowpiercer) and will star Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams, who will make her live-action debut in Black Panther 2. No other details are currently available about the show.",
    "Don Cheadle\u2019s James Rhodes/War Machine will appear in his own Disney Plus show in the future, too. Based on the comic series of the same name, filming is expected to begin in 2022 and will explore the aftermath of Tony Stark\u2019s death in Avengers: Endgame in some capacity. Girls screenwriter Yassir Lester is on board to pen the scripts.",
    "Announced in February 2021, a Wakanda spinoff show \u2013 developed by Black Panther writer-director Ryan Coogler \u2013 is also in the works. Danai Gurira has signed a deal to reprise her role as Okoye in the unnamed TV series, but it\u2019s unclear if other Black Panther stars will feature, too.",
    "What If\u2026? season 2 is already being developed at Marvel Studios. According to head writer A.C. Bradley and director Bryan Andrew, one episode is ready to go (a Gamora-centric episode that didn\u2019t make it into season 1), some are nearing completion and others require more work.",
    "Regardless, don\u2019t expect the next instalment in Marvel\u2019s animated anthology series to arrive before mid to late 2022.",
    "Lastly, Loki season 2 is in development for Disney Plus. The trickster god\u2019s return was teased during the season 1 finale, but there\u2019s no word on whether it\u2019ll be filmed before other Disney Plus shows or not.",
    "Tom Hiddleston is almost certain to reprise his role as the god of mischief. Owen Wilson, Wunmi Mosaku, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Sophia Di Martino could also return, while season 1 head writer Michael Waldron has signed on to write season 2\u2019s screenplays.",
    "Announced in December 2020, I Am Groot will follow the fan favorite Guardians of the Galaxy character as he grows from the sapling we saw in Guardians 2 into the teenage character we see in Avengers: Infinity Way and Endgame.",
    "The show will consist of a series of shorts as he explores the galaxy alongside new and unusual characters. As you'd expect, Groot will get himself into some challenging situations, so we can expect a few laughs and thrills along the way.",
    "Featuring a photorealistic animation style, I Am Groot began production in August 2021. It's being directed by Kirsten Lepore, whose previous work includes Adventure Time and Summer Camp Island. The series will be part of Marvel's Phase 4 slate, but there's no launch date to speak of yet.",
    "As we mentioned in our intro, Marvel announced a spate of new Disney Plus shows that are set to enter production in the future. There's no word on when they will do so, or even a sniff of when they'll be released.",
    "Still, it's good (if a tad daunting) to see so many new Marvel shows on the way. You can see what else is coming up in the MCU in the future below:"
