  "article": [
    "Update for Saturday: We're scouting out PS5 restock date news at Best Buy, Target, GameStop and Walmart ahead of the new week.",
    "Friday updaye: The Best Buy PS5 restock time was later than any time in 2021, happening after 5pm EDT yesterday, according to our 24/7 PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider, who will send you an alert when the Sony console is in stock \u2013 if you follow his account and turn on notifications.",
    "Trust and credibility: Matt Swider has helped over 50,000 people buy a next-gen console in recent weeks. How? With his tireless 24/7 tracking, in-stock Twitter alerts and exclusive restock reporting.",
    "Click on this example of the Best Buy PS5 restock today to follow Matt Swider and turn on notifications (the little bell icon).",
    "Matt also issued a guide on how to order the PS5 on Best Buy before it sold out. Knowing which to go for \u2013 $499 PS5 Disc or $399 PS5 Digital \u2013 is essential before you try to purchase the Sony console.",
    "The Best Buy PS5 restock time was so late in the day that we didn't think it was going to happen. This is because Best Buy didn't have inventory in all of its warehouses for much of June 24, according to our exclusive sources. At the least second, the restock, already delayed from Monday, actually took place.",
    "Best Buy wasn't alone. There was a Costco PS5 restock that was members-only. Often Walmart has a console restock on Thursdays, though we had our doubts based on our sources (Walmart had a big PS5 restock last week, too).",
    "The PS5 restock at Costo today finally happened, although it was a region-limited bundle (meaning it may not have been in your zip code) and for Costco members only. That type of restock is instantly met with 'who's next' replies \u2013 'when is Best Buy' \u2013 on the Twitter account of PS5 restock tracker Matt Swider.",
    "The good news is that Best Buy did have a restock at the very end of the day \u2013 just after 5pm EDT, with Matt Swider sending an instant alert on Twitter. Both the PS5 Disc and PS5 Digital Edition consoles were in stock.",
    "This Best Buy PS5 restock was overdue: it was supposed to have it on Monday (likely originally meant to compete with Prime Day 2021 deals) but that had to be rearranged, as we're told some Best Buy warehouses have struggled to get inventory in this week. Again, this is why the Thursday restock was so late.",
    "Our sources at some key warehouses had zero consoles, while Best Buy warehouse contacts did have enough consistent with a drop. Best Buy usually waits until stores nationwide can be sent the PS5 restock from the warehouses to stores for customer pick-up (after the purchase is secured online).",
    "Walmart just had a restock for PS5 Digital Edition last Thursday, and it sold so many PS5 consoles it ran out of inventory and had to promise many buyers a free upgrade to PS5 Disc \u2013 without paying customers paying the $100 premium. It wouldn't do that if it had ample inventory for this week.",
    "Last week was a very good week for PS5 restock news. We saw the Sony console at Walmart, Sam's Club, Target and Antonline in the span of four days. This week is a different story \u2013 we had the long-awaited Amazon PS5 restock, but little else.",
    "Here's where we saw consoles yesterday, June 23.",
    "Technically, Sony Direct restock had a restock on June 23 but the virtual queue was for people with a special (randomly sent) email invite. It never opened up the virtual queue to everyone else at 5pm EDT yesterday, although we did live stream a PS5 restock Q&A off the back of the virtual queue not happening.",
    "There was a GameStop Xbox Series X restock, and three additional places had the console \u2013 all yesterday. So PS5 restock events have been lagging behind this week \u2013 with the exception of that Amazon PS5 restock. Newegg did have a PS5 Digital bundle in stock this week alongside the Newegg Shuffle GPU restock, but that was also a lottery system, and a much smaller one.",
    "Stat tuned for more PS5 restock news, as we continue to send out alerts whenever stores in the US get inventory, or our sources tell us that there's going to be the $499 PS5 Disc or $399 PS5 Digital in stock nationwide."
