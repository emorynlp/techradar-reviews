    "Pursuing a dedicated open source industrial policy will help the EU accelerate the digital transformation of European industry, suggests a new report published by the European Commission.",
    "The study was conducted by Fraunhofer ISI and OpenForum Europe (OFE), to investigate the economic impact of open source software (OSS) and hardware on the EU\u2019s economy.",
    "It estimates that OSS already contributes between \u20ac65 to \u20ac95 billion to the EU\u2019s GDP, which according to the OFE is the equivalent of both air and water transport combined.",
    "\u201cOpen source offers a greenfield advantage for policymakers and Europe has the chance to lead,\u201d noted Sachiko Muto, the OFE\u2019s CEO.",
    "The report notes that EU governments and companies have already invested over \u20ac1 billion in open source development in 2018 alone, even as it identifies the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of OSS in important fields such as cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI), among others.",
    "The report goes on to offer certain recommendations to enable OSS to help digitise the European industry. One of the suggestions involves setting up a European network of governmental units dedicated to accelerating the use of open technologies.",
    "The report also suggests using the Horizon Europe program with a total budget of \u20ac95.5 billion for 2021-2027 to infuse capital into \u201copen source support mechanisms and projects.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe data predicts that if open source contributions increased by 10% in the EU, they would generate an additional 0.4% to 0.6% (around \u20ac100 billion) to the bloc\u2019s GDP,\u201d notes OFE, which hopes the study equips policymakers with all the evidence they need to promote open source for the benefit of the EU."
