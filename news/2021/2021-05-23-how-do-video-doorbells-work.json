    "Are you constantly missing deliveries because you\u2019re out? Or maybe you\u2019re fed up of being caught out by cold callers, and want a way of checking who\u2019s at the door before you open it? You\u2019ve probably heard that the best video doorbells are a handy solution, letting you converse with anyone on your doorstep from your smartphone.",
    "However, if you\u2019re not entirely sure how these handy smart home gadgets actually work, we\u2019ll explain exactly how video doorbells work, where they store the video they record and how they can be integrated with the best smart home devices to automate your home.",
    "Want to get your hands on a video doorbell now? Check out these great deals for some of the best on the market, although we might some big deals also appear whenever Prime Day 2021 rolls around:",
    "As well as letting you see and speak to whoever\u2019s on your threshold if the doorbell is pressed (thanks to a built-in camera, microphone and speaker) smart doorbells will also act in the same way as the best home security cameras.",
    "They\u2019ll alert you if motion is detected in its field of view, so you\u2019ll know if there\u2019s any unwanted visitors to your property. They\u2019ll even store the footage so you can go back and review it at a later date, providing peace of mind that your home is safe if you\u2019re away for a few days or weeks.",
    "Video doorbells have surged in popularity over the past four years, with one in four homes in the US owning one, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, and it\u2019s not surprising as they really do make life a little easier.",
    "Some are battery powered and can be installed with very little DIY expertise, such as the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus, while others, like the Arlo Video Doorbell are designed to replace an existing wired doorbell, and may require professional installation.",
    "Some video doorbells even use artificial intelligence (AI )to identify whether it\u2019s a person, animal or vehicle they\u2019ve detected to prevent you getting notified every time a bush mildly wobbles in the wind.",
    "It\u2019s worth keeping in mind though, that most video doorbells require a monthly subscription to get the most out of them. This enables you to review footage after it\u2019s happened, as well as access the smart features and functions designed to reduce unwanted alerts such as setting activity zones so you\u2019re only alerted about motion in these areas of the camera\u2019s field of view.",
    "Video doorbells work in the same way as the best home security cameras; by using Wi-Fi to send a notification to your phone whenever motion is detected in the doorbell\u2019s field of view, or the doorbell itself is pressed.",
    "If you receive a notification, or you just want to see what\u2019s happening at your home, you can use the companion app on your smartphone or table (or get a dedicated smart display) to log in to the doorbell\u2019s camera and see who\u2019s on your doorstep.",
    "The doorbell\u2019s built-in speaker and microphone allow you to converse with anyone in the camera\u2019s field of view too.",
    "Video doorbells also store the footage recorded when motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed so it can be reviewed back at a later date. This is handy if you couldn\u2019t answer the alert at the time it arrived, but want to see who the caller was.",
    "However, as we\u2019ve already mentioned for many video doorbells, this does require a monthly subscription, which starts from $2.99 / \u00a32.49 / AU$4.49 .",
    "The Eufy Video Doorbell 2K is one of the few smart doorbells that doesn\u2019t need a subscription, instead up to 16GB of video - around two week\u2019s worth - can be stored on the bundled base station, so there\u2019s no on-going cost.",
    "Unwanted notifications about motion that turn about to be birds, the wind rustling through trees or pedestrians on the pavement can be frustrating, so many video doorbells also offer handy features to reduce these nuisance alerts; for example activity zones so you\u2019re only alerted when motion is detected in these areas and AI that can identify whether an animal, vehicle or person caused the alert too.",
    "Most video doorbells also offer integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or HomeKit, so they can be set to work with your smart speakers and smart displays; making a sound when the doorbell is pressed and letting you converse with whoever is on your doorstep.",
    "In the case of smart displays, they can be used to view the doorbell\u2019s feed too. Not all video doorbells work with all voice assistants, however, so make sure you check it will work with your current kit before you buy.",
    "The video doorbell market is a crowded one with big names in home security including Ring, and Arlo competing alongside the likes of Google and Eufy. Some brands even offer a choice of models to choose from. We\u2019ve rounded up out pick from each of the big hitters to help you choose.",
    "Like any item on the exterior of your property, there is a small possibility it could be stolen. Most video doorbells require screwing to the exterior of your property, so it certainly won\u2019t be an easy task for them to be removed, but it could happen.",
    "Ring video doorbells come with a security screw, which can only be removed by a unique type of screwdriver (included in the box) that can deter thieves. Ring also promises to replace any of its video doorbells that are stolen providing you contact them within 30 days of theft and provide the police report."
