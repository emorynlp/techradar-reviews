    "Intel may have accidently revealed the Windows 11 release date, with its latest drivers referencing \u201cWindows 11-64 \u2013 October 2021 Update \u2013 version 21H2\u201d.",
    "This gives extra weight to the rumors that Windows 11 will be releasing in October 2021. So far, Microsoft hasn\u2019t officially revealed the Windows 11 release date, instead simply stating that it is \u201cdue out later in 2021 and will be delivered over several months\u201d.",
    "However, this latest leak, which is found in the release notes published by Intel alongside its latest GPU driver, makes a clear reference to October 2021.",
    "In the past, Microsoft has named its major Windows 10 updates after the month in which they are going to be released (which has caused issues in the past when there have been delays), and the release notes make reference to existing Windows 10 updates as well, such as the May 2021 Update (21H1).",
    "The \u201821H2\u2019 part of the update name in relation to Windows 11 suggests, as with other Windows updates, that it will release in the second half of 2021.",
    "There will also be a Windows 10 21H2 update, but that\u2019s expected to bring minor updates, maybe because Microsoft is focussing on Windows 11.",
    "So far, the evidence seems pretty conclusive that Windows 11 will launch \u2013 for some people, at least \u2013 in October 2021. Microsoft itself recently showed off new Windows 11 screenshots that contained references to October, so, barring any unforeseen delays, we\u2019d say that it\u2019s very likely you could be running Windows 11 by the time Halloween rolls around.",
    "However, we\u2019re still not sure who will be able to get Windows 11 then. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll start seeing new laptops and PCs being sold with the new operating system already installed, but people with existing Windows 10 devices, the wait may be a little longer for the upgrade.",
    "Microsoft usually rolls out big OS updates, so it can keep an eye on any issues, and in a Tweet a while ago, it said that the \u201crollout of the upgrade to Windows 10 devices already in use today will begin in 2022 through the first half of that year.\u201d",
    "If you really can\u2019t wait to try out the new operating system, you can try an early build. Check out our guide on how to download and install Windows 11 for more information.",
