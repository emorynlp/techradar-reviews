    "Disney fans, assemble. If you haven't made it your business to get acquainted with the House of Mouse's very own streaming service, Disney Plus, now is the time to do it before prices in the US receive an increase from March 26.",
    "It may seem like a long time ago since they slashed the Disney Plus free trial from potential new customers, but we said 'Hukuna Matata' to that. Now, though, the Disney Plus price is going up - though admittedly only by a dollar where the likes of the UK and other territories saw bigger hikes.",
    "With one day until the aforementioned price hike, today is your last chance to secure a subscription - either monthly or yearly - at Disney Plus' cheapest possible rate.",
    "Secure the current cost of $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year before it's too late. Similarly you can secure the Disney Plus bundle for $12.99 a month, throwing together Disney Plus with Hulu and ESPN Plus for one ultimate package.",
    "Tomorrow Disney Plus prices will go up to $7.99 for its monthly plan and $79.99 a year, with the Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus package costing from $13.99 a month.",
    "Find out more about this Disney Plus deal in full below, or head straight to the Disney Plus website to sign up and secure these cheaper rates.",
    "If you opt to sign up purely to Disney Plus, you've still got a boatload of fantastic TV shows, movies, and documentaries to binge your way through. With Disney animations, Pixar movies, and National Geographic documentaries, Disney Plus boasts the MCU in its entirety, including brand new Disney Plus exclusives like WandaVision. You can even watch The Falcon and the Winter Solider now.",
    "Alongside Marvel superheroes, Disney Plus also has a whole roster of films and movies from a galaxy far, far away. Yep, for Star Wars fans, this is the streaming service for you, including the one place you can watch The Mandalorian online, too.",
    "With 31 seasons of The Simpsons, Disney Plus alone will certainly keep you busy. If you're eyeing up that Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus package, you'll have even more hours to throwaway marathoning excellent shows and movies.",
    "For drama, Hulu has a bunch of new and old titles in its catalog, including Little Fires Everywhere, Helstrum, and The United States vs Billie Holiday.
