    "Microsoft is exploring some new optimization options for Windows 10 that would allow users to personalize their devices depending on what they are predominantly used for. The new feature is only being tested in Preview builds so it\u2019s not entirely clear how it will eventually look when it gets a general release, or if it will be pursued at all long-term.",
    "The change will be part of a revamped Settings app that will include a new \u201cDevice Usage\u201d section, which will appear under the \u201cPersonalization\u201d page. Users will be given six main usage categories to choose from: Gaming, Family, Creativity, Schoolwork, Entertainment, and Business.",
    "Currently, it\u2019s not clear how Windows 10 will optimize a device for the user\u2019s chosen category. For example, if users select \u201cGaming,\u201d the operating system could tweak the battery, visual effects, and mouse settings to ensure that the device is set up in the best possible way for video game players.",
    "The \u201cDevice Usage\u201d feature could be an extension of the update coming to Microsoft\u2019s out of the box experience (OOBE) screen, which is designed to help users set up their device following Windows 10 feature updates.",
    "\u201cWhen customers turn on their Windows PCs for the first time, they will see the Windows Out of Box Experience,\u201d Microsoft documentation explains. \u201cOOBE consists of a series of screens that require customers to accept the license agreement, connect to the internet, log in with, or sign up for a Microsoft Account, and share information with the OEM.\u201d",
    "However, the OOBE has been around for a few years now and it seems as though Microsoft is trialing new customization options for the feature. It\u2019s possible that more information will be released during Windows 10\u2019s next major feature update coming later this year.",
