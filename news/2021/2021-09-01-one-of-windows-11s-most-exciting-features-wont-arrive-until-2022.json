    "Windows 11 might be coming sooner than expected, at the start of October, but when Microsoft\u2019s revamped desktop OS arrives it will be without support for Android apps.",
    "As part of the announcement that Windows 11 will launch on October 5, Microsoft\u2019s Aaron Woodman, GM of Windows marketing, addressed the topic of the redesigned Microsoft Store, and clarified that: \u201cWe look forward to continuing our journey to bring Android apps to Windows 11 and the Microsoft Store through our collaboration with Amazon and Intel; this will start with a preview for Windows Insiders [testers] over the coming months.\u201d",
    "The expectation was that this feature which allows Android apps from the Amazon App Store to run under Windows 11 would be here for launch as part of the all-new Microsoft Store, but we can now see that this isn\u2019t the case.",
    "The wording from Microsoft suggests that testing will be started soon \u2013 we don\u2019t know how soon \u2013 and that it will continue over the \u2018coming months\u2019, which sounds like at least a few months of playing with the feature.",
    "Given that there\u2019s only a few months left in 2021, post Windows 11 release, this makes it clear enough that not only will Android support fail to make the cut for launch in October, but that Windows 11 surely won\u2019t be getting this feature until 2022 at some point.",
    "The ability to run Android apps on the desktop is one of the most tempting introductions with Windows 11, opening up a load more software for users in the Microsoft Store. (Previously, Windows 10 has allowed Android apps to run on the desktop, but not natively \u2013 rather via the Your Phone app hooking up with a Samsung smartphone).",
    "In recent times, we\u2019ve heard plenty of clamor from Windows Insiders about when support for Android would be arriving for testing, and with just tumbleweed as a response, many folks were already starting to draw their own conclusions that the feature wouldn\u2019t be ready for the initial release of Windows 11.",
    "We can now see that\u2019s true, and clearly Microsoft had to say something about Android app support when announcing that Windows 11 is only just over a month away. Obviously it wasn\u2019t going to cram a new feature into the final month of the testing program, which is all about honing what\u2019s already there and squashing bugs.",
    "Hopefully Android support in the Microsoft Store will be due earlier in 2022, rather than later. That should be the case, and it\u2019ll presumably be deployed separately, as a \u2018feature experience\u2019, rather than in the main feature update for 2022 (remember, Windows 11 only has one big yearly update, and that comes later in the year \u2013 it\u2019ll be 22H2).",
