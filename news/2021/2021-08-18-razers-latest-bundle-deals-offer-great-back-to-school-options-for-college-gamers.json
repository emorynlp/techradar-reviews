    "Going to college and have a bit of cash to spend? There are a few great back to school laptop deals exclusively available at the Razer site this week that are definitely worth taking a look at.",
    "While there are some rather full-featured packages being offered that are focusing on productivity, our top pick of the bunch is Razer's 'Mobile Gaming' bundle, which retails at $1,799.99 (\u00a31,899 in the UK). Included in this one is a discounted Razer Blade Stealth 13 - a fantastic little laptop for both work and casual gaming, a set of premium Hammerhead wireless earbuds, and a handy protective case.",
    "Put those together, and you've got a great package here for college. The Stealth 13 is conspicuous enough to easily blend into any library or classroom without automatically screaming 'RGB gamer' while still having plenty of power. Bear in mind, however, that the Intel Core i7-i7-1165G7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and GTX 1650 Ti in the 2021 Stealth 13 won't withstand super-heavy punishment, so don't expect to max out every title.",
    "At $100 off base-price, this latest back to school laptop deal lines up with the usual sales price we see for these machines when we track the best Razer Blade gaming laptop deals on a weekly basis, so it's not just about the freebies here.",
    "Speaking of freebies, all back to school laptop deals at Razer includes 3-years of extended warranty on the house and a free gift if you use the BACK2SCHOOL at checkout. That latter gift actually applies to all purchases over $129, though it's just a neat little keychain - nothing super expensive. If you'd like to see a few more of today's back to school sales at Razer, we've included a few more down below.",
    "While Razer laptops are definitely fantastic premium machines, they're obviously serious investments. If you're on a budget, then below, you'll find a quick round-up of today's best prices on budget gaming laptops in your region. For a more in-depth list of recommendations, then see our main cheap gaming laptop deals page for more.",
