    "Google\u2019s annual software-focused event is fast approaching, with Google IO 2021 kicking off on May 18.",
    "The event this year is online-only, for obvious reasons, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will be short of big announcements. Not much has been confirmed so far, but through a combination of leaks, rumors, the event schedule and past form, we have a good idea of what to expect.",
    "Below, then, you\u2019ll find an overview of the biggest things we\u2019re likely to see at Google IO 2021, then further down we\u2019ve listed two big things that you\u2019ll probably be waiting longer for.",
    "Android 12 is undoubtedly going to make an appearance at Google IO. In fact, it\u2019s likely to be the star of the show.",
    "This won\u2019t actually be our first look at Android 12, as it\u2019s already available to developers in preview form. But based on past form (and an official roadmap) it\u2019s likely that Google will reveal more details about it and even release the first public beta. So you\u2019ll be able to try it for yourself if you have a compatible phone \u2013 which likely means the Google Pixel 5 or another recent Pixel model, along perhaps with a few other lucky handsets.",
    "This isn\u2019t when Android 12 will launch in finished form though \u2013 that probably won\u2019t happen until September.",
    "As for what Android 12 is set to offer, based on the developer betas and various leaks we know to expect a redesigned quick settings menu, an app hibernation feature, a recycle bin, the ability to easily share Wi-Fi passwords, tweaks to the appearance of various screens, an improved one-handed mode, and all sorts of other stuff.",
    "While Google IO tends to be focused on software, it\u2019s not unusual to also see hardware at the event, and this year that hardware is likely to include the Google Pixel 5a.",
    "The Pixel 3a was announced at Google IO in 2019, so there\u2019s precedent for this, and had the pandemic not scuppered Google IO 2020 we\u2019d likely have seen the Pixel 4a there \u2013 though instead it got a later August launch.",
    "That means it\u2019s possible that we won\u2019t see the Pixel 5a until around August, but Google IO 2021 remains our best guess.",
    "Rumors suggest that the Pixel 5a will have a 6.2-inch Full HD+ OLED screen, a dual-lens camera, a plastic body and mid-range power. It might not be the most exciting phone then, but it could be a strong camera-focused mid-ranger, and one that\u2019s likely to be sold at an appealing price.",
    "Google hasn\u2019t paid a whole lot of attention to Wear OS in recent years, but that could be set to change, with some big announcements possibly set for Google IO 2021.",
    "We\u2019ve recently seen a drip-feed of new Wear OS features, such as it getting Gboard and a UV index, and Google has promised that there\u2019s more to come this year. As for what the more might be, one of the talks scheduled for IO is titled 'Create your first Tile in Wear', which is a strong hint that third-party tile support will be added.",
    "But we\u2019re hoping to see a lot more beyond that. With Google having bought Fitbit, and Samsung strongly rumored to be switching to Wear OS for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch Active 4, it seems like there could be big things for the platform on the horizon \u2013 so maybe Google will unveil some of them at IO.",
    "The Pixel 5a might not be the only hardware we see at Google IO 2021, with the Pixel Buds A also potentially making an appearance. They haven\u2019t specifically been linked to the event, but rumors suggest they\u2019re landing imminently.",
    "These are rumored to sport touch controls for controlling music playback and accessing Google Assistant, along with a similar rounded design to the standard Pixel Buds. There\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know about them though, which might mean they\u2019re not launching so soon after all.",
    "While we\u2019re likely to see a number of things at Google IO 2021, there are some rumored or upcoming Google products that we almost certainly won\u2019t see. We\u2019ve detailed the two most significant ones below.",
    "The Google Pixel 6 is set to be the company\u2019s flagship phone for 2021, but we\u2019d be shocked if it arrived at Google IO, as in the past the company has always launched new flagship Pixel models later in the year.",
    "Specifically, we\u2019ve always seen them in October, except for the Pixel 5, which landed on September 30 of 2020. So either late September or \u2013 more likely \u2013 October is when we\u2019ll almost certainly see the Google Pixel 6.",
    "It should hopefully be worth the wait though, with rumors of a radical redesign, and a custom-made chipset, currently codenamed Whitechapel. This won\u2019t necessarily be better than a Snapdragon alternative, but could allow Google to bring more unity between the hardware and software, similarly to how Apple has with its iPhone chipsets.",
    "The Pixel 6 might also support 4K video recording with the front camera, have an in-screen fingerprint scanner, and possibly even have an under-display front camera \u2013 though that\u2019s less likely.",
    "The Google Pixel Watch is a long-rumored device, but one that there\u2019s no clear news on a release date for.",
    "The lack of rumors \u2013 both around the release date and the device itself \u2013 makes us think it\u2019s very unlikely the Pixel Watch will land as soon as Google IO, though it would certainly bolster any Wear OS announcements the company makes if it did.",
    "If we see it at all this year, it\u2019s much more likely that we\u2019ll see the wearable alongside the Google Pixel 6 in September or October.",
    "If and when the Google Pixel Watch does launch, rumors suggest it might have a physical crown, a circular screen, all sorts of fitness features such as SpO2 tracking and sleep apnea detection, and the ability to listen out for voice commands at all times without draining the battery."
