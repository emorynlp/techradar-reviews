    "After a so-so year for the streamer, Netflix is finally getting its big shows back on the service.",
    "We\u2019ve already got release dates (or months) for highly-anticipated series like The Witcher season 2, Cobra Kai season 4 and Sex Education season 3 \u2013 and now, thanks to a new teaser trailer, we also know that Stranger Things season 4 will definitely be returning in 2022.",
    "Initially expected to release this year, the mega-popular sci-fi show was hampered by pandemic-related production delays, with filming halted in March last year and not resuming until September. With a 2022 arrival now confirmed, we're hoping Stranger Things will return in the early months of next year.",
    "Season 4 of the show is set to be the most ambitious yet, with the plot moving away from Hawkins and into new locations in both the US and Russia following Jim Hopper\u2019s supposed death and Eleven\u2019s relocation.",
    "\"As much as it pains our viewers that it will have been so long,\u201d executive producer Shawn Levy recently told Collider, \u201cwe chose season 4 to be by far \u2013 and I mean by far \u2013 the most ambitious of the seasons.\"",
    "In this latest teaser, we get only a small taste of that ambition. Interspersed with clips from previous episodes is some blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it new footage showing a flame-throwing Hopper and some new shots of the young cast. All the usual suspects return, so we\u2019re expecting more of the same supernatural hijinks from Dustin, Mike and the gang.",
    "As for why Netflix has decided to share such a tenuous release window for the show now, rather than waiting until later in the year to confirm a single date, speaks to the streamer\u2019s efforts to promise its subscribers that quality content is on the way. It also ends speculation about the prospect of the show returning this year, which always seemed unlikely after the filming delay.",
    "Netflix has certainly had a quieter year when it comes to its big, returning series \u2013 it hasn't stopped it producing new hits like Shadow and Bone, Sex/Life or Sweet Tooth, but a lot of its most popular programming has been slow to emerge thanks to the pandemic. This summer, in particular, has yielded a noticeably drier library of original content.",
    "What\u2019s more, with the likes of Disney Plus and HBO Max seemingly benefiting from excellent new additions \u2013 and viewers \u2013 every week, the pressure is on Netflix to double-down on its flagship franchises in the coming year to recoup lost prestige.",
    "This latest tease for Stranger Things\u2019 fourth season will go some way to reminding subscribers why Netflix has proved so popular in the last decade \u2013 but its golden geese will need to deliver the goods when they do eventually arrive."
