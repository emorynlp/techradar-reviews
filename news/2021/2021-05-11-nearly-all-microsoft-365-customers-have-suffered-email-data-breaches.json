    "Using Microsoft 365, the software giant\u2019s cloud-based communications and collaboration platform, could be a security liability for many organizations, a new report from Egress seems to suggest.",
    "The data security company\u2019s new Outbound Email: Microsoft 365\u2019s Security Blind Spot paper, based on a poll of 500 IT leaders and 3,000 remote-workers in the UK and US, claims businesses who use Microsoft 365 suffer more email data breaches and have to deal with more difficult consequences in the aftermath.",
    "Were it not for the pandemic, however, things would probably have been different.",
    "More than two-thirds (67%) of IT leaders said the increase in email data breaches happened due to home working, compared to just below a third (32%) among those whose organizations don\u2019t use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based collaboration and communication platform.",
    "Furthermore, almost all (93%) businesses who use the service reported negative impacts following an email data breach, fewer than those who don\u2019t use it (84%).",
    "More than one in six (15%) of those using Microsoft 365 suffered more than 500 data breaches last year, compared to just 4% among those that don\u2019t.",
    "At the end of the day, the problem doesn\u2019t seem to be in the platform itself, but in the way people use ut. More than a quarter of IT leaders (26%) said a severe data loss incident came from an employee sharing data via email by mistake. Yet again, the figure drops among businesses that don\u2019t use Microsoft 365 - 14%.",
    "The worst part is that IT leaders aren\u2019t overly optimistic about the future, not believing things would change for the better, any time soon. More than three-quarters (76%) believe remote and hybrid working will make it harder to prevent email data loss from Microsoft 365 in the future.",
    "Among those not using the service, just 40% share the same outlook.",
    "\u201cMicrosoft 365 has seen phenomenal adoption during the Covid-19 pandemic and has brought cost and efficiency benefits to many organizations, but its security limitations are clear to see,\u201d commented Egress\u2019 Chief Technology Officer Darren Cooper.",
    "\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the risk of email data loss from Microsoft 365 and the shortcomings of static DLP solutions to mitigate the outbound email security risks that organizations face today. Email data breaches are the top security concern for all businesses, and remote working has only exacerbated the risk. Organizations need to take proactive steps now to secure their data using intelligent solutions that can understand an individual user\u2019s behavior and the context in which they\u2019re sharing data to prevent data loss before it happens,\u201d Cooper concluded."
