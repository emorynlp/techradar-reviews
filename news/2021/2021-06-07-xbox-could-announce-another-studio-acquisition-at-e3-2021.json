    "Microsoft might announce another Xbox studio at E3 2021, according to new rumors, which would take its total of first-party studios up to 24.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s latest acquisition saw the company stump up $7.5 billion to buy ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda; however, Windows Central editor Jez Corden believes that the company isn\u2019t quite done yet.",
    "In the Windows Central Discord (thanks, Pure Xbox), Corden said he believes \u201cthere\u2019s a very good chance of at least one [Xbox] acquisition being announced at [E3 2021]\u201d, and if it doesn\u2019t happen during the annual video games extravaganza, which takes place from June 12 to June 15, Corden thinks it\u2019s \u201con the horizon\u201d.",
    "Corden\u2019s prediction might sound rather vague, but he followed up his comments by saying he\u2019s heard \u201cgood, very good\u201d rumors that Microsoft has acquired a new or existing IP, which could be tied with a studio acquisition. Corden did stress, though, that we won\u2019t be seeing an acquisition as ground-breaking as the Bethesda deal, saying that it isn\u2019t \u201cAAA-hype level stuff.\u201d",
    "As with all rumors and insider tips, we\u2019ll have to take Corden\u2019s prediction with a pinch of salt, with Corden himself taking to Twitter to say he has \u201cno hard evidence yet\u201d of any Xbox acquisition, or one being announced at E3.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen, though, and it\u2019s always fun to speculate which studios Microsoft might go after. If we take into Corden\u2019s comment about it not being a studio that will result in \u201cAAA-hype level stuff\u201d, it means the acquisition could be something along the lines of when Microsoft bought We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games.",
    "Asobo Studios could be a good bet for Microsoft\u2019s next acquisition. The team were responsible for Disneyland Adventures for Kinect, the Quantum Break PC port and even worked on Young Conker for Hololens. More recently the studio delivered A Plague\u2019s Tale Innocence and Microsoft\u2019s Flight Simulator, so it\u2019s a studio that has an existing relationship with Xbox and a proven track record.",
    "Of course, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if Microsoft does reveal whether it\u2019s snapped up another studio at E3, and you can keep up with all the announcements on TechRadar."
