  "article": [
    "I never thought of the Xbox Series S as a portable console \u2013 and fundamentally, it isn\u2019t designed to be one. But after taking Microsoft\u2019s smallest ever Xbox with me on holiday, it\u2019s actually far more viable than you might think.",
    "In fact, I was rather shocked by just how easy it is to pack up the Xbox Series S and take it on the move. And while it obviously won\u2019t be a replacement for the Nintendo Switch or upcoming Steam Deck, it\u2019s suddenly become my go-to console whenever I know I\u2019m going to be away for a few nights. At least for now...",
    "As it stands, Covid-19 travel restrictions continue to make the idea of hopping on a plane an anxiety-inducing and costly event that I\u2019d rather do without. That\u2019s why since the pandemic, my holidays have centered around booking nearby staycations, instead of sunning myself on a sandy beach with a cocktail in hand.",
    "Even though a change of scenery is always welcome, it\u2019s hard not to miss your home comforts when you are basically staying in\u2026 well... just another home, albeit a fancier one. And with no pool, beach or hotel entertainment to preoccupy me in the evenings, taking the Xbox Series S on holiday suddenly made sense. After all, I knew that there would be a TV, one which would hopefully have an HDMI port.",
    "What\u2019s more, I\u2019ve also stayed at quite a few places which didn\u2019t have Netflix or Amazon Video available, so being able to leave my laptop behind and watch my favorite programs on a bigger screen is also something that the Xbox Series S could provide.",
    "With the Xbox Series S essentially being made up of four parts: the console, power lead, HDMI cable and a controller, I found that three of these components could be handily stored in my headphone\u2019s travel case. It meant that I only needed to worry about transporting the console safely, something which a discarded Amazon box did the job of perfectly.",
    "I\u2019ll admit that sticking the Xbox Series S in a cardboard box wasn\u2019t the most glamorous solution, but you can buy some lovely little cases that are specifically designed to transport your Xbox Series S more safely (though nothing is as cool as the Microsoft Flight Simulator Xbox Series S luggage).",
    "Before I knew it, then, I had the Xbox Series S packed up and ready to go in a matter of minutes. Once I reached my destination, it was simply a case of unpacking the console, plugging in the necessary cables and voil\u00e0, my evenings were now sorted.",
    "Once I\u2019d connected to the Wi-Fi, the way Xbox handles cloud saves meant that my progress from Xbox Series X was synced to the Xbox Series S in a couple of seconds, and with the Seagate Xbox Storage Expansion Card, I had countless more games available as soon as I plugged in Microsoft\u2019s proprietary SSD into the back of the console. From Gang Beasts and Octopath Traveler to Gears Tactics and FIFA 21, being able to game away from home was a luxury that I\u2019m keen to repeat in the future.",
    "Of course, one factor that could hinder your enjoyment of your Xbox Series S on holiday is the quality of TV that you\u2019ll find at your destination. Thankfully, my staycation had a surprisingly decent 1080p JVC television, which after a bit of calibrating (yeah, I have a bad habit of tweaking other people\u2019s TVs) looked great.",
    "Unfortunately, that won\u2019t always be the case, but soon even this problem could be circumvented. The recently backed xScreen display on Kickstarter might turn the Xbox Series S into the ultimate portable console, as it lets you attach an 11.6-inch 1080p 60Hz display. Created by a company called UPSpec Gaming, it sits flush with the edge of the console, and only adds an extra 1.5 pounds (695g) to the overall weight of the Xbox Series S.",
    "While I\u2019d definitely opt for the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck when I\u2019m brave enough to fly again, if you\u2019re an Xbox Series S owner, don\u2019t discount Microsoft\u2019s svelte white box as the system to take on your next vacation."
