  "article": [
    "The upcoming Samsung Galaxy A72 may inherit a game-changing camera feature that\u2019s only been seen in the brand\u2019s flagship phones like the Samsung S21. Called Space Zoom, this feature offers a reach reach of up to 30x of digital magnification.",
    "That\u2019s just one detail in a large specs leak by YouTuber TechTalkTV, who shared the information via a series of tweets. Most of these echo the specs we\u2019ve seen rumored previously, but this is the first we\u2019ve heard that one of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range\u2019s best features is trickling down to the brand\u2019s mid-range phones.",
    "Space Zoom debuted in the Samsung Galaxy S20 line, managing the same 30x digital magnification on the current flagships, but it\u2019s much crisper at that maximum in the S21 range.",
    "Trickling this feature down to the Galaxy A72 is a great boon for folks who don\u2019t want to pay flagship phone prices for Samsung quality \u2013 but it\u2019s also very impressive given its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy A71, didn\u2019t have a telephoto lens at all (just a 5MP depth sensor).",
    "We\u2019ve heard plenty of rumors about the Samsung Galaxy A72 that paint a pretty clear picture of what kind of phone we\u2019re likely to get.",
    "The aforementioned specs leaks, along with this one, suggest a 4G-only phone powered by a Snapdragon 720G chipset, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage, though that\u2019s expandable via microSD (up to 1TB, the new leak suggests). Leaks suggest it will have a 6.7-inch Full HD Plus (2400 x 1080) AMOLED display with in-screen fingerprint scanner and 90Hz refresh rate.",
    "With a 5,000mAh battery, Android 11, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, we\u2019re expecting a solid mid-range device much like its predecessor and a price far below Samsung Galaxy S21 deals.",
    "It\u2019s the cameras that could differentiate the A72 from last year\u2019s Samsung A71: while we\u2019d heard about a 32MP selfie, 64MP main shooter, 12MP ultra-wide, and 2MP macro shooter, we\u2019d only heard about an 8MP camera that could be telephoto. The new leak suggests that latter shooter will indeed be an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom.",
    "While that\u2019s below the 64MP 3x optical telephoto lens on the Samsung Galaxy S21 \u2013 which could mean the A72\u2019s 8MP lens will take blurrier photos at maximum magnification \u2013 Space Zoom is still a neat feature that broadens the mid-range phone\u2019s photographic capabilities.",
