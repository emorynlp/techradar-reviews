    "Samsung has revealed it will remain the official TV partner of the Xbox Series X in the US and Canada.",
    "As part of the multi-year agreement, announced at Samsung\u2019s Unbox and Discover event, Samsung Neo QLED is now the official TV partner of the Xbox Series X, and both companies are set to continue working together to offer what they describe as \u201can unbeatable gaming experience.\u201d",
    "We first saw Samsung\u2019s Neo QLED TVs at CES 2021, where the company revealed the new display technology packs in 10 times more LEDs into a screen than has been previously possible to radically increase brightness, reduce blooming and widen viewing angles.",
    "Samsung says its Neo QLED and QLED displays will offer the best TV companions to next-gen gaming with the Xbox Series X, thanks to 4K resolution, 120fps and impressively-low 5.8ms response times.",
    "The event also marked the announcement of further gaming news for the TV giant. The latest Samsung TVs (that\u2019s the Q70A 4K and up, as well as The Frame) will be the first to offer AMD FreeSync Premium Pro \u2013 technology which enables brighter HDR gaming \u2013 for PC and console games.",
    "It\u2019s worth clarifying that, despite the partnership, Xbox is reluctant to choose sides when it comes to which TVs are best suited to its new hardware.",
    "While it\u2019s undoubtedly true that Samsung\u2019s Neo QLED and QLED displays will offer some of the best gaming experiences money can buy right now, other TV giants have thrown their hats in the ring to claim that they provide the best gaming TVs for the Xbox Series X.",
    "At the end of 2020, we reported on a similar partnership between Xbox and LG, with the latter claiming that its OLED TVs offered the best next-gen gaming experience.",
    "The point being, official partnerships between brands are merely marketing tools to mutually showcase the products involved \u2013 it\u2019s abundantly clear that both Samsung and LG offer market-leading OLED screens that suit the Xbox Series X\u2019s capabilities down to the ground.",
    "The same can be said for misconstruing that these TV giants are favouring one console-maker over another. While we\u2019ve previously highlighted a PS5-specific HDR issue on Samsung TVs, it won\u2019t be long before Sony\u2019s flagship console (March, according to Samsung) plays equally well on both Samsung and LG hardware.",
    "Naturally, Sony chooses to market its games consoles through its own TV products, so a partnership between PlayStation and a rival TV brand is always unlikely, but that\u2019s not to say this comes at the expense of the PS5\u2019s performance on the biggest and best displays on the market right now.",
    "In any case, if you\u2019re after the best gaming TVs to enjoy your new console in all its next-gen glory, you\u2019ll have to fork out the big bucks \u2013 regardless of the brand you choose."
