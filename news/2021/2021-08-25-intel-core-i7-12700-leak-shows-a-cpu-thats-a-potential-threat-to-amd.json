  "summary": "Alder Lake chip keeps pace with AMD Ryzen 7 5800X in leaked benchmark",
  "article": [
    "One of Intel\u2019s Alder Lake processors has been spotted being benchmarked, with the purported Core i7-12700 producing some interesting results \u2013 and having an interesting core count for that matter.",
    "The Intel Core i7-12700 was spotted in a Geekbench result, as flagged by BenchLeaks on Twitter, and according to the listed spec of this CPU, it has 8-cores and 16-threads. That means the chip has 8 full-power cores (with hyperthreading), but no power-efficient cores.",
    "Now, the rumored Core i7-12700K is purportedly going to offer eight full cores plus four low-power cores, for a total thread count of 20, so if the spec info provided via Geekbench is correct, the vanilla 12700 will do away with the 4 \u2018small\u2019 power-efficient cores.",
    "Clock speeds are indicative of a pre-release sample CPU with a base clock of 2.1GHz and boost to 4.8GHz, but that\u2019s very common with early leaks (remember, Alder Lake isn\u2019t due until later in the year, maybe around October going by the rumor mill).",
    "As for the actual result \u2013 assuming it\u2019s genuine \u2013 the Core i7-12700 managed a score of 1,595 in single-core, with 10,170 recorded in multi-core. The former score doesn\u2019t look great, and indeed lags behind the current Core i7-11700, which is of course disappointing on the face of it (more on that in a moment).",
    "Multi-core is a more positive showing here with the Alder Lake processor offering a 15% uptick compared to its predecessor, and coming pretty close to the performance of the Ryzen 7 5800X. This is something to get a bit more excited about, of course, particularly given that the Alder Lake silicon is a sample, so we can expect more pep than this from the final version (And remember, Windows 11 is set to fine-tune performance of Intel\u2019s 12th-gen CPUs, too).",
    "As ever with these kinds of early benchmark leaks, we definitely can\u2019t read too much into what is just a sample chip, and there\u2019s only so much a single benchmark can tell us anyway.",
    "The single-core result is disappointing as mentioned, but this is symptomatic of an engineering sample, where typically scores can pitch considerably lower than what we should expect from the finished product. Indeed, there\u2019s clearly no way Intel would release a successor CPU which was slower than the current model for single-core performance, as that just wouldn\u2019t make any sense.",
    "As for the prospect of the Core i7-12700 doing away with power-efficient cores compared to the \u2018K\u2019 model, that\u2019s a move to be skeptical around in our opinion. The \u2018K\u2019 variant of an Intel processor is always capable of better performance, but it does that with higher clock speeds, and being unlocked for overclocking \u2013 while the core configuration remains identical to the vanilla (non-K) offering.",
    "So, either Intel is seriously changing things up here, or the CPU\u2019s configuration is being misread by the software \u2013 or indeed this could be a result of the 12700 shown here being an early sample chip. The latter possibilities seem more likely, so we wouldn\u2019t get hung up on purported differences in the actual core count, and it\u2019s surely likely the vanilla 12700 will offer 4 \u2018little\u2019 cores just like its 12700K sibling.",
    "There may be other Alder Lake CPUs which drop the power-efficient cores from the mix, as per the rumor mill, but we\u2019d be surprised to see such a variation between K and non-K models.",
