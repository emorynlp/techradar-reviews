    "Spoilers follow for Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League.",
    "If you've reached the end of Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, you might be wondering who the green guy floating in front of Bruce Wayne's lakeside house at the end is. DC Comics fans already know the answer: this is the Martian Manhunter, played by Harry Lennix. In this guide, we'll explain who he is, and the significance of his appearance in the Snyder Cut.",
    "The Martian Manhunter cameo is among the many major changes Snyder has made to his version of the 2017 film, alongside a very different ending and a new Knightmare epilogue sequence. Below, we'll tell you everything you need to know about this new superhero, as well as a little about his origins in DC's comics.",
    "Like we said at the top of the page, there are big spoilers for the Snyder Cut incoming. If you\u2019ve somehow opened this page without making it to the end credits, you really should turn back.",
    "Zack Snyder had teased that his movie would end with a massive cameo, but rather than hitting us with a big surprise, it turns out that this character had already been revealed by the director pre-release.",
    "That may come as a disappointment to some fans, but for anyone who hasn\u2019t been keeping up with Snyder\u2019s various interviews, they might not see it coming. After Bruce Wayne wakes from his nightmare of a Darkseid-ravaged future, he heads outside to see what appears to be Superman floating down to meet him - only it isn\u2019t the son of Krypton.",
    "It\u2019s Martian Manhunter, another superhero who has been hiding in plain sight throughout Snyder\u2019s DCEU movies. He\u2019s been masquerading as General Calvin Swanwick, played by Harry Lennix, who viewers will recognize from Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.",
    "Martian Manhunter reveals his true identity to Bruce Wayne, who seems taken aback by his arrival. The alien superhero, who also goes by the name J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz, tells Bruce that the Justice League needs to find the Anti-Life Equation before Darkseid does, and that he\u2019s prepared to help after hiding in the shadows for too long. He says he\u2019ll be in touch with Bruce soon and flies into the distance as the screen turns black.",
    "We\u2019ll never know how prominent a role Martian Manhunter would have played in Snyder\u2019s Justice League sequels, since there are no plans to make them. Given his reveal in this movie, however, we can predict that he would have played a much greater role down the line. What could've been, huh?",
    "For those unfamiliar with the character, in the comics Martian Manhunter is a Mars law enforcement officer who ends up being marooned on Earth. He becomes a police detective and superhero when he realizes he can\u2019t return home, and helps to found the Justice League in his new home.",
    "Martian Manhunter made his comic debut in Detective Comics #225 in November 1955. Created by writer Joseph Samachson and illustrator Joe Certa, Martian Manhunter is a green-skinned humanoid alien who accidentally arrives on Earth when a scientific experiment goes wrong.",
    "Pulled to our world by an experimental teleportation beam, J\u2019onzz is permanently stuck on Earth when the project\u2019s lead scientist dies of shock over the superhero\u2019s arrival. Until a time when Martian technology can bring him home, Martian Manhunter adopts the human moniker John Jones, becomes a police detective, and uses his superpowers to aid humanity.",
    "Speaking of abilities, Martian Manhunter has a few. They\u2019re all pretty similar to Superman\u2019s so, if you\u2019re clued up on the Man of Steel\u2019s powers, J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz superpowers won\u2019t be unfamiliar. They include flight, superhuman strength, regeneration, durability, and heat vision. Unlike Superman, Martian Manhunter is able to turn invisible, and use telekinesis and telepathy, but he doesn\u2019t possess superhuman breath like his alien counterpart.",
    "Martian Manhunter is also able to shapeshift, which is an ability we glimpse in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. After visiting Lois Lane, Superman\u2019s adopted mother Martha leaves the former\u2019s apartment - only it isn\u2019t the Martha we know from Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.",
    "As Martha\u2019s eyes begin to glow red, a cape drapes around her and her clothes change. It turns out that Martian Manhunter was masquerading as Clark Kent\u2019s mom to persuade Lois to move on with her life after Superman\u2019s death. J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz then shapeshifts into General Swanwick before leaving the building.",
    "What of his involvement in the Justice League\u2019s comic history, then? Martian Manhunter helped to form the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Green Lantern. Its formation occurred in The Brave and the Bold #28 in March 1960, and he\u2019s appeared in standalone and Justice League comics in the 66 years since his creation.",
    "Martian Manhunter was installed as Justice League chairman during DC Comics\u2019 relaunching of its comic book lines in 2016. He\u2019s also a member of the newest incarnation of the Justice League, which arrived as part of DC\u2019s Infinite Frontier relaunch in March 2021.",
    "If you\u2019re hungry for more on Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, we\u2019ve got plenty to keep you busy. Check out why the movie utilizes a 4:3 picture format over its widescreen counterpart, and our review to see if it lines up with your thoughts on the movie."
