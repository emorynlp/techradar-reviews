  "article": [
    "Nvidia could again be relying on a previous-gen graphics card in the form of the GeForce RTX 2060 to help mitigate stock issues \u2013 except this time around, Team Green might purportedly give the card a boost by doubling up the VRAM.",
    "As you may recall, this isn\u2019t the first time Nvidia has pulled this trick, and indeed at the beginning of 2021, the GPU maker resurrected RTX 2060 graphics cards (only just after they\u2019d been discontinued) to help deal with RTX 3000 stock issues.",
    "We\u2019ve never really seen a let-up in those supply problems, of course, and if this rumor is correct, we won\u2019t be doing in the foreseeable, because the contention on the grapevine is that Nvidia will be making these GPUs again, except with one big change \u2013 the loadout of 6GB of VRAM will be doubled to 12GB (GDDR6).",
    "That\u2019s going by sources who spoke to VideoCardz about a new \u2018PG161\u2019 model featuring more RAM but the same TU106-300 GPU. Manufacturing is expected to kick off with a view to realizing these 2060 graphics cards at the end of the year, with a possible on-sale date of January 2022 mentioned.",
    "With the availability and pricing of the RTX 3060 being so skewed thanks to the ongoing supply issues around this GPU (and other Ampere models), it wouldn\u2019t really be a surprise to see Nvidia take this route (which as mentioned, has been an alternative used before) to ensure some more affordable graphics cards are out there.",
    "Doubling up the memory should help ensure these cards are better equipped to run contemporary games \u2013 the RTX 2060 still remains a palatable proposition for 1080p gaming at least, even if you can\u2019t expect to crank details and so forth with more demanding titles.",
    "While all this does make some sense, then, as a rumor, we should obviously be very cautious around the prospect (even if it is something Nvidia is considering right now, the company may change its mind \u2013 who knows).",
    "That said, all we\u2019ve been hearing of late is that the global chip shortage will keep its grip on the industry into and throughout 2022, so in that light, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that continuing stock and pricing problems could well need alleviating in some manner."
