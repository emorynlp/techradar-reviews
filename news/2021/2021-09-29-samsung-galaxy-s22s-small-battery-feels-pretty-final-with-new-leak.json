    "A new leak suggests the Samsung Galaxy S22 will have a smaller battery than its predecessor, echoing several previous rumors and convincing us even more that Samsung will shrink its battery capacity.",
    "A new certification listed on Safety Korea, as spotted by Phone Arena, shows a photo of a supposed Galaxy S22 battery unit with two numbers in the label\u2019s fine print: a \u2018typical capacity\u2019 (often the figure used in advertisements) of 3,700mAh, with a rated capacity of 3,590mAh. By comparison, last year\u2019s Galaxy S21 had a typical capacity of 4,000mAh and rated capacity of 3,880mAh.",
    "That\u2019s a slight but not insignificant drop in capacity, and goes against general precedent that batteries get bigger in phones going forward \u2013 or at least not smaller. But that\u2019s the second time we\u2019ve heard that the Galaxy S22\u2019s rated capacity will be 3,590mAh after a previous rumor.",
    "We\u2019ll have to see, of course, if a lower capacity directly translates to less battery life \u2013 or if Samsung can manage efficiencies and other tricks to make the Galaxy S22 last as long as its predecessor.",
    "We\u2019re still a ways out from the Samsung Galaxy S22\u2019s launch, which we expect to follow its predecessors by coming early next year \u2013 likely January 2022.",
    "What we have heard suggests the phone will have a 6.06-inch display and be physically smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S21 (which had a 6.2-inch screen). It would make sense that the battery may have a consequently smaller capacity, then, though certainly unfortunate.",
    "Otherwise, a recent Samsung Galaxy S22 render leak suggests the phone will look much like the S21 before it, with vertically-aligned rear cameras nested in a sizable camera bump. In other words, not much new \u2013 although another render of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra reveals a potential camera setup that doesn\u2019t have a bump at all \u2013 just glass covering all five lenses in an oblong shape. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see whether these are the final designs for the phone."
