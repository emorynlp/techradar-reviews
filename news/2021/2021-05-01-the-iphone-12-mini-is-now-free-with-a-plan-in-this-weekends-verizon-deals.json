    "This weekend's latest iPhone 12 Mini Verizon deals now mean you can bag the brand new flagship device for free with a new unlimited data line.",
    "Available for a limited time only, and for new customers only with a number port-in, this is the first time we've seen this particular device go for 'free' without a trade.",
    "Previously, the iPhone 12 Mini was only available for free via the carrier's 'buy-one get-one' promo or, in rare circumstances, a particularly good trade-in if you happened to have a really fancy phone to hand over. Subsequently, this is the best iPhone 12 Mini Verizon deal we've seen yet when it comes to outright value on a single device - despite being available for new customers only.",
    "If you're a fan of smaller devices you're no doubt already interested in the excellent iPhone 12 Mini. If you're not familiar - don't discount it. While slightly smaller than its 12-series brethren it's every bit as powerful thanks to the Apple A14 chip hiding under the hood. The camera, screen, and overall design are also top-notch and make it pretty much the only 'smaller' device on the market right now to offer such features in a palm-friendly form factor.",
    "Outside the US? See the best iPhone 12 deals in your region just below.",
    "Verizon, of course, doesn't offer what you'd exactly define at cheap cell phone plans, but there are a few really good reasons to switch. Firstly, the carrier has one of the best 5G networks in the nation in terms of coverage and speed - with heaps of priority data that can't be throttled. Secondly, Verizon wireless plans feature some really fantastic bundled-in streaming service subscriptions like Hulu, EPSN+, and Disney+.",
    "Subsequently, while Verizon's unlimited data plans are indeed pretty pricey, they offer quite a lot of added value each month - especially if you're a heavy user. With a device like the iPhone 12 Mini, you'll also be able to make full use of that speedy network too since it's a fully 5G compatible device.",
