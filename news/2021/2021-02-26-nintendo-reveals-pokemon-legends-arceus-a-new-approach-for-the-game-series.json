    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus has been announced for the Nintendo Switch as the closer to the Pok\u00e9mon Presents presentation, which was held to celebrate the franchise\u2019s 25th anniversary with new game announcements.",
    "According to the announcement, Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus acts as a prequel to the main series. Taking place in a much older version of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\u2019s Sinnoh region, in a time when Pok\u00e9mon roamed freely. Players will travel from their village home base to many different areas surrounding it.",
    "The world premiere trailer showed off a glimpse at Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus\u2019s gameplay, which looks to be running on the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield engine. The game will release simultaneously worldwide in early 2022 and is being developed by Game Freak.",
    "Players will be tasked with filling out one of the very first Pokedexes, which are your trusty Pok\u00e9mon data collection devices featured throughout the series. In a twist on the typical formula, the three starter Pok\u00e9mon are all from different generations, and they are Rowlet, Cyndaquil and Oshawott.",
    "There\u2019s more of an emphasis on Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus being an RPG adventure, meaning progression might not be quite as linear as we\u2019re used to in older titles. It looks like your trainer can catch Pok\u00e9mon from the overworld, too, without having to enter a battle first. Of course, Pok\u00e9mon battles will still be a major part of the experience.",
    "The focus of the game\u2019s story looks like it will heavily involve the titular mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Arceus, who in the Pok\u00e9mon lore shaped the world how it is today.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus looks to break new ground for the long-running series. While this may not be a mainline series entry, it\u2019s interesting to see a big Pok\u00e9mon adventure not be announced alongside a counterpart game, as we saw in 2017 with Pok\u00e9mon Let\u2019s Go Pikachu and Let\u2019s Go Eevee."
