    "In a bid to help microbusinesses grow their online presence, domain registrar and web hosting giant GoDaddy has teamed up with eBay to help SMBs find new customers.",
    "The new partnership will mean that UK entrepreneurs and microbusiness owners using GoDaddy can now sell their products on eBay through a single dashboard.",
    "Small business owners will be pushed to expand their ecommerce store offerings and find new customers through the GoDaddy Websites + Marketing platform.",
    "Available now, the new feature enables business owners to list their inventory with eBay while using its online store feature to manage orders and shipping across various platforms.",
    "With no additional add-ons or plug-ins needed, GoDaddy customers will have the ability to list their products with eBay, using their existing online store product catalogue.",
    "Ben Law, Head of UK and Ireland, GoDaddy, said: \u201cWe know how important it is for small and microbusinesses to have a strong online presence and we continue to support small businesses and entrepreneurs across the UK, with an integrated suite of online tools and solutions to help them grow their business online.\u201d",
