    "Since launching a few months ago, Windows 11 has had a bit of a mixed reception, with several bugs \u2013 and even deliberate design decisions \u2013 annoying users. Now it looks like Microsoft is looking to address some of these issues.",
    "As The Verge reports, a new update that\u2019s rolling out to Windows Insiders \u2013 users who\u2019ve signed up to help test early versions of Windows \u2013 has added the clock and date to the taskbar on multiple monitors.",
    "Many users who have more than one monitor had complained that the date and time wasn\u2019t shown on the taskbar in their secondary monitors \u2013 only the main one. This may sound like a small complaint, but it annoyed a lot of people. It led some to use third-party apps to bring the time and date back, but now it looks like Microsoft will be including an official option to add time and date info to multiple monitors.",
    "The Verge also reports that a new Insider build \u2013 it's not clear if the update and the new build are the same thing \u2013 is tweaking the Windows 11 Start menu, giving users more configuration options regarding pinned app shortcuts and recommendations. The Start menu is one of the most-used elements of Windows, which means people can be very protective over it. Any changes Microsoft makes to how it works could annoy a lot of people \u2013 which is what happened with Windows 8 \u2013 and Windows 11 also brought some unwelcome changes.",
    "The Settings app has also been expanded to offer more options that you\u2019d usually find in Control Panel, including network discovery and printer sharing. This is part of Microsoft\u2019s ambition to phase out Control Panel, which has been a part of Windows since Windows 1.0 back in 1985, and replace it with the modern Settings app.",
    "Of course, removing a feature that some people have been using for 36 years could once again cause friction between Microsoft and its customers. It\u2019ll need to proceed with caution \u2013 which it appears to be doing with the slow migration of tools from Control Panel to the Settings app.",
    "When Windows 11 launched, a number of changes the operating system made over its predecessor, Windows 10, frustrated many users.",
    "To Microsoft\u2019s credit, it has been listening to feedback, and for some of its more controversial changes, it's added options that allow users to revert to the way things worked in Windows 10. This is undoubtedly a good thing, as it gives users more choice as to how they use Windows 11, rather than just undoing any changes; after all, there will be some people who like the changes Windows 11 brings.",
    "There\u2019s still work to be done, however. Some of Windows 11\u2019s most annoying \u2013 and baffling \u2013 changes, such as the inability to drag and drop app shortcuts onto the taskbar, have yet to be addressed, though it does appear that Microsoft is working on a solution to that.",
    "As we observed in our Windows 11 review, the new operating system feels like a work in progress, and that's a positive thing. So if there\u2019s something about Windows 11 you don\u2019t like, be patient, as Microsoft may look to change it in an upcoming update."
