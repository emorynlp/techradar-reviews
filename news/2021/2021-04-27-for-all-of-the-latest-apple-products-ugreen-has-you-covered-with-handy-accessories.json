    "Apple makes some of the best gadgets in the industry, and those shown at its recent April Event are no exception. But, a common theme among them is the need for extra accessories to really make the most of them. And, when it comes to accessories for everything from your new iPad to your iPhone and MacBook Pro, UGREEN has you covered with highly capable products at highly favorable prices. You can even find UGREEN products ready for the latest products from Apple.",
    "UGREEN is celebrating the launch of the latest Apple gear with a 20% discount on its products to help you accessorize your devices. When you check out, you can use discount code \u201c3SAEVENT20\u201d to apply your savings.",
    "When you need to keep your devices charged, you can turn to UGREEN. Give your phone or tablet a speedy charge with UGREEN\u2019s 20-watt PD 3.0 charger, or you can go for the powerful yet compact 65W 3C1A GaN Charger. This small power brick can deliver enough juice to keep a MacBook Air running or it can charge four devices at the same time.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a power outlet handy, UGREEN can even keep you covered on the go with its 20W 10,000mAh USB-C Power Bank, which can add a bunch of extra battery life to two devices at the same time. Naturally UGREEN also has the charging cables you\u2019ll need, like the 60W PD Fast Charging Cable and the 18W Right Angle USB-C Cable.",
    "Whether you\u2019re streaming music from your phone on the go or attending a video call on your laptop, a good pair of wireless earbuds can really help your presence. UGREEN has a handful of wireless earbuds available, including the new HiTune T2 Low Latency True Wireless Earbuds. These earbuds cost only a little over $30, but you\u2019ll find large drivers and 3D surround audio to rival Apple\u2019s own AirPods. Plus, with low latency, they can keep up with your games and video.",
    "UGREEN also has accessories that expand the capabilities of Apple\u2019s devices. Take its Active Capacitive Stylus Pen for iPad for example. This stylus will help you take notes and draw on your tablet with fine detail you\u2019d struggle to achieve with touch input, and it even supports palm rejection, so you can use it more comfortably.",
    "UGREEN\u2019s USB hubs really give you options. You\u2019ll find hubs for MacBooks and iPads. With them, you won\u2019t be stuck with just a couple USB-C ports. UGREEN\u2019s hubs can turn a single port into several different types of ports. The 5-in-1 USB-C Hub for iPad Pro takes the tablet\u2019s one port and converts it into two USB-A ports, a full-size HDMI port for 4K 60Hz video output, a headphone jack, and another USB-C port with support for 100W charging. For even more ports and flexibility, UGREEN\u2019s 6-in-1 USB C Adapter with 4K HDMI can also help out. UGREEN sells a similar hub for the MacBook as well as an impressive 9-in-1 USB-C Hub that can help turn a MacBook into a true workstation that\u2019ll connect to a handful of peripherals, external storage, and desktop monitors all at once.",
    "So, once you\u2019ve grabbed the latest Apple devices and are looking for accessories with higher-cost performance to help you take them to the next level, make sure you check out the quality accessories available from UGREEN along with their 20% discount using coupon code \u201c3SAEVENT20\u201d, and keep up with the latest from UGREEN on Facebook."
