    "We're really in the thick of the Labor Day furniture sales now as multiple retailers have considerable discounts on various fixtures, fittings and more for the inside and outside of your home. To give you some ideas, we've picked out a few standout deals from the major stores below. You can also peruse everything that's reduced by the highlighted retailers for even more bargains.",
    "So, what deals can you find in the Labor Day sales?",
    "Well, with the warmer summer months drawing to a close, expect to find discounted patio furniture to feature heavily in the sales as retailers look to shift remaining stock in this year\u2019s styles. You can snag this Cloverbrooke 4-Piece Outdoor Conversation set for $1399.99 That's a saving of $700 and will set you up for some epic garden parties next year.",
    "However, if it\u2019s the inside of your home that needs a bit of a makeover then everything from sofas and comfy armchairs to dining tables and lamps is all featured in the Labor Day furniture sales. We've seen this Brayden Modular Sofa & Chaise for $702.99 at Wayfair. Previously it was almost $3000, so you're getting a massive 76% off in the sale.",
    "You might even be able to find a cheap bed frame to pair with one of the many Labor Day mattress sales that are already live to really set yourself up for the best night's sleep ever. Why not complete the look with this South Shore Sazena Floating Nightstand for less than $60 (was $114).",
    "Overall, it\u2019s a particularly good time of year if you\u2019re looking to splash some cash and spruce up all areas of your home as many end-of-summer items get put on sale at the likes of Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot and Wayfair.",
    "Below, you'll find all the very best Labor Day furniture deals for 2021. You can click through to your favourite store and browse everything they've got on offer for the rest of the day to create the home of your dreams.",
    "Well, you're already making a great start by being on this very page as right here we'll be bringing you all the best Labor Day furniture sales as and when we spot them during the sale period. You can have a browse through all the offers in the retailer list above.",
    "On the big day, you'll want to pay close attention to the clearance sales on a lot of outdoor furniture and goods. Now that those warm summer evenings are sadly behind many of us, stores will be looking to shift any remaining stock on patio furniture and other outdoor goods so it isn't clogging their warehouses until next year. That means some serious bargains should be up for grabs.",
    "Stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot could be the best places to look as you can also take advantage of free shipping on orders over $45. Not an unreasonable target to hit if you're buying particularly substantial items and that saving on the shipping cost can make the deal even sweeter.",
    "You'll find that most stores end their Labor Day sale at midnight on September 7 - that's the Tuesday. Although many start offering a few discounts earlier than Labor Day itself, there's usually very little that follows. Sure, some stores may keep a few deals live until the end of the week, but the bulk will be gone.",
    "If you've been eyeing a bargain today, then, make sure you get that purchase in before the end of the day. There's a good chance it'll be gone by the time you check tomorrow!",
    "We're also rounding up all the latest Labor Day appliance sales for more kitchen-focused discounts. Or check out our roundups of the best Labor Day Lowe's sales and Best Buy Labor Day sales."
