    "Smartwatches are useful for a lot of things, from tracking your activity and sleep to getting notification alerts and \u2013 of course \u2013 checking the time. One thing they\u2019re not so useful for is web browsing, and yet you can now do exactly that on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.",
    "Samsung has made its Samsung Internet browser available for its Wear OS smartwatches (meaning the Galaxy Watch 4 range), so you can browse from your wrist on a tiny screen.",
    "In fairness, it\u2019s not a complete disaster. We tried it on a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and the text on pages is readable, and thanks to gesture controls scrolling around them isn\u2019t a complete nightmare. On the Classic model, the rotating bezel means you can scroll through a webpage at speed, but this physical feature isn't present on the non-Classic watch.",
    "There\u2019s also a zoom mode, which zooms in on the bit of the page you\u2019re viewing, and shortcuts to add the page to your bookmarks or open it in Samsung Internet on your phone.",
    "It is however quite clunky, especially for inputting text, and we can\u2019t envisage many scenarios where anyone would want to web-browse on their watch. We suppose if you don\u2019t have your phone with you (but are still connected to the internet through Wi-Fi or through having an LTE model) then it could occasionally come in handy, but it definitely seems niche.",
    "Still, it\u2019s there if you want it, and in fairness you can already get a web browser on Samsung\u2019s older Tizen smartwatches, so this isn\u2019t a new idea for Samsung.",
    "We might have sounded a bit down on the Samsung Internet browser, but while this won\u2019t be super useful for most people it\u2019s nice to see Samsung bringing more features to the Galaxy Watch 4 range post launch.",
    "We\u2019d like to see this continue, so the wearable continues to feel fresh for longer. Especially because Google has a patchy history with adding new features to Wear OS itself, so we might need Samsung to do some of the heavy lifting here.",
    "Plus, as useful as smartwatches now are, they still aren\u2019t the essential devices that smartphones are, and there\u2019s a sense that developers are still trying to get the most out of them. So hopefully Samsung keeps experimenting and keeps adding features. They won\u2019t all be hits, but some are sure to be.",
