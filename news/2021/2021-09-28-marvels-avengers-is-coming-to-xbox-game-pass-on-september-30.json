    "Marvel\u2019s Avengers developer Crystal Dynamics has announced that its ambitious superhero game is coming to Xbox Game Pass on September 30 for Xbox consoles, PC and via Xbox Cloud Gaming.",
    "Marvel\u2019s Avengers on Xbox Game Pass includes the full game and all previously released content, post-launch heroes, and expansions. That means you can prepare to fight for Wakanda in the Black Panther: War for Wakanda expansion.",
    "But that\u2019s not all. Any future content and expansions featuring new heroes, missions and expansions will be added to Marvel\u2019s Avengers on Xbox Game Pass, so you\u2019ll always be playing the most up-to-date version of the game.",
    "Marvel\u2019s Avengers joins the plethora of other Xbox games in supporting Xbox Smart Delivery, which means that players who own the Xbox One version will be able to upgrade to the Xbox Series X/S version at no extra cost. The next-gen version of Marvel\u2019s Avengers features higher framerates and a better resolution than the Xbox One version.",
    "Even though Marvel\u2019s Avengers appearance on Xbox Game Pass will be a huge boon for the game\u2019s player base, there\u2019s still no plan for Xbox, or any other platform, to receive the upcoming Spider-Man DLC other than PlayStation consoles. The Spider-Man DLC will be an \u201cevent\u201d according to Crystal Dynamics\u2019 Dan Matlack, which features its own cutscenes and story. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get some more information on whether this PlayStation exclusive content will come to other platforms, but we wouldn\u2019t count on it.",
    "Additionally, players of Marvel\u2019s Avengers on Xbox Game Pass will have to buy the digital-only Endgame Edition separately if they want to receive the eight cosmetic items that are tied to that edition.",
    "Marvel\u2019s Avengers was also recently added to PS Now, Sony\u2019s subscription service that lets you download and stream PS4, PS2, and PS3 games, though the latter cannot be downloaded. Unfortunately, though, it was only the PS4 version of the game, as PlayStation Now doesn\u2019t include any PS5 titles as of yet \u2013 something that we hope will change in the future."
