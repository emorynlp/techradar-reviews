  "article": [
    "Outriders, the freshly-released sci-fi looter shooter, can\u2019t be paused in single-player by design \u2013 but it can if you have an Nvidia graphics card, using what\u2019s essentially a workaround.",
    "The scoop here is that, as you\u2019re no doubt aware if you picked up Outriders over the weekend, the game allows for up to three player co-op, but even if you\u2019re going lone wolf, the single-player is still an always-online experience \u2013 meaning that you can\u2019t pause it. If you want to grab a drink, or have a loo break, or quickly answer the door, you must find a suitable corner of the map to hide in and hope you aren\u2019t attacked\u2026",
    "However, this isn\u2019t the case if you have an Nvidia GPU, because then you can invoke Nvidia Ansel \u2013 the fancy screenshot (or \u2018photo mode\u2019) feature \u2013 to come to your rescue, as Outriders supports this functionality.",
    "As a denizen of Reddit, Aced-Bread, points out (spotted by PC Gamer), hitting the key combo (Alt+F2) for Ansel to swing into action dumps you into the photo mode, where you can make a plethora of image adjustments with filters and suchlike \u2013 but crucially, the game is paused to let you do all this.",
    "Ansel, by the way, is part of Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Experience, so if you haven\u2019t installed the latter, and are running with just Nvidia\u2019s bare graphics driver, you obviously won\u2019t have it enabled.",
    "Incidentally, in case you were wondering: yes, Ansel works even if you are playing multiplayer with other folks, but the game session won\u2019t be paused in this scenario \u2013 it\u2019ll carry on while you\u2019re doing your image manipulation stuff.",
    "Naturally, there are still plenty of gamers out there who think that Outriders should just have a straightforward pause feature that works off-the-bat if you\u2019re engaging in single-player. But this workaround is certainly better than nothing, and has led to more than a few statements of \u2018finally a use for Ansel\u2019. Although obviously it doesn\u2019t help AMD graphics card owners (or console players for that matter).",
    "As you may have seen, Outriders got off to something of a shaky start with some server-related and crossplay issues, and various bugs on PC including crashing and stuttering with DX12, but the developer has been commendably upfront in the ongoing process of dealing with these. Hopefully we can expect a resolution to these problems sooner rather than later, particularly those frustrating server niggles..."
