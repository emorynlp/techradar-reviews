    "Xbox Series X restock dates in the US at GameStop, Best Buy, Microsoft and Target don't happen often, but the proven best opportunity to buy the console is with our 24/7 Xbox restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider, who will send you an alert when it's in stock \u2013 if you follow his Twitter account and turn on notifications.",
    "Matt has helped over 57,500 people buy a next-gen console through his Twitter alerts, all for MSRP or in a GameStop bundle in which the price is face value for everything. There are even a few secrets at Target and the Microsoft store he'll tell you about.",
    "\u25ba When is Xbox restock? Follow our Xbox Series X restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider and turn on notifications for live restock news. It's the fastest way to get Xbox restock updates.",
    "\u25ba Don't buy from other Twitter users \u2013 which are all scams. Only buy from the US stores Matt alerts you about. No one will legitimately sell Xbox Series X for just $550.",
    "Click on this last major Xbox Series X restock date, when Best Buy had the $499 Xbox console for sale at MSRP this past week. It won't be in stock today, July 18, but an alert will be sent in case any US retailers surprise us.",
    "The Best Buy Xbox Series X has been happening weekly for one month with the exception of the short 4th of July holiday which only one retailer in the US, Target, had a restock of the new Microsoft Xbox console. That's why Best Buy has suddenly become the most popular retailer for Xbox Series X stock \u2013 it's consistent. Note: it has done weekly restocks before and then skipped six weeks in a row in 2021, so it's never guaranteed at Best Buy anymore.",
    "Unfortunately, every Xbox Series X restock has been on a different date and time in the last month. Thursday and Friday used to be popular with Best Buy, it has shifted to Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday during the latest restock cycle, and the time has extended from 9:38am to 6:05pm \u2013 so basically the whole day.",
    "That's why our Xbox Series X restock alerts have become so crucial for people.",
    "The GameStop Xbox Series X restock strategy is all over the place, with the last major online inventory launching back on May 26 (alongside a big PS5 restock opportunity). There have been other Xbox restock events since that date: on June 16 we saw the first and only major in-store restock at retailer stores \u2013 GameStop or otherwise \u2013 in 2021; on June 23, we saw an Xbox All Access bundle go live; and this past Thursday, July 15, the retailer briefly bundled the Xbox Series X console with an extra blue Xbox controller, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and $20 gift card and F1 2021.",
    "We're hoping for more \u2013 and better \u2013 Xbox Series X GameStop bundles in the near future, as the game retailer keeps trying different things with its Xbox inventory. And, of course, we'll be there with Twitter alerts.",
    "The official Microsoft Store hasn't had a major restock in the US months through its website. Instead, the company is diverting some of Xbox Series X inventory to a pilot program designed to help its most loyal Xbox fans get the new Series X console.",
    "The Xbox Insiders Xbox Series X upgrade plan, first discovered by Bradon Hofer over at Gaming Target, is actually a great incentive for people who want to beta test dashboard tweaks and other system updates that Microsoft is developing for its consoles. And if you're stuck testing things out on an old Xbox One and wanting to upgrade to the new Xbox Series X, really you should be the first in line.",
    "Note: you'll need to power up your old Xbox One console in order to log into this particular Xbox Insiders menu. You access it online, nor can you find the menu on an Xbox Series X. This prevents Xbox Series X owners from ordering a second console from their brand new system.",
    "The last Walmart Xbox Series X restock date had some good news attached to it, and so did some of the most recent Best Buy restock dates: the Microsoft console was in stock for anywhere from 14 minutes (at Walmart on July 1) to 29 minutes (on June 24 and June 29) at Best Buy. Costco also had an Xbox bundle with a pricey SSD that stayed in stock for an entire weekend.",
    "Why is that important? Well, if the Xbox Series X Walmart restock is this week, Thursday at either 2:30pm EDT or 3pm EDT (it's overdue), it may just sit there as demand shrank in June and July. We just need a restock opportunity to happen at MSRP.",
    "Every morning Target has the Xbox Series X in stock at random stores to be bought online (no, you cannot buy the Xbox in stores in the US at this time). The problem is that it's hard to issue Twitter alerts when it's usually select stores in a city and there are as few as five consoles as part of the Xbox restock.",
    "Target has switched from a nationwide restock date to offering the Xbox Series X at a local level (again only to be bought online buy picked up in stores) and it has the Xbox consoles for sale as they come in every morning.",
    "Stores like Walmart and GameStop often restock the Xbox Series X through the Xbox All Access bundle, which works a lot like a smartphone plan. You pay for the console over time, but you're also signed up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which is actually something you should look into buying alongside an Xbox anyway).",
    "After 24 months, you save a couple of dollars with this Xbox Series X plan, but you're on the hook being required to pay for it for two years.",
    "The Xbox Series X restock news continues to be a mixed bag. The console is readily available when there's a restock, but retailers in the US haven't made the new Xbox for sale except for a few restock dates in late June and the first half of July. Demand has fallen, but so has supply. At first, it may be difficult to buy Xbox Series X once things do become steady again (as more demand piles up), but as soon as those pent-up needs are met, it will just sit there in stock again, according to our analysis."
