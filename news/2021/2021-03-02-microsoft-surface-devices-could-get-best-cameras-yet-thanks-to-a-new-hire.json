    "Microsoft's upcoming Surface devices could be looking at a hefty camera upgrade thanks to its latest hire, a former Lumia photography lead. Ari Partinen also helped out Apple with its smartphones \u2013 the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 \u2013 so he has plenty of experience.",
    "In a tweet Ari Partinen said he\u2019s joined the Microsoft Surface imaging team, but we aren\u2019t 100% sure what this means yet for any upcoming tech. Our best guess is that he could be improving the webcam capabilities of Surface Laptop products, given the rise of home working that the Covid-19 pandemic has seen in across the world.",
    "Partinen is also likely lending a hand to improve the imaging capabilities of the more compact Surface devices, too, like the Surface Duo \u2013 because that was one area in which we felt the current model was lacking.",
    "Just don\u2019t expect any camera improvements for Surface devices too soon. As he\u2019s only a recent hire, we don\u2019t expect Partinen\u2019s expertise to impact devices for at least six months to a year, at least not from a hardware perspective.",
    "According to a 2018 survey by Statista, camera quality was the fifth most important phone feature to consumers, with 86% saying it was something they considered when buying a smartphone.",
    "For the Surface Duo, which blends the line between phone and computer, the camera quality is definitely something Microsoft would do well to address if they want to win more people over.",
    "When it comes to more traditional laptops, webcams are essential for conducting business from home, so an improvement in that department could win over anyone who's thinking about buying a Surface Laptop.",
    "Only time will tell how much of an impact Partinen will have on Microsoft Surface cameras, but we\u2019re eager to see what changes he\u2019ll bring."
