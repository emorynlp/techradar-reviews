  "article": [
    "The long rumoured Sky television set, the Sky Glass, has finally been revealed. With all of the best bits of Sky Q built in, the TV range comes in three sizes, each offering 4K quantum dot displays, with a broad range of HDR support and built-in Dolby Atmos sound systems and voice control.",
    "It\u2019s an all-in-one TV package quite unlike any other that\u2019s come before it \u2013 and that includes the way you purchase the sets.",
    "Launching on October 18, not only do you have three screen sizes to choose from (a \u2018Small\u2019 43-incher, a \u2018Medium\u2019 55-incher and a \u2018Large\u2019 65-incher) but you\u2019ve also got the choice of buying the TV outright, having it subsidised against the cost of a monthly fee as you would a phone contract, and also a wide array of TV channel packages that you can bolt on top.",
    "It could get a bit confusing, so let this Sky Glass TV pre-order guide walk you through how to pick the right set up for you ahead of that October 18 release date.",
    "At present, Sky is not taking any orders or deposits on Sky Glass TV sets. However, it is allowing interested customers to \u2018pre-register\u2019 their interest in the new televisions. You\u2019ll then be on the list for the latest news and ordering information as they become available.",
    "It\u2019s a simple process \u2013 just head over to the Sky Glass pre-registering page. You\u2019ll be asked for your first and last name, email address and phone number. Pop them in and you\u2019ll be first to know when the Sky Glass TV goes on sale.",
    "After having a read of our hands on Sky Glass TV review, the first decision you\u2019ll have to make is for what screen size you\u2019re looking to purchase.",
    "If you\u2019re after the 43-inch models, they can be purchased outright for \u00a3649, or on a 48-month contract at \u00a313 a month. That works out at a total cost of \u00a3624.",
    "For the 55-inch model, you can buy one for \u00a3849, or \u00a317 a month on a 48 month contract. That contract\u2019s the equivalent of \u00a3816.",
    "Finally, the 65-inch version will be sold for \u00a31049, or \u00a321 a month on a 48 month contract. That monthly fee will cost \u00a31008 by the end of the contract term.",
    "With all the contract options, shorter contracts of 24 months can be negotiated in return for a higher monthly outlay (43-inch, \u00a326pm, \u00a3644 total / 55-inch, \u00a334pm, \u00a3836 total / 65-inch, \u00a342pm, \u00a31028 total).",
    "All contracts also include a one-off, upfront fee \u2013 \u00a320 for 24 month contracts, and \u00a310 for 48 month contracts.",
    "Remember though that all purchases currently must be paired with a Sky TV subscription package, so factor that cost in too \u2013 more on those next.",
    "After that, you\u2019ve then got the option to customise the screen\u2019s aluminium casing in one of five colors \u2013 blue, green, pink, white or black. Remote controls will be offered in matching colors, while a range of magnetic front plates with various patterns will also eventually be offered at an additional cost.",
    "With the two year minimum commitment on the subscription purchase options proving more affordable than the outright purchases, Sky is obviously banking on you splashing the cash with its TV packages and raking the cash in that way. There are some affordable options here, but the most fun stuff here is inevitably locked behind the more expensive tiers.",
    "The basic package is the \u2018Sky Ultimate TV\u2019 bundle. This throws together Sky\u2019s entertainment channels and TV boxsets in with a Netflix subscription for \u00a326 a month. It\u2019s great for binge TV watchers.",
    "If you\u2019re after Sky\u2019s very extensive sports programming that includes loads of Premier League football, golf, cricket and motorsports action, that\u2019s an additional \u00a325 a month. If you want access to the sports content that rival provider BT Sports offer, that\u2019s another \u00a324. With that, combined with the Sky stuff, that\u2019ll be basically all televised paid-for sporting content, aside from what Amazon Prime Video offers.",
    "The best-value add-on is the Sky Cinema bolt on, which costs an extra \u00a311 a month. Sky has a great catalogue of movies from across the ages, and excellent on demand movie boxset packages too, collating complete series of popular movie franchises.",
    "If you\u2019ve got kids running around, you can add the Sky Kids programming, with lots of exclusive characters your little-ones will recognise, for an extra \u00a35 a month.",
    "Perhaps the most cheeky part of Sky\u2019s pricing options is that 4K HDR TV content, and Dolby Atmos options, are locked behind an additional \u00a35 per month add-on, the \u2018Sky Ultra HDR and Dolby Atmos pack.\u2019 That feels quite cynical, but will be needed to get the most out of the content you\u2019re watching.",
    "All packages are sold on a 31-day rolling contract, letting you adjust them on a near-monthly basis as your finances allow.",
    "So what if you\u2019ve already got a TV that you\u2019re in love with, but still want to get Sky Glass\u2019s feature set? Well, at present, whatever happens you\u2019re going to need to buy a Sky Glass TV \u2013 but there is a package that will let you additionally add the features to another TV set in your home.",
    "For an extra \u00a310 a month, you can upgrade to the \u201cWhole Home\u201d package, which offers up the Sky Stream Puck. This box, connecting to your old TV over HDMI, will bring all the software features of Sky Glass to your television \u2013 but, obviously, won\u2019t magically add Dolby Atmos surround sound or built-in microphones to your old TV set. Think of it like Sky\u2019s equivalent to a streaming stick, though sadly it\u2019s not currently set to be sold separately, hence the requirement to still sign up for one of the Sky Glass TV offers. Each Puck costs a one-off \u00a350 fee."
