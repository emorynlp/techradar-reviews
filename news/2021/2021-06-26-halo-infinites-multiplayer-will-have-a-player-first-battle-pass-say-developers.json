    "Following its unveiling at E3 2021, 343 Industries has gone into more detail on Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer, explaining the thinking behind its seasonal structure, its Battle Passes and the title of its first season: Heroes of Reach.",
    "In a recent Inside Infinite blog post on Halo Waypoint, Live Team Design Director, Ryan Paradis, and Lead Progression Designer, Christopher Blohm, revealed that Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer seasons will have a quarterly structure, with a new season kicking off \u201croughly every three months... with a ton of updates, new gameplay content, new events, new systems, new customizations, new progressions.\u201d",
    "The reason for this three-monthly refresh is, according to Paradis, \u201cbecause it gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore the Seasonal content, without it getting tiresome and without constantly pulling the rug from under players.\u201d Adding to this, Blohm said, \u201cwe do not want to demand that players play a ton of hours every week of the season to complete everything. We want players having fun in Halo, not grind it like it\u2019s a job.\u201d",
    "343 Industries is making it pretty clear that it wants to avoid forcing players to grind with its seasonal structure, which seems to feed into its plans for Halo Infinite\u2019s Battle Pass. It was confirmed in the initial multiplayer reveal that the game's Battle Passes won\u2019t expire and Paradis expands on this, explaining that 343 Industries wants to be \u201cplayer-first\u201d with Halo Infinite\u2019s Battle Passes.",
    "\u201cSeason 1 Battle Pass will be around forever; you can always go back, select that as your active Battle Pass and continue to earn progress in it,\u201d Paradis says, \u201cIf you decided to take a Season off, or you simply didn\u2019t have time to play, that\u2019s fine. You can always go back and purchase any prior Battle Pass as well. Additionally, our passes will always include various free rewards in addition to the premium track. This goes back to a few pillars of ours: Provide unambiguous value and maintain that player-first focus.\u201d",
    "The idea behind permanent Battle Passes is that it will remove the grind and sense of obligation to play that can sometimes arise with timed-access. \u201cWe want it to be a supplemental reward stream for the time you were already putting into the game,\u201d Paradis explains, \u201cI for one can\u2019t stand it when I\u2019m playing a game JUST to complete the Battle Pass \u2013 it feels like a chore to me.\u201d",
    "As the game doesn't have a firm release date we don\u2019t know when exactly multiplayer's seasons will begin but the Halo Waypoint blog also revealed that the first season will be titled \"Heroes of Reach\". Head of Creative for Halo Infinite, Joseph Staten, explains that 343 Industries has \u201ca goal to deeply root your Multiplayer character in the larger Halo universe and give them a vital, active role in the Halo story moving forward.\u201d",
    "How this will work over the course of the game\u2019s seasons isn\u2019t detailed but Staten adds that \u201cHeroes of Reach\u201d was picked as the first season\u2019s theme for \u201cvery specific reasons\u201d, explaining, \u201cReach has a rich history; it\u2019s a key location for Spartans of old and a focal point for a new generation of Spartans preparing to wrestle with the perils and mysteries of a galaxy that has fundamentally changed after the events of Halo 5.\u201d The first season, then, \u201ctakes place at a transformational moment in Halo history\u2014at the pivot point from one generation of heroes to the next\u201d and, Staten adds, \u201cyour Multiplayer hero is waiting just offstage, geared up for battle and ready to spring into action.\u201d",
    "This information follows on from the Halo Infinite multiplayer deep-dive which took place earlier in June. Over the course of a twelve-minute video and accompanying blog post, 343 Industries introduced players to Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer and gave them a broad overview of what they can expect from it. If you missed that overview, you can watch it for yourself below:",
    "Halo Infinite doesn\u2019t have a release date just yet but it is still slated to launch in Holiday 2021 on Xbox and PC. Very recently, amid concerns that the release date might slip again, Head of Xbox Phil Spencer clarified that Halo Infinite release window has been narrowed down to \u201ca few weeks\u201d, and that both Microsoft and 343 Industries are confident about hitting the Holiday 2021 window."
