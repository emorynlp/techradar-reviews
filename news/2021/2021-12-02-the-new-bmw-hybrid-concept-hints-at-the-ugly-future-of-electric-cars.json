    "Another day, another questionable electric car design. This week, it\u2019s BMW\u2019s latest plug-in hybrid (PHEV) concept, the XM, under the spotlight.",
    "Supposedly based on the existing BMW X7, the XM is the German manufacturer's upcoming coupe-SUV. It\u2019ll be the flagship model in BMW\u2019s M performance division, and is expected to hit showrooms as early as next year.",
    "The brand says the XM SUV will sport an impressive 740bhp PHEV powertrain, an \u201cemotionally-rich\u201d sound and stand tall as \u201cthe first pure BMW M model since the legendary M1\u201d \u2013 which is all well and good, if those credentials weren't undercut by its appearance.",
    "Look, we\u2019re all for innovation here at TechRadar, but the XM SUV is the sort of brutish, boxy ride that Megatron would choose to transform into \u2013 and unfortunately, it\u2019s rather symbolic of the uninspired future of electric car design in general.",
    "There\u2019s no doubt that both electric and hybrid automotive technology has come on leaps and bounds in recent years. Battery-powered cars are faster, cleaner and cheaper than ever before, and many major automakers have committed to converting their entire vehicle fleets into electric equivalents as soon as 2025.",
    "Legislation now passed in many different countries will soon prohibit the sale and manufacture of traditional combustion engines, too, leaving many drivers with no option but to seriously consider the switch to four greener wheels.",
    "Why, then, are these cars so homogeneous in appearance? There seems to be a conscious effort on the part of designers to reflect the futuristic nature of an electric car\u2019s internal wizardry with a spaceship-like exterior that lacks any sort of personality.",
    "Sure, more outlandish projects like the Tesla Cybertruck are deliberately robotic in design, but consumer-facing cars like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Toyota bZ4X, Subaru Solterra, Polestar 2 and now BMW XM seem so aesthetically-banal that it makes you wish these manufacturers had just plonked an electric battery inside their existing combustion models.",
    "Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder \u2013 there is no doubt that some will warm to this decidedly cold vehicular direction. And make no mistake, there have been some darn pretty electric cars in recent times (the Mercedes EQS and Audi e-tron GT come to mind).",
    "But it\u2019s a shame to see a brand like BMW ditch its angel-eyed heritage for an electric aesthetic that seems intentionally minimalist and lacking in any unique features beyond a comically-large front grill.",
    "Perhaps, though, the aversion to this new direction in vehicle design simply mimics the scepticism towards every new automotive trend in years past. Long bonnets were all the rage back in the 1930s, wheel size ballooned at the turn of the last century and carbon fibre has meant today\u2019s most expensive cars appear more like fighter jets than traditional roadsters.",
    "Maybe, then, we\u2019ll come to love rather than loathe this electric spaceship circus. These models are, after all, the future of motoring \u2013 and nobody likes being stuck in the past."
