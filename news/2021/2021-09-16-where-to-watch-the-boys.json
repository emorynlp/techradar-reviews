    "If you're looking for a different take on the superhero genre, you may well have come across The Boys. Based on the comic book by Garth Ennis and Danick Robertson, it\u2019s a subversive and satirical take on the superhero genre.",
    "The Boys is set in a world where superheroes have become a corporate product, marketed and monetized by the powerful Vought International. Vought\u2019s main superhero team is the Seven.",
    "Though they put on heroic public personas, they are arrogant and nasty people, especially their leader, the narcissistic Homelander, played by Antony Starr. A rival group, The Boys, challenges Vought\u2019s corruption and is led by Karl Urban\u2019s character, Billy Butcher.",
    "The Boys has been praised for its cynical and edgy take on the genre - it\u2019s less family-friendly than your typical superhero movie and has fun with that.",
    "It also has an impressive mix of socially relevant themes and superpowered action. There are currently two seasons of The Boys available, with a third on the way. In this article, we\u2019ll explain where you can watch The Boys.",
    "Though Prime Video is the only place that you can stream both seasons of The Boys, some outlets have the first season available as a one-off purchase.",
    "In the US, you can buy the first season from Vudu. In the UK, you can buy Season 1 from Google Play for \u00a314.99 or from Sky Store for \u00a317.99. In Canada, Season 1 costs $17.99 on Google Play. In Australia, The Boys Season 1 is available for $17.99 from Google Play or $19.99 from Telstra.",
    "If you find yourself abroad in a country but want to watch Amazon Prime as if you were at home, that's probably down to geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "Thankfully, help is at hand. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite show no matter where you are, simply by changing your IP address to one that's back in your country of residence. Here's how to get started with this essential bit of streaming software.",
