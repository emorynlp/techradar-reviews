    "Ahead of Battlefield 2042\u2019s release later this month, EA DICE has shed some light on its post-launch plans for the game.",
    "In a recent blog post on the official Battlefield site, EA says that Battlefield 2042\u2019s launch is \u201conly the beginning\u201d, adding that it\u2019s \u201ctaking a new approach to live service\u201d with \u201ca commitment to new content\u201d as well as \u201ca goal of enhancing the Battlefield experience through seasons that will continue to evolve the world\u201d of the game.",
    "The post confirms that Battlefield 2042\u2019s first season won\u2019t begin until 2022. An exact date isn\u2019t given but when it does start, players can apparently expect \u201ca new Specialist, Battle Pass and Portal content, and maybe even some new sights to see as the story of Battlefield 2042 continues to unfold\u201d.",
    "The post isn\u2019t forthcoming on anything more specific than that in relation to season one but it does say that there will be more details released \u201cearly next year\u201d. In the meantime, when the game launches this month, players will be able to take part in a pre-season. This will involve weekly missions and rewards, as well as limited time modes and \u201cexperiences in Battlefield Portal.\u201d",
    "While Battlefield 2042\u2019s first season doesn\u2019t begin until 2022, EA has the game\u2019s first year of live service content planned. Across that year, there will be four seasons in all, \u201cwith four Battle Passes, four new Specialists, and new locations along with more fresh content.\u201d EA also promises continued updates for Battlefield Portal which it says will \u201cgive players more ways to build and share new Battlefield experiences with the world.\u201d",
    "So, now that you know when you\u2019ll start playing Battlefield 2042\u2019s first season it might be a good idea to find out when you can actually start playing the game full stop. Well, it's now possible to pre-load Battlefield 2042 on all platforms but there are a couple of different dates for when you'll actually be able to start playing it.",
    "The official launch date for the standard edition of the game on all platforms\u2014that\u2019s PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and PC\u2014is November 19 2021. However, EA Play Pro subscribers and those that have pre-ordered the Gold or Ultimate Editions of the game will be able to get early access from November 12. These editions also come with a Year 1 Pass which gives access to those four seasons of live service content we\u2019ve mentioned above.",
    "For those who aren\u2019t sure whether they want to commit to a pre-order but aren\u2019t against trying Battlefield 2042 ahead of its release date, there will also be a 10 hour free trial available to Xbox Game Pass and standard EA Play subscribers starting on November 12. Once your ten hours of playtime are up you\u2019ll need to buy the game to keep playing and if it\u2019s not yet November 19, you\u2019ll need to pay for the Gold or Ultimate Editions if you want to keep enjoying that early access."
