    "Prime Day deals are just around the corner, with Amazon's 48-hour savings event kicking off on Monday, June 21. While we expect the biggest offers to sit on Echo devices and other Amazon-owned brands, however, Prime Day lightning deals also offer some of the most lucrative savings on the site. The trick is getting there in time.",
    "Amazon's lightning deals consist of incredibly time-limited flash sales but generally slash prices way below what you'd usually find on a regular discount. Discounts usually run on timers of between 1 and 12 hours or in limited quantities (in which case you'll simply see a percentage of the products that have already been claimed). These savings typically hit lesser-known brands or cheaper value items on a day-to-day basis, but Prime Day lightning deals are far more likely to hit bigger items.",
    "That means you'll want to keep a close eye on these short-term sales when the main event kicks off next week, and we're telling you everything you need to know about making the most of these offers right here.",
    "Amazon Prime Day lightning deals will be landing during the entire 48-hour sales window, which means you'll need to keep a close eye on the site for the biggest savings. Below, you'll find our top tips for making sure you never miss an offer.",
    "Lightning deals typically center around smaller products like smart home devices, PC accessories, small kitchen appliances, and smartwatches. While brands are typically less well known, bigger names like Samsung, Lego, Nike, and Marvel have been known to run lightning deals on Amazon. Over Prime Day, we tend to see more of these big brand lightning deals, which means you can look forward to a range of tech and home items this year.",
    "The smart home category is usually a big winner for Amazon during this sales period, though, so we do expect to see more smart bulbs, robot vacuum cleaners, RGB light strips, and other Alexa-enabled devices landing in the lightning deals category. However, you may also find items like headphones and smartwatches offering some bigger brand items as well.",
