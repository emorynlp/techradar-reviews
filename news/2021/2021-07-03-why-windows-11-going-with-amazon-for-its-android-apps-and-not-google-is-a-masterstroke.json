    "One of the biggest surprises of the Windows 11 launch event was the announcement that Android apps are coming to the new Microsoft Store... but through Amazon.",
    "While the decision was praised, it\u2019s also been met with some trepidation and puzzlement, leaving people wondering why there hasn\u2019t just been an arrangement made with Google itself.",
    "The redesigned Microsoft Store on Windows 11 is very welcome, but users will have far less Android apps to choose from, compared to the amount that\u2019s available on Google\u2019s own Play Store.",
    "With this in mind, here\u2019s why this decision may have come to Amazon\u2019s Store instead.",
    "Google announced recently that it is changing the format for Android apps, called APK, and moving to a new format from August called the \u2018Android App Bundle\u2019, or AAB.",
    "When you download an app from Google\u2019s Play Store for your Android device, it uses the \u2018.APK\u2019 naming convention, similar to how you install an app on Windows as \u2018.exe\u2019, or \u2018.DMG\u2019 on Apple\u2019s macOS operating system.",
    "However, this new type of file, according to Google, reduces the size of the app, alongside being able to be signed, which essentially means that Google will be able to track the app from within its Play Store with an \u2018Upload Key\u2019, so it can help recover the app for a developer if something occurs.",
    "This is where I believe Amazon\u2019s App Store on Windows 11 comes in.",
    "For years now, Amazon has had its own Android app store, which enables users of Kindle Fire devices to download apps from Amazon\u2019s own site, and from within the company\u2019s own storefront.",
    "Since the store\u2019s launch in 2011, there are almost 500,000 apps available from Amazon, which seems minimal compared to the millions available on Google\u2019s Play Store.",
    "However, Amazon has total control over this store, so developers that make apps that illegally offer games and apps for free that are otherwise available for a fee are blocked, similar to Apple\u2019s own guidelines.",
    "This, along with Google\u2019s plans for AAB and its plan for signing every app with an upload key, may be why we are seeing Amazon\u2019s store on Windows 11 instead. It helps give focus to what\u2019s available from Amazon\u2019s storefront, and doesn\u2019t flood the new Microsoft Store with copycat apps. More so, it doesn\u2019t require Microsoft to police the apps coming in from Android, as Amazon already does this.",
    "It\u2019s an ingenious move when you think about it. It enables more apps on the new Microsoft Store with minimal effort from Microsoft, and helps it become a substantial rival to Apple\u2019s Mac App Store, with iOS apps now available on M1 Macs.",
    "With extensions being available for Microsoft Edge as well in the Microsoft Store, it\u2019s a fantastic outlet for new and existing users to discover apps they might not have otherwise found before.",
    "There\u2019s already an early version of Windows 11 available to download for testing, but it doesn\u2019t include Android apps at the moment, so we\u2019ll have to wait to see just how successful Microsoft\u2019s inclusion of these mobile apps turns out to be."
