    "Who doesn't love a good board game? Especially at Christmas. There's nothing quite like getting cozy with your family or friends and battling it out on the board. And, right now, you can pick up some of the best board games of all time for less, ahead of Black Friday. Amazon is currently offering a discount on a range of brilliant board games, meaning you can pick up Catan, Ticket to Ride, and Pandemic - plus much more - at a discount right now. (Not in the UK or US? Scroll down for deals in your region)",
    "It's possible we could see these board games, and many more, discounted as part of Black Friday deals. In fact, we could even see these prices drop even further over the official sales period. After all, Catan dropped to $24.72 at Walmart as part of the best board game Black Friday deals in 2020, but the current discount only sees it reduced to $35.20 at Amazon. While Ticket to Ride has dropped to as low as \u00a316 at Amazon UK before but is currently discounted to just \u00a323.21.",
    "What we would advise, then, is to hold out for Black Friday board game deals for the biggest discounts. However, if you want to secure board games for Thanksgiving - or simply don't want to risk waiting for Black Friday - then these deals certainly aren't to be sniffed at.",

    "While Amazon is offering discounts on a range of board games, we've picked out discounts on (what we deem) some of the best board games around. It's worth noting that not all of these titles are necessarily family-friendly, but they're all absolutely worth your time and money.",
    "Our person top picks from the board games currently on offer are Pandemic, Catan and Ticket to Ride: the latter two I picked up on sale myself.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for board games from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
