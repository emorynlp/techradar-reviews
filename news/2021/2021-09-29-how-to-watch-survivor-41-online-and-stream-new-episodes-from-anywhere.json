    "We\u2019ve all become honorary survivalists since Survivor: Winners at War aired last year, thanks to the global pandemic. Perhaps that\u2019s why showrunner and host Jeff Probst has upped the ante for season 41, ushering in \u201ca new era\u201d. This time round, the islanders have fewer resources and rewards, while a truncated filming schedule has resulted in a more brutal pace and frequent evictions.",
    "Probst continues it's, \u201clike the monster in a horror movie. And, if you\u2019re a player, it\u2019s coming for you.\u201d With episodes entitled \u201cJuggling Chainsaws\u201d, we believe him. But that begs the question: who will survive and what will be left of them?",
    "Among the 18 contestants hoping to survive are 20-year-old college student Jairus Robinson, ex-NFL player Danny McCray, and David Voce, a neurosurgeon who\u2019ll be using his brains to endure until the Final Tribal Council.",
    "It\u2019s been touted as a rebirth for Survivor, and we can\u2019t wait to see how this diverse group of individuals overcome this more challenging season. Read on below as we explain how to watch Survivor 41 online and stream new episodes now.",
    "If you\u2019re abroad when Survivor 41 airs, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the show on your usual streaming platform, thanks to annoying regional restrictions.",
