    "When the playoffs get started with a clash between the Yankees and the Red Sox, you know there's something special in store. There's no love lost between these two, and there's much more than bragging rights at stake as they fight for the fourth and final place in the American League Division Series. Read on as we explain how to watch the Yankees vs Red Sox game online and live stream the 2021 MLB Wild Card game from anywhere.",
    "The Sox have home-field advantage, which can make a huge difference in one-off games like this, and you can guarantee the atmosphere at Fenway will be anything but friendly.",
    "The best thing is, these teams were freakishly well-matched during the regular season. They both finished with a 92-70 record, and the Red Sox edged their head-to-head, winning 10 games to the Yanks' 9.",
    "However, it was the Pinstripers who came out on top down the stretch, winning each of their last six encounters. It's an ominous sign for the Red Sox, as Gerrit Cole and Nathan Eovaldi take the mound knowing that defeat means it's all over for the year.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a Yankees fan in New York, a Red Sox fan in Boston or just an MLB follower wanting to watch the baseball at Fenway Park, we\u2019ll show you how to get a high-quality MLB live stream of the Yankees vs Red Sox game.",
    "A VPN is becoming an essential bit of kit for baseball fans for two reasons. Firstly, MLB blackout rules mean that you can't use its otherwise comprehensive MLB.TV streaming service to watch teams within your own market - fine for Yankees fans living in Seattle, not so great for those in the Bronx.",
    "It's a real pain for cord-cutters, but fortunately, VPNs help you get around this by allowing you to relocate your IP address to a different location. This means you can still be sitting in your NYC apartment, but your computer will be rerouted to a server in a different part of the country - thereby allowing you to watch the Yankees (or Mets) just like you would if you had a fancy cable package.",
    "Secondly, if you find yourself abroad at all during the 2021 MLB season, you'll likely find you're unable to access your usual baseball coverage like you would at home. This isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but rather the result of geo-blocking - best understood as digital borders that restrict certain services and content to certain parts of the world.",
