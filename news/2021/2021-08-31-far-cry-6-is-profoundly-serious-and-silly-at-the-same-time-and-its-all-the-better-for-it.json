    "Far Cry 6 is a game of extremes. On the one hand, you\u2019re part of a fearless guerrilla movement known as Libertad \u2013 a band of rebels who are hell-bent on overthrowing the island of Yara\u2019s ruthless dictator, Anton Castillo.",
    "On the other, you\u2019ll be issuing commands to a T-shirt-wearing pet crocodile, singing along to the latest hits on the radio, and firing pirated CDs of Los del Rio\u2019s Macarena at unwitting enemies as you liberate Yara from Castilo\u2019s vice-like grip, one overthrown outpost at a time.",
    "Far Cry 6 is like dipping bacon in peanut butter, then: it shouldn\u2019t work, but the combination of two contrasting flavors complements each other surprisingly well. It\u2019s gravely serious yet delightfully silly at the same time, and it\u2019s the kooky and comical side of Far Cry 6 that resonated with me most during my hands-on time with the game.",
    "Fundamentally, the sixth entry in Ubisoft\u2019s long-running open-world series doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel or offer the type of revolution you\u2019re desperately fighting for in Far Cry 6. Instead, it sticks closely to the tried-and-test formula that epitomizes almost every Far Cry game, which will either delight or prove a turn-off depending on your stance on the franchise.",
    "You\u2019ll still be taking down checkpoints, wrestling key points of interest from the enemy, embarking on countless side-quests, commandeering heavily-armed vehicles, and blowing things to kingdom come in delightfully inventive ways. You can also expect to see a frankly frightening amount of icons on your mini-map, all vying for your attention.",
    "But one thing that stood out after playing Far Cry 6 for more than a few hours is that the game doesn\u2019t hold you back by needlessly restricting the things that you need. In fact, they\u2019re more accessible than ever.",
    "Need a ride? Call one in, and enjoy the complementary machine-gun turret that\u2019s attached to the back. See that checkpoint in the distance? Well, you can jump off a cliff and use a combination of your parachute and wingsuit to get to your objective lickety-split. Want to take out an outpost using stealth or go in wielding a flamethrower? The choice is yours.",
    "Far Cry 6 delivers the type of instant gratification the majority of open-world games have been missing in recent years, and it\u2019s super refreshing as a result. Red Dead Redemption 2 may have the most realistic horses in a video game to date, but Far Cry 6\u2019s unruly stallions are genuinely more exhilarating to ride because they aren\u2019t constrained by the same meticulous standards.",
    "So, even though much of Far Cry 6\u2019s signature brand of entertainment is familiar \u2013 and likely won\u2019t convert those who already aren\u2019t a fan of Ubisoft\u2019s title \u2013 there are some distinct changes to the game\u2019s formula that offer more of an impact than I initially thought.",
    "The first of which is the fact that your protagonist, Dani Rojas, has a face. Yes, as daft as it may sound, I found that being able to see my character in the flesh during the game\u2019s many cutscenes and interactions with the cast of zany characters really helped ground me in Far Cry 6\u2019s tropical world, something that I haven\u2019t felt was the case in previous titles.",
    "This feeling of being connected to your character is strengthened by certain gameplay scenes, too. Whenever you enter specific guerrilla camps or fire off your backpack super (a devastating special move that can wipe out tens of enemies), you\u2019ll see Dani in all their glory.",
    "Far Cry 6 also has a heavy emphasis on customization this time around. Dani can wield, wear and craft countless crude-looking items in Far Cry 6, and you\u2019ll need to use the right tool for the job if you want to really rip Castillo\u2019s forces a new one. From bullet-piercing rounds to providing protection against poisonous gases, or simply equipping a make-do silencer out of an old plastic bottle, tinkering at your worktable to create your next weapon or gear is of paramount importance if you\u2019re to beat the overwhelming odds that stand in your way.",
    "The series\u2019 usual tropes are still alive and well in Far Cry 6, then, but my time in Yara generated more than a few smiles and genuine giggles. Whether it was jumping out of a helicopter to land on a boat teeming with hostiles or simply running away from a frightfully aggressive wild boar that wanted nothing more than to spill my blood, there\u2019s definitely fun to be found in Yara\u2019s twisted paradise.",
    "Far Cry 6 will be released on October 7 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Stadia, and PC."
