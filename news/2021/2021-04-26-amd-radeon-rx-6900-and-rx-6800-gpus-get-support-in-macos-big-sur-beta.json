  "article": [
    "AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 6900 XT, RX 6800 XT and RX 6800 graphics cards are now supported as of the latest macOS Big Sur beta (11.4).",
    "In its version 11.4 release notes, Apple confirmed: \u201cYou can now use graphics cards based on the AMD Navi RDNA2 architecture.\u201d",
    "What does that mean for Mac owners exactly? If you have a Mac Pro, you\u2019re now able to slot in one of these Big Navi GPUs and feel the benefit, as some owners have already done (reporting, for example, some pretty nippy performance levels with Octane X, a rendering suite).",
    "That\u2019s the only Apple computer that can be internally fitted with one of these AMD GPUs, but remember that other Mac owners might use an external GPU (eGPU), a box containing a graphics card which hooks up via a fast Thunderbolt 3 connection to provide much better performance. And now you\u2019ll be able to use these Big Navi cards in an eGPU, which could be a major boon for gamers.",
    "For now, if you want to give it a whirl, you\u2019ll need to install the Big Sur beta, with all the usual caveats that running beta software might entail (things could go wrong, of course, with any pre-release code). Version 11.4 of Big Sur is still in the very early stages, and indeed version 11.3 of the OS still hasn\u2019t been released \u2013 but should be imminently.",
    "Note that the new Macs with Apple\u2019s own M1 chip do not support eGPUs, at least not yet, though that situation may change in the future (or indeed, it may not, as there are certainly folks out there who are skeptical that this will ever happen).",
