    "Job postings can frequently give gaming fans a hint of what\u2019s to come. They teased the return of the Fable franchise from developer Playground Games, and now might have just revealed Microsoft\u2019s answer to AI-based graphical upscaling like Nvidia's DLSS but for Xbox Series X.",
    "AI-based graphical upscaling is a lot of buzzwords to get your head around. What they all mean is that rather than relying solely on a graphics card to output what we see on screen, the power of AI is used to lighten the load. Basically, it means that games can reach higher resolutions, using clever upscaling, without sacrificing performance.",
    "To do this, Xbox plans to leverage \u201cmachine learning to make traditional rendering algorithms more efficient and to provide better alternatives\". What form this could take is yet to be seen, but it\u2019ll likely look similar to Nvidia\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s FidelityFX technology, the latter of which the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S support. However, it could just as likely be something new and unique to Xbox hardware.",
    "If you happen to think that you\u2019re the person to help Microsoft \u201cdelight millions of gamers\u201d with next-level graphics (or if you\u2019re just feeling nosey), you can find the job listings below:",
    "Most often, people will think of DLSS when it comes to AI upscaling. DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling and is a feature found in Nvidia RTX graphics cards. When you need a framerate boost, the GPU starts producing a lower quality image that\u2019s faster to render and then AI adds pixels to upscale the image to your desired quality.",
    "This is all well and good, but what does it mean for your games? Well this method works really well when paired with another technology that\u2019s also become more commonplace: ray tracing.",
    "Ray tracing is an incredibly beautiful, but equally taxing way of rendering light in a game world because you have to calculate so much at once. Even the best GPUs can struggle to hit just 4K at 30FPS (such as the RTX 3080 graphics card). Thanks to DLSS and similar technologies though, players can upscale a lower resolution image to great effect. Just look at this explanation video to see DLSS in action.",
    "We\u2019ll have to wait and see exactly what form Microsoft\u2019s AI upscaling takes when the system launches on Xbox Series X. When we do find out more though, we\u2019ll be sure to update you on everything you\u2019ll need to do to unlock the best gaming experience possible."
