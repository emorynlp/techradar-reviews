  "summary": "Chip shortage is just a \u2018megacycle\u2019 apparently",
  "article": [
    "CEO Lisa Su has again predicted that the supply of AMD\u2019s chips will improve as 2021 rumbles onward, and that the current chip shortage \u2013 which is making its effects felt across the entire tech industry, and not just with AMD\u2019s GPUs and processors \u2013 is just a \u2018megacycle\u2019.",
    "Meaning that while the tech industry in general goes through cycles of increased demand outweighing supply (or vice versa) as a matter of course, this is a particularly pronounced one, in which demand has been massively stoked by the pandemic (spiking hardware sales as a whole load of folks are now working from home rather than going to the office).",
    "This all comes from a Bloomberg report, in which Su observed: \u201cSemiconductors do go through these cycles. There are some times when supply is much greater than demand, and there are some times when demand is much greater than supply. And this particular cycle is special because what we\u2019re seeing is the incredible demand for all things that require chips.\u201d",
    "AMD\u2019s chief executive admitted: \u201cYes, it\u2019s a lot to manage. But I have to tell you, this industry is also really good at managing these things. And you know, it does take a while for the supply and demand imbalance to balance itself out, but we are very much working together as an industry.\u201d",
    "Su is certainly doing her best not to appear fazed by the ongoing component shortage, but of course as AMD\u2019s CEO, that\u2019s what she\u2019s paid to do: stop the boat from any danger of rocking in terms of investors.",
    "Nonetheless, it\u2019s good to hear what seem to be reasonably firm assertions that the situation will improve regarding AMD\u2019s graphics cards and CPUs throughout 2021, and this backs up similar promises we\u2019ve heard from the company recently.",
    "Just a few weeks back, Su very firmly stated that AMD will be ramping up GPU production with the expectation that RX 6000 series graphics card sales will \u2018grow significantly\u2019 as the year progresses.",
    "And on the CPU front, a statement reportedly direct from AMD indicates that incoming new revisions of Ryzen 5000 processors are all about ushering in increased production levels for these chips, rather than revamping them to be faster (as a previous rumor claimed).",
