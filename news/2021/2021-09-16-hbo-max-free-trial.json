  "article": [
    "Newbies to the streaming game almost always offer tasters, and when first launched there was a 7-day HBO Max free trial available for anyone in the US. However, much like Netflix and Disney Plus, now that HBO Max is thoroughly established in the game, this generosity seems to have dried.",
    "That said, HBO Max continues to expand into new territories, making the possibility of a HBO Max free trial for you more likely.",
    "Whether you're in the US or elsewhere, then, we've detailed below how you might be able to get a HBO Max subscription for free, as well as other cheap ways to access HBO Max content and what you can watch with your plan.",
    "From the platform\u2019s launch in the US in May 2020 until early December the same year, the HBO Max free trial was available to help uncertain customers decide whether the fledgling streaming service was for them.",
    "It provided 7 days of complimentary access, not only to Warner Brothers' 100-year-old film library, but iconic HBO series like The Sopranos, and third-party content from the likes of New Line Cinema and Studio Ghibli.",
    "While the HBO Max free trial then disappeared before the release of Wonder Woman 1984, which was made available both in cinemas and through HBO Max, some customers can still benefit from a HBO Max free trial.",
    "Those in the US could still secure access to HBO Max for free if they sign up to one of Cricket Wireless' $60 unlimited plans, with the ad-supported plan thrown in at no extra cost.",
    "It's also worth noting HBO Max has recently launched in Latin America and the Caribbean, where you can benefit from a 7-day HBO Max free trial in order to try out the streaming platform. It might also be the case when HBO Max launches in parts of Europe later in the year, including Spain and Nordic countries.",
    "WarnerMedia's VOD platform certainly was one of the pricier streaming services out there in comparison to the likes of Hulu, Netflix, and Disney Plus. That was until it announced a new plan in June 2021, offering a With Ads plan for $9.99 a month. Depending on what you're after from your HBO Max subscription, this could be a great choice for those on a budget.",
    "While you will have to endure ads while you stream and will miss out on some content, this cheaper HBO Max price still gets you tons of TV shows, movies, and other exclusive titles.",
    "Alternatively, you can pay a monthly rate of $14.99 to get all this without ads in its Ad-Free plan, and also be able to watch brand new WarnerBro releases at home on the same day as their cinematic release at the movies in 2021. You'll also be able to watch titles in 4K as well as HD, and download to watch offline anytime.",
    "You can save money by committing to an annual plan rather than its monthly rate - With Ads will cost you $99.99 a year, while Ad-Free will cost $149.99 a year.",
    "It's worth noting you can significantly reduce that amount, or even get HBO Max for free if you qualify. If you\u2019re subscribed to HBO or HBO Now already, and signed up via one of the providers listed here, then hallelujah! You\u2019ll have absolutely free access to HBO Max, too \u2013 just download the HBO Max app and sign in using your existing details.",
    "Promotions are regularly updated, so check its website for the latest offers.",
    "And while the HBO Max free trial has gone for customers in the US \u2013 for now \u2013 potential subscribers can still check out some of their biggest shows for nothing. Just visit the \u2018Free Episodes\u2019 section of its website to enjoy a small sample of their content: ranging from DC\u2019s Doom Patrol, Game of Thrones, and Euphoria, to Max Originals like Raised by Wolves, Love Life, and The Flight Attendant.",
    "Pure TV gold. It\u2019s got everything HBO ever produced, including critically acclaimed hits like The Wire, Westworld, Six Feet Under, and Sex and The City, while being the exclusive home to immensely popular sitcoms like Friends (and the subsequent Friends: The Reunion), and The Big Bang Theory.",
    "It also hosts films from dozens of major studios. Paramount Pictures, MGM, and Warner Bros all make an appearance, which means viewers can immerse themselves in cinema classics from the Hollywood Golden Age (Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz) all the way up to contemporary blockbusters like 2019\u2019s Joker, and the award-winning animation of Studio Ghibli.",
    "Most exciting is that Warner Brothers 2021 films are all heading to HBO Max day-and-date with their theatrical release \u2013 meaning you won\u2019t have to wait a second to stream mind-blowing new movies like Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune, The Matrix Resurrections, and Godzilla vs. Kong."
