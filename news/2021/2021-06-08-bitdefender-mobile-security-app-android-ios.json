  "article": [
    "Bitdefender doesn\u2019t just make antivirus for computers, but also mobile devices. With Bitdefender Mobile Security, it gives you an app that can be used on both Android and iOS operating systems. Obviously enough, they\u2019re quite different to what you get on a Windows PC or Mac.",
    "So you might be wondering exactly how they differ, and what Bitdefender Mobile Security gives you in terms of protection for your smartphone. Both of these Bitdefender mobile apps have different features, so we\u2019re going to go through what you get with each, and the ways in which you can obtain coverage for your mobile phone (or tablet), whether it\u2019s Android or iOS.",
    "Bitdefender Mobile Security is the firm\u2019s smartphone (or tablet) security solution which is produced in two flavors: an Android app, and an iOS app. It comes as a standalone application, and the Android antivirus app is considerably more in-depth than the one for Apple devices \u2013 the latter is a much more barebones affair.",
    "As mentioned, Bitdefender makes Mobile Security apps for both iOS and Android devices. With Bitdefender Mobile Security for Apple devices, your hardware must be running iOS 11.2 or better. In the case of Bitdefender Mobile Security for Android, the requirement is to be running Android 5.0 or later.",
    "Subscribing to Bitdefender Mobile Security gives you coverage for just one device. However, there is an alternative to buying the standalone product \u2013 or having to purchase a number of copies if you\u2019re protecting more than one mobile \u2013 and that\u2019s to get coverage for multiple iOS and/or Android devices with a Bitdefender Total Security subscription. In the case of the latter, you can purchase plans which cover up to 5 or 10 devices (mobiles or PCs).",
    "App scanner plus web protection",
    "Bitdefender Mobile Security provides on-demand scanning to check for any dangerous apps \u2013 this also runs automatically whenever a new app is installed \u2013 coupled with anti-phishing tech and malicious URL blocking to keep you protected when browsing the web on your mobile device.",
    "App lock",
    "This feature can be set to guard your more sensitive apps which carry personal data, preventing anyone from getting at this info by implementing a PIN for accessing those applications. For the sake of convenience, you can specify to have these apps unlocked when using your home network.",
    "Anti-theft",
    "Anti-theft countermeasures ensure that if you lose your device, or it\u2019s stolen, you can try to locate it, send a message to the person who has found it, or remotely lock or wipe the phone or tablet if necessary.",
    "WearON",
    "If you have a Wear OS smartwatch to partner your Android phone, Bitdefender Mobile Security also covers the gadget on your wrist, with nifty features like alerts on your watch if you move too far away from your phone (and might have left it behind), or a sound ping to help locate your handset.",
    "Bitdefender VPN",
    "As with Bitdefender desktop software, the mobile apps come with an integrated VPN. There is a major limitation in that it only gives you 200MB of data per day - so nowhere near on a par with the best Android VPNs in the Play Store - but it\u2019ll still be handy for occasional use.",
    "Bitdefender Mobile Security for iPhone and iPad is a considerably cut-back app compared to the Android version, mainly because as you may be aware, iOS doesn\u2019t have traditional \u2018antivirus\u2019 apps as such. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s mobile operating system sandboxes apps, meaning there\u2019s already built-in protection from malware-laden applications. There are still dangers iOS users can encounter though, and that\u2019s why Bitdefender offers the following features:",
    "Web protection",
    "When you\u2019re browsing the web on an iOS device, you can still run into hazards like phishing pages, so Bitdefender Mobile Security provides some top-quality URL filtering to help keep you safe.",
    "Privacy monitoring",
    "Bitdefender Mobile Security keeps an eye out for whether any of your online accounts have been involved in a data breach. That\u2019s where a company is hacked and account details are stolen \u2013 or info is mistakenly leaked somehow \u2013 and your precious data ends up online somewhere. If you\u2019re warned that this has happened by the app, you can then take swift action (perhaps changing passwords, etc).",
    "Bitdefender VPN",
    "This works exactly the same as with the Android app above, with the same major caveat \u2013 you only get 200MB of daily data allowance, but that could still come in pretty useful now and then.",
    "Bitdefender is a well-respected security vendor and the company is generally ranked at or near the top when the independent test labs prepare their reports (the seriously in-depth affairs which compare the relative strengths of different antivirus engines). In the latest rounds of testing by both major independent labs (AV-Test and AV-Comparatives), Bitdefender scored very highly.",
    "Furthermore, as we\u2019ve seen on Android, Bitdefender Mobile Security is well-featured and the asking price looks reasonable. On iOS, the argument is less compelling seeing as you only really get two pillars of defense \u2013 anti-phishing and the privacy monitoring \u2013 but you may find that\u2019s still worthwhile. Or perhaps more to the point, if you have iOS devices and multiple other computers or Android phones to protect, you might find it a tempting proposition to fork out for Bitdefender Total Security, which gives you the mobile apps plus the ability to defend PCs (or Macs) as well.",
    "Bitdefender Total Security certainly looks a good option for the heavily discounted first year of the subscription, but the plan could become less compelling after renewal compared to the asking price per mobile device with Bitdefender Mobile Security. As ever, you\u2019ll have to work out the cost side of the equation depending on your own needs and number of devices \u2013 mobile, or otherwise \u2013 to be covered."
