  "article": [
    "There\u2019s a new update for Microsoft Surface Duo that turns the device into a handheld gaming console of sorts: now some Xbox Cloud Gaming titles can be played with the second screen covered in touch controls mapped to the Xbox controller buttons.",
    "The update went live this morning, empowering Surface Duo owners to play a selection of 50 games over Xbox Cloud Gaming (formerly xCloud), but you\u2019ll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play them, according to a tweet from Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay:",
    "Xbox has seemingly quietly been adding touch controls to some titles in its Game Pass library over the last few months, per The Verge, and the actual list amounts to 66 games as of publishing time \u2013 you can find them on the Game Pass catalogue by filtering for \u2018Cloud-enabled\u2019 and \u2018Xbox touch controls\u2019 games here. As of now, the list includes games like Gears 5, River City Girls, Dead Cells, Tell Me Why, Spiritfarer, Pillars of Eternity, Sea of Thieves, Nier: Automata, and more.",
    "Since the Surface Duo was released, we\u2019ve wondered about its gaming capabilities. Microsoft opted for a dual-screen rather than single wide foldable display, so we imagined it would be easy enough to use one for controls and leave the other to display the action (without our thumbs getting in the way) similar to how the LG V60\u2019s Dual Screen peripheral enabled gaming.",
    "Of course, Microsoft\u2019s big advantage lies in the Xbox Game Pass system, making it seemingly easier for the company to prod developers into programming compatibility for the Surface Duo touchscreen. That\u2019s probably more leverage than a phonemaker like LG could bring to produce similar bespoke compatibility with its Dual Screen touchscreen (if LG hadn\u2019t quit making phones, anyway), but it shows that there\u2019s still new experiences coming for the Surface Duo device \u2013 and Microsoft hasn\u2019t abandoned it yet. Of course, players can still simply use a Bluetooth-linked console controller to play said Xbox Cloud Gaming titles if touch controls are too cumbersome."
