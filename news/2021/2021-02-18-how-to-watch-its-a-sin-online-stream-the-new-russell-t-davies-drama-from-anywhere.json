    "Showing the highs and lows of gay life in 1980s London with critically-revered authenticity, hit Russell T Davies miniseries It's a Sin has just emphatically expanded its global reach, launching in the US from Thursday, February 18. The show will be exclusive to HBO Max there and is also already available in other parts of the world including the UK (Channel 4) and Australia (Stan), so read on as we explain how to watch It's a Sin online and stream every episode wherever you are today.",
    "The five-part show, which HBO Max has dropped in true binge style all at once, follows the lives if a group of young gay men and their friends, who leave home to seek love, fame, and friendship in 1980s London \u2013 only for the AIDS epidemic to cast a dark pall over their wide-eyed plans.",
    "Skins star Olly Alexander plays Ritchie, while Omari Douglas and Callum Scott Howells - both making their TV debuts - are Roscoe and Collin respectively. They arrive in London full of grandiose dreams \u2013 Roscoe to be rich, Collinn to be ridiculously famous. And both to have fun!",
    "In no time at all, they're having a great time and enjoying their newfound freedom - but the arrival of a mysterious illness threatens to upend their lives, and heralds a fresh wave of discrimination for the LGBTQ+ community. Heart-breaking and hilarious, it also features young talent alongside veteran actors like Keeley Hawes and Stephen Fry.",
    "Davies portrays the realities of gay life honestly and unflinchingly, just as he did in the ground-breaking Queer as Folk (2000), bringing an incredible authenticity to his recreation of 1980s London - from its grubby pubs to its conservative Thatcherite attitudes and unforgiving policing methods.",
    "It\u2019s a Sin combines the personal journeys of our protagonists with tremendous socio-political upheaval to incredibly potent effect. You can watch It\u2019s a Sin online from anywhere - read on for full details of streaming It's a Sin or learn more about the great value HBO Max price plans and deals available right now."
