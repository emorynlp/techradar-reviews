    "It's out with the Cheetahs and Kings, and in with the Sharks, Stormers, Lions and Bulls, as a bright new era begins in club rugby. South Africa's finest join the cream of Scotland, Wales and Italy and, of course, Ireland's dominant provinces in a 16-strong, ultra-competitive league encompassing both hemispheres. Read on as we explain how to watch a United Rugby Championship live stream online for every 2021/22 game, no matter where you are in the world.",
    "Leinster brought the Pro14 era to a close by securing their fourth consecutive title in March. The Irish club will forever be synonymous with the Pro14, but there's nothing like a major revamp to forge new rivalries and breathe new intensity into old ones.",
    "From South Africa, the Lions finished as Super Rugby runners-up for three years in a row from 2017-2019. But the Bulls have won the last two editions of the Currie Cup, beating the Sharks on both occasions.",
    "These teams are used to winning, and with European Rugby Champions Cup places up for grabs - even for the South African teams - how they'd love to embarrass their new stablemates.",
    "So how can you watch all the gripping action this season? Read on as we explain how to watch a United Rugby Championship live stream no matter where you are in the world. You can even watch the rugby FREE online if you're in Ireland or the UK.",
    "We've recommended some of the best places to live stream United Rugby Championship action below. But you might run into a problem trying to access them if you're outside of your country. This is because of something called geo-blocking - best thought of as a kind of digital border.",
    "But we can help you get back to your preferred UCR live stream in no time at all. Simply follow our VPN advice below and you'll soon be up and running with a great bit of software that allows you to relocate your device back to your country of residence - thereby regaining access to all the streaming services and content you normally enjoy at home.",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Ireland or Wales, just head to the likes of TG4 Player or S4C on BBC iPlayer as described below",
    "The United Rugby Championship has launched its very own streaming service - the aptly named URC TV.",
    "It's not available in any of the above-mentioned territories, but can be watched in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and pretty much everywhere else (excepting countries in Sub-Saharan Africa).",
    "For an idea of pricing, in the US it costs $24.99 for a weekend pass, while the whole season would set you back $139.99. Down Under in Australia, you'll be looking at AU$35 and AU$135 respectively.",
    "If you're not bothered about (or not awake for) live coverage, then you can still register for free to watch match highlights. You can watch across a range of devices, including laptops, Androids, iPhone, iPad, Airplay or Chromecast."
