  "article": [
    "As the quantity of data generated worldwide continues to expand at an aggressive rate, researchers are looking for ultra-dense and ultra-durable storage technologies capable of housing it all.",
    "For example, Microsoft is examining the possibility of using lasers to etch data into quartz glass, or storing information in hologram form inside crystals. New developments in the field of tape storage, the current leading choice for archival use cases, are also promising.",
    "However, one new storage medium in particular appears to have all the necessary attributes: deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Researchers have found a single gram of DNA is capable of storing 215 PB (220,000 TB) of data.",
    "To find out more about the work going into making DNA storage a commercial reality, TechRadar Pro spoke with the DNA Data Storage Alliance, founded last year by Microsoft, Western Digital, Twist Bioscience and Ilumina.",
    "The Alliance was launched with the goal of raising awareness about the emerging storage technology and establishing a set of standards and specifications on which the industry can build."
