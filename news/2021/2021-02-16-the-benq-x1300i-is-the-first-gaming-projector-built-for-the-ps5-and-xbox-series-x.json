    "BenQ is releasing a new gaming projector that should make anyone with a PS5 or Xbox Series X \u2013 as limited of a population as that may be \u2013 very excited.",
    "Dubbed the BenQ X1300i and announced toward the end of last year in the UK, the latest 4LED beamer from BenQ has a native 1080p resolution at 120Hz with 4K HDR compatibility and a seriously impressive 8.3ms of latency.",
    "In terms of specs, BenQ says the X1300i puts out over 3,000 lumens and has a 500,000:1 contrast ratio. That, the company says, helps the X1300i cover 98% of the Rec709 color space. In the sound department, the X1300i uses two 5W speakers that have three distinct settings \u2013 one for RPGs, one for first-person shooters and one for sports games \u2013 all tuned by treVolo.",
    "The projector will be available soon for $1,299 (\u00a31,249 if you're in the UK, or around AU$1,700 in Australia) on BenQ.com, Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo and Adorama.",
    "While we\u2019ve seen projectors with 120Hz refresh rates and low latency in the past, it\u2019s rare that we\u2019ve seen them combined in one reasonably affordable package.",
    "Admittedly, it would've been better had it supported native 4K and while the price is good for a gaming projector, it\u2019s not a whole lot lower than some of the native 4K 120Hz TVs out there like the LG BX OLED or Sony X900H LED-LCD TV.",
    "That said, with the X1300i you get a heck of a lot more screen for your money.",
    "As for how it fares against gaming monitors, well, monitors typically tend to have even higher refresh rates (144Hz, 240Hz, 360Hz, etc\u2026) and cans sometimes even cheaper than 4K TVs. The downside is that, again, they\u2019re smaller.",
    "Whether you should opt for the X1300i instead of a 4K TV or a monitor all depends on how much space you have to fill and your budget. But, if you\u2019ve got an empty wall and an PS5 or Xbox Series X, the BenQ X1300i could be a solid alternative to the 4K/120Hz TV you might\u2019ve had your eye on."
