    "After many a set back, the long anticipated arrival of Black Widow's own title movie is here, starring Scarlett Johansson. Available to stream at no extra cost to Disney Plus subscribers, watch Black Widow online right now wherever you are.",
    "Fitting itself snuggly between the Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War timeline, ex-KGB agent Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) has exiled herself in the middle of nowhere in Norway. It's not long before she's tracked down by Yelena (Florence Pugh), a fellow Widow and her surrogate sister. And what does Yelena need? Well, help in dismantling the very Black Widow program that shaped them into deadly assassins in the first place, of course.",
    "Along the way they're reunited with their adoptive parents, Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), as well as facing off the overseer of the Black Widow program, Dreykov, and villain, Taskmaster.",
    "Delivering a much sought after backstory to Natasha Romanoff's character, it's full of all the action-packed, explosive scenes we've come to expect from a Marvel superhero movie.",
    "Initially arriving on Disney Plus Premier Access, you'll now be able to watch Black Widow online with a regular Disney Plus subscription. If you haven't already, get started by signing up now so you can stream it from anywhere.",
    "Disney Plus is already cheaper than competing streaming services like Netflix but you can save even more when you sign up for an annual subscription which gives you 15% off the monthly price. Obviously you have to splash the cash at the start, but with so much content to get stuck into we very much doubt you'll run out of things to watch before the 12 months are up. You're looking at a mere $79.99/\u00a379.90/AU$119.99 for the year.",
    "Or if your interests are farther reaching (and you're in the US), then we'd seriously suggest looking at the fantastic value bundle package. It adds Hulu and ESPN Plus to your subscription price.",
    "The Hulu element opens up a world of Hulu Originals such as Nine Perfect Strangers, The Handmaid's Tale, and PEN15. Bringing further great value, ESPN Plus offers loads of exclusive live sport, highlights and documentaries. The combined bundle costs just $13.99 a month.",
    "Disney Plus just gets better and better with its original content, on top of old favorites. It's the place to watch What If...?, which is just one in the latest in a string of recent blockbuster releases exclusive to the platform, including Luca, The Mandalorian, Cruella, Hamilton, and much more.",
    "The streaming service has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices.",
    "And finally, there's the new Star on Disney Plus that most global markets get to enjoy and sees the amount of content available through Disney Plus more than double, with a particular eye to shows grown-ups are going to enjoy. It costs a tiny bit more, but is worth it based on our initial impressions - and you can still save big by going with an annual subscription.",
