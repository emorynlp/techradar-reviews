    "\u201cWith over two billion active users, WhatsApp can be an attractive target for attackers. Once we discovered the security vulnerability, we quickly reported our findings to WhatsApp, who was cooperative and collaborative in issuing a fix,\u201d said Oded Vanunu, Head of Products Vulnerabilities Research at CPR.",
    "CPR explains that image filtering is the process through which pixels of the original image are modified to achieve certain visual effects, such as blur or sharpen.",
