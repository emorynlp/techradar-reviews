    "Infinix has been on a tireless campaign to bring premium smartphone technologies and features at more attainable prices, in stark contrast to the sky-high prices you\u2019d find from other manufacturers. This campaign has already been on display with products like the Infinix NOTE 10 Pro, which earned an iF Design Award for 2021, as well as the unique Infinix Concept Phone and stylish-yet-powerful INBook laptop. With the introduction of the Infinix ZERO X Pro, the top of its new ZERO X Series, Infinix is bringing premium capabilities and stylish design language to every corner of the device, and there\u2019s a little something extra special for photographers..",
    "Just take a quick look at everything the Infinix ZERO X Pro is offering, and you\u2019ll see the phone boasts features that stand next to premium flagships from top brands. You\u2019ll find a massive and bright display, a 108MP triple rear camera system, and powerful internals with a dual-chip design to keep it all running. Infinix even packs it all into a fairly thin and lightweight package with a premium glass back designed to emulate the endless depth of the Milky Way Galaxy.",
    "The most impressive feature of the Infinix ZERO X Pro is the powerful camera system. You\u2019ll find few budget-friendly devices offering this much on the camera front. There\u2019s a 108MP main camera to help you take pictures with fine details, and it offers optical image stabilization so your photos will be clear even if you\u2019re caught up in the commotion of the busy world around you. An 8MP ultra-wide camera will let you take it all in, whether that\u2019s capturing sprawling scenes of the world around you or just getting all of your friends and family into the picture. That ultra-wide camera also lets you see the minute details of the world with its Macro mode, so you can explore the intricacies of nature. You\u2019ll look sharp in selfies you send to friends with the 16MP front-facing camera. Then there\u2019s the 8MP periscope camera, which can get in close on far-off subjects with its 5x optical zoom and stunning 60x hybrid zoom. You\u2019ll be able to take pictures of things you never thought you could before, like birds perched high up in trees or the city streets far below a high-rise, or even the Moon in crisp detail in the clear night sky.",
    "With all that zoom, you may be tempted to shoot (for) the Moon, so Infinix has created a top-notch Galileo Algorithm Engine that helps keep your shot of the Moon lined up and in focus. The device also boasts AI capabilities to really bring out all the details of the Moon. Say goodbye to those old shots of an overexposed, out-of-focus, tiny white ball in the sky. This is Moon photography made simple.",
    "In the spirit of exploration and creativity, Infinix held its Infinix Presents: See Beyond online webinar at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in London to bring astronomy down to Earth, allowing the next generation to \u201csee beyond to a world they\u2019ve only imagined,\u201d explains Skye Chen, Head of Infinix Global Public Relations. The ZERO X Pro does just that \u2013 through the lenses of the device, you are able to capture the Moon as though you were seeing it through a telescope and let your creativity run wild.",
    "In addition to the camera features. you\u2019ll get a good view of everything you capture on the Infinix ZERO X Pro\u2019s immersive display. That 6.67-inch display has a FHD+ resolution for sharp visuals boosted by the high brightness levels and deep black levels offered by the AMOLED panel, a stunning pairing for the latest TV and movies. Combining all that with a silky smooth 120Hz refresh rate and the ultra-fast 240Hz touch sampling rate, you\u2019ll get a snappier, more responsive gaming experience so you can see the action clearly and react faster than the competition. Infinix even managed to tuck a fingerprint scanner underneath the display itself for enhanced security and convenience.",
    "The Zero X Pro runs on a special dual-chip system pairing a MediaTek Helio G95 octa-core chipset with a MediaTek Intelligent Display chipset. This gives it plenty of power to run and more advanced display capabilities, like that boosted 120Hz refresh rate, which results in a crisp, seamless experience.",
    "A powerful system like this needs a strong battery to keep it running, so Infinix has packed in a 4,500mAh battery so you can shoot all day long. Additionally, it has implemented T\u00dcV Rheinland Safe Fast-Charge Technology to offer 45W charging speeds, giving you a 40% charge in 15 minutes. With power like this, you\u2019ll be able to go on extended photo shoots without worrying about needing to charge your device mid-day.",
