    "Intel\u2019s Core i9-11900K, the purportedly incoming 8-core flagship of its next-gen Rocket Lake processors, has been spotted in another leaked benchmark.",
    "This one is a Geekbench result posted on Twitter (as spotted by VideoCardz), and it shows the 11900K with a boost speed of 5.3GHz \u2013 which matches what we witnessed in another leak a couple of weeks ago.",
    "As ever with leaked benchmarks, treat this with a healthy amount of skepticism, but the Core i9-11900K (in a Gigabyte Z490 Aorus Master motherboard) recorded a single-core result of 1,892 and a multi-core tally of 10,934.",
    "Those are some seriously impressive figures, particularly the single-core where the 11900K beats out the 10900K Comet Lake flagship by around 35%, no less, going by the benchmarks flagged up for comparison by VideoCardz. And both these Intel chips are level-pegging in multi-core, which again is impressive seeing as the 10900K is a 10-core product, and has a pair more cores to work with.",
    "Furthermore, looking at the 11900K results here in comparison to AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5800X (also an 8-core CPU), Intel\u2019s chip was 13% faster in single-core, and 5% quicker in multi-core.",
    "Bear in mind the usual caveats about leaks, and not reading too much into a single benchmark, especially not a pre-release one \u2013 but on the latter point, there\u2019s also the possibility that the final performance of the 11900K could be even better.",
    "When it comes to the overall picture, a lot will depend on exactly where Intel decides to pitch the new Rocket Lake CPUs \u2013 which are rumored to be launching in March \u2013 in terms of their pricing, but the latest speculation we\u2019ve heard on that front sounds quite positive. It\u2019s possible that the 11900K may come in at a cheaper level than the Comet Lake flagship, and that would certainly make for strong competition for AMD.",
    "VideoCardz also pointed out a Geekbench leak for the Core i7-11700K, which will also run with 8-cores according to the rumor mill, and achieved single-core and multi-core results of 1,551 and 8,849 respectively.",
    "That\u2019s around 8% and 18% slower than the Ryzen 5800X, but note that the 11700K is pegged at a boost speed of 4.4GHz in this benchmark, so obviously this doesn\u2019t represent the full capabilities of that chip (the 10700K boosts up to 5.1GHz)."
