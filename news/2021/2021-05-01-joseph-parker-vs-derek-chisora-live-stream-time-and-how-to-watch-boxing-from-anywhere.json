    "They've been embroiled in a war of words for nearly two years, but it's finally time for Joseph Parker (28-2) and Derek Chisora (32-10) to let their fists do the talking. You're in the right place to find out all the details of how to watch a Parker vs Chisora live stream online to catch all this weekend's boxing action from anywhere in the world - with FREE options available in some regions.",
    "Del Boy rarely needs an excuse to start shooting his mouth off, but that's exactly what Parker gave him when he pulled out of their October 2019 fight because of a spider bite, and he's been questioning the New Zealander's courage ever since.",
    "It's been nearly three years since Parker last fought in the UK. In fact, the only two defeats of his professional career came in Blighty - at the hands of Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte, both in 2018. But he's been on an upward trajectory ever since, winning four consecutive fights - three by knockout - the most recent of which came at the expense of long-time rival Junior Fa in February.",
    "Chisora had won three in a row before succumbing to former cruiserweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk in October. Chisora came flying out of the blocks but punched himself out, and it was one-way traffic after that.",
    "It's a grudge match that's been nearly two years in the making, and here's how to watch a Joseph Parker vs Derek Chisora live stream from anywhere.",
    "Yes, in a way - but only in certain countries where a DAZN free trial is on offer.",
    "Boxing fans in Canada are among those in luck, as while it costs 20 bucks in the Great White North for the service monthly, you can get a FREE trial of DAZN in Canada. It's one of the only countries, along with Switzerland, we're aware of where the service offers a trial on the house.",
    "If that isn't you, don't worry, as DAZN is dirt cheap all over the world!",
    "It's also really reasonable to watch Parker vs Chisora in Australia, where DAZN is currently being offered for the introductory discount price of just $2.99 a month, compared to the steeper DAZN US price of $19.99 a month.",
    "If you're abroad and discover that your usual coverage is geo-blocked, then the only alternative that we know is to use a VPN to dial in to a country that does is showing the fight.",
    "The software is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address and appear to be in a completely different location - and all through a safe, encrypted connection. Here's how to get started.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Parker vs Chisora anywhere",
    "Remember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.",
    "Out of the country? DAZN subscribers who find themselves abroad for the fight will find they can access their account just like they would at home - wherever you are in the world, all you need is the help of a good VPN.",
    "However, those looking to subscribe to DAZN for the first time may find the service manages to effectively block certain VPNs at the point of creating an account. VPNs most notably encounter obstacles starting from scratch with DAZN Canada, though in other places like the US our general sports VPN recommendation was working fine in 2021.",
    "And if you've already got an account, a VPN should work wherever you are to help you regain access to pre-existing subscriptions.",
    "Pronounced 'Da Zone', DAZN is a sports-centric streaming service that launched in 2016 and is now available in over 200 countries all around the world including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "Its offering varies by region, but as an idea, it owns the rights to the Premier League, Champions League, NFL, cricket, snooker, rugby union and more in Canada - one of its original and biggest markets.",
    "It's also seeking to challenge the pay-per-view boxing hierarchy, and is landing an increasing number of coups.",
    "The price of DAZN also varies depending on where you are in the world but is generally competitive - in newer markets like Australia, an introductory offer is still running that has it available for just $2.99 a month, while in more established markets like Canada it costs CAD$20 a month. It also offers a FREE trial in some areas and works with pretty much any modern device imaginable.",
    "It's a great all-round offering, with the only real drawback being that it doesn't play overly nice with VPNs in all territories. As we've said, Canadians abroad will find they can't sign up for DAZN even with the help of a Virtual Private Network - though existing account holders (with or without a subscription) will find they can access the service fine.",
    "It's not universally the case, either, as our latest testing reveals DAZN US is accessible using a VPN across the board.",
    "The Joseph Parker vs Derek Chisora fight takes place on Saturday, May 1 at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England.",
    "The night's main card is set to get underway at 6pm BST, which is 1pm ET / 10am PT in the US and Canada, 3am AEST in Australia, and 5am NZST in New Zealand.",
    "Ring walks for the main event are roughly expected to be as follows.",
    "Parker vs Chisora ring walk times",
    "Joseph Parker is a 29-year-old former WBO heavyweight champion of the world, having won the vacant belt by defeating Andy Ruiz Jr. in 2016.",
    "He held onto it for 15 months, successfully defending his title twice, before it was taken from him by Anthony Joshua in March 2018, in a fight that went the distance and was awarded to AJ via unanimous decision.",
    "It was the first defeat of Parker's professional career, and he would lose again four months later, albeit in controversial circumstances.",
    "Dillian Whyte beat him via unanimous decision in July 2018, though the fight featured a clash of heads that dropped Parker to the canvas, as well as roughhouse tactics from Whyte, including rabbit punches, shoves and headbutts.",
    "Derek Chisora is a hugely experienced boxer, the 37-year-old having started his professional career in 2007.",
    "The Zimbabwean-born British fighter has faced many of the biggest names of the past decade, including Vitali Klitschko, Tyson Fury, David Haye and Dillian Whyte, though he came out second-best to all of them.",
    "He's known for his wind-up tactics, which have included kissing Carl Baker at the weigh-in before their fight, slapping Klitschko at the weigh-in and, after losing that fight, instigating a brawl with Haye - which led to the temporary withdrawal of his boxing licence."
