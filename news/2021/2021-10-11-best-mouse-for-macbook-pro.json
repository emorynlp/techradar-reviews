    "The best mouse for the MacBook Pro is a great investment if you have one of Apple\u2019s laptops, but don\u2019t want to rely on the touchpad. Not all mice are created equal and not all special extra mouse features will work in the Apple environment. A gaming mouse with more than six buttons for your MacBook or Mac, for example, might be a waste of money, and not just because Apple notebooks aren\u2019t really the best gaming laptops.",
    "Apple devices are all about simplicity and seamlessness of workflow, and an ideal mouse for your MacBook Pro should let you use that inherent design to its full potential. First and foremost, choose a mouse that is optimized for use on macOS. A wireless mouse or a USB-C wired one is also a better option than one that still connects via a USB cable (as you\u2019ll need to use an adaptor). And, if you\u2019re a content creator (which a lot of MacBook Pro users are), you\u2019ll want a mouse that comes with programmable buttons to simplify your creative tasks.",
    "Whether you just got your very first Apple laptop or you\u2019re just ready to move on from the trackpad, you\u2019ll soon realize the difference the best mouse for MacBook Pro makes in your daily tasks. Find the ideal one for you in our list below just in time for the upcoming release of the rumored MacBook Pro 14-inch, alongside our price comparison tool for the best mouse deal.",
    "As a rule, the OG is always the best, and the Apple Magic Mouse 2 is no exception. After all, Apple designed it to work beautifully with Mac and MacBooks. It screams Apple as well, with a smooth Multi-Touch surface that allows it to get rid of any buttons and lets its users perform gestures that make their computing life all the more seamless, and a small and thin footprint so it goes anywhere your MacBook Pro goes. Since it\u2019s wireless, you do need to remember to charge it, but Apple promises month-long battery life so you don\u2019t have to do it so often.",
    "If you spend most of your day editing videos and images or creating 3D designs, then you need a more robust mouse that will help you simplify your non-creative workflow so you can focus on your creative one. This is where the Logitech MX Master 3 comes in, a feature-rich mouse that comes with app-specific button re-assignments so you can assign your most used actions to any of its 8 buttons, simplifying what would normally be multi-step processes. Not only that, but it also offers multi-device connectivity and supports Logitech Flow so you can automatically switch between PCs or laptops without clicking a button. The Logitech MX Master 3 is among the most expensive offerings here, but you\u2019re definitely getting your money\u2019s worth.",

    "Being a digital nomad, this author has long relied on the Logitech MX Anywhere 3 to see her through her daily workload wherever she ends up in the world. The beauty of this little mouse is that it\u2019s incredibly compact while also extremely robust and reliable. For something so small, it\u2019s got a lot to unpack, from multi-device connectivity and multi-surface tracking to being rechargeable and with whopping 70-day battery life. It even has a premium MagSpeed Electromagnetic scroll wheel and programmable buttons to help simplify workflows. Plus, it comes in several different colors, including pink, because work doesn\u2019t have to be boring.",

    "Most cheap mice come with the usual set of drawbacks \u2013 they\u2019re not rechargeable, robust, or all that reliable. The great thing about Satechi\u2019s line of accessories is that they beat all those stereotypes just by having better quality overall while keeping their price tags appealingly cheap. That\u2019s why the Satechi M1 Wireless Mouse has made this list as the best budget option. It\u2019s minimal on features \u2013 it is still a cheap mouse, after all \u2013 but it delivers where it counts, offering accurate and responsive performance, reliable Bluetooth connectivity with a 32-foot range, buttons that are satisfying to click, and great battery life. Speaking of which, it\u2019s completely rechargeable so you won\u2019t have to worry about needing to buy batteries every few months. And, did we mention that it comes in five different shades?",
    "Just because MacBook Pros don\u2019t make for the best gaming laptops, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t play games on them. In fact, there\u2019s a whole slew of Mac games out there that include our favorites like Sims 4 and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI. And, for those, you\u2019ll want the Logitech G G305 Lightspeed in your arsenal. It connects via Logitech\u2019s USB LIGHTSPEED Wireless receiver, which means you do need a USB hub handy, but even with it, its performance is fast and accurate.",
    "It also boasts up to 12,000 DPI, a 1ms report rate, and programmable buttons that are extremely satisfying to click. Plus, for your comfort, it\u2019s ultra-lightweight and has a beautifully contoured shape around the palm rest that supports your hand whether you\u2019re gaming or working. The only thing is that it\u2019s AA-powered, but with over 250 hours of battery life, you don\u2019t have to switch often."
