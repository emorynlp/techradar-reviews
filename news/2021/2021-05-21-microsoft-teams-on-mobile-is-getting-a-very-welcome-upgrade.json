    "Among the new features is Together Mode, which looks to offer a different view from regular video call, as well as the ability to react with live emojis and GIFs during a call.",
    "Microsoft also recently revealed that Teams meeting organizers will soon be able to disable and enable video feeds from specific attendees - as well as turning off the video feeds of all participants in a call.",
    "The update means that hosts and attendees alike should be less distracted by the vast collection of video feeds that normally comes with joining a group call.",
