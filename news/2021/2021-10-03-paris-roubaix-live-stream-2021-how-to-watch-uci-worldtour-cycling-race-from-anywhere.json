    "Ready, sett, go! Not-so-fondly nicknamed L'enfer du Nord (The Hell of the North), Paris-Roubaix is the cobbliest, most-storied and, in the minds and behinds of many, the most brutal of the Classics. It's back after a one-year hiatus and we're here to explain how to get a 2021 Paris-Roubaix live stream today and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online wherever you are.",
    "Paris-Roubaix tends to be a mucky affair at the best of times, but with steady rain expected before and during the event, this one could get seriously messy.",
    "Defending champion Philippe Gilbert is one of five former winners in contention, alongside Peter Sagan, John Degenkolb, Greg Van Avermaet and Niki Terpstra, but the greatest weight of expectation lies on the shoulders of Wout van Aert, who missed out on the rainbow jersey at the Road World Championships.",
    "It's the toughest one-day race on the calendar and one of the final events of the season, so read on for everything you need to know to watch a Paris-Roubaix live stream from anywhere in the world.",
    "There are plenty of ways to watch a FREE Paris-Roubaix live stream, with SBS On Demand showing all of the action in Australia.",
    "If you fancy your cycling coverage with some European flavour, free UCI Road World Championships coverage is also available via France 3 in France, Sporza in Belgium, Rai in Italy and RTVE in Spain.",
    "And if you're from any of the countries listed above but you're abroad right now, don't worry about missing out on that free coverage - all you need to do is download a VPN to re-connect to your home streaming coverage...",
    "If you're desperate to watch the Paris-Roubaix but you're away from home and the coverage is geo-blocked, then you could always use a VPN to access it (assuming you're not breaching any broadcaster T&Cs, of course). You may be surprised how simple it is to do.",
    "Use a VPN to get a Paris-Roubaix live stream from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from Australia, just head to the SBS website or app"
