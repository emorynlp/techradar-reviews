    "If you still use the Xbox One as an intermediary between your cable box and your TV, Microsoft has some bad news for you: soon, you\u2019ll no longer see TV listings inside OneGuide.",
    "The news comes from a new Xbox Wire blog post which mentions that, while you\u2019ll still be able to view any device connected to the HDMI port on the back of your Xbox One, you won\u2019t see channel listings or program information for any of the TV channels, shows or movies that appear on the screen.",
    "The work around? Well, if you have your cable box plugged into your Xbox One, Xbox One S or Xbox One X, you might want to run it to the TV directly now.",
    "The good news is that Microsoft is giving you another two months before it pulls the figurative plug on the key Xbox OneGuide feature and you won\u2019t have to worry about it until May of this year.",
    "It wasn't that long ago that Don Mattrick, then-President of the Interactive Entertainment Business for Microsoft, was promising that the Xbox One as entertainment center of your home.",
    "In the Xbox One's rather infamous unveiling event, Mattrick said that by connecting your cable box to your Xbox you'd open up a whole new world of entertainment thanks to features like picture-in-picture (Snap) and Kinect integration. To do this, Mattrick said the console would always need to have an internet connection which really upset swaths of gamers who just wanted a basic upgrade to the Xbox 360.",
    "The Xbox Series X would go on to implement some of Mattrick's ideas (downloaded games do require you to be connected to the internet to make sure you're the actual owner) and a few \u2013 like the seamless music integration \u2013 became key parts of the PS4 and PS5.",
    "Unfortunately, Microsoft's pivot to the center of your media center didn't quite work the way it had wanted, but in the end Microsoft found new services \u2013 like Xbox Game Pass and backward compatibility \u2013 to show gamers that the Xbox One was more than just a sports TV box.",
    "While OneGuide will remain after the update, the app will be a shell of its former self \u2013 a reminder that Microsoft once thought the Xbox One could be the control center of your living room, failed at it, and became something better."
