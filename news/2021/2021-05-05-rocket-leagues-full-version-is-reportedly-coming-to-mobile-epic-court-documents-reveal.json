    "While we\u2019d previously heard about the side-scrolling Rocket League: Sideswipe coming to mobile, the ongoing Apple v. Epic court battle has unearthed emails and documents revealing plenty \u2013 including that the latter is planning to bring the full Rocket League experience to smartphones.",
    "The document \u2013 a slideshow from mid-2020 outlining Epic\u2019s plans for the next year uploaded by The Verge \u2013 doesn\u2019t reveal when the game would fully release, but one slide (p. 91) does outright state that a Rocket League mobile public beta is planned for Q2 2021.",
    "The beta will be part of what\u2019s phrased as Rocket League \u201cNext,\u201d which is a \u2018next-generation client\u2019 that enables cross-play and cross-progress across all platforms \u2013 including mobile.",
    "This game won\u2019t be at the expense of Rocket League: Sideswipe, which is detailed in the following slide (p. 92) as \u2018Rocket League rebuilt for touch controls\u2019 that will almost certainly launch first, especially after it held a limited alpha in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year, per Android Police.",
    "Of course, a lot has changed in the last year, and it\u2019s unclear if Epic and its subsidiary Psyonix, which launched Rocket League in 2015 and is assumedly working on the full mobile version, will continue with plans outlined in the internal-only slideshow. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if it\u2019s still in development, or if Epic would rather wait to see how this trial shakes out before it goes forward with another smartphone game.",
