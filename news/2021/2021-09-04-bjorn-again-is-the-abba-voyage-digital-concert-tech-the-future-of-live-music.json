    "My my! Abba are back \u2013 but not as you\u2019ve ever seen them before.",
    "It\u2019s been forty years since the Swedish foursome, responsible for some of the most recognisable songs in pop music history, last released new music. But Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad are back with new tracks \u2013 a new album, Abba Voyages, to be released in November 2021 \u2013 and more excitingly, new live shows.",
    "Except, Abba themselves won\u2019t be present at the shows, set to take place in London from May 2022. Instead, they\u2019ll be there in digital form \u2013 and de-aged to appear just how they were at the height of their powers toward the end of the 1970s.",
    "Teaming up with George Lucas\u2019s Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), the Abba Voyage shows will see the band perform \u2018live\u2019 night after night, having had a performance (choreographed by Wayne McGregor, resident artist at London\u2019s Royal Ballet) recorded in 3D in front of 160 cameras by a motion capture team. This footage was directed by Baillie Walsh, and produced by Johan Renck (worked on the superb Chernobyl TV show) and Svana Gisla, who teamed up with Renck on promo videos for David Bowie\u2019s final record, Blackstar. The talent behind the camera is just as astonishing as it is in front of it, then.",
    "These recordings were then handed over to close to 1,000 digital artists at four of ILM's global studios, who used archive footage to take the scans of the band and roll back the years, ready for a performance that will give the illusion that the band of the 70s have been teleported to the roaring 2020s.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re truly sailing in uncharted waters. With the help of our younger selves, we travel into the future,\u201d Benny Andersson told the Guardian.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen digital representations of much-loved artists. Remember Tupac\u2019s surprise digital resurrection at the 2012 Coachella festival? It was the start of a whole new industry for holographics performances, with long-dead stars returning to stages around the world. And while it\u2019s not an identical technology to what Abba is using (which appears to be a form of advanced 2D projection giving the appearance of depth), it\u2019s conceptually the same.",
    "David Nussbaum, CEO of PORTL, a telecommunications company that uses hologram-like projection technology to beam lifesize appearances of individuals in real time anywhere around the world, has worked on many such hologram gigs throughout his career.",
    "\u201cWe would bring lots of dead people back to posthumously perform in sold out cities around the country and around the world,\u201d he told TechRadar. Nussbaum worked on live performances from departed artists like Jackie Wilson, Billie Holiday and even Whitney Houston (for a duet with the very-much-alive Christina Aguilera, for an episode of the US version of The Voice which never aired).",
    "While such gigs have primarily been used to bring back deceased performers Nussbaum anticipates that this is just the beginning of creative uses of bringing both the living and dead to new performance locations \u2013 and to preserve them for future ages to enjoy.",
    "\u201cYou can hit the record button on any of these performances and create hologram jukeboxes,\u201d posits Nussbaum.",
    "\u201cImagine going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or any of these artist Hall of Fames and instead of seeing a picture on a wall, or a plaque, or statue, seeing the artist performing the music that he or she was made famous for. Imagine interacting with them, talking to them, having them talk back. I believe people are most excited by physical interaction, close up, experiences, and almost having that VIP to share the same space as these as these amazing performers\u201d",
    "Nussbaum\u2019s PORTL tech, though primarily envisaged for business use, could be similarly applied to the performance space.",
    "Its box-like appearance offers \u201c25,000 lumens of super bright white interior light, all projecting onto a single projection area where a 4k resolution image is revealed, the content. It works in almost all forms of light,\u201d describes Nussbaum.",
    "\u201cYou can pre record any piece of content and play it back. It's great for advertising, it's great for conventions and stuff. It\u2019s the evolution of the mobile phone, it's the evolution of holograms. We would be able to beam you in real time to interact with any person in any venue, around the world on a whim.\u201d",
    "Unless you have ready access to a time machine, you\u2019re not going to be able to head back to Abba\u2019s late 70s heyday and see them in all their pop pomp and glam glory. So this really is as good as it\u2019s going to get.",
    "And all the signs point to this being a really well considered venture for the band, and a special experience for its legion of fans. From the care that\u2019s gone into the motion capture, to the fact it\u2019s taking place in a purpose-built arena, specially designed to best present the tech in a flattering and convincing manner, suggests we could be in for the time of our lives at the shows.",
    "Abba Voyage has a benefit that all previous, similarly-tech-fuelled revivals and resurrections have lacked \u2013 all members of Abba are alive and well. So not only do the designers of the show have classic archive footage to base performances on, but they\u2019ve been able to work alongside the band themselves, capturing the mannerisms and movements exactly before applying a lick of de-ageing paint to the foursome. In addition, it\u2019s not necessarily a karaoke show either \u2013 all four members have been back in the studio, laying down new recordings and vocals of the classic hits. It may be a pre-recorded show, but at least it\u2019s one that will have never been heard before opening night.",
    "Perhaps most appealing though is the price \u2013 with the digital Abbatars performing five times a week (sometimes with two performances happening per day), ticket prices have been able to stay relatively low, with the cheapest starting at just \u00a321 a pop. Performing takes a great physical effort, particularly for older stars, but the Abba Voyage tech means the band can \u2018play\u2019 night after night without burning out, allowing for more shows and cheaper tickets.",
    "\u201cI think this will be a regular thing that people do,\u201d says Nussbaum, \u201cinstead of jumping on a plane, spending six or seven hours in the air, getting checked into a hotel.",
    "\u201cThis is going to be what people prefer. It not just saves them money and saves them time but it's saving the Earth. I've seen over the last 18 months companies not just saving millions or even billions of dollars in air travel, but their carbon footprint goes down to virtually nothing.\u201d",
    "In a post-covid age, this could be a glimpse at a potential future of touring for bands \u2013 record a motion capture show, and send the digital files to be broadcast anywhere in the world from the largest arenas to tucked away theatres. It may never capture the full experience of an in-the-flesh, sweaty star singing their hearts out and all the potential spontaneity that comes with it. But for bands entering their twilight years, it\u2019ll let the songs keep playing long after their last notes have been sung."
