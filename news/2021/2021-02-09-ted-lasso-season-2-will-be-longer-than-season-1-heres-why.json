    "Ted Lasso season 2 will be longer than season 1, star Juno Temple (who plays Keeley Jones on the show) has revealed. While season 1 was 10 episodes long, Apple TV Plus picked the series up for more episodes this time, according to the actress, which Apple later confirmed. Season 2 will include 12 episodes in total.",
    "The reason? The story for season 2 demanded it, according to Apple.",
    "This comes from Collider, who spoke to Temple about the show, which has now begun filming mid-pandemic in the UK. \"Well we've joyously been picked up for a few extra episodes this season. So it's a longer shoot due to actually shooting more.\"",
    "Collider later confirmed with Apple that season 2 will be 12 episodes long, and the company told the outlet that the additional episodes were required for story reasons.",
    "Ted Lasso has drawn critical acclaim, recently getting nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy, with actor Jason Sudeikis also getting a Best Actor nomination in the comedy category. It's one of Apple TV Plus' most acclaimed originals to date. More episodes probably seem like a no-brainer.",
    "It's unclear when Ted Lasso season 2 will be released, but we hope to see it this year at some point.",
    "Ted Lasso season 1 ended with AFC Richmond being relegated from the Premier League, and we expect season 2 to focus on the team's comeback season in the EFL Championship. Having more episodes to help tell that story doesn't hurt, especially when the 30-minute episodes already seem to fly by.",
    "Our best guess is that Ted Lasso will eventually end in the team winning the Premier League \u2013 in an underdog story not unlike that of Leicester City's 2015/2016-winning season. That feels like the sort of feelgood moment that would make sense as a long-term goal for the show."
