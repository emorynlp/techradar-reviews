  "article": [
    "It was a bumper hour-long Apple launch event on April, with the Cupertino company\u2019s Apple Spring Loaded event introducing loads of new products and features to its existing slate of software and applications.",
    "From slick new M1 iMacs to a revamped Apple TV 4K box, it ran the gauntlet from entertainment to work and business, with a showcase that seemed keen to acknowledge the shift many of its customers have made to a new work-from-home routines.",
    "But alongside the big computing and iPad Pro 2021 launches, there were some smaller, but still significant announcements made by CEO Tim Cook and his team of developers, engineers and marketeers.",
    "Here are seven things you may have missed among the bombardment of announcements \u2013 and one secret reveal that Apple kept outside of its event altogether...",
    "Apple was the first major tech company to popularize the podcasting format with its iTunes player, and, seeing increased competition from the likes of Spotify and Amazon\u2019s audible, it\u2019s looking to secure its place in the market for years to come. It\u2019s putting out a new-and-improved Apple Podcasts app, that will include some cool new features.",
    "A fully redesigned app will give greater emphasis to personalized recommendations, and colorful landing pages for the podcasts themselves. New channel sections will be introduced to collate similar podcasting content across genres and creators. It\u2019s a great opportunity for podcast creators, too.",
    "There\u2019s a new Apple Podcasts Subscriptions option that creators can tap into, letting them set annual and monthly pricing for their shows and offer up additional premium content for their most loyal listeners, including ad-free listening. It\u2019s an option rolling out to 170 regions as of next month, with Apple of course taking a sizeable cut of the profits (seemingly 30% in the first year of a podcast's lifespan, and 15% thereafter).",
    "Apple wants to take the guesswork out of whether or not your TV is calibrated properly for the best possible image quality. The new Apple TV 4K doesn\u2019t just feature the speedy A12 Bionic mobile chipset, and doesn\u2019t only come with a redesigned remote with easy Siri voice recognition access and playback scroll wheel controls. No, it\u2019ll auto calibrate your Apple TV box\u2019s output to ensure your screen is looking its best.",
    "This is an interesting approach from Apple \u2013 rather than asking the user to tweak the image using the television\u2019s menu options, it instead tailors the output from the Apple TV box itself, based on a reading that\u2019s given from your iPhone\u2019s camera in an accompanying calibration app. It means the Apple TV can do the hard work of tweaking the image quality, without you messing with settings that might ruin the image for other sources connected to the TV.",
    "It\u2019s the benefit of Apple\u2019s interconnected ecosystem at work \u2013 Apple knows how its iPhone cameras perform, so can be sure of the quality of the reading and information it can send back to the TV box. Very smart.",
    "The rather lovely iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini is getting an all-new color option, for fans of Prince and MacDonald\u2019s Grimace mascot. Pre-order this Friday, and it\u2019ll be available in store from April 30.",
    "Launched with The Simpsons \u201cMmm\u2026 purple\" reference, this is as brave as it gets.",
    "The long-rumored AirTag Bluetooth trackers were finally revealed \u2013 coin-sized devices that you can attach to any item you like in order to help find them if they become lost.",
    "Using the same \u201cFind My\u201d network as the Find My iPhone app, the speaker-equipped tags use Bluetooth LE and Apple\u2019s U1 chip to pinpoint where a lost item is, and offer up directions on where to find them on your iPhone screen. Promising that they \u201ctrack items, not people\u201d, Apple has made sure that privacy concerns are covered with the AirTags, and lets users customize the small trackers with things like emoji engravings and a selection of luggage and strap accessories. Accessories for the accessories. Yep.",
    "Costing $29 dollars each, you can get a pack of four for $99 when order start this Friday, before becoming generally available on April 30. It\u2019ll come as worrying news for rival Tile and its trackers, which has pioneered the concept with its own similar devices for the past eight years.",
    "While the introduction of the M1 chip to the iPad Pro range will get most of the attention, the rear cameras have also been upgraded too. The dual-lens array now includes a 12MP ultrawide camera to take in more of a scene, and that's enabled a feature Apple is calling Center Stage.",
    "With Center Stage enabled, the iPad Pro keeps subjects in shot during a video call. If you move to the other side of your desk or stand up, the camera will try and follow you. Even better, it works with multiple people \u2013 if someone else comes into the frame, the camera extends the scope of the shot so that everyone can be seen.",
    "Obviously it can't work magic \u2013 the iPad won't move to follow you if you walk out of the door \u2013 but it should make framing on video calls a little bit more automatic and intelligent.",
    "Apple\u2019s launched a brand new range of iMac computers, and they\u2019re back to that wonderfully-colorful styling that the first wave of Jony Ive iMacs offered, back in those plastic bubble days. Running on the Apple M1 chip (which is now also in the iPad Pro), seven shades will be available, starting at $1,299.",
    "A new range of Apple keyboards, Magic Mice and Magic Trackpads will be available, in colors to match the new iMacs. But the keyboards will finally come in a configuration that offers Touch ID fingerprint security, keeping prying eyes away from your personal files. Unfortunately, the Magic Mouse still has to be charged from that ill-placed underside port.",
    "Finally, the first announcement Apple made tonight. From the supply chain to the use of its products, CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple is committing to becoming net-zero in its carbon output by 2030, right across its business. Removing 1 million tonnes of carbon every year from its operations, it\u2019s interesting to see Apple prepared to offset the energy costs of the use of its products, too.",
    "Cheeky sneaky Apple decided not to put this into the actual pre-recorded announcement event itself, but made a side announcement stating that iOS 14.5 will be rolling out to iPhone users next week.",
    "Its new features include the option to change how Siri sounds, improved privacy features, the ability to unlock a Face ID iPhone with an Apple Watch, and connect the new PS5 DualSense and Xbox Series X gamepads to devices, too."
