    "Ubisoft has announced that The Division 2\u2019s next major update is slated to launch later this year and will include the introduction of an entirely new game mode.",
    "In a recent blog post on the Ubisoft website, The Division 2\u2019s development team thanked fans for their continued support of the game, which reached 40 million players last year, and outlined its long and short-term plans for the game\u2019s future.",
    "The post confirmed that Ubisoft Massive will continue development, with Adrian Trasca and Yannick Banchereau staying in their respective roles as producer and associate creative director, while there will be additional support from \u201ca talented group of developers at Ubisoft Bucharest\u201d.",
    "In the long-term, the team is planning a \u201cmajor update\u201d which it hopes will bring \u201ca meaningful change to the game.\u201d At the moment the team has confirmed that the update will include a game mode that\u2019s \u201centirely new to the franchise\u201d and, potentially, some new means of agent progression as the team also said it\u2019s investigating this, \u201cwith an emphasis on increasing build variety and viability.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s possible this won\u2019t be the extent of the plans as the team noted that it will be \u201crevealing more about what lies ahead as the update gets closer.\u201d",
    "While it was confirmed that work on the next big update is underway, it\u2019s also still \u201cin its early stages and will take several months to complete.\u201d As a result, players shouldn\u2019t expect to see it launched until \u201clate 2021 at the earliest\u201d.",
    "In the meantime, players can expect to see \u201cnew Apparel Events and some minor Title Updates focused on game health\u201d as well as re-runs of previous seasons. So the game\u2019s next season, which is technically Season 5, will actually be a re-run of Season 1 and Ubisoft says that it hopes this will give players the chance to gather rewards and collectibles they might have missed out on the first time they played.",
    "This outline has come after Ubisoft surprised players last month by announcing its intention to extend the life of The Division 2 beyond its fourth season, End of Watch, which was assumed to be the end for the game.",
    "First released on PS4, Xbox One and PC back in 2019, The Division 2 is also now available on Google Stadia as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, with a recent next-gen upgrade introducing support for 4K visuals and 60 fps."
