    "If you\u2019re a recruiter or if you work in an HR department, then you\u2019ll be familiar with just how busy the job can get \u2013 and just how many resumes you\u2019ll receive for open positions.",
    "While it\u2019s undoubtedly great to have a big pool of talent to choose from, sifting through all of those resumes and applications can be daunting, especially if you\u2019re busy or you have to tackle the task on your own.",
    "Happily, there are plenty of areas where you can quickly examine a resume and see if the person should be on your shortlist or if you should discard the document. And, if you\u2019re happy to spend a little more time with each resume, you can spot loads more information that will show whether a candidate will be a good fit for your company.",
    "It\u2019s a lot to take in, especially if you\u2019ve got to deal with loads of resumes or if you don\u2019t have loads of recruitment experience. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve rounded up the five key areas where you need to pay particular attention.",
    "We\u2019ve got plenty of other articles that are worth your attention if you need new staff, too: here are 2021\u2019s best recruitment platforms, and head here to discover our top 10 tips for finding the best employees. And, finally, there\u2019s our verdict on 2021\u2019s best US job sites.",
    "Understandably, this is the big one \u2013 you\u2019ve got to pay plenty of attention to the employment experience of anyone who applies for your open positions. And with long careers and loads of information to digest, this is one area where you\u2019ve got to really concentrate.",
    "Take a close look at a candidate\u2019s career, and you can learn plenty about their prospects. A person\u2019s previous work experience can indicate if they\u2019re going to have the skills and abilities to tackle your position or if there are areas where they won\u2019t be able to match up.",
    "You can gain insights by looking beyond their earlier duties and responsibilities, too. If you can see obvious signs of increasing responsibility and career progression then that\u2019s a good sign that someone is hard-working and effective, but if you see diminishing responsibility or an obvious career plateau then that\u2019s a potential red flag.",
    "You can find out loads if you read between the lines. Depending on the industry, if a person frequently changes jobs, then that could be an indicator of personality issues \u2013 or it might just mean that they\u2019ve taken on contract work. It could be more pertinent to see if there are suspiciously large gaps between people\u2019s jobs.",
    "If someone stays at their previous jobs for a long period then it\u2019s an indicator that they were happy and progressed at their previous job, which bodes well for your business. Also, be on the look out for concrete data about someone\u2019s earlier employment \u2013 measurable successes are more indicative than buzzwords.",
    "There are some final things to bear in mind when you examine someone\u2019s experience. Remember that people working in a different industry is not necessarily a problem \u2013 they can still have loads of transferrable skills. Similarly, it\u2019s worth considering people who have only held junior roles in the past, because the right person can always grow and develop in your business.",
    "Education is vital in all occupations, and it\u2019s one of the most important aspects of a resume. If someone has the right education for your role, then you can be confident that they\u2019ll have the abilities required for your vacancy. It\u2019s even more important if someone has just left education and doesn\u2019t have any work experience.",
    "The education section on a resume can show off an applicant\u2019s skills, interests, and abilities, and it can also show if they\u2019ve got an education at the level you need for your role. Bear in mind that their education doesn\u2019t necessarily need to match the industry you\u2019re hiring in, either \u2013 a good education can supply the skills and knowledge needed even if it\u2019s in a different subject.",
    "If you\u2019re open to hiring people who have just left university, it can be useful to see if they\u2019ve included any relevant coursework on their resume \u2013 this can function like work experience if that\u2019s absent.",
    "Also bear in mind that loads of candidates will have professional certifications that they have obtained over their working life. These will be crucial for many jobs, so pay attention if you require these for your vacancy.",
    "Any new hire must have at least some of the skills and abilities needed to perform the job, so you\u2019ve got to examine an entire resume to find out if an applicant has what it takes.",
    "Many candidates will include a dedicated section on their resume that outlines their professional, relevant skills, so you\u2019ll be able to see straight away how many boxes that each applicant ticks. That\u2019s incredibly helpful if you need to quickly decide who should progress to the next stage of your recruitment process \u2013 you can see what each candidate has and what they\u2019re missing.",
    "It\u2019s not just about those measurable skills, though. If you read through a person\u2019s previous work experience, then you\u2019ll often easily see what knowledge and abilities they\u2019ve developed and demonstrated in previous roles. Casting your eye over a person\u2019s hobbies and interests can illustrate more skills \u2013 especially interpersonal ones that could help someone integrate into your business.",
    "This is one area that can be hard to read from a resume, but any good recruiter can still draw some conclusions here. And it\u2019s important, because any candidate who can fit into your business and get on well with your staff is going to do a better job \u2013 and that\u2019s a victory for everyone involved.",
    "There are some areas where you can make determinations about someone\u2019s personality and values. Many candidates will include a short personal statement on their resume, and plenty more will have lists of people\u2019s hobbies and interests.",
    "Ultimately, you won\u2019t be able to tell everything about a candidate\u2019s personality from their resume, but you can usually get enough information to help you decide if they\u2019re worth an interview.",
    "If you find a resume that\u2019s riddled with spelling errors, grammatical inconsistencies, and an ugly layout then you can dismiss it straight away \u2013 you want someone with good attention to detail, and candidates with error-strewn resumes clearly don\u2019t fit that brief.",
    "Beyond spelling and grammar, there are plenty of aspects where a resume\u2019s design and layout can reveal plenty about the candidate.",
    "If they\u2019ve used concise, organized, and straightforward language on their resume then that\u2019s a good sign \u2013 it shows better communication skills than a resume that\u2019s filled with jargon and empty buzzwords. Also look out for good contextual information and relevant words and phrases for your industry, because it shows that the candidate has paid attention to the job description you\u2019ve advertised. If they\u2019ve tailored their resume to the job, it means they\u2019re serious and have good attention to detail.",
    "The resume\u2019s layout should be clear and consistent, it should ideally use a modern font, and it should be easy to read. It shouldn\u2019t be too long, either, and they should have followed the directions you provided when you listed the job.",
    "Elsewhere, be aware if people have not listed who you should contact for a reference: it\u2019s a potential red flag if they don\u2019t want you to speak to some of their previous employers.",
    "A good resume should have clear contact details and, if it\u2019s electronic, it\u2019s handy if they\u2019ve included links to their relevant professional and social profiles. This doesn\u2019t just show good attention to detail \u2013 it means you can make sure that their resume matches up with that\u2019s listed online.",
