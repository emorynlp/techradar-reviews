    "Sports fans wanting to watch an Olympics live stream in 2021 should be able to access their usual free or paid coverage from all over the world. While geo-blocking typically restricts coverage when overseas to local providers - and some places of work, study or even leisure may stop you from streaming because of bandwidth restrictions - there's a really easy way to solve these issues.",
    "The answer is as simple as downloading and installing the best VPN service, which will then allow you to tell your computer, phone, tablet or other device that it's in a different country. This means you can tune in to your usual coverage from home, wherever you are, without having to resort to an illegal stream.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is really simple - as easy as one-two-three, in fact!",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top overall choice is ExpressVPN, which represents the best solution for most sports fans this Olympics",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the country where your home broadcaster is based",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's live stream - so if you're from the UK, just head to BBC iPlayer and log-in as usual",
    "That's all there is to it! You'll now be able to watch all the Olympics action just like you would from the comfort of your own sofa.",
    "If you're not in one of these countries, don't worry - the Olympics are being shown in most places around the world, though you might not luck out with free streaming and coverage levels vary considerably by location.",
    "You can check what's on offer where you are with the help of the dedicated Wikipedia page of all of the world's Olympic Games channels."
