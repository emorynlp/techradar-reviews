  "article": [
    "It\u2019s 2021, and if you play a lot of games on your smartphone, you might wonder whether a mainstream flagship smartphone will serve just fine \u2013 or whether a gaming phone is right for you.",
    "In truth, the best phones you can buy aren\u2019t too different from the top gaming phones. Both will pack top specs, big batteries, and great screens. For everyday use, not to mention playing casual games, you won\u2019t go wrong with either.",
    "But let\u2019s drill down to the real differences between the two categories \u2013 how much better it is to play on a proper gaming phone, and what you\u2019ll be giving up by not picking up a more mainstream handset.",
    "Gaming phones aren\u2019t uniform in their features, with unique advantages and perks that differ from model to model. Overall, they do improve the mobile gaming experience \u2013 to different degrees, of course.",
    "These advantages include both hardware and software features. There are a few things that are common among most of them, including powerful specs with leading chipsets (right now, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 is the best silicon) and expansive RAM (8GB at least, though the Asus ROG 5 Ultimate goes up to 18GB).",
    "Gaming phones also typically have big batteries around, and perhaps beyond, 5,000mAh that allow players to stay in the game for hours and still have enough capacity to last until the end of the day. More often than not, gaming phones also have 3.5mm headphone jacks, a feature that\u2019s rarely seen on mainstream flagship phones.",
    "Gaming phones also typically have software that eases the playing experience. These are often branded as \u2018gaming modes\u2019 that have a mix of automatic and manual features. The former include upping the performance or streamlining power consumption so the battery doesn\u2019t overheat, while the latter include toggle settings to block out calls, texts, and other notifications while in a match.",
    "Of course, there are mainstream phones that have their own gaming modes, like the recent OnePlus 9 or Sony Xperia 1 III, but they typically have much more limited options and settings than gaming phones.",
    "Some gaming phones have very elaborate gaming modes \u2013 the Asus ROG 5 and its predecessors have the Asus \u2018Armoury Crate\u2019 software that collects your games into a library and allows you to tweak your performance settings, as well as the \u2018Game Genie\u2019 overlay you can swipe out mid-game to fiddle with settings and change the shoulder AirTrigger mappings (more on that below).",
    "The ROG 5 also has \u2018X Mode,\u2019 which prioritizes performance when switched on \u2013 by default, this is done by physically pinching the sides of the handset.",
    "One of the biggest advantages of gaming phones is hardware: the Asus ROG 5 has two touch-sensitive buttons on the top and bottom of the right side, such that rotating the phone into landscape mode puts them right under a player\u2019s index fingers.",
    "They operate like \u2018shoulder\u2019 buttons on traditional gamepads, which players can map to different functions in games, offering greater control and freeing up screen space that would be covered by thumbs. Extra touch-sensitive buttons are somewhat prevalent in gaming phones, appearing also on the Nubia Red Magic 6 and its predecessors.",
    "The flashiest gaming phone advantages are the peripherals. Many have their own bespoke accessories tailored to the phone \u2013 for instance, the ROG 5\u2019s Kunai 3 gamepad fits controller halves on either side, Nintendo Switch-style, that slide into a case that only fits that phone.",
    "The ROG 5 also has a specific charge port midway on the left side of the phone that its attachments can click into, like the AeroActive Cooler 5 fan. (External fans are probably the most common attachment.)",
    "Does having an external fan noticeably cool your phone? We\u2019ve never seen a phone overheat enough from gaming to see slowdown, though that might not be the case in hotter environments. In any case, the fans do make your phone cooler and thus more comfortable to hold \u2013 and in the AeroActive Cooler 5\u2019s case, add physical underside buttons.",
    "The external controllers are more obviously advantageous \u2013 even if they aren\u2019t as precise as Nintendo\u2019s Joy Cons, they add more precision than touch controls.",
    "Gaming phones also have some surprisingly subtle gaming-enhancing internal design advantages, too. The Asus ROG 5\u2019s battery is split in two for faster charging as well as to keep the actual battery cells cooler and away from where player fingers will likely rest on the back of the phone. The ROG 5 also has multiple cell and 5G antennas spread equidistantly around the phone, so no matter how you\u2019re holding it (including sideways while playing), you should still get signal. Likewise, there are multiple microphones positioned around the phone to hear you speak.",
    "Going for a mainstream phone has several advantages \u2013 or, put another way, gaming phones have several disadvantages. They often have poor cameras, both in lens variety and software for image processing and photo modes. They typically have worse availability, and usually aren\u2019t sold by carriers, which makes it harder in markets like the US where consumers buy plans to pay in monthly installments.",
    "Android gaming phones may not get software updates as frequently or for as long as mainstream phones, and there are no specific iOS gaming phones.",
    "Mainstream phones really are pretty good at playing games, and consumers who aren\u2019t planning to play competitively or aspire to mobile gaming esports have little to worry about if they opt for non-gaming phones. Heck, we make this clear on our best gaming phones page, which lists the top mainstream flagship phones you can still get a good gaming experience while using.",
    "There are also accessories that work just fine on non-gaming phones, especially Nintendo Switch-like controllers such as the iOS-only Jawbone. If you really wanted to, there\u2019s probably an external fan or other gaming specific accessory out there to try. The rest of you can link up their Xbox Series X and PS5 (or Xbox One and PS4) controllers to their phones via Bluetooth to play games, and even buy a clip accessory to attach to their gamepad while playing.",
    "There are good reasons to choose gaming phones, and good reasons to stick with normal non-gaming phones, too. Pick the one that\u2019s right for you and fits within your budget \u2013 which is a far more important consideration than stressing over which handset has better game-assisting software."
