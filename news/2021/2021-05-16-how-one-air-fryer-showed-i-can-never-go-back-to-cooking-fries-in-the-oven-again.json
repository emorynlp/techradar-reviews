    "When it comes to cooking, there are plenty of gadgets that can help from the best Instant Pots, which can speed up cooking times when using cheaper, tougher cuts of meat, to the best blenders that can blitz vegetables into silky smooth soups.",
    "There are some gadgets I can\u2019t live without; for example my trusty KitchenAid stand mixer as I\u2019m always whipping up cakes, bread and other tasty bakes for friends and family, while others get used just once and spend the rest of their time cluttering your countertops. So I\u2019m surprised as you, when I admit an air fryer has become one of my must-have kitchen gadgets.",
    "I\u2019ve tested air fryers in the past, and felt very disappointed with them. What\u2019s the point if all they can offer is soggy fries and anemic-looking chicken? However, when I reviewed the Instant Vortex Plus Air Fryer, I was blown away by the results.",
    "It\u2019s taken the top-spot in the best air fryers and now I\u2019m considering changing the way I cook fries forever. Here\u2019s why I think an air fryer is the best way to make fries, and more.",
    "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love fries as much as the next person but I also try to eat as healthily as possible, so I\u2019ve never been one to deep fry chips, or anything else for that matter. Instead, when I felt like indulging in some tasty treats, I\u2019d make my own oven-baked fries.",
    "It\u2019s a time-consuming process though, once I\u2019d peeled and chopped potatoes, par-boiled them for five minutes, and then coated them in low-calorie spray oil, while the oven was pre-heating. Then they\u2019d cook for 15 minutes, then I\u2019d remove the tray and painstakingly turn each fry before letting them cook for 15 minutes again. A quick process it certainly wasn\u2019t.",
    "However, the air fryer can shave 10-15 minutes of the overall cooking time, as fries take just 20 minutes.",
    "Once the potatoes are peeled and chopped, they do need to be soaked in water for at least 10 minutes and then thoroughly dried (to ensure a crisp exterior and so they don\u2019t stick together), but in a bid to stick to my healthy eating regime plan meals in advance and usually do some of the prep in the morning or at lunchtime.",
    "This includes peeling and chopping potatoes and then leaving them in a bowl of water so they don\u2019t go brown, meaning there are no extra steps involved here.",
    "There\u2019s also no need to carefully turn each chip halfway through, as the frying basket allows hot air to circulate. Instead, the food just needs a quick shake halfway through cooking, and the Instant Vortex Plus even offers up an audible alert when I need to do this.",
    "It's not just fries that can be cooked in an air fryer, I also cooked-up some delicious chicken wings with similar crisp crunchy skin, and succulent tender meat, meaning it\u2019s so much more than a one-it wonder.",
    "It\u2019s not just the time aspect either. The Instant Vortex Plus has a wipe clean frying basket with a dishwasher-safe crisper tray that\u2019s less than half the overall footprint of the oven tray I use to cook fries in the oven.",
    "I usually find there\u2019s not enough room in the dishwasher when I\u2019ve cooked a full meal to include the oven tray, so I have to wait until one cycle has ended and then put the dishwasher on again to ensure the tray can be cleaned too. However the air fyer\u2019s crisper tray takes up the same amount of space in the dishwasher as an extra dinner plate, so I have no problems fitting it in the dishwasher load after I\u2019ve eaten.",
    "The air fryer uses less energy than my oven, too (full disclosure I have a freestanding electric cooker that has an induction hob on top so uses more energy than many standard electric built-in ovens).",
    "To cook fries, my oven needs to be in use for 40 minutes (10 minutes preheating and 30 minutes cooking), which uses 0.63kwh while the air fryer uses 0.5kwh in the 20 minutes it takes to cook fries. `",
    "There are downsides though - the Instant Vortex Plus is a bulky appliance and does take up a fair amount of countertop space (sadly, I don\u2019t have a cupboard I can stash it away in when it\u2019s not in use) and it doesn\u2019t come cheap at $119.95 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$269",
    "However for me, at least, these downsides pale into insignificance when I put that crisp, fluffy fry into my mouth - that\u2019s heaven and makes the air fryer worth the cost and countertop space. I certainly won\u2019t be making fries any other way from now on."
