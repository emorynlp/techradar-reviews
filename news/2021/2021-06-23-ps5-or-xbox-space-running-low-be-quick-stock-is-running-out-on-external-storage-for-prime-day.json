    "Amazon's Prime Day deals are now live, and there's a great selection of external hard drives that can give you more room to store your favorite games.",
    "With Sony's PlayStation Plus and Play at Home initiatives, there's been plenty of opportunity to download a plethora of games for your PS5 console for free. This eventually all adds up on the internal SSD, which still can't be expanded at the moment.",
    "Let's not also forget the huge library that Xbox Game Pass offers, alongside the upcoming games of Forza Horizon 5 and Halo Infinite arriving, there's going to be a need for a bigger hard drive to store all of these at once.",
    "But do remember that while you can store PS5 games on an external drive, you can't play them. You'll need to transfer them back onto the console's external drive if you want to boot them up.",
    "Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region.",
    "The main factor to consider when looking at an external drive for your PS5 or Xbox Series X is how much storage you think you will need for the coming months. With Halo Infinite, Horizon Forbidden West and more coming throughout the year, it may be best to look at a drive that has at least 2TB of storage.",
    "No matter where you live, though, you'll find all the lowest prices for external hard drives from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
