    "GameStop still has some incredible Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals available right now, with several of the best titles for the hybrid system available at impulse-buy prices.",
    "The list of Switch games on offer includes notable titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for $39.99, Fire Emblem: Three Houses for $35, Monster Hunter Rise for $24.99, and Hades for $18.99. (Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region - and check out our Black Friday deals live blog for all the latest stuff still available).",
    "Some of the games on offer are pre-owned or digital download codes but don\u2019t let that put you off. Nintendo Switch games come on sturdy little cartridges, so you needn\u2019t worry about scratches or damaged discs being a problem. Digital downloads also have the benefit of being instantly accessible whenever you want to play, as you don't have to bother switching between Game Cards.",
    "It\u2019s rare that we see this many great offers on Nintendo Switch games during Black Friday, as there really is a huge variety of games discounted. Stock is also holding extremely well for the most part, which is a surprise considering how popular the Switch is right now.",
    "However, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the majority of these deals are snapped up before Cyber Monday, so don\u2019t wait around if you want to bulk up your Switch library for less.",
    "The Nintendo Switch is home to some fantastic titles, and when a deal comes along it\u2019s best to act fast. Nintendo\u2019s first-party games rarely go on sale, and discounts tend to be meager at best. GameStop\u2019s Black Friday deals are well worth pouncing on, then, as it\u2019ll be a while before we see these types of offers again.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the best Nintendo Switch games from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
