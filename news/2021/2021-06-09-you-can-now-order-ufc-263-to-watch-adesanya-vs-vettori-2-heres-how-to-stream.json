    "Israel \"The Last Stylebender\" Adesanya returns to the Octagon this weekend as he puts his middleweight crown on the line for a much-anticipated rematch against old foe Marvin Vettori at UFC 263.",
    "Looking to put the disappointment of his light heavyweight title fight defeat against Jan B\u0142achowicz back in March at UFC 259 behind him, Adesanya will once once again face Italian star Vettori in a 185-pound title showdown on Saturday.",
    "Set to take place on Saturday, June 12, it's a card no MMA fan will want to miss - read on to find out how to book UFC 263 and watch all the action from Arizona online from anywhere.",
    "The pair last met in 2018, with Adesanya coming out on top via a narrow split decision in a fight that could have easily gone either way.",
    "Vettori has bounced back well since that defeat, winning his last five bouts, with his last victory coming against Kevin Holland in April via a unanimous decision, in a fight that saw the 27-year-old land 11 takedowns.",
    "The bill also includes Nate Diaz vs Leon Edwards as co-main event in a long-awaited welterweight match-up originally scheduled for UFC 263, that was nixed after Diaz suffered a minor injury in training.",
    "Read on to discover how to order ESPN Plus's UFC PPV now and get prepared to watch Adesanya vs Vettori 2 at UFC 263.",
    "As well as all the action from Arizona, a subscription to ESPN+ opens up access to exclusive live UFC Fight Nights, alongside original content including Dana White\u2019s Contender Series, UFC Destined, and Ariel & The Bad Guy, plus classic fights, replays, and there\u2019s also the perk of fewer adverts.",
    "Outside of UFC live streams and coverage, ESPN Plus continues to pick up loads of other great live sport action. Alongside top rank boxing, it also shows loads of European soccer, and even gets the odd NHL and NFL game. Considering you get the whole year for less than an effective $30 with the above bundle, it's hard to ignore the value."
