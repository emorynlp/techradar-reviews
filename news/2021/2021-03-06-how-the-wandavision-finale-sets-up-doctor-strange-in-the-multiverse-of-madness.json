    "Spoilers for WandaVision follow.",
    "The Hulk showed up in Thor: Ragnarok, Black Widow was a key player in the Captain America movies, and Iron Man was effectively the antagonist in Captain America: Civil War. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we\u2019re used to seeing big-name characters cropping up in films headlined by other superheroes.",
    "While it seems likely that WandaVision won\u2019t get a season 2, Wanda Maximoff will live to fight another day in another corner of the MCU. Freshly revealed to be the Scarlet Witch of legend, her reality-altering exploits in Westview, New Jersey, are set to tee up the plot for the upcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness \u2013 due in cinemas in March 2022.",
    "With WandaVision star Elizabeth Olsen long since confirmed to appear alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in the Sorcerer Supreme sequel, the big question now is how the events of the hit Disney Plus TV show tie into the magical action of Doctor Strange.",
    "So we\u2019ve delved into the WandaVision finale to explain what it means for magic in the MCU \u2013 and how it may (or may not) explain why the multiverse is the \u201cnext step in the evolution of the MCU\u201d.",
    "The connection goes way beyond the fact that Wanda Maximoff and Stephen Strange are the two most prominent way practitioners of magic in the MCU. While WandaVision director Matt Shakman has told Collider that \u201cwe have no plans for WandaVision season 2 at all\u201d \u2013 albeit with a \u201cthat could change, of course\u201d caveat \u2013 it\u2019s long been known that Wanda herself will appear in the Doctor Strange sequel. Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s involvement was confirmed in July 2019, when Marvel Studios unveiled its hotly anticipated, post-Avengers: Endgame Phase 4 slate \u2013 including the intriguingly titled Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.",
    "While the exact nature of Wanda\u2019s involvement in the movie is currently unknown, we can piece together a few bits and pieces about the Sorcerer Supreme sequel.",
    "It\u2019s directed by Sam Raimi, who took over from Scott Derrickson after \u201ccreative differences\u201d (as reported in Variety) prompted the director of the original Doctor Strange to leave the project. Raimi has previous form with characters created by legendary Marvel artist Steve Ditko, having directed the three Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies \u2013 the Wallcrawler was a collaboration between Ditko and Stan Lee. Raimi has also brought his Spidey composer, Danny Elfman, along for the ride.",
    "As for the plot, the \u2026in the Multiverse of Madness title is a big clue in itself. As Derrickson told the Hall H audience at Comic-Con 2019 (reported by Entertainment Weekly), \u201cJust because Quentin Beck makes up lies about the multiverse [in Spider-Man: Far From Home] doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real.\u201d",
    "Marvel Studios overlord Kevin Feige expanded on the importance of the parallel realities of the multiverse to the future of the MCU in a December 2019 interview with ComicBook.com. He explained that, \u201cWhen we first started the MCU, it was all about Tony Stark. Introduce the world to Tony Stark and that Iron Man armor. Then we went on to teach people what Asgardians were and learn about Supersoldiers, and then bring them together in Avengers. I\u2019ve always loved space movies, which is why we did Guardians [of the Galaxy] and the audience came with us. I always wanted to do time travel, which we finally got to do in [Avengers:] Endgame. The multiverse is the next step in the evolution of the MCU, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is going to crack it open in ways that will have repercussions for a Disney Plus series before it (that\u2019s not WandaVision), and for movies after it, in a big, fun way.\u201d",
    "It seems likely that the Time Stone \u2013 the Infinity Stone that sits at the heart of the Eye of Agamotto, worn by the Sorcerer Supreme \u2013 will open at least some of the doors to the multiverse. Indeed, a Doctor Strange 2 synopsis that appeared in Backstage revealed that: \u201cAfter the events of Avengers: Endgame, Dr Stephen Strange continues his research on the Time Stone. But an old friend-turned-enemy puts an end to his plans, and causes Strange to unleash unspeakable evil.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s an outside chance friend-turned-enemy could be Wanda \u2013 after all, she and Strange were both part of the Avengers team that fought off Thanos, and Wanda\u2019s use of magic may put her at odds with the Sorcerer Supreme.",
    "Much more likely, however, is that this ally-turned-antagonist is Chiwetel Ejiofor\u2019s Mordo. While Mordo initially fought alongside Strange in the first movie, come the end credits he\u2019d become disillusioned with the way Strange and the Ancient One had flaunted the laws of nature. As (Baron) Mordo is also a villain in the comics, it seems likely he\u2019ll be one of the bad guys in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t think Doctor Strange [in the Multiverse of Madness] would make sense at all if we didn\u2019t have WandaVision,\u201d Olsen told USA Today in January 2021. \u201c[Wanda] has really resisted the role that has been given to her, being this person with abilities and powers. [WandaVision] is like a full accountability and realization of ownership of what makes her unique and the accountability of her life experience. It feels like a coming-of-age story in an adult, womanly way for her with this show.\u201d",
    "The last two episodes of WandaVision revealed that Wanda Maximoff is much more powerful than we ever suspected \u2013 in fact, the witch Agatha Harkness confirmed that Wanda\u2019s even more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme himself.",
    "We\u2019d always assumed that Wanda\u2019s magical powers were solely the result of her exposure to the Mind Stone as part of HYDRA experiments in her native Sokovia. That\u2019s only half the story, however \u2013 she was born with limited telekinetic and telepathic abilities, but coming into contact with the aforementioned Infinity Stone gave them a major turbo boost.",
    "She\u2019s now the Scarlet Witch, a one-of-a-kind entity with the ability to wield Chaos Magic, and also seemingly a Nexus Being with the power to manipulate reality. Agatha explains that the Scarlet Witch \u201cis not born, she is forged. She has no coven, no need for incantation. It\u2019s [her] destiny to destroy the world.\u201d",
    "By the end of WandaVision, Wanda has defeated Agatha\u2019s plans to steal her energy, and shut down the Hex field that had transformed the town of Westview into a living, breathing sitcom. As an unfortunate consequence, the reincarnated Vision and their superpowered kids, Billy and Tommy, ceased to exist.",
    "But\u2026 the WandaVision finale\u2019s post-credits sequence showed that Wanda has relocated to a remote mountain cabin \u2013 possibly in the vicinity of Mount Wundagore, the place of her birth in the comics. While Wanda looked her normal self, a second Scarlet Witch incarnation of herself was busy in a backroom, casting spells and absorbing information from the Darkhold. This infamous \u201cbook of the Damned\u201d is a key source of information on dark magic.",
    "So what\u2019s the Scarlet Witch up to? The fact that Billy and Tommy\u2019s calls for help were clearly audible suggests she was trying to find a way to bring them back \u2013 this would tally with storylines in the comic, where the twin brothers were also magical constructs who were subsequently reincarnated.",
    "In fact, the Scarlet Witch\u2019s \u2018research\u2019 could be what brings Doctor Strange and Wanda together. After all, it\u2019s part of the Sorcerer Supreme\u2019s remit to keep an eye on other wielders of magic, especially those who dabble too much in the dark arts. He\u2019s sure to be interested in someone who can wield Chaos Magic, and may even enlist the help of Agatha, sentenced to a lifetime of sitcom purgatory by Wanda.",
    "There\u2019s also another, more subtle hint that this scene is a direct launchpad for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness \u2013 a slowed-down version of Michael Giacchino\u2019s Doctor Strange theme plays as part of the score.",
    "When Evan Peters showed up on Wanda\u2019s doorstep as her late brother, Pietro, we thought it was our first proper glimpse of Marvel\u2019s multiverse. After all, Peters had played Peter Maximoff (aka Quicksilver) in the non-MCU X-Men movies \u2013 Aaron Taylor-Johnson had previously played the role in Avengers: Age of Ultron \u2013 suggesting there\u2019d been some splicing of realities.",
    "As it turned out, the true explanation was much more mundane. The WandaVision Pietro was simply Agatha\u2019s puppet, a spy dispatched to uncover information on the world Wanda had created. Rather than being a genuine crossover with the separate timeline of the X-Men movies, this was simply a reprogrammed version of Ralph, the real-life resident of the house Agatha had taken over in her chirpy Agnes guise. The fact he looked like the other Pietro has no in-universe significance \u2013 this was just an Easter egg for viewers. The doors to the multiverse remain unopened.",
    "That said, the reality-altering abilities Wanda revealed in WandaVision may be key to unlocking the MCU\u2019s version of the multiverse. In the House of M story arc in Marvel's comics, Wanda tried to use her universe-altering skills to create a new improved reality where life is better for everyone. Perhaps plans for a utopian new universe will be the catalyst for Doctor Strange\u2019s multiverse of madness?",
