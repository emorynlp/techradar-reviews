    "Facebook has announced that it\u2019s transferring the already open-sourced Ent project, an entity framework for the Go programming language, to the Linux Foundation.",
    "Ent was conceptualized at Facebook as a means to streamline the process of building and maintaining applications that involve large data-models, and was released under the Apache license in 2019.",
    "After fostering Ent\u2019s community for a couple of years, Facebook has now decided to move the project under the governance of the vendor-neutral Linux Foundation.",
    "\u201cWith the move to the Linux Foundation\u2019s neutral governance model, we (on behalf of myself and the rest of the Ent maintainers) hope to double-down on growing Ent into the industry standard for data-access in Go,\u201d said Ariel Mashraki, Ent\u2019s creator and lead maintainer.",
    "Created by the Facebook Connectivity team, Ent was reportedly inspired by an entity framework that\u2019s used internally at Facebook.",
    "Since the project was open-sourced, leading technology companies such as GitHub, Mail.ru, Scaleway, and others, have contributed code to Ent, together with Facebook. Besides these companies, various open source projects and groups such as the Linux Foundation\u2019s Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) have rolled Ent into their development assembly line.",
    "That it isn\u2019t surprising says Mashraki given that Ent offers a \u201cunique and compelling value proposition\u201d to companies with complex technology stacks as it lends itself to various use cases.",
    "\u201cThis additional step of enabling open source contributors to take direct ownership of a project\u2019s technical vision is part of our longstanding commitment to open and sustainable innovation,\u201d said Michael Cheng, product manager at Facebook.",
    "Mashraki, who\u2019s recently launched a company that'll create a data fabric solutions provider built on Ent, expects to see a lot of \u201cexciting developments\u201d over the next six months from the project.",
