  "article": [
    "Don\u2019t get too excited about all the rumors suggesting the iPhone 13 will finally get an in-screen fingerprint sensor: a new rumor insists we won\u2019t see under-screen Touch ID until the iPhone 14.",
    "That rumor comes courtesy of noted Apple analyst and forecaster Ming-Chi Kuo, who predicted that Touch ID sensors underneath screens will come for some models of 2022 phones, according to MacRumors.",
    "Kuo didn\u2019t indicate which phones would be getting the in-screen fingerprint sensor \u2013 or under-screen Touch ID, if you will, as we aren\u2019t sure if there\u2019d be any difference between Apple\u2019s tech and the industry standard. While it would make sense for the flagship iPhone 14 models to get the authentication tech, Kuo simultaneously reiterated his previous claims that we should expect an updated iPhone SE in the first half of 2022.",
    "Kuo didn\u2019t suggest the mid-range iPhone would get the under-screen Touch ID, but he did suggest that the iPhone 13 will be the last with a 5.4-inch \u2018mini\u2019 size. Instead, the 2022 iPhone 14 range will replace it with an affordable large phone with a 6.7-inch display.",
    "Given Apple\u2019s tendency to leave some features out of the cheaper flagship phones, like the telephoto lens on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini, we could see the Pro and Pro Max models exclusively getting the under-screen Touch ID.",
    "Kuo predicted that larger 6.7-inch iPhone 14 will still be more affordable than the Pro models, and may cost less than $900 in the US, but will lack certain features \u2013 like an in-screen fingerprint sensor \u2013 to be that affordable.",
    "But Kuo also predicted that the high-end 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 models (presumably the Pro and Pro Max) will have upgraded 48MP wide-angle cameras \u2013 aka the main cameras \u2013 which would presumably be sharper than the 12MP main/wide camera on the iPhone 12.",
    "As always, take Kuo\u2019s predictions with a grain of salt given the far scope of his predictions. While we\u2019ve been hearing about an in-screen fingerprint sensor since July 2020, and several leaks have suggested the feature is coming to this year\u2019s iPhone 13, it\u2019s possible that things could change between now and the phone\u2019s expected release window in late 2021.",
