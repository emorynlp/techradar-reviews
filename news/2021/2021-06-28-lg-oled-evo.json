  "article": [
    "What is LG OLED evo? The new panel technology is whipping up a storm in today\u2019s OLED TV market, by improving manufacturing methods to increase the brightness output possible in an OLED display.",
    "OLED TVs are, by and large, capable premium screens \u2013 though their relatively dim brightness compared to high-end LCD and QLED TVs remains a sore point for many, especially those who tend to watch in well-lit rooms or during daytime hours. While an OLED TV may be ideal for a dedicated home theater room, the realities of some homes mean that a bright LCD display can often be more practical.",
    "That\u2019s all changing with the arrival of OLED evo, which is how LG describes the unique panel used in its LG G1 Gallery Series flagship.",
    "But how does OLED evo actually work, and how much of a difference does it really make?",
    "OLED evo is how LG Electronics refers to the brightness-enhanced OLED panel technology used in its 2021 flagship, the LG G1.",
    "LG tells us directly that \u201cLG OLED evo is a combination of a new panel and optimised processing, available exclusively in G1-series. OLED evo technology is the next step in the evolution of LG OLED that delivers better luminosity for higher brightness and punchy images with amazing clarity, detail, and realism.\u201d",
    "The panel itself improves on LG\u2019s regular OLEDs \u201cwith an added layer made of stronger emissive material that refines the wavelengths of light and as a result, increases efficiency and improves brightness with the same amount of light input. The materials used for OLED lighting have also been changed to enhance and strengthen light intensity and this is what delivers the brighter, sharper images.\u201d",
    "We\u2019re also told that the OLED evo panel was specifically designed for the \u201coptimised processing within the Alpha 9 Gen 4 Processor,\u201d meaning you wouldn\u2019t necessarily get the same results with the cheapest a7 (Alpha 7) chipset range used in the LG B1 and LG A1.",
    "OLED evo is said to increase peak brightness by 20% \u2013 a notable uptick given the usual brightness of OLED screens, which lags far behind the 1,000 nits used to master HDR (high dynamic range) content.",
    "OLED evo doesn\u2019t currently have the capabilities to get to 1,000 nits, but it certainly gets closer. In our LG G1 review, we recorded a peak brightness reading of \u201cjust over 870 nits\u201d rather than the \u201c754 nits of last year\u2019s GX range.\u201d",
    "We noted that \u201cthe peak brightness reduces by 100 nits or so when you shift from the (inadvisable) Vivid picture preset to Standard,\u201d meaning those gains aren\u2019t entirely felt in more commonly-used picture modes. The extent of the G1 brightness improvement versus the GX, though, tends to be between 10% and 20% across all picture presets.\u201d",
    "The difference isn\u2019t seismic, but the LG G1 is certainly a better friend to high dynamic range imagery than any LG OLED before it.",
    "LG wouldn\u2019t be drawn on plans to implement OLED evo into its other television ranges, like the C Series, B Series or A Series, telling us that \u201cLG is unable to comment on the next stage of product development regarding increased brightness in future models.\u201d",
    "However, we can predict a likely rollout of OLED evo based on the expansion of the 48-inch OLED TV size that first released last year.",
    "At first, the LG CX was the only OLED TV on the market to come in a 48-inch size, followed shortly by the Sony A9S and Philips OLED+935. In 2021, though, it\u2019s a bit more common, coming to both the LG C1 and entry-level A1 \u2013 with options for both a premium model and a more affordable one.",
    "We expect to see OLED evo return in the Gallery Series model next year \u2013 likely named the \u2018G2\u2019 \u2013 though it could always come to the C Series, or even the 8K OLED TV (Z Series) for truly high-end buyers.",
    "So far, you\u2019ll only get OLED evo with LG Electronics \u2013 which makes sense, given its close relationship with OLED panel supplier LG Display. However, we do expect that to change relatively soon, if just to make sure LG Display can start producing OLED evo at a larger (and more cost-effective) scale.",
    "We recently reported that researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a new electrode that can \"liberate\" more light from self-emissive OLED panels \u2013 at the same time as increasing energy efficiency and improving the battery life of portable OLED displays (smartphones and the like).",
    "The new design replaces a typically transparent module with a 5nm silver layer (on a copper base) that better directs light and ensures less light is lost in the transition between the panel\u2019s diodes and the glass surface above them. The study\u2019s authors claim that they recorded a 20% brightness increase, but predict that a 40% increase would be possible for manufacturers too.",
    "It\u2019s that 40% increase that would really help OLED TVs compete with the brightness of QLED screens. And while brightness isn\u2019t everything \u2013 contrast, black levels, color accuracy and processing all playing a huge part in determining a set\u2019s picture quality \u2013 ridding OLED of this weak spot would certainly help to elevate the technology in the face of the Mini LED and Micro LED displays now entering the market."
