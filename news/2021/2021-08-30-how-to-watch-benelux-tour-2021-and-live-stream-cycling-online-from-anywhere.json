    "You may know it better as the BinckBank Tour or the Eneco Tour, but - 16 years after its conception - the seven-stage cycling race across the Netherlands and Belgium has broken free from the shackles of its sponsors and reinvented itself as the Benelux Tour. There's plenty of stars out in force, so join us for a spin as we explain how to get a 2021 Benelux Tour live stream and watch UCI WorldTour cycling online from anywhere. We also have info on this year's Benelux Tour stage times.",
    "Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Fenix) and Tom Dumoulin (Jumbo-Visma) are the biggest names in contention. The former won last year's shortened edition of the race, but there are doubts surrounding the fitness of the defending champion, who's been struggling with back issues. So, barring a remarkable recovery from the Dutchman, the stage is set for a new champion to be crowned.",
    "And with the riders looking to get a strong performance in their legs ahead of the UCI Road World Championships in a few weeks' time, there should be no shortage of tussles at the front of the pack.",
