    "Windows 11 has fully leaked online, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Microsoft from moving forward with its teaser trailers. In a new tweet to remind Windows fans of its upcoming Microsoft Event, it just dropped another teaser trailer for Windows 11.",
    "The new teaser is a short, 10-second video, but there\u2019s enough to unpack here. The model\u2019s face is bathed in blue lighting, the very same shade of blue featured on the leaked Windows 11 background image. There\u2019s also a close-up shot of the model\u2019s ear, which seems to reinforce a previous teaser video, which alludes to a new startup sound for Windows 11.",
    "Although a version of Windows 11 has already been leaked, featuring a total rework of the Windows UI so that it looks slightly reminiscent of the macOS, it\u2019s entirely possible that many elements of the upcoming OS have been since been changed. That means that Microsoft could still have a few surprises in store.",
    "Our sister site Windows Central was able to take Windows 11 for a quick spin, and we\u2019re seeing a total rework of the Windows user interface. There\u2019s an appealingly minimalist background image and a new taskbar whose icons seem to be centred at default while the Microsoft Store seems to be sporting a slightly cleaner, less crowded look. And, they all seem to point at Microsoft getting a few inspirations from Apple\u2019s macOS.",
    "Still, this leaked version is likely to be an earlier one, which could mean that Microsoft has made a lot of changes since then. We could be looking at something audio-related that\u2019s much bigger than new sounds judging from this new trailer, or possibly more updates to improve user experience on touchscreens and multi-monitor setups.",
    "Whatever these new updates will be, we\u2019ll definitely be getting much more than what we\u2019ve seen so far \u2013 at least, if Microsoft were to justify a new numbered moniker to its OS, instead of simply rolling out another Windows 10 update.",
    "Whatever they are, we won\u2019t have to wait too long as the Microsoft Event is only a few days away on June 24. In the meantime, we\u2019ll keep you updated on any fresh Windows 11 leaks and rumors to come out before then."
