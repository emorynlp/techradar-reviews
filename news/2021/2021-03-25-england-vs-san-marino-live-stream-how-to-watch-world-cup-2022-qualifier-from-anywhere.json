Read on for your full guide to getting an England vs San Marino live stream and watch this World Cup 2022 qualifier where it's being shown exclusively in the US on ESPN Plus.",
    "England couldn't have asked for a softer start for their bid to reach next year's tournament in Qatar as they face the worst-ranked team in FIFA's world rankings. San Marino have famously never won a competitive football match, with the nation's single victory coming with a 1\u20130 win over Liechtenstein in a friendly match back in 2004.",

    "With Robert Lewandowski's Poland coming up, there are far bigger challenges ahead for England, but Southgate will be hoping for a professional performance from his players here as he looks to build confidence and perhaps experiment with his line up. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins could make his first start for his country, while the recalled Jesse Lingard will be looking to replicate his scintillating West Ham form on the international stage.",
