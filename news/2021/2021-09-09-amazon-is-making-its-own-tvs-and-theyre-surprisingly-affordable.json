  "article": [
    "Amazon has taken the wraps off its first-ever in-house 4K TV series, called the Amazon Fire TV Omni Series, that was designed to compete with LG, Samsung and Sony televisions.",
    "The new series of televisions will be available starting in October in 43-, 50-, 55-, 65-, and 75-inch sizes - but for now Amazon says they\u2019ll only be available in the US at Best Buy and Amazon.",
    "What separates the Omni Series from other TVs - even the Amazon Fire TVs that were developed with Toshiba and Insignia - is a deeper level of integration with Amazon\u2019s own services.",
    "For starters, it\u2019s the first Alexa Home Theater device that can use Amazon Echo devices as surround sound speakers. In addition, the Omni comes with a built-in microphone for Alexa commands (similar to the Fire TV Cube) and they\u2019ll offer several new commands like \u201cAlexa, What Should I Watch?\u201d that will make their debut on the Omni series.",
    "While they won\u2019t support every new standard in 4K TVs - they\u2019re basic LED-LCD TVs without a quantum dot filter - the Omni series does support a number of new standards including HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision in the 65-inch and 75-inch models.",
    "Amazon didn\u2019t specify whether the TVs will be native 120Hz with HDMI 2.1 ports (we\u2019re leaning towards a no there) but they will support Dolby Atmos audio if they\u2019re connected to an Amazon Echo Studio speaker.",
    "More surprising, however is their cost: they start at just $409 (around \u00a3300, AU$550). That puts them in the same range as most budget TVs from the big-name players, and you're getting a ton of features inside the box.",
    "At launch, Amazon says you\u2019ll be able to use the TV like an Alexa device to turn devices on and off, but down the road it will become a whole home control center thanks to the all-new smart home dashboard. With it, you\u2019ll be able to view security camera feeds on the TV and control groups of devices all while watching your TV.",
    "Finally, if you want to use your TV like a video conferencing device, Amazon says it will enable the Omni TV to work with Zoom and Alexa Calling by plugging in a webcam.",
    "If previous years' data is anything to go by, Amazon's got a huge hit on its hands with the Omni TVs - even if they aren't the best-looking TVs ever made.",
    "In an interview with TechRadar, Daniel Rausch, Vice President, Entertainment Devices and Services told us that, as you\u2019d expect, Amazon devices sold incredibly well over Amazon Prime Day this last year. In particular, though, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K outsold everything - and it\u2019s not a stretch of the imagination to think the same will be true for the Amazon Omni during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
    "Considering their low starting price of $409 (around \u00a3300, AU$550) and robust feature set, we\u2019re expecting to see these TVs fly off the shelf\u2026 er, storage facility fast.",
    "\u201cIn terms of capabilities, which is where I think customers start, you\u2019re going to find everything you\u2019d want here from 4K TV across a whole range of sizes, prices and brands. Anyone looking for a 4K TV will find the features at the price point that fit them best,\u201d Rausch said during our interview.",
    "Another nugget from the interview is the fact that the Amazon Omni TVs will support Amazon Luna right out of the gate - meaning you\u2019ll have a TV that can play some of the latest games from Ubisoft as they\u2019re released.",
    "We\u2019ll have to wait to test them for ourselves to see how good they are - arguably the biggest question mark around the new TVs is their performance - but at this price point and Amazon\u2019s clout in the TV sales business, they could sell like hotcakes."
