    "Ben Stokes has taken on skipper duties from the self-isolating Eoin Morgan, with nine uncapped players parachuted into the most makeshift England squad we've seen in years.",
    "The Green Shirts' preparations haven't exactly been ideal either, the Pakistan squad having had little rest between recent clashes against South Africa and Zimbabwe, and the end of the PSL season that has whisked Babar Azam's men from the extreme heat of the UAE to pitches too wet to practice on.",
    "But they'll take that over the chaotic situation England currently find themselves in, Stokes in charge despite being deemed unfit to play just a matter of days ago. He'll be able to count on the experience of Dawid Malan, but the likes of Zak Crawley and John Simpson are those in line to get their first taste of international 50-over cricket.",
    "The good news is that they'll be getting close to the full experience, with Lord's set to be at full capacity and Edgbaston at 80%. And England are going to need all the backing they can get!",
