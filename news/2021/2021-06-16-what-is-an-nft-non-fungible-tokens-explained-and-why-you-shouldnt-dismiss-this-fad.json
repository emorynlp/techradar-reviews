    "NFT, or non-fungible token, has become 2021\u2019s \u2018blockchain\u2019, a word you\u2019ve never heard of before that is suddenly everywhere. Be it Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey auctioning his first tweet, or the Kings of Leon selling their latest album, as one, NFTs are everywhere. But what is an NFT?",
    "Some see it as the latest fad, a new crypto-esque bubble that\u2019s guaranteed to pop eventually, while others think NFTs could have an important role in the future of digital art.",
    "We can\u2019t say for certain which it will be for now, but read on to discover everything you need to know about NFTs, and our insight into why they\u2019re worth watching.",
    "As we've mentioned, \u2018NFT\u2019 stands for non-fungible token, but what does that mean?",
    "If something is fungible that means it isn\u2019t unique, it\u2019s a commodity. Dollar bills are fungible, two bills of the same value are for all intents and purposes identical. Apples are fungible, your box of cornflakes is fungible, your PS5 is fungible.",
    "However, if your PS5 has been turned into artwork by drawing on it or adding decoration \u2013 as you might have seen online \u2013 then it has become something non-fungible.",
    "Think of the Mona Lisa. You could take a photo of it and hang it on your wall but it wouldn\u2019t be the same \u2013 or have the same value \u2013 as the Mona Lisa that resides in the Louvre. Much like other original paintings, the Mona Lisa is non-fungible, in that it's unique.",
    "A non-fungible token is a digital interpretation of that. Someone might have a copy of the same digital artwork, but it\u2019s not the original file.",
    "It\u2019s certainly an odd idea to wrap your head around. When something is digital, the original file and a copy of it are seemingly identical. For some people though there is a \u2018specialness\u2019 to that original file that makes it unique.",
    "While this might seem like those people are imposing an imaginary value on it, it\u2019s not that different to the Mona Lisa example in many ways. Fundamentally the Mona Lisa painting and a copy of it are of the same image; it's just that people have imposed qualities on the original that give it value.",
    "With NFTs it\u2019s that same idea. But while you might not be convinced about them just yet, going forward there may be more tangible benefits to NFT ownership.",
    "Here things get tricky. Some see NFTs as just the latest fad, which like the \u2018GameStonks\u2019 bubble will pop eventually and leave many winners and losers in its wake. However, there are some interesting ideas that could mean NFTs survive.",
    "One example could see content creators reward their biggest fans based on NFT ownership. Potentially creators could host a stream or Q&A where only owners of certain NFTs \u2013 or a certain number of the creator\u2019s NFTs \u2013 can take part.",
    "You could then see people selling their collection of NFTs if they decide to move on from a certain artist. Think of it like a digital version of selling old albums: the seller gets their investment back, and a new fan can catch up with everything that\u2019s come before.",
    "With reselling there\u2019s also the option for NFT creators to stipulate that if an NFT is resold, they get a cut. It\u2019s common for art to become more valuable over time, and this would give artists the opportunity to benefit from that increase in value.",
    "None of this guarantees that NFTs won\u2019t still just be a fad, but they leave open a range of interesting possibilities that mean they're certainly worth keeping an eye on."
