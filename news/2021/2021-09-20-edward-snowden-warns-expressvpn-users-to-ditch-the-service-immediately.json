  "article": [
    "Former NSA whistleblower and privacy advocate Edward Snowden has warned users to stop using popular VPN service ExpressVPN.",
    "\u201cIf you\u2019re an ExpressVPN customer, you shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Snowden posted on Twitter.",
    "Snowden\u2019s suggestion was a quote tweet that shared news of ExpressVPN CIO Daniel Gericke\u2019s role in Project Raven, which involved the creation of spying tools for the UAE.",
    "Gericke is part of the three former US intelligence operatives that have been charged by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) for their role in the spying operation, and have agreed not to contest the charges and pay the imposed fine.",
    "In response to the development, ExpressVPN has released a statement to shed light on Gericke\u2019s cybersecurity background and its decision to stick with its CIO.",
    "Gericke was hired by ExpressVPN in 2019, and while the company was aware of his background, it had no details about any \u201cclassified activities.\u201d",
    "\u201cTo be completely clear, as much as we value Daniel\u2019s expertise and how it has helped us to protect customers, we do not condone Project Raven,\u201d the company added.",
    "The DoJ has charged Gericke and two others for their alleged work as mercenary hackers for the UAE, helping the country create and use zero-click surveillance tools against vocal critics of the country\u2019s human rights record.",
    "Instead of fighting the charges, the three defendants have agreed to cooperate with US authorities and pay the fine in exchange for deferred prosecution.",
    "ExpressVPN meanwhile has decided to standby its CIO, as it tries to allay the fears voiced by privacy advocates such as Snowden.",
    "\u201cSince Daniel joined us, he has performed exactly the function that we hired him to do: He has consistently and continuously strengthened and reinforced the systems that allow us to deliver privacy and security to millions of people,\u201d said ExpressVPN, sharing details of the technology that helps it protect the interest of its users against all kinds of threats.",
    "It\u2019s been a busy couple of weeks for ExpressVPN, with Snowden\u2019s warning following the DoJ resolution that came on the heels of ExpressVPN\u2019s acquisition by Kape Technologies in a deal valued close to $1 billion."
