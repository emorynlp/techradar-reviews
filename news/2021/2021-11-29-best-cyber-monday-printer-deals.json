    "There are some things to think about before looking for Cyber Monday printer deals that will save you a lot of money and frustration down the road.",
    "The most important thing to know is that buying the right printer for you is about much more than the price of the machine itself, since a poorly planned purchase will turn a great deal into a home office paperweight in no time.",
    "The printer market isn't as complex as it looks, though, and we'll help steer you toward the right deal so you get the best printer for your need and budget.",
    "1. Know what you want before Cyber Monday Take the time now to look into the kind of printer you want or need, what your budget will be for the next several weeks, and know how each kind of printer will work for your needs.",
    "Once you know the type of printer you need, research your options in and just above your price range \u2013 early sales and Cyber Monday printer deals could drop many of these into your budget, after all.",
    "2. Resist the impulse purchase Just because a printer is 95% off doesn't make it a great deal if it doesn't do what you need it to do. Look to your needs first, not the price a printer is being offered for.",
    "3. Done be afraid to make a return, if necessary Sometimes, you can do all the research in the world, but you won't ever know when a printer is the right one for you until you actually try it out for yourself. If it turns out not to be the right one for you, you can almost always return it for a refund (subject to retailers' return policies, of course).",
    "4. Consider all the costs of the printer No matter the printer, it will cost you money to continue to use it, mostly in the form of printer ink, but possibly other parts as well. Make sure you factor these into your purchase.",
    "5. Check in with TechRadar regularly for the best Cyber Monday printer deals Here at TechRadar, we're going to have a crack team of dedicated experts sorting through the flood of Cyber Monday deals to find the best ones we feel are worth the investment and which ones you need to skip.

    "We picked the laser, inkjet, and all-in-one printer we'd most like to see discounted this Cyber Monday so you know which ones we'll be keeping our eye on.",
    "The Xerox VersaLink B600DN is just about everything you could ask for in a monochrome laser printer, from nearly one page a second printing to its large paper capacity, the VersaLink B600DN is a laser printer's laser printer. The problem is that it costs a small fortune.",
    "And while the initial cost for a monochrome print-only device like this seems pretty high, this is a seriously premium machine that is actually very practical to run with a lower long term cost per print and its consistent print quality justifies the price tag, in our mind, especially if you're in a business that needs to print a lot of black and white paperwork. We'd really just like to see it come down a good bit in price.",

    "Inkjet printers aren't the fastest print game in town, and the Canon Pixma G6050 definitely takes its time to print a page, with an average of just 13 pages per minute or just a little over 4 seconds per page.",
    "The key is that when it finally does finish up that print job, the quality is some of the best we've seen. Canon\u2019s cartridge-free printers are particularly easy to top up whenever you see the ink in the window getting low and they come with plenty more ink in the box, enough to print 7,700 full colour images, or 18,000 in black and white.",
    "Add to this an excellent 250 sheet paper capacity and you go a long way toward justifying its price. If we can get a Black Friday printer deal on this one, we'd very easily recommend it for creatives, students, and other non-enterprise users.",
    "Read the full review: Canon Pixma G6050",
    "A great All-In-One printer has a rep for being the Jack-of-all-trades of home office machines, and that assessment isn't wrong, but the truly best don't succumb to the master-of-none downside that comes with versatility.",
    "The Brother MFC-J5330DW is a color inkjet printer that produces high quality photos with truly accurate color, a relatively fast 22 PPM (mono) and 20 PPM (color) printing rate, though your performance may vary with the nature of your print. It is able to print A3 size paper as well, making it well suited for special projects and poster printing.",
    "It's somewhat pricey at retail, especially since you're locked into having to buy expensive color inks throughout its effective life, so if this all-in-one printer gets a big enough price cut this Black Friday, we definitely suggest you give this one a long look.",
