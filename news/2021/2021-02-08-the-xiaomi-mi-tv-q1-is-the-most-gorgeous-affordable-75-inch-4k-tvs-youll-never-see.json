  "summary": "We hear the details on Xiaomi\u2019s big 75-inch Mi TV Q1 that we might never get",
  "article": [
    "Xiaomi is taking the wraps off its new 75-inch Mi TV Q1, its flagship 4K HDR TV that incorporates both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ and packs Android 10. It\u2019s Xiaomi\u2019s most premium TV to date and, the company told me in an interview, could rival the Samsung Q80T in both specs and usability.",
    "How? Emory Babb, a product marketing manager at Xiaomi, tells us that the Q1 TV will have an HDMI 2.1 port with auto low latency, a native 120Hz refresh rate that will pair nicely with the Xbox Series X and PS5, and a full array local dimming panel with 192 zones. The result should be that it offers ultra-wide viewing angles and high color saturation that rivals Samsung.",
    "\u201cThe TV we had in mind was the Q80T 75-inch, as far as specs go. We like to think we compete pretty closely with them \u2013 but we\u2019re separating ourselves by offering the HDR10+ and Dolby Vision as well,\u201d Babb says. \u201cIt\u2019s the TV we\u2019d compare ourselves to the most \u2013 but at a more affordable price.\u201d",
    "To that point, while the Samsung Q80T costs $2,499 for a 75-inch model, the Xiaomi Mi TV Q1 will cost a mere \u20ac1,299 (around $1,550, \u00a31,140, AU$2,000).",
    "So what\u2019s the catch? Babb and the team at Xiaomi says that, while the TV will be rolling out in over a dozen countries today \u2013 with special limited-time discounts in Spain, Germany, Italy and France \u2013 the US, UK and Australia won\u2019t be among the countries getting one.",
    "Based on the specs and expected price, that\u2019s an utter shame.",
    "If you live in most parts of Asia, Xiaomi is a brand you know intimately for its Mi Series, Mi Note Series, Mi Max Series, Mi Mix Series, Redmi and POCO Series Android devices. It\u2019s currently the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, surpassing Apple (and, briefly, Huawei) in global sales, and has over 300 million active users.",
    "Alongside the Mi TV Q1, Xiaomi is also announcing Mi Electric Scooter Pro 2 special edition \u2013 because yes, it also makes scooters. That's not all, though: Xiaomi recently debuted its Xiaomi Mi 10i 5G flagship phone back in January, and just last week showed off a quad-curved concept phone that doesn\u2019t have any ports or buttons.",
    "On the AV side of things, the company moved into TVs and expanded the reach into the European market \u2013 a competitive space usually dominated by Samsung, Panasonic, Philips and LG \u2013 but that didn\u2019t stop Xiaomi from releasing its Mi TV 4 in Spain, Germany and Russia in 2020 while the US got the Mi TV Stick.",
    "The company hasn\u2019t moved its flatscreen TV business to the United States or United Kingdom, countries that are smaller markets than Asia, but are equally as competitive because of just how many manufacturers, both big and small, try to vie for a spot on the shelves here.",
    "Not helping matters, though, is that Xiaomi also had a bit of a problem with the US government, whose concerns about its ties to Communist Chinese military led to the company being put on a blacklist for US investors \u2013 the same thing that happened to one of its biggest rivals, Huawei, a few years ago.",
    "That wasn\u2019t something Babb was authorized to speak to me about, unfortunately, though Xiaomi has put out a statement saying that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military and is not a \u201cCommunist Chinese Military Company\u201d as defined by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), recently filing a lawsuit against the United States for that allegation.",
    "It\u2019s important to understand how Xiaomi fits within the global landscape before we hit you with the bad news: despite this TV being a properly-priced 120Hz 4K TV that could finally answer our question of where all the affordable 120Hz HDMI 2.1 TVs are, it\u2019s definitely not coming to the US, and a release in the UK or Australia doesn't look likely, either.",
    "That\u2019s a shame considering what the Xiaomi Mi TV Q1 brings to the table.",
    "In some specs shared by Babb and the team at Xiaomi, the Q1 uses a quantum dot filter to hit 95% of the DCI-P3 color space with a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits. Babb says that the TV has a viewing angle of 178 degrees without significant desaturation, and uses a quad-core Mediatek processor.",
    "Admittedly, a lot of smart TVs use quad-core processors to power their individual upscaling algorithms that upscale HD content into 4K images, so that's not unique to this TV, but it's worth mentioning, if just for clarity.",
    "Moreover, fans of next-gen consoles will appreciate that the TV has an HDMI 2.1 port, with support for auto low latency mode. The Q1 has Chromecast built-in and Miracast support as well for screen sharing, and outputs 30W of sound via two tweeters and four woofers.",
    "Because it uses Android TV, it\u2019ll also have a voice assistant and IoT integrations as well. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Google Assistant built into the TV that can hear you from three meters away,\u201d Babb says. \u201cSpeak and you shall receive.\u201d However, if you\u2019re concerned about the smart assistant listening when it shouldn\u2019t, there\u2019s also a physical switch to turn off active listening.",
    "While there\u2019s still some specs that could be pushed higher \u2013 the peak brightness is only 1,000 nits instead of, say, 2,000 or 2,500 that Samsung\u2019s top QLEDs can reach \u2013 these are some very decent specs for a 75-inch TV that costs as much as most 65-inch screens.",
    "With solid specs and a salivating price tag, there\u2019s little doubt that a TV like the Xiaomi Mi TV Q1 would win some fans in the AV community \u2013 but could Xiaomi stand up to the crowded American and British TV markets?",
    "According to Babb, Xiaomi isn\u2019t afraid of the competition.",
    "\u201cWe embrace the competition,\u201d Babb says. \u201cIt drives us to do better \u2013 to further innovate. But we think our user experience is really going to set us apart. I mentioned the far-field mic, but we also have a mic built into the remote \u2013 which, instead of IR, uses Bluetooth. We also, of course, have the most accessible price.\u201d",
    "In India, Xiaomi has definitely found its footing. Sudhanshu Singh, who reviewed the Xiaomi Mi TV 4X Pro for TechRadar, said it was the top choice for an affordable 55-inch television and a superb value for the sticker price of Rs 39,999 (around $550 / \u00a3400 / AU$700).",
    "But the US has TCL and Vizio, two extremely popular TV companies that routinely pump out 55-inch 4K HDR TVs for around the same price, as well as big names like Samsung, LG and Sony that charge more for similar specs.",
    "Even if you disregard the recent drama with the US government, how Xiaomi could co-exist with these companies is a bit of a mystery. While new players have certainly come to the market and succeeded in the last 20 years \u2013 just look at TCL and Hisense, for example \u2013 for every success story there\u2019s a failure as well (see: LeEco, Panasonic, or Toshiba, all of whom left the US market).",
    "\u201cAt this point we\u2019ve got the streaming stick and streaming box that have been pretty successful. And we would love to bring our products to more people around the world,\u201d Babb continued, while clarifying that \u201cwe currently don\u2019t have any plans for the United States at this time.\u201d",
    "Whether Xiaomi isn\u2019t entering the market because of its fear of being overshadowed, out-priced, outmatched or something else entirely isn\u2019t clear. But, on paper at least, the Mi TV Q1 looks like it could hang with the best of them, should Xiaomi ever decide to offer its TV stateside."
