    "The best 1440p monitors might just be that sweet spot you\u2019re looking for, and not just for PC gaming. Most 4K monitors are still expensive and limited to the 60Hz refresh rate, and while 1080p displays are still widely used, that 1920 x 1080 is slowly on its way out. Their 1440p peers, on the other hand, combine a higher resolution with fast refresh rates at affordable prices.",
    "If you want better and smoother picture quality without spending a whole lot of money, 1440p displays are just the ticket. You\u2019re getting a higher pixel count and more detail, as well as a 144Hz or higher refresh rate, for typically much less money and while requiring less powerful internals than their 4K counterparts.",
    "Here are the best 1440p monitors you can find today, from gaming panels to displays fit for productivity.",
    "Excellent color coverage and all the ports you\u2019ll need are only two of the many reasons why the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 is our best all-around pick for a 1440p monitor. This 32-inch panel also delivers great picture quality, good build, and a strong feature set overall while touting a not-cheap-but-not-expensive price tag. Its 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time are great for budding pro-gamers, its DisplayHDR 400 helps with creative workflows and immersive media consumption, and its multi-mount ergonomic stand makes its very versatile for a whole lot of uses. And, there\u2019s more where that came from.",

    "At less than $300/\u00a3300, the Monoprice Dark Matter 27-inch is a true budget option. But, it\u2019s its solid feature-set that makes it a compelling one. The 240Hz refresh rate and DisplayHDR 400 you\u2019ll get with it are premium features you\u2019ll typically find in pricier 1440p monitors, and already make it a better value than everything else on this list. Of course, being a cheap display, there are compromises like the lack of USB-C and paltry color coverage. However, if getting a cheap gaming monitor that delivers smooth, high-resolution visuals ideal for fast-paced titles is what you want, it\u2019s definitely an ace.",

    "The LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A already ticks off a lot of things on the list \u2013 nice brightness levels, great color coverage, decent 144Hz refresh rate, and both AMD and Nvidia\u2019s adaptive sync technologies. Even its HDR10 support gives it a bit more value, especially at that very affordable price. However, don\u2019t think this is the jack-of-all-trades choice. It\u2019s got the best ergonomics we\u2019ve seen on a monitor. It doesn\u2019t just turn and tilt; it swivels 280 degrees in both directions, pivots 90-degrees to portrait, has a height adjustment of 130mm, and even extends and retracts up to 180mm. This is the monitor for those who need a lot of versatility in their setup.",

    "There\u2019s value in the curve, especially in gaming, as it immerses you even more in your game without straining your eyes. So, we had to include a curved 1440p option that doesn\u2019t take up a whole lot of space. The Samsung Odyssey G7 naturally gets our vote, its 1000R curvature on a 27-inch panel is just the right amount to be properly immersive. But, this VA monitor goes even further, giving you HDR600, a super-fast 240Hz refresh rate, and LED backlight for the full immersion. And, you can take home all that without breaking the bank, as it\u2019s also surprisingly affordable for what it offers.",

    "If you want to fully commit and have the space for it, go ultrawide with the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9. This panel will cost you, probably your entire savings too, but its entire 49-inch goodness is worth it if you can afford it. Among its many excellent features are the 240Hz refresh rate, HDR2000, 1000R curvature, and impressive color gamuts. But, its marquee one is its massive 5,120 x 1,440 resolution that gives you not just plenty of screen real estate, but also a one-of-a-kind experience that puts your right in the middle of the action. Just make sure you\u2019ve got a big enough desk.",
