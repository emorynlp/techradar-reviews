    "While the latest iPhone 13 isn\u2019t officially available to buy until Friday, September 17, right now Apple is letting customers effectively set up a pre-order so that you can just check out on the launch day.",
    "If you\u2019re hoping to get your hands on the newest iPhone 13, you\u2019re now able to go online to the Apple store website and choose which device you want, color, phone carrier, add accessories to your basket now, and set up your payment method so you can just click buy on Friday.",
    "While this pre-ordering process isn\u2019t new, Apple previously only had the service available to customers of the iPhone upgrade program. However, this time, Apple has opened up the pre-order process to all customers, and now both existing and new customers can get ahead of the game by sorting pre-orders in advance.",
