    "For those on the hunt for their next machine, the Dell Presidents' Day sales are offering huge price cuts across a whole range of work, casual, and even gaming laptops right now.",
    "Dell XPS, Inspiron, G5 gaming machines, and even Alienware laptops are all on sale today, and we've picked out a few prime choices for our readers to consider just down below.",
    "Prices start at just $379.99 for the latest Dell Inspiron 14 5000 today, which is a fantastic pick if you're looking for a cheap machine for just general or even light work tasks. As you'd expect from Dell, inside it's packing the latest components on the market - an 11th gen Intel Core i3 and 128GB SSD to be exact that makes it a nifty little performer, especially for the price.",
    "For those with a little more cash to spend, we'd recommend considering the excellent range of Dell XPS 13's on offer in this week's Presidents' Day sales. This 'entry-level' model for $749.99 (was $1,149) in particular looks to be a fantastic buy. Well, we say entry-level, but of course, its Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD are anything but.",
    "And finally, there are some fantastic gaming laptop deals to check out, including this Dell G5 15 for $649.99 (was $909). With a GTX 1650 Ti graphics card, this machine really stands out from most competition at this price point, and the 10th gen Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD make it a great starter laptop for gamers on a budget.",
    "If you'd like to see what else is going on this week, we recommend heading on over to our main Presidents' Day sales page for plenty more deals from all the top retailers.",
