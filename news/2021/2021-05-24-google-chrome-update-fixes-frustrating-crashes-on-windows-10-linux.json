    "After Google Chrome users began experiencing crashes on Windows 10 and Linux last week, the search giant has released a minor update for its browser intended to fix the underlying issue behind these crashes.",
    "Many Windows 10 users recently discovered that Google Chrome extensions and tabs were crashing after they installed Chrome 90 on their systems.",
    "While these crashes closed Chrome completely on some systems, users also reported that they were no longer able to access the browser's settings or extensions page and that new browser tabs were showing a gray screen.",
    "In order to fix the issue, some users tried reinstalling the browser completely or wiping their \u201cUser Data\u201d folder in Chrome though this could lead to data loss. Thankfully, Google has now released a new update to fix the issue completely.",
    "In a new update on the Google Chrome Help website, Google has acknowledged the problem and provided a series of steps for Windows 10 and Linux users to follow to fix their browsers.",
    "Windows 10 users should take the following steps:",
    "Linux users should take the following steps:",
    "Although Google has not officially come out and said what caused these crashes, based on the fix for Linux users, it appears that an Origin Trial experiment pushed out to a subset of Chrome users could be to blame.",
