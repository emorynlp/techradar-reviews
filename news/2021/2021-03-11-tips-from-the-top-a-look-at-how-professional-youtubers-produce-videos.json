    "Ever wondered how professional YouTubers produce their videos? Well, wonder no more. We\u2019ve got some tips from the top that will ensure that your uploads will look and sound just as good as the professionals do. All you\u2019ll need to do is find a subject matter you love, and ooze as much charisma and charm as you can muster to captivate your audience.",
    "Speaking of which, any viewers who come across your videos are far more likely to stick around and hit that subscribe button if your videos look the part. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to ensure you have four key elements as part of your setup: an easy to use online video editor \u2013 like InVideo \u2013 a top quality microphone and camera, along with great lighting.",
    "Let\u2019s run through exactly what you need to do to guarantee professional looking YouTube videos, then, so you can get started on your journey to potential internet stardom.",
    "One of the hardest things about getting started on YouTube isn\u2019t actually getting in front of the camera: it\u2019s finding a video editor that\u2019s not only affordable, but one that won\u2019t bog you down with hours of tutorials or a complex interface.",
    "InVideo is an online video editor that lets you edit and create watermark-free videos fast, and it comes with everything you could possibly need like filters, templates, stickers and more. You can edit and create your first video for free, too, and thanks to InVideos intuitive interface, it\u2019s super easy to get started.",
    "InVideo uses templates to make video creation effortlessly simple. Just select one of the 3500+ templates available, add your media (or pick something from InVideo\u2019s expansive free media library), then customize it to your heart\u2019s content by picking from a variety of colors, animations, transitions and emojis.",
    "Once you\u2019ve got your video looking exactly how you want it, it\u2019s ready to share with the world. With InVideo, you\u2019ll have more time to focus on content creation, and spend less time wrestling with the ins and out of video editing.",
    "There\u2019s nothing worse than watching a video that has subpar audio quality. If your microphone is picking up unnecessary background noise, distorting or simply doesn\u2019t record your voice clearly, it can be grating for any viewer to sit through. Sure you can add music to your video, but if you\u2019re doing any voiceover work, you\u2019ll want to sound crystal clear.",
    "It\u2019s a good idea to invest in a dedicated microphone if possible, then \u2013 one that is preferably a cardioid condenser microphone as this will only pick up sounds coming directly in front, like your voice, instead of everything else in the room. If there\u2019s one thing professional YouTubers always get right, it\u2019s making sure their videos sound as good as they look.",
    "While InVideo can certainly help you save you time and let you make some awesome edits to your videos, you\u2019ll want to pick up a good quality camera or webcam so you can upload your videos at higher resolutions like 1080p on YouTube. With almost every smartphone, laptops, TV and monitor supporting HD resolutions as standard, your videos will stick out for all the wrong reasons if the recording quality isn\u2019t up to scratch.",
    "Most webcams shoot in high definition, but if you really want to achieve the quality that professional YouTubers strive for, we\u2019d recommend a DSLR or mirrorless camera. This is an expensive option, though, and honestly, a webcam is a great place to start, as is using your smartphone\u2019s camera \u2013 many of which are capable of shooting in high definition and even at higher framerates.",
    "No camera or webcam will be able to cope with poor lighting or a dimly lit room, though, and nor will your subscribers. There\u2019s a reason why photographers tend to shoot against well-lit spaces, so don\u2019t underestimate the difference good lighting can make to giving your videos that professional feel.",
    "Always try to shoot in a well lit room when you\u2019re creating your YouTube content, then, and preferably frame yourself with a softbox light or ring light if you can. This can help boost the quality of even the cheapest webcam significantly, and will ensure that you\u2019re getting the best picture quality possible out of more expensive cameras, too.",
    "With these tips from the top, you\u2019ll be able to make video professional YouTube videos in no time at all, and hopefully watch your subscriber count grow in the process."
