  "article": [
    "MSI is going to increase asking prices for its graphics cards due to continuing production woes and GPU shortages from both AMD and Nvidia, according to a new report.",
    "Assuming the report is correct, DigiTimes (via Tom\u2019s Hardware) says that the chairman of MSI, Joseph Hsu, indicated that graphics card prices will be hiked to reflect \u2018tight supply\u2019 \u2013 and that this unfortunate situation could last \u2018through the end of 2021\u2019.",
    "That\u2019s obviously a double blow in terms of bad news for gamers who are looking to buy a new AMD or Nvidia GPU, and if MSI is being forced to increase price tags, that inevitably leads to speculation about other graphics card manufacturers doing the same (as they are all facing the same kind of pressures \u2013 at least on the GPU availability front, and pandemic-related problems).",
    "Hsu made the comments when talking about MSI\u2019s Q4 2020 profits, where the company made less money than expected. Costs were up in the final quarter due to a range of factors that included logistics problems (shipping delays) and Taiwan\u2019s currency strengthening. That said, the chairman was also careful to note that last year still saw a new high achieved in profits.",
    "Hsu predicted strong demand not just for MSI\u2019s graphics cards, but also motherboards and gaming laptops, throughout 2021. These products will be in double-digit growth, Hsu noted.",
    "Asus also recently observed that graphics card shortages will persist, highlighting a shortage of Nvidia GPUs, and noting that price hikes were happening as a result.",
    "Overall, it really isn\u2019t a pretty picture, and MSI chipping in with this latest nugget of negativity doesn\u2019t help matters.",
    "When vanishingly-thin-on-the-ground new GPUs do pop up for sale \u2013 either Nvidia RTX 3000 models or AMD Big Navi cards \u2013 they\u2019re instantly snapped up, with scalpers getting in on the action, and crypto-miners too.",
    "This has led to an odd situation with extreme measure such as Nvidia re-releasing the GTX 1050 Ti (a card which was discontinued two years ago) to give desperate folks an option at the budget end of the GPU market."
