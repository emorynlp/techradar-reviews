    "We\u2019ve finally been given another glimpse of Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign mode for the first time since August 11, 2020, and it looks like it\u2019s shaping up nicely.",
    "According to the game\u2019s latest trailer, which lasts around seven minutes in total, this is \u201cthe biggest campaign to date\u201d and will offer \u201cmore freedom than ever before,\u201d which should excite those who are a fan of Halo\u2019s legendary sandbox-style gameplay.",
    "Players will once again step into the Mark VI Mjolnir Armor of Master Chief, Spartan 117, and face overwhelming odds in the battle for humanity\u2019s survival. You\u2019ll need to overcome a deadly new foe, the Banished, who have taken control of the mysterious Zeta Halo and are hunting Master Chief and the remaining UNSC survivors at every turn.",
    "While Chief won\u2019t have Cortana to call on this time, a new AI is on hand in the form of \u2018The Weapon\u2019. The new AI was created to lockdown Cortana, who went rogue in Halo 5. Her whereabouts remain unknown.",
    "You\u2019ll be able to take the Banished down in any way you choose in Halo Infinite, which will give players more agency to tackle the campaign how they see fit and should create a unique experience for each player.",
    "New threats will also pose a fresh challenge to Halo veterans, such as the agile Skimmers and a sadistic Covenant Spartan killer. You\u2019ll also need to make good use of Chief\u2019s new equipment, like the grappling hook, and call in vehicles like the Warthog or Scorpion tanks to traverse the game\u2019s massive map and turn the tide on the enemy.",
    "The trailer also showed that some enemies will now have health bars, and Chief will gain access to various upgrades, making you a more formidable opponent for the Banished and Covenant forces.",
    "Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign looks more exciting and expansive than the initial reveal suggested. The ability to call in vehicles on the fly and take on bases swarming with enemies in any way you like poses limitless possibilities. It seems like the perfect direction for the series.",
    "Concern about the game\u2019s campaign was rising due to developer 343 Industries\u2019 ongoing silence, with some speculation pointing towards a possible delay. However, from what we\u2019ve seen today, it looks like those fears may have been misplaced.",
    "While it still might not be quite the graphically showcase some gamers expected, Halo Infinite certainly looks like it has benefited from the game\u2019s delay, and there\u2019s no denying that it at least looks like a lot of fun to play. It looks like classic Halo, which after the disappointment of Halo 5: Guardians, can only be a good thing.",
    "Will it live up to the hype, though? We\u2019ll soon find out when the game releases on December 8 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC. The game will also be available on day one to Xbox Game Pass subscribers, and the multiplayer will be free-to-play for the first time in the series\u2019 history."
