    "Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League will include a superhero appearance that fans aren\u2019t expecting, according to a recent report.",
    "In an extensive Vanity Fair feature, which explores the inside story behind the director\u2019s original vision for the DCEU movie, author Anthony Breznican revealed that Snyder has re-shot the film\u2019s ending with a \u201chero cameo that will blow hard-core fans\u2019 minds\u201d. As you might expect from such a tease, the internet is rife with speculation as to which character may rock up when the Snyder Cut launches on March 18.",
    "Many fans had suspected that Ryan Reynolds would reprise his role as Hal Jordan \u2013 aka Green Lantern \u2013 from 2011\u2019s panned adaptation. However, Reynolds has taken to Twitter to refute those claims in typically droll fashion, so it remains unclear who might show up.",
    "Check out Reynolds\u2019 tweet below, and keep scrolling for our theories on who this mysterious cameo could be.",
    "Reynolds could be bluffing to throw fans off the scent, but who else might appear if Hal Jordan doesn\u2019t show up in Justice League?",
    "The obvious choice would be Martian Manhunter, but we already know that character will feature in the upcoming HBO Max movie. Snyder and General Swanwick actor Harry Lennix have confirmed that the high-ranking army officer is a ruse for J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz, aka Martian Manhunter, with Lennix telling Variety that he has filmed scenes for the character\u2019s Justice League reveal. With J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz\u2019s appearance confirmed, this probably won't be the massive cameo that\u2019s been hinted at.",
    "While Reynolds\u2019 Green Lantern incarnation won\u2019t return, it\u2019s possible that another Green Lantern may show up. Alan Scott, the original bearer of the ring, might appear, or a Bronze Age Green Lantern such as John Stewart may reveal themselves to the world. Green Lantern is the only member of the comic book\u2019s original Justice League lineup who hasn\u2019t made an appearance yet, so this would be a cool inclusion.",
    "A left-field possibility could be Shazam. The 2019 Zachary Levi-starring superhero movie included a Superman Easter egg during its final scene \u2013 even though Henry Cavill didn't reprise his role \u2013 and Shazam has been part of the Justice League in the comics.",
    "Snyder won\u2019t be returning for future DC movies, so this could just be a fun little nod to Warner Bros\u2019 wider comic book universe as he heads off to pursue other creative endeavors."
