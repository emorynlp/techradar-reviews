    "Samsung has done it: the phonemaker has finally made a foldable that costs the same as a \u2018flat\u2019 flagship phone. Finally, consumers really can pick between a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 and a Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus at the same cost. There\u2019s no longer a tax for novelty.",
    "Or rather, not a very big one: you\u2019ll still give up photo range (the Z Flip 3 doesn\u2019t have the impressive telephoto lens of the Samsung Galaxy S21 range nor its 50x Space Zoom), and its specs are just a bit less impressive. But with a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, it\u2019s powerful enough to deserve its price with all its features intact, making the Z Flip 3 the most exciting foldable of 2021.",
    "At the same price as the best phones on the market, customers can opt for a Z Flip 3 and not feel like they\u2019re compromising. And for that, they can finally enjoy the real benefit of a foldable: shifting it around to a form that\u2019s more convenient for whatever you\u2019re doing.",
    "For clamshell foldables, that\u2019s unfolding it for most typical phone uses like using apps and browsing the web, then folding it back up to a compact size to slip in a pocket or a bag. The Z Flip 3 does all this, and even minimizes its predecessor\u2019s greatest weakness: instead of the Z Flip\u2019s pinkie finger-sized 1.1-inch external screen, the Z Flip 3\u2019s 1.9-inch outer display is nearly four times larger, making it big enough to have some app functionality like audio playback controls.",
    "The Z Flip 3 is the best clamshell foldable on the market, achieving what the Motorola Razr was building to but couldn\u2019t quite accomplish \u2013 and that is its own bittersweet recognition.",
    "We don\u2019t know exactly why Motorola was beaten to the punch by Samsung to release a phone at a flagship price, but Motorola was certainly first to release a clamshell foldable: as we reported, when the original Motorola Razr was revealed in November 2019, we were excited for the possibilities.",
    "The Razr still had the sleek design and stylistic je ne sais quoi of its flip phone originator, preserving the tactile satisfaction of flipping open the phone and flipping it closed again, but with a smartphone display within. There were issues, though, including concerns about particles invading the gap between display and hinge as well as reports of frigid temperatures affecting the screen\u2019s durability.",
    "Months after the Razr was released, the first Samsung Galaxy Z Fip came out, and it trumped Motorola\u2019s foldable in nearly every way \u2013 better cameras, superior display, fewer screen and hinge concerns, and it could be opened to any angle. Both devices were surpassed by slightly-refined versions in 2020, though they didn\u2019t make big changes, meaning the Z Flip\u2019s aforementioned 1.1-inch display still couldn\u2019t compete with the Razr\u2019s 2.6-inch screen, which was great for previews while taking selfies and limited screen functionality,",
    "The Z Flip 3 would seem to trim the Razr\u2019s advantage in a big way with its 1.9-inch display, but the real victory is in getting to price parity with flagship phones. That is what foldables needed most: a model that would compete with some of the best-selling phones on the market.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is clearly the dominant foldable of the two announced at Samsung Unpacked, but it also retains its predecessor\u2019s premium pricetag, with a starting cost of $999 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,499. Its S Pen stylus compatibility marks it as a device for the productivity-minded consumers, especially since the Samsung Galaxy Note 21 was canceled.",
    "Given the Z Flip 3 is priced competitively with other flagship phones \u2013 including Samsung\u2019s own Galaxy S21 Plus \u2013 but in briefings, Samsung assured TechRadar that the foldable won\u2019t displace other phones in its lineup, and instead be complementary to its \u2018flat\u2019 handsets.",
    "Obviously, consumers will need time to weigh a competitively-priced foldable against traditional phones and decide whether the folding novelty is worth it.",
    "It\u2019s also clear that Samsung is thinking a lot about how people use clamshell foldables \u2013 or, in the year-plus since the original Z Flip came out, saw what a lot of case makers were doing. Samsung will sell cases with a circular ring \u2013 great for hanging off a necklace or to slip a finger through \u2013 and a wide ringlet to feed a strap into.",
    "The consumer debate over whether to embrace foldables as more than a niche choice starts with the Z Flip 3, which could be the onramp for many to consider a Z Fold 3 or other device. If we one day think about whether to pick between \u2018flats\u2019 or \u2018folds\u2019 when shopping for phones, it\u2019s because the Z Flip 3 went on sale at the right time with the right price."
