    "Xbox has always been known for sticking to its guns when it comes to traditional battery packs. As far back as the Xbox 360, players have been given the option of powering their gamepads using AA batteries, and it\u2019s an outdated feature that has also found its way into the next generation of consoles. Yes, Xbox Series X controllers still take AA batteries \u2013 but there\u2019s a reason, we guess.",
    "Unlike PlayStation\u2019s DualShock (and now DualSense) series of controllers, which have always used an inbuilt rechargeable battery, the Xbox controller range has, at least, given players options when it comes to how to power their controllers. But the real reason for Microsoft dragging its feet on batteries lies in a long-lasting deal struck with Duracell.",
    "In an interview with Stealth Optional, Duracell UK\u2019s marketing director, Luke Anderson, suggested \u201cthere\u2019s always been\u201d a partnership with Duracell and Xbox. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a constant agreement that Duracell and Microsoft have in place [...] for [Duracell] to supply the battery product for the Xbox consoles and also the controllers\u2019 battery.\u201d",
    "So, perhaps giving the player options wasn\u2019t always at the forefront of Microsoft\u2019s reluctance to ditch traditional batteries. On whether it\u2019s a partnership that will continue into the future, Anderson clarified the deal is \u201cgoing to go on for a while\u2026 it\u2019s been going on for a while and I think it needs to go for a while [more].\u201d",
    "If we\u2019re honest, the signs of a deal between the two companies have been hiding in plain sight for several years. The Xbox Series S and S both come with two Duracell-branded AA batteries, rather than Microsoft\u2019s Xbox-branded battery packs, and Duracell\u2019s online marketing campaigns also frequently feature Xbox controllers.",
    "But Microsoft could be willing to concede defeat on other aspects of its controllers, after an Xbox console experience survey went out to customers asking for suggestions on how it can improve the overall user experience \u2013 including, tellingly, a question on whether users are \u201caware of features on PlayStation controllers\u201d that they wish were on Xbox controllers.",
    "It\u2019s a question that makes reference to the PS5 Dualsense controller\u2019s adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, features that aren\u2019t included in the new Xbox Series X controller.",
    "Could Microsoft be regretting its reluctance to update its line of gamepads? Only future updates will reveal the answer \u2013 just don\u2019t expect the company to ditch Duracell batteries any time soon."
