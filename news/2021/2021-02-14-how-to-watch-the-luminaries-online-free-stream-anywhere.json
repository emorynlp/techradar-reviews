    "Based on Eleanor Catton's epic, complex Man Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, The Luminaries is an other-worldly murder mystery love story that follows Anna Wetherell (Eve Hewson) as she voyages alone to New Zealand's South Island in search of a new life during the 1860s West Coast Gold Rush, only to be dragged into a vortex of love, greed and fickle fortune. Read on as we explain how to watch The Luminaries online and stream every episode, no matter where you are in the world right now.",
    "At the end of the journey Anna meets Emery Staines (Himesh Patel), who's heading to New Zealand to dig for gold, and they forge an instant, transformative connection, one that they're unable to explain but are overwhelmed by.",
    "However, they're almost instantly torn apart by fate, which itself is ably assisted by the scheming, domineering Lydia Wells (Eva Green), a one-woman force of nature who runs The House Of Many Wishes, a fortune parlor that has become a Mecca for gold-diggers.",
    "An opportunist and an entrepreneur, Lydia knows exactly how much power she wields over the gold-seekers, and blinded by greed and her secret love for ex-convict Francis Carver (Marton Csokas), she's grown accustomed to getting whatever she wants whenever she wants it.",
    "But, not being driven by fame and fortune, Anna alone has no desire to be favored by Lydia, who you cross at your own peril.
