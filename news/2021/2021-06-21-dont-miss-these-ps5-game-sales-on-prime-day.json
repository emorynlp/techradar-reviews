    "Several PS5 games, including major exclusives, have been discounted for Prime Day 2021.",
    "Since the PS5 first launched in most territories back in November 2020, with microchip shortages limiting the number of consoles available, many PS5 games are going to take a long time to see price drops, especially the first-party titles from PlayStation Studios. Several of these games are on sale right now, however, such as Demon's Souls, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition and Returnal.",
    "If you're still looking for some solid PS5 games to round out your lineup, you'll want to jump on these deals. Don't wait, though \u2013 most of these discounts appear to be limited-time deals and won't last for much longer."
