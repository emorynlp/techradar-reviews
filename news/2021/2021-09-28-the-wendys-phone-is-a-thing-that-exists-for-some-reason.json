    "If you\u2019re hoping to snag a new phone this year there\u2019s a new and utterly unexpected option entering the fray, as Wendy\u2019s \u2013 yes, the Wendy\u2019s that\u2019s known almost exclusively for fast food \u2013 is launching a handset, called simply the Wendy\u2019s Phone.",
    "The company has so far been light on details about the handset, saying that it has a 6.4-inch HD+ screen, a fingerprint scanner on the back, and a triple-lens rear camera with \u201cmore megapixels than the Baconator has bacon.\u201d",
    "It mostly looks like a fairly conventional cheap phone then, except with a bright red finish and Wendy\u2019s branding on the back. But there are two interesting aspects \u2013 beyond the simple fact that it exists.",
    "The first is that the Wendy\u2019s Phone apparently has a bespoke voice assistant, which responds to the wake up phrase \u201cHey, Wendy\u201d, and will carry out typical voice assistant tasks like setting alarms and telling jokes, albeit with a Wendy\u2019s spin.",
    "The second is that from the images shared so far there\u2019s no visible camera on the front, though Wendy\u2019s mentions a front-facing camera, so whether this is a pop-up one, an in-screen one (unlikely) or simply a case of the image being inaccurate, we\u2019re not sure.",
    "You won\u2019t actually be able to buy the Wendy\u2019s Phone, but if you live in Canada you can try and win one, by favoriting your Wendy\u2019s order of choice, screenshotting it, and tweeting the image, alongside the hashtags #WendysPhone and #Contest. There are 20 handsets up for grabs, and you can try again every day between September 28 and October 17.",
    "As bizarre as the Wendy\u2019s Phone seems, this isn\u2019t the first time a fast food company has launched a handset. Back in 2017 a KFC phone launched in China, and that one was actually possible to buy.",
    "Similarly, the Pepsi P1 was launched in China in 2015. So it seems China has a thing for phones with food and drink branding, but the Wendy\u2019s one is a bit different for launching in Canada.",
    "The Wendy\u2019s Phone is also perhaps a bit more ambitious, given that it has its own voice assistant on board.",
    "We\u2019re almost disappointed that it\u2019s limited to a competition, and to Canada, because it sounds just weird enough to be interesting, and while it probably wouldn\u2019t be one of the best cheap phones, it would certainly be one of the most unusual ones.",
