    "It seems as if Remedy Entertainment\u2019s thriller, Alan Wake Remastered, will be making its way onto the Nintendo Switch alongside the previously-announced PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC versions.",
    "Spotted by a journalist on Twitter, the Brazilian rating board recently listed a Nintendo Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered. Announced at Sony\u2019s PlayStation September showcase, there was no mention of Alan Wake Remastered coming to the Switch, so if this listing is accurate, it will come as nice a surprise for Nintendo Switch fans who were feeling left out.",
    "Alan Wake Remastered will be running on the PS5 and Xbox Series X with improved graphics, higher resolutions and faster frame rates than the original game, but we likely won\u2019t see the same visual and performance upgrades with the remaster on the Nintendo Switch \u2013 if it is indeed coming to the console.",
    "The Nintendo Switch\u2019s games often have lackluster visuals and performance compared to games on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, with the framerates of some games on the Switch teetering around 30fps, and hitting resolutions as low as 540p, which means it\u2019s quite likely we\u2019ll see very few gamers pick up the Nintendo Switch version of Alan Wake Remastered over the next-gen consoles versions, if they have the choice."
