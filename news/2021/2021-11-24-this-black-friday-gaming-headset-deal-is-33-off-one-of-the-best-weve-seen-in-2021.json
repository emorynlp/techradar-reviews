    "The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal gaming headset has had its price slashed at Game this Black Friday, and is well worth checking out if you're after something a bit more premium to purchase ahead of the holidays.",
    "There's a couple of great Black Friday gaming headset discounts for the Beoplay Portal in both the US and the UK, but Game by far has the best deal right now, who has the headset discounted to \u00a3299, a massive \u00a3150 saving off the usual \u00a3449 retail price.",
    "If you're in the US, Amazon's discount is still worth checking out. The online retail giant is currently selling the Beoplay Portal gaming headset for $378, a decent 25% saving off of retail price.",
    "(Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "There's no beating around the bush, the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal gaming headset is expensive, even at the above discounted prices. However, there's plenty of reasons to buy them if you have the cash to spare this Black Friday.",

    "If you don't quite have the budget for the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal gaming headset, there's plenty of other options available. Be sure to check out our best Black Friday gaming headsets hub if you're looking for another deal, or perhaps for a PS5-compatible headset.",
