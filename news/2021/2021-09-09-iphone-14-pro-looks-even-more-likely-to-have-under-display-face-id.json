    "The iPhone 13 isn\u2019t even here yet, but iPhone 14 leaks are rolling in, and hot on the heels of unofficial renders showing an iPhone 14 Pro Max with no notch, another reputable source has now also suggested that the notch might be on the way out.",
    "Ross Young, a leaker with a good track record \u2013 especially when it comes to things related to smartphone displays \u2013 tweeted a reminder that he first predicted under-display Face ID for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max (a move which would allow the company to remove the notch) back in June.",
    "This would seem to suggest that he still believes this is happening, but in a follow-up tweet he clarified that under-display Face ID is apparently still being worked on and isn\u2019t final yet, but that it\u2019s supposedly easier to implement than an under-display camera. So it sounds like he thinks there\u2019s a good chance it could be done in time for the iPhone 14 range.",
    "His mention that it\u2019s easier to achieve than an under-display camera would also explain why the leaked renders show the iPhone 14 Pro Max with a punch-hole camera, rather than bringing everything under the display.",
    "There\u2019s nothing else new here, but Young\u2019s claims back in June included quite detailed specs for the entire iPhone 14 range, as you can see in the tweet above. Notably, Young\u2019s earlier claims include mention of larger batteries, which fits with the thicker design seen in the unofficial renders.",
    "So between these specs and the unofficial renders, we already have a surprisingly good idea of what to expect from Apple\u2019s 2022 phones \u2013 if any of this is accurate.",
    "While there are now multiple sources pointing to the possibility of under-display Face ID - and with it the removal of the notch - in the iPhone 14 Pro range, it\u2019s still by no means a certainty.",
    "Young sounds a lot less confident of it than Jon Prosser (the source of the iPhone 14 Pro Max renders), and Apple has never been one to rush things, so if this tech is still being worked on, there\u2019s every chance Apple won\u2019t be happy with it in time for it to land on the iPhone 14 range.",
    "Plus it\u2019s very early for iPhone 14 rumors, so it\u2019s worth being extra skeptical of anything you hear. Early rumors are often wrong, or they\u2019re about details that haven\u2019t yet been finalized (and therefore could change).",
    "That said, it\u2019s clear that Apple wants to head in this direction. Many people are critical of the notch it uses, and the company is expected to shrink this for the iPhone 13 range, so removing it altogether is an obvious next step. It\u2019s just a step that could be tricky, and might therefore be multiple years away.",
