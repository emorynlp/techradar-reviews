    "Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s multiplayer mode \u2013 which likely won\u2019t be ready until 2022 \u2013 has had some early details apparently spilled thanks to data miners.",
    "As spotted by DSO Gaming, which claims to have verified the information contained within the game\u2019s executable, there are currently two multiplayer modes which will be implemented: deathmatch and heist.",
    "The former is, obviously enough, a simple deathmatch mode where you\u2019re just going after the other players. The heist mode will seemingly be structured like a quest, presumably co-op missions of some kind (GTA Online has heists, of course), and players will be able to choose from different character classes (assassin, techie, and netrunner are mentioned).",
    "Another nugget of info dropped is that there are references to peer-to-peer (P2P) connections that the data miners found, hinting that the plan might be to eschew dedicated servers for multiplayer.",
    "We\u2019d be very cautious about that latter prospect, though, and of course the whole multiplayer side of Cyberpunk 2077 is still under development \u2013 possibly relatively early development, given what we\u2019ve heard about the release being planned for next year \u2013 so all the ideas floating about here could (and indeed probably will) change.",
    "At any rate, even mere talk of multiplayer at this point will doubtless have many folks grumbling about fixing the existing single player game first (although it is admittedly in better shape on the PC than consoles). There\u2019s also the distinct possibility that CD Projekt Red will feel the pressure to ensure that the multiplayer isn\u2019t buggy for obvious reasons \u2013 again pointing to a long development road ahead.",
    "We recently heard that CD Projekt Red is under investigation by a Polish regulator, and could be fined a hefty amount if its measures to fix Cyberpunk 2077 aren\u2019t deemed satisfactory."
