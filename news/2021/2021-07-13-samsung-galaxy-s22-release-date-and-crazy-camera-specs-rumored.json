    "With only a few flagships left to come in 2021, leakers are already turning their attention to 2022 and the Samsung Galaxy S22 range, which according to the latest leak could land as soon as January.",
    "That\u2019s according to \u201cmultiple industry sources\u201d speaking to Pulse News, and while they don\u2019t get more specific than that, January has always looked likely, given that the Samsung Galaxy S21 range landed in January of this year.",
    "That said, the launch this year was slightly earlier than Samsung\u2019s usual February or March window, so there\u2019s a chance it will return to that for the Galaxy S22.",
    "In any case, the release date is only one of the claims made in this report. The site also says that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will have a penta-lens camera on the back, with a 200MP main sensor and Olympus technology.",
    "There\u2019s a lot to break down there. That 200MP claim is one that we\u2019ve heard before, and we even know that Samsung is working on a 200MP camera. But a recent leak from a reputable source suggested that this sensor won\u2019t actually make it to the Samsung Galaxy S22 range, with the company sticking with a 108MP camera instead. So there\u2019s some disagreement here.",
    "The Olympus branding is also something that we\u2019ve heard rumored before, and other smartphone companies have partnered with camera brands (most recently OnePlus with Hasselblad), so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising. That said, it\u2019s not something Samsung has ever done before, and the cameras on its flagships are usually praised anyway, so it might not be necessary.",
    "Then there\u2019s the claim that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will have five lenses on the back. This, as far as we know, is a new claim, but it too is possible. That would be one more than the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, but it\u2019s a number that we\u2019ve previously seen on the Nokia 9 PureView, and it could help the S22 Ultra stand out.",
    "On the other hand, we\u2019ve elsewhere heard that the Galaxy S22 Ultra might have a continuous zoom lens (meaning it would offer optical zoom at all levels up to its maximum). That\u2019s in contrast to the S21 Ultra, which only offers optical zoom at 3x and 10x, and to achieve this requires two separate lenses.",
    "Why is this relevant? Because if the S22 Ultra does have continuous optical zoom then it could offer all the functionality of the Galaxy S21 Ultra\u2019s camera (and more) with one less lens. So that would likely mean two new lenses added to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, with main, telephoto and ultra-wide already accounted for.",
    "We\u2019re not sure what Samsung would choose to add in this case \u2013 macro and depth sensors are the obvious options, but they tend to be seen as filler, and aren\u2019t often found on premium phones. So we\u2019re not convinced that both the penta-lens and continuous optical zoom rumors are true, but either one of them could be.",
    "Finally, this report claims that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra will support the S Pen, and that\u2019s no surprise at all given that the S21 Ultra does, though there\u2019s no word on whether there will be a slot for it this time.",
    "For now we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt, but hopefully the Samsung Galaxy S22 range\u2019s specs will become a lot clearer well in advance of its 2022 launch.",
