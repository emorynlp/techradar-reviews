    "Shark's AI Robot Vacuum is up there with the best robot vacuums you can buy in 2021, and the brand itself is offering some great exclusive deals on two different versions of the innovative cleaning hardware.",
    "You can now pick up the Shark AI Robot Vacuum for just $299.60 (down from $399.60) at Shark.com, or go one better and save $200 on the XL Self-Empty Base version (now $449.80, down from $649.80). The latter comes equipped with a base station in which the vacuum will automatically deposit 60 days' worth of debris.",
    "You'll need a code for each discount \u2013 ROBOT100 on the Shark AI Robot Vacuum, and ROBOT200 on the Shark AI Robot Vacuum Self-Empty XL \u2013 but this is one of the best early Black Friday vacuum deals we've seen ahead of Black Friday itself.",
    "The Shark AI Robot Vacuum is the brand's top-of-the-range model, and it's only available in the US at present. Like its expensive competitors \u2013 the iRobot Roomba S9, for example \u2013 Shark's premium cleaner comes with object detection and a LiDAR scanner, so it can make its way around your home more efficiently.",
    "Along with the HEPA Self-Empty Base on the more expensive package Shark is offering above, you'll also benefit from the brand's three-year VIP warranty (as opposed to one year on the standalone deal), giving you the option of returning, fixing or replacing your vacuum, free of charge, until 2024.",
    "If you're after a potentially cheaper product from a different vacuum manufacturer, though, we've listed even more cheap robot vacuum deals below."
