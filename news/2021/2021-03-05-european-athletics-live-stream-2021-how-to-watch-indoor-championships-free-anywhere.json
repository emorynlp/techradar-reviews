Poland have raked in the most medals in the past two European Athletics Indoor Championships, and may well do it again, with Lewandowski, Michal Haratyk (shot put), Pawel Wojciechowski (pole vault), Ewa Swoboda (60m) just some of the star names in their 45-strong team.",
    "One of the key battles to look forward to is that between the young buck Mondo Duplantis and resurgent veteran Renaud Lavillenie in the men's pole vault, but the schedule is well and truly jam-packed, so there's no shortage of storylines.",
