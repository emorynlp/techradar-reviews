    "It looks like the Runners of Night City won\u2019t be able to team up after all, as Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s multiplayer follow-up has been cancelled following a strategy update in which president and CEO Adam Kici\u0144ski stated the plans for the game have been \u201creconsidered.\u201d",
    "In the strategy update video released via CD Projekt Red\u2019s YouTube channel, Kici\u0144ski stated: \u201cPreviously we hinted that our next triple-A would be a multiplayer Cyberpunk game, but we have decided to reconsider this now. Given our new more systematic and agile approach, instead of primarily focusing on one big online experience or game, we are focusing on bringing online into all of our franchises one day.\u201d",
    "Kici\u0144ski\u2019s comments come during the launch period of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s sizable 1.2 patch, which addressed hundreds of bugs and glitches plaguing the game, as well as throwing in some quality-of-life updates for good measure.",
    "Instead of creating a separate multiplayer experience for Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red\u2019s strategy update will involve developing a new technology framework that will allow the company to instead integrate online functionality into its existing titles.",
    "Kici\u0144ski elaborated: \u201cLet\u2019s stress this here, CD Projekt Red makes single-player story-driven AAA RPGs \u2013 that is not changing. What is changing is our long-term approach to online.",
    "And by this, we mean ensuring we are properly prepared to implement online elements in our games where they make sense. We don\u2019t want to go overboard or lose our single-player DNA.\u201d",
    "Kici\u0144ski\u2019s comments on the matter of online could be a welcome shift in attitude for CD Projekt Red fans, as they could hint that the company is refocusing its efforts on the current state of Cyberpunk 2077, rather than embarking on an entirely separate project while leaving the single-player experience in the dust.",
    "We don\u2019t know exactly what Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s online functions will now end up being, dataminers have previously unearthed code alluding to Deathmatch and Heist modes, the latter of which may have involved players selecting different classes to tackle co-op based missions.",
    "Whether or not these modes will still be added to Cyberpunk 2077 eventually remains to be seen. On the other hand, we could see a more asymmetrical approach to multiplayer, where players can influence the gameplay of others\u2019 sessions in various ways. This could be similar to Death Stranding\u2019s online functionality, or even the Dark Souls series\u2019 sporadic invasion system, wherein players could warp into another\u2019s world to potentially ruin their day.",
    "CD Projekt Red\u2019s strategy update isn\u2019t relegated to just Cyberpunk 2077, though, as The Witcher series will also be affected. As such, CD Projekt Red could work on future Cyberpunk and Witcher projects simultaneously. The Witcher 3\u2019s PS5 and Xbox Series X update is also scheduled to arrive later in 2021."
