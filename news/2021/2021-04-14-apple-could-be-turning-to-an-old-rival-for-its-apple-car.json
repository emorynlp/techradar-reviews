    "After what seems like an eternity of back-and-forth negotiations for the tech giant, Apple may have finally found a partner to help produce its Apple Car EV \u2013 and it could be an old rival.",
    "According to a recent Korea Times report, Apple is \u201cvery near\u201d to landing a collaborative deal with Canadian automotive supplier Magna International and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 LG Electronics.",
    "The two companies are expected to be collaborating on a venture loosely named \u2018LG Magna e-Powertrain\u2019, and it seems like Apple hopes to integrate this initiative \u2013 whatever it might be \u2013 into its initial round of Apple Car production.",
    "The report suggests LG and Magna are \u201cvery near to signing contracts with Apple under which [they] could handle the initial volume production of Apple EVs.\u201d It would seem likely, then, that the e-Powertrain in question does indeed refer to a vehicle powertrain \u2013 the mechanism used to transmit the drive from the engine (or battery) of a vehicle to its axle \u2013 capable of powering the Apple Car.",
    "Although the report claims contract details \u201care still being discussed\u201d and that the collaboration would merely represent an \u201copportunity to evaluate [the] marketability [of an Apple EV]\u201d, the rumored partnership nonetheless reignites hopes that an Apple-branded car could soon become a reality.",
    "Although LG Electronics might seem like an unlikely source of alliance for Apple given the competitive history between the two companies, the partnership would in fact be mutually-beneficial.",
    "It\u2019s worth remembering that LG and Apple are no longer in direct competition with one another. The South Korean company\u2019s recent departure from the smartphone industry comes as it looks to focus resources on growth areas where its brand is better positioned \u2013 electric vehicle components, for example.",
    "LG isn\u2019t a name traditionally associated with auto manufacturing \u2013 but neither is Apple. It\u2019s this common ground that could finally see Apple secure a partner on its Apple Car project, after several failed deals that reportedly collapsed without much discussion.",
    "It\u2019s thought that collaboration has been a major sticking point for Apple due to an unwillingness on the part of the big car brands to become a bit-part supplier on a vehicle that would ultimately bear the Apple name. LG Electronics and Magna International, though, don\u2019t have that same conflict of interest.",
    "A partnership between the three companies \u2013 none of whom currently maintain a major foothold in the automotive market \u2013 would offer LG and Magna a customer for their EV components, and provide Apple with a supplier that wouldn\u2019t demand shared branding of the vehicle.",
    "In hindsight, \u201ckeep your friends close, but your enemies closer\u201d seems like advice worth taking.",
