  "summary": "LG has shaken up the TV market this year with new tech and screen sizes",
  "article": [
    "The LG TV line-up was strong throughout 2021. We reviewed the LG C1 OLED TV when it was first released and it\u2019s hands-down one of our best TVs of 2021. But the year brought other changes beyond a great OLED, including expanded TV panel sizes, like the 83-inch displays from LG launched in the summer of 2021.",
    "After the success of its popular LG CX OLED in 2020, the TV maker is clearly taking pains to stress that it's tackling any remaining areas for improvement, with across-the-board improvements for the LG C1 OLED, and upped brightness in the LG G1 Gallery OLED through a new 'OLED evo' technology.",
    "LG brought out a new LG B1 OLED. The B Series has been the cheapest OLED TV in LG's television range. But in 2021, that moniker goes to the entry-level A Series. This range still features an A7 processing chip but will likely feature other cost-saving measures too.",
    "There are more 8K TVs, too, with the Nano9Z and Nano9X NanoCell LCD televisions, along with a host of 4K models we look at in detail in the guide below.",
    "Excitingly, LG also launched its Mini LED TV range of 'QNED' screens in 2021, bringing the company's exciting new combination of NanoCell LCD and Mini LED backlighting to the world for the first time.",
    "There\u2019s also increased support for gaming functionality, with four HDMI 2.1 ports for each new OLED set, as well as VRR (variable refresh rate) and game streaming services Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now landing on new LG TVs too.",
    "It\u2019s not just the new LG TVs we\u2019re excited about either, but accessories, like the LG Magic Remote, which comes with LG OLED TVs. This remote really stands out because you can use it as a regular point and click remote, but it also comes with motion technology built-in, which responds to gestures and significantly upgrades your viewing experience once you get used to it.",
    "Read on for the full lowdown on the best TVs of this year from LG, as well as the 2020 LG TVs that we think need to be improved upon.",
    "LG Z1 8K OLED (77, 88-inch): LG's only 8K OLED TV is sure to be pricey, but it's one of very few televisions that meld 8K resolution with the benefits of an OLED panel. It's only available in a couple of larger sizes, though a bit cheaper than in previous years. At the top-end LG OLED, though, you're also getting top-class upscaling, Dolby Atmos audio, and the HDMI 2.1 / VRR gaming features found on the C1 and G1. We've only got UK pricing (below), but US figures are sure to follow shortly.",

    "UK pricing and release date",
    "LG G1 4K OLED (55, 65, 77-inch): The Gallery Series OLED has a successor, with a slimmed-down form factor and an \u2018OLED evo\u2019 upgrade to the picture\u2019s brightness that even the LG CX won\u2019t be benefitting from. It\u2019s set to be brighter than last year\u2019s GX too, and come with the option of a paired Gallery Stand for those not wanting to drill this stunner into a wall. Featuring 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and Atmos too.",

    "US pricing and release date",
    "UK pricing and release date",
    "LG C1 4K OLED (48, 55, 65, 77, 83-inch): The successor to last year\u2019s popular CX OLED is the C1, with a new 83-inch size, an a9 Gen 4 AI processor, and support for Dolby Vision / Atmos. You\u2019ll get the most sizing options with the C Series, going as small as 48 inches and including a new 83-inch size.",
    "In our review, we called the C1 one of the best TVs at any price. It\u2019s missing the new OLED evo panels going into the G1 OLED, but even in their absence the C1 produces colorful, bright and rich pictures with support for most types of HDR. There might be one or two areas for improvement, but otherwise the LG C1 OLED is still the gold standard for 2021 OLED TVs.",

    "US pricing and release date",
    "UK pricing and release date",
    "LG B1 4K OLED (55, 65, 77-inch): The B Series OLED isn't the cheapest model any more, but a new iteration is still coming. It has 40W of downward-firing audio, rather than the 20W of the A1 model below, and has two HDMI 2.1 ports to recommend it as a gaming TV too. It uses the a7 Gen 4 AI processor, rather than a higher-spec a9 model, so you can expect a little more video noise than in pricier OLEDs, but still with an excellent 4K HDR picture.",
    "We now have UK pricing, but the B1 OLED won't be coming to the US. Read more in our LG B1 OLED guide.",
    "UK pricing and release date",
    "LG A1 4K OLED (48, 55, 65, 77-inch): This new entry-level OLED features the a7 Gen 4 AI processor, supports Dolby Vision and Atmos, and packs in 20W of audio, but doesn\u2019t support HDMI 2.1 in its three HDMI inputs (unlike last year\u2019s LG BX OLED). We\u2019ll no doubt hear more soon, but for now know that this will be the cheapest LG OLED you\u2019re getting this year.",
    "Read more in our LG A1 OLED guide",
    "US pricing and release date",
    "UK pricing and release date",
    "LG QNED99 8K TV (65, 75, 86-inch): The Nano9Z is this year\u2019s highest-spec \u2018QNED\u2019 television, meaning it makes use of a Mini LED backlight to improve brightness control and contrast over standard LCD-LED displays. It\u2019s an 8K TV too, and packs a 120Hz panel with Full Array Local Dimming, as well as supporting hands-free voice commands.",
    "US pricing and release date",
    "LG QNED95 8K TV (65, 75-inch): The QNED95 cleaves close to the QNED99, as a Mini LED 8K TV, but makes do with a 60Hz panel rather than 120Hz. It uses an 8K iteration of the a9 Gen 4 AI Processor too.",
    "LG QNED90 4K TV (65, 75, 86-inch): This QNED television packs in 4K resolution, a 120Hz panel, and Full Array Local Dimming through its Mini LED backlight. It uses the a7 Gen 4 AI processor rather than the a9 though.",
    "US pricing and release date",
    "LG QNED85 4K TV (65, 75-inch): This step-down QNED model is also 4K, and matches the QNED90 for specs aside from its 60Hz panel.",
    "LG Nano90 4K NanoCell (55, 65, 75, 86-inch): We\u2019re no longer in Mini LED / QNED territory, with these 2021 iterations on last year\u2019s NanoCell LCD TVs. The Nano90 is a 4K set featuring Nano Color, a 120Hz panel, It\u2019s compatible with the Gallery Stand, too.",
    "LG Nano80 4K NanoCell (50, 55, 65, 75-inch): This step-down 4K NanoCell model drops the motion rate from 120Hz to 60Hz, with an exception for its 86-inch size (which still features 120Hz). You\u2019re making do with a quard-core processor rather than the a7 Gen 4 AI, and you won\u2019t get Dolby Vision either. The backlight uses local dimming rather than Full Array too. It is, however, Gallery Stand compatible, unlike the other NanoCell 2021 TVs.",
    "LG Nano75 4K NanoCell (43, 50, 55, 65-inch): Almost the same as above, but without local dimming or compatibility with the Gallery Stand.",
    "LG UP80 (43, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 82, 86-inch): Don\u2019t need the fancy stuff? This 4K UHD television packs a 60Hz panel for most sizes, with a 120Hz panel for its largest 82-inch / 86-inch iterations. Also with a quad-core processor, ThinQ AI and Magic Remote, and a slim \u2018unibody\u2019 form factor that\u2019s compatible with the Gallery Stand.",
    "LG UP70 (43, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75-inch): Similar to above, but every size is 60Hz, and you won\u2019t get the Magic Remote thrown in. There\u2019s no \u2018unibody\u2019 design or Gallery Stand compatibility either, but it is compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa.",
    "So, what\u2019s new with LG TVs in 2021? There's a lot to get excited about. 2021 sees LG introducing a new round of processors, as ever, with the a9 getting a Gen 4 AI iteration, as well as a step-down a7 Gen 3 model for the new A Series. (The A Series will cleave close to the B Series of previous years, for those wondering.)",
    "It\u2019s that \u2018AI\u2019 part of the new a9 chip that piques our interest, though. LG claims its new chip will use deep learning to better analyze discrete objects onscreen, meaning people, backgrounds, and sections of text are all properly distinguished from each other.",
    "The biggest change this year is probably the introduction of Mini LED, an LCD TV technology also used by TCL. LG\u2019s Mini LED screens aren\u2019t replacing its OLED TVs, but it could give new life to the company\u2019s LCD displays, which tend to feel a bit underwhelming next to their impressive OLED siblings.",
    "What is Mini LED? This panel technology makes use of a huge number of tiny LEDs (30 thousand in LG\u2019s first Mini LED set), and is what LG calls \u201cthe ultimate evolution of LCD TVs\u201d. LG\u2019s Mini LED sets will be branded as \u2018QNED\u2019 (a garbled contraction of Quantum NanoCell Mini LED), which does sound eerily similar to Samsung\u2019s QLED branding. The underlying technology is very different, though, given the Mini LED backlight, which should vastly outperform the brightness and contrast of traditional LED TVs.",
    "If you're interested in the tech but not sure it's right for you, check our our guide: should I buy an LG NanoCell TV?",
    "LG says its new backlight \u201ccomprises up to almost 30,000 tiny LEDs that produce incredible peak brightness and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 when paired with up to 2,500 dimming zones and advanced local dimming zones.\u201d",
    "We have to discuss the new TV sizes, of course. LG Display, which supplies LG Electronics with OLED panels, is introducing a new 83-inch OLED panel size, as well as a 42-inch size for those after something smaller. It\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see both sizes for flagship sets like the C Series and G Series, if not the A Series too \u2013 and we know that the 48-inch OLED panel introduced last year is going to be more widespread across the LG range.",
    "LG\u2019s webOS smart TV platform has changed sizeably, with the usual horizontal icon bar now becoming a screen-filling interface, packed with recommended titles based on your viewing history.",
    "The LG Magic Remote has undergone something of an overhaul, too, with a new ergonomic shape as well as the introduction of NFC Magic Tap technology to enable fast screen mirroring from a smartphone. It will feature dedicated buttons for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, and LG Channels \u2013 as well as ThinQ, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa smart assistants.",
    "Gaming is a big concern this year \u2013 understandably, given the recent launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles. And LG\u2019s 2021 TVs are set to feature VRR (variable refresh rate), Nvidia G-Sync for reduced screen tearing from connected PCs, and four HDMI 2.1 ports (for the OLEDs, at least). There\u2019s also",
    "We\u2019ll even see support for Google Stadia and the Nvidia GeForce Now streaming services land in the second half of 2021, in a major boost to both platforms.",
    "LG\u2019s AI Sound Pro feature will also upmix audio to 5.1.2 channel sound, for a surround sound-esque effect, though we don\u2019t expect it will ever quite feel like the real thing.",
    "LG BX Series OLED",
    "Model Numbers: LG 55OLEDBX, 65OLEDBX",
    "The most affordable LG OLED is the one that, unfortunately, comes out the latest \u2013 though it finally launched in early September. The LG BX OLED is available in two sizes so far (55- and 65-inch), with a 77-inch model likely coming down the line.",
    "As the cheapest member of the OLED family, the BX will use the slightly less powerful a7 Gen 3 Processor instead of the a9, which means it doesn\u2019t benefit from AI upscaling, a pretty essential feature if you\u2019re thinking about buying at a larger size.",
    "However, last year's B9 didn't suffer much in the picture department, and the BX is likely to be a smart buy too \u2013 especially since it's retailing at just $1,399 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,795 for a 55-inch size, significantly less than its B9 predecessor did at launch. The larger 65-inch model costs $2,099 / \u00a31,999 / AU$3,795.",
    "Read our full LG BX OLED TV review",
    "LG CX Series OLED",
    "Model Numbers: LG 48OLEDCX, 55OLEDCX, 65OLEDCX, 77OLEDCX",
    "One step above the entry-level BX series is the 2020 CX OLED, a successor to last year\u2019s award-winning LG C9 OLED, and the first TV in the OLED lineup to use the alpha 9 Gen 3 Processor. As we mentioned earlier this is the first time LG is offering a 48-inch version of the TV, so if you\u2019ve wanted a slightly smaller OLED for your bedroom, the new CX OLED is one to forward to. It sits on a unibody stand or can be wall-mounted.",
    "Prices start at $1,799 / \u00a31,799 (around AU$2,500) for the 55-inch model, with a 65-inch model costing $2,499 / \u00a32,799. There's a bigger 77-inch version (price TBA) and more compact 48-inch model (\u00a31,499 / probably $1,499) too.",
    "Read our full LG CX OLED review",
    "LG GX \u2018Gallery\u2019 Series OLED",
    "Model Numbers: LG 55OLEDGX, LG 65OLEDGX, LG 77OLEDGX",
    "So, slight change in the lineup this year \u2013 there\u2019s no E Series OLED in 2020. Instead what we get is the new GX \u2018Gallery\u2019 Series OLED that mounts on the wall and has ports located right on the back. It\u2019s a similar design to the W-Series \u2018Wallpaper\u2019 design you might have seen in past years, but by integrating the ports right into the TV instead of an attached soundbar, you\u2019re able to hook the TV up to whichever sound system you\u2019d like. It\u2019s also worth noting that this is the first TV in the range to support ATSC 3.0.",
    "Prices start at $2,699 / \u00a32,299 (around AU$4,500) for the 55-inch model, with a 65-inch (April) and 77-inch (May) model available too.",
    "Read our hands-on LG GX OLED review",
    "LG WX \u2018Wallpaper\u2019 Series OLED",
    "Model Number: LG 65OLEDWX",
    "That said, you\u2019ll still see a single new model of the LG WX \u2018Wallpaper\u2019 Series in 2020, available in a 65-inch screen size for \u00a34,499 (around $5,600 / AU$9,200) from April.",
    "Like years prior, it will still use an attached Dolby Atmos soundbar as a hub for inputs and outputs and need to be mounted. If you want something bigger than 65-inches, LG says that the 77-inch version of the W9 OLED will be available this year as well. It also supports ATSC 3.0.",
    "Read our comparison piece: LG GX vs LG WX OLED: which should you choose?",
    "LG Signature ZX 8K OLED",
    "Model Number: LG 77OLEDZX, LG 88OLEDZX",
    "The penultimate OLED this year is the LG Signature ZX - LG\u2019s only 8K OLED TV. Because it\u2019s 8K, it uses the higher-end Alpha 9 Gen. 3 8K AI chip with deep learning to offer better upscaling to fill all those pixels and hands-free voice control thanks to a built-in microphone that responds to \u2018Hi LG\u2019. It was easily one of the best TVs we saw at CES 2020 this year, and we can\u2019t wait to try it out in our own home later this year.",
    "Prices start at \u00a324,999 (around $30,100 / AU$51,000) for the 77-inch model, though the 88-inch model launched first for \u00a339,999 (around $50,000 / AU$82,000) in May.",
    "LG Signature RX 'Rollable' OLED",
    "Model Number: LG 65OLEDRX",
    "OK, so the Rollable OLED TV missed its debut in 2019 but LG has said repeatedly that this will be the year that you\u2019ll be able to buy the Rollable OLED with the new Alpha A9 Processor in it. That\u2019s the good news.",
    "The bad news is that it only comes in a single screen size \u2013 65-inch \u2013 that costs upwards of $60,000 (around \u00a348,000 / AU$99,000). It also won\u2019t be ATSC 3.0-ready, which could be a real disadvantage once stations start broadcasting in 4K HDR. Still, if you\u2019re absolutely loaded and want the coolest TV in town, the Rollable OLED fits the bill.",
    "Read our hands on LG RX Rollable OLED review",
    "LG Nano85 Series",
    "Available screen sizes: 49-inches, 55-inches, 65-inches, 75-inches",
    "Dropping down from OLED TVs to Nano Cell LED-LCDs, the first entry in the lineup is the LG Nano85. This series will use the Alpha A7 Gen. 3 Processor and have a native 120Hz refresh rate. It\u2019s also capable of displaying Dolby Vision content as well as passing on Dolby Atmos signal to a compatible sound system.",
    "That\u2019s something all the OLED TVs can do, so it\u2019s nice to see it in the more affordable entry-level Nano Cell series. The only downside to this model is that it uses edge-lit LEDs instead of a full array panel which will definitely take a toll on contrast, but again, you get what you pay for.",
    "LG Nano90 Series",
    "Available screen sizes: 55-inches, 65-inches, 75-inches and 86-inches",
    "The LG Nano90 is one step up from the LG Nano85 and the big change is that it uses a full-array panel for better contrast and comes in a larger, 86-inch screen size. Otherwise it has all the same specs and features as the LG Nano85.",
    "UK pricing starts at \u00a31,299 (around $1,600 / AU$2,700) for the 55-inch model.",
    "Don't miss our LG Nano90 review",
    "LG Nano97 Series",
    "Available screen sizes: 65-inches and 75-inches",
    "Going up one more step is the LG Nano97. It\u2019s the first 8K TV in the Nano Cell lineup and uses the Alpha A9 Gen. 3 8K AI Processor. Unlike the lower-end Nano Cell TVs, the Nano97 will also incorporate the built-in microphone and responds to \u2018Hi LG\u2019.",
    "LG Nano99 Series",
    "Available screen sizes: 65-inches and 75-inches",
    "The highest-end Nano Cell TV is the LG Nano99 - another 8K LED-LCD screen and the best one in LG\u2019s 2020 lineup. It only comes in two sizes, but both use LG\u2019s Full Array Dimming Pro technology to give even better black levels and contrast. We\u2019ll have to test it to see how much of a difference it makes, but if you\u2019re afraid of burn-in and really want an 8K LED-LCD, this is probably the model to pick.",
    "The 75-inch model launched first in late April, for \u00a35,499 (around $6,800 / AU$11,300), and a cheaper 65-inch model arrived in June.",
    "LG UN6900/UN6970 (US)",
    "Available screen sizes: 65-inches to 85-inches",
    "The cheapest TV you\u2019ll be able to buy from LG in 2020 is the UN6900/UN6970 - at least in the US. The UK and Australia will get their own budget UHD TVs with most of the same specs, but there\u2019s likely to be some regional variation as well. In the US, expect these TVs to use Active HDR, the basic version of WebOS and a Quad-Core processor. Unfortunately they only have a native refresh rate of 60Hz and use a basic IPS panel.",
    "LG UN7300/UN7370 (US)",
    "Available screen sizes: 65-inches to 85-inches",
    "It\u2019s not a massive step up from the UN6900 but the UN7300 will add smart assistants (Google, Alexa and Siri through AirPlay 2) as well as Sports Alert through WebOS. Unfortunately there's no Dolby Vision support at this level and the panel runs at a native 60Hz. Both those specs change with the next step up, thankfully.",
    "LG UN8500/8570 (US)",
    "Available screen sizes: 65-inches to 85-inches",
    "The highest-end regular UHD TV from LG in 2020 (at least for US customers) is the UN8500 that adds Dolby Vision IQ to the TV as well as the Alpha a9 Gen. 3 Processor. The panel gets upgraded to 120Hz at this level and has some form of local dimming. It's not going to be as good as the Nano Cell TVs above it, but if your budget is very limited, these will probably offer the best bang for your buck.",
