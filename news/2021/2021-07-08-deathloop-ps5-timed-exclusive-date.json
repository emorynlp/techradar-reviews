    "Sony and now-Microsoft-owned Bethesda Softworks have announced that Deathloop will remain a timed PS5 exclusive until September 14, 2022 at the earliest.",
    "The game might be available on PC before that date, but the wording found at the end of the latest gameplay trailer make it sound like we'll be waiting a while to get the game on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, despite Microsoft owning the video game publisher and developer.",
    "The trailer, which debuted during Sony's latest State of Play event and we\u2019ve embedded below, finally explains how the game\u2019s premise \u2013 a ceaseless time loop \u2013 will mesh with developer Arkane Studios\u2019 frenetic shooter. The results are what would happen if you crossed Groundhog\u2019s Day with Dishonored.",
    "According to the game\u2019s director, you\u2019re tasked with taking out eight targets all in the same run. Fail to do it, or die trying, and you\u2019ll come back again to try it again. Each run you\u2019ll learn a bit more about your targets and their schedules and when you find out where they\u2019ll be and when, taking them out is as easy as infiltrating their lairs and taking out dozens of their guards. You can rewind time twice if the guards take you out but the third time will start the time loop all over again Majora\u2019s Mask style.",
    "On the surface this might remind you of the PS5\u2019s other big hit from earlier this year, Returnal, however the two share very little in common other than the shooting and time loop. (OK, maybe Returnal is a better comparison than Groundhogs Day\u2026)",
    "Regardless, Deathloop\u2019s map doesn\u2019t sound like it will change every time you die. In fact, you\u2019ll likely need it to stay the same so you can carry out your missions.",
    "Also, after seeing how easily a target was taken out in the above trailer, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll have to face another six super-challenging boss fights, either.",
    "We might be eating our words when the game comes out on PS5 \u2013 and only PS5 \u2013 on September 14 2021, but so far this looks like a loop that we\u2019ll be able to see through to the end."
