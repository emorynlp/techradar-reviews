    "If you\u2019ve been on the lookout for Hisense\u2019s new 65-inch A9G 4K OLED TV, then you\u2019re in luck. We reported on the existence of the new Hisense flagship last month, and it\u2019s now available to pre-order over at Box.",
    "You\u2019ll have to act fast if you want to pre-order the Hisense A9G ahead of launch, though. The 4K OLED TV will launch on June 26, 2021 for \u00a32,499. Currently, it looks like the TV will only be available in the UK and Europe, but we\u2019ll keep you updated if and when the Hisense A9G becomes available worldwide.",
    "The Hisense A9G looks to tick many of the right boxes for an OLED TV. It will feature a wide-viewing angle, accompanied by a wider color gamut, Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and MEMC frame interpolation for the smooth playback you\u2019d expect from a 4K TV. On the audio front, the A9G sports a 2.1.2 channel audio front firing speaker and support for Dolby Atmos.",
    "The A9G marks a return to the OLED market for Hisense, which hasn\u2019t released a TV of the like since 2019\u2019s O8B. In our review, we found the O8B to be a middling OLED TV at best, but one that at least had a price point suitable for its compromises.",
    "With the A9G\u2019s higher price, then, we hope the new OLED TV can address issues present in the older O8B model, which we found to have poor brightness control and subpar Dolby Vision integration, as well as those ever-intrusive screensavers that we could really do without.",
    "We\u2019ve been harsh on the O8B, but it\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t a complete write-off. We loved the ease of navigation and vivid image quality for its price. We hope that these are features the A9G can retain and improve upon still, especially with the larger 65-inch model that wasn\u2019t part of the O8B\u2019s lineup."
