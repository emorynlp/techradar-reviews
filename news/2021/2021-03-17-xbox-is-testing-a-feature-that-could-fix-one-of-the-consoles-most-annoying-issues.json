    "A new Xbox feature is on the way that will finally address a long-standing issue on Microsoft\u2019s platform: slow download speeds.",
    "It\u2019s likely that you will have encountered this problem yourself over the years but, basically, whenever you have a game running in the background on Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S consoles, your download speeds can slow to a crawl. The only way to hit the speeds you\u2019d expect to see is to close a game entirely, which is rather annoying, to say the least.",
    "Thankfully, though, this historic problem will be rectified soon. Microsoft has revealed that a new \u2018suspend my game\u2019 button is now available to beta testers in the Xbox Insider program that will let you keep your games running in the background, but won\u2019t throttle download speeds as a result.",
    "In a post on Twitter, engineering lead at Xbox Eden Marie shared that the \u2018suspend my game\u2019 button will let you download at full speed while making sure your game can be resumed.",
    "The timing couldn\u2019t be more fortuitous now that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S have arrived. Both consoles use Quick Resume, which lets you suspend and resume multiple titles. You can jump back in exactly where you left off, even when you shut down the system completely. Being able to keep these games running when you need the full speed of your bandwidth available, then, is a huge plus.",
    "Marie also revealed that new banners are coming to the Full Library that will make it easier to see which Xbox Game Pass games you\u2019ve added to your \u2018Play later\u2019 list, what\u2019s been recently added and what\u2019s leaving soon.",
    "The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S were criticized at launch for having the same UI as the Xbox One, as apart from having dynamic backgrounds, it didn\u2019t do much to add to that \u2018next-gen\u2019 feel many were hoping for. However, Microsoft\u2019s decision to continue to build upon its existing dashboard appears to be paying off, as not only is it able to make incremental improvements, it\u2019s also not missing any key features by starting from scratch that gamers have come to expect."
