  "article": [
    "The Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are great phones, each achieving four stars in our reviews, but they\u2019ve also suffered from a surprising number of problems, with users reporting all sorts of issues with the devices.",
    "Below, we\u2019ve cataloged the main problems that have been reported, along with details of any potential fixes for them, be they things that you can do now or planned software updates to resolve the issue.",
    "Sadly, not all of the issues have any known fixes, but we\u2019ll update this article if that changes.",
    "One of the most common complaints about the Pixel 6 range is that the fingerprint scanners don\u2019t work very well. Readings can be slow and they will often fail, as we found ourselves in reviewing these phones.",
    "Google has addressed the slowness part of the problem and suggested that you press firmly, make sure the display is clear of dirt and smudges, and \u2013 if you have excessively dry fingers \u2013 moisturize or re-enroll them.",
    "At the moment there aren\u2019t any proper solutions, with Google claiming that it\u2019s slow because of \"enhanced security algorithms\", but it\u2019s possible that Google might eventually be able to optimize those algorithms to speed things up in future.",
    "Perhaps the most troubling issue suffered by Pixel 6 users is that the fingerprint scanner reportedly breaks if you let the battery run flat.",
    "This is fixable, but at the moment only by factory resetting your phone \u2013 and if the battery runs flat again then you might suffer this issue all over again. It seems this problem doesn\u2019t affect every Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but a large number of people have reported it.",
    "The good news is that since a factory reset fixes this it\u2019s presumably a software issue rather than a hardware one, which means Google will hopefully be able to provide a more permanent software fix down the line, but so far there\u2019s no word of that.",
    "Users have reported a number of issues with the screen on the Pixel 6 range, with some saying that the screen flickers when pressing the power button while the phone is off, and others reporting a green tint to the display.",
    "While there\u2019s no news on a fix for the greenish tint, Google has acknowledged the flickering, saying that the issue can happen if you don\u2019t press the power button hard enough to turn the phone on.",
    "To avoid the issue, simply hold the power button down until your Pixel handset switches on. Google also plans a proper fix for this in a December software update.",
    "The Pixel 6 range can supposedly charge at up to 30W, but Android Authority has found that the maximum power obtained by either the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro when charging is 22W, with the average being 13W over a full charging cycle.",
    "There\u2019s probably no way for Google to increase it to 30W, as that\u2019s likely a hardware limitation, but it might be possible for a software update to at least bring the average closer to 22W. For now though there\u2019s no news on that.",
    "Some Pixel 6 owners have reported that their phone will spontaneously call contacts, with the issue seemingly being related to Google Assistant, which might be mishearing things and thinking they instructed it to call someone.",
    "A temporary fix therefore is to disable Google Assistant on the lock screen, by heading to Settings > Google Assistant > Lock Screen > Assistant responses on the lock screen, and turning it off.",
    "This obviously isn\u2019t ideal, but according to 9to5Google the company is aware of the issue and is \u201cworking on an immediate fix.\u201d",
    "There are scattered reports of Pixel 6 models just flat out refusing to connect to a network, either intermittently or at all.",
    "Tom\u2019s Guide reports that on Verizon they\u2019ve sometimes been told that the carrier is temporarily unavailable, leaving their phone out of action for a period of time, while some users of networks such as iD Mobile and Giffgaff in the UK are reporting that they can\u2019t get a signal at all.",
    "It\u2019s unclear how widespread this issue is, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be a fix currently, other than hoping it resolves on its own, or that Google or your network will push an update through to fix it.",
    "Another issue affecting some Pixel 6 owners is the handset not connecting to Android Auto.",
    "A number of posts to this effect have been logged on Google\u2019s community support pages, with one gaining a reply from a member of the Android Auto team, who claimed that the company is unable to reproduce the issue, but will use bug reports from users to attempt to fix it. So there\u2019s hope that this one will be solved soon.",
    "Some Google Fi customers are finding that Wi-Fi Calling isn\u2019t working on the Pixel 6 range, but posts on Reddit suggest that in many cases this issue seems to be fixing itself over time, so patience might just be needed here.",
    "In the meantime, you might have some luck if you turn airplane mode on and then off again.",
    "Some users on Reddit are also reporting that their Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro will keep adjusting its screen brightness, with no change to the environmental lighting.",
    "Seemingly this is a result of the auto brightness algorithm learning how bright you like your phone, so if you manually adjust your brightness when it shifts to a level that you\u2019re not happy with then it should eventually learn how you want it."
