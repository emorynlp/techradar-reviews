    "Monday update: The Best Buy PS5 restock isn't going to happen today, according to our PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider. While some Best Buy warehouses were said to be getting ready PS5 console inventory for June 21, possibly to compete with Amazon Prime Day deals, the actual Best Buy restock may have been rescheduled.",
    "Matt will send you an alert when the Sony console is in stock \u2013 if you follow his account and turn on notifications. He's tracking next-gen consoles 24/7.",
    "Matt has helped nearly 50,000 people buy a next-gen console with his restock alerts on Twitter.",
    "Matt's sources at Best Buy indicate that the electronics retailer is likely to offer the PS5 for sale soon. But some regional warehouse sources tell us they don't have any console stock and are still waiting for shipments.",
    "When a PS5 Best Buy restock happens, the alert will look like this:",
    "This Best Buy PS5 restock is long overdue. Two weeks ago, the retailer added a new bundle to its inventory for the newly launched game Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart, and though bundles are not tied to console inventory at Best Buy, unlike GameStop. All of this was a strong hint that Best Buy would be restocking \u2013 eventually.",
    "Best Buy also teased the all-important yellow add-to-cart button on both the $499 PS5 Disc and $399 PS5 Digital versions of the console. When this happened, no one was able to buy the PS5 from Best Buy last week, according to Matt Swider, but it's another sign that the online store is testing things out.",
    "Finally, Best Buy warehouse employees told TechRadar that they're finally getting in PS5 console inventory after weeks of having zero next-gen consoles in their regional warehouses. It's consistent with a drop. While these sources aren't in charge of that add-to-cart button, others within Best Buy's rank have signaled that the date is this week, though no restock time has been set, which is normal up until the last minute.",
    "Trust and credibility: Matt has helped nearly 45,000 people get a next-gen console in recent weeks with his in-stock Twitter alerts and restock news reporting.",
    "Everyone wants to know 'when is the Best Buy PS5 restock time'. The information we've gotten of possibly this week didn't have a specific time attached to it, and we know that the date and time get decided in the last hours and isn't always shared with our sources.",
    "The good news is that we know when Best Buy has had a PS5 restock in the past. The most consistent time, at least recently, has been around 3:40pm EDT. But we've also seen 12pm EDT, 12:30pm EDT and the most recent PS5 drop was at 9:37am EDT.",
    "In other words, the Best Buy restock time is scattershot across the day. In 2021, it's never been earlier than 9:37am EDT and never later than 4:00pm EDT. That's a wide net and why you need a PS5 restock Twitter tracker to do the heavy lifting for you.",
    "So Best Buy has PS5 stock running through its warehouses, but you shouldn't wait to see it in stock to take action. Besides following our PS5 restock Twitter tracker, you can find helpful tips detailing how to get the console over other people. Millions are trying to buy PS5, after all, each time there's a restock.",
    "Best Buy pages use a yellow add-to-cart button that acts like the Sony Direct virtual queue in some ways. Here's what to do:",
    "We'll have more updates on the PS5 restock news in the coming days, as Best Buy and other retailers are going to be competing with Prime Day deals for 2021 all next week. Walmart, Best Buy and even Amazon may be eager to appeal to everyone who is in the buying mood. It may be why we haven't seen Best Buy and Amazon do a PS5 restock in some time."
