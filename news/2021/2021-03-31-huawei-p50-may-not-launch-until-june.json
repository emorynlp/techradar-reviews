    "It looks like we\u2019ll be waiting a little longer for the arrival of Huawei\u2019s next flagship 5G phone, the Huawei P50.",
    "Having recently reported on an OS-related delay which saw the P50\u2019s release date pushed back until May (after rumors suggested initial plans to launch the phone in March), it now seems more likely to arrive in June.",
    "According to PhoneArena, supply chain issues related to US export restrictions on Chinese manufacturers are thought to be the cause of this latest delay. In 2019, Huawei was placed on a US government blacklist which banned the company from accessing US-based suppliers. Although these export rules were eased in 2020, lengthy licensing and shipping processes continue to hinder the company\u2019s production line.",
    "Typically, new models in Huawei\u2019s P series launch between March and April, and usually arrive prior to the release of an updated Huawei Mate lineup later in the year. In 2021, we\u2019re expecting the arrival of the Huawei P50, P50 Pro and P50 Pro Plus, following the release of the impressive P40, P40 Pro and P40 Pro Plus in 2020.",
    "You can find all the latest rumors and information surrounding these upcoming devices \u2013 including their expected chipsets, camera setups and displays \u2013 in our Huawei P50 hub.",
    "Given the aforementioned export sanctions imposed on Huawei in 2019, the company\u2019s sales have deteriorated in the US and Europe in the years since \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean its profits have fallen, mind.",
    "A recent The Verge report suggests Huawei recorded its highest-ever quarterly revenue in 2021, despite its struggles in markets outside of China.",
    "The company\u2019s success should come as no surprise, though, given the quality of its recent phones. Last year\u2019s Huawei P40, P40 Pro and P40 Pro Plus all packed superb cameras, plenty of power and excellent battery lives which saw them rank among the best smartphones of 2020.",
    "While it\u2019s true that these latest delays mean we won\u2019t get to see the Huawei P50 and its siblings as soon as we\u2019d otherwise expect, we\u2019ve no doubt that its arrival will be worth the wait.",
