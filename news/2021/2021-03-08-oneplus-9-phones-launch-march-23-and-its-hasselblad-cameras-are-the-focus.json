    "OnePlus has finally announced its long-rumored flagship OnePlus 9 series of phones to rival the Samsung Galaxy S21 range as the top phones of 2021. What\u2019s more, we have a OnePlus 9 launch date: March 23 with a launch event streaming from OnePlus\u2019 website.",
    "The OnePlus 9 series, rumored to be the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro and 9 Lite, have one big ace up their sleeve: famed camera company Hasselblad has cooperated with OnePlus to help revamp the new phones\u2019 camera systems, according to a press release.",
    "The phonemaker didn\u2019t confirm anything major about the upcoming handsets beyond camera details (they\u2019ll use a Sony IMX789 sensor, for instance), though they\u2019re rumored to pack top-tier specs like a Snapdragon 888 chipset.",
    "Hasselblad has an incredible reputation, which OnePlus\u2019 promotional material is leaning on, featuring reproductions of famous photos taken using Hasselblad cameras \u2013 like Earthrise, a shot taken of our planet during the Apollo 11 Moon landing. While a OnePlus 9 probably won\u2019t make it to our nearest celestial neighbor for a photo op, the phonemaker is sending a clear signal with the partnership that it\u2019s finally addressing one of the biggest criticisms of OnePlus phones: weak cameras.",
    "Whether this partnership will result in better photography won\u2019t be clear until we get our hands on the OnePlus 9 range\u2019s cameras. Plenty of phone brands have partnered with notable camera companies over the years, but some of those matchups have been more publicity stunt than productive synthesis that truly raises the camera phone bar, as Mr. Mobile\u2019s Michael Fisher explains in a new video.",
    "At least we know this isn\u2019t a one-and-done partnership: OnePlus and Hasselblad are working together for the next three years on the phonemaker\u2019s handsets, with the OnePlus 9 series as the first to come out.",
    "OnePlus has also shed light on the extent of the partnership, claiming Hasselblad will work with them to improve multiple parts of the camera system: first the software, refining color tuning and sensor calibration to \u201cbring more perceptually accurate and natural-looking colors to photos taken with OnePlus flagship cameras,\u201d according to a press release.",
    "There\u2019s also a Hasselblad Pro Mode in the phone\u2019s camera that will have a new user interface based on the camera company\u2019s own image processing software for better control to fine-tune photos.",
    "OnePlus has other ambitions to improve its cameras over a three-year period, including opening four more R&D labs, developing a 140-degree field-of-view camera (current ultra-wide angle lenses manage around 120 degrees), faster selfie camera focus, and a \u2018freeform lens\u2019 debuting in the OnePlus 9 that reduces edge distortion in ultra-wide photos.",
    "Another part of the teaser also claims the whole series of these handsets will be 5G ready, so that may mean the upcoming OnePlus 9 Lite will be one of the cheapest 5G phones.",
    "When will we hear about the OnePlus 9 family? March 23 is the big day for the launch event, and it's set to start at 7am PT / 10am EST / 3pm GMT (or March 24 at 1am for those in AEDT)."
