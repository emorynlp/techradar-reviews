    "Labor Day sales are still ongoing at a number of leading retailers today but things are really, really winding down now we've passed the 'official' Labor Day date. Deals are still available at Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowes, and others but we'd act quickly if you want to snag them - they're disappearing fast.",
    "To help you find all the top offers still available, we've rounded up the best Labor Day sales and the top stand-out deals for you below. Whether you're after home appliances, furniture, mattresses and grills or TVs, laptops, headphones, and more, our roundup has you covered with easy-to-navigate sections on everything.",
    "As you can see, the current selection of retailers offering Labor Day sales is vast. Looking for something more specific? We've highlighted today's best deals below. You can either scroll down to browse our top picks or use the navigation links to jump to the section you want.",
    "Positioned between the bigger Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday deals events, the yearly Labor Day sales are essentially the last stop before the big 'Holiday deals' season starts in November. It's a smaller retail event, but it's a great time to bag a bargain on anything from laptops to late summer items like grills.",
    "The Labor Day Sales traditionally cover things like appliances, both outdoor and indoor furniture, and home items in general. You'll also find awesome sales on things like mattresses as well as end-of-summer items like BBQ grills. As you'd expect, it's also a great time to pick up clearance patio furniture for next year at places like Lowes and Home Depot - which normally have free delivery too.",
    "As with any online shopping event, the Labor Day sales will also have a ton of cheap tech deals to check out too. We expect retailers like Best Buy and Walmart to come out the gates with some really cheap laptops and 4K TV deals - which are always favorites for our readers in particular. We should also see discounted headphones and smart hubs too - especially if Amazon joins in as sales on its own devices are pretty much a given on any sales event.",
    "Home Depot, Lowe's, Best Buy and Amazon tend to have the widest selection of deals in the Labor Day sales covering pretty much all the bases. Last year we did see quite a few more specialized retailers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP join in too, which were particularly good for laptop deals. If you'd like to see a full run down of last year's top Labor Day sales, we've preserved some just below.",
    "Labor Day itself started as a way to celebrate the efforts and contributions of the American Labor movement and everyday workers, from its inception in 1894 all the way to the present day. In recent years, like many federal holidays, it's been used as an opportunity by many retailers to offer big discounts on a whole array of items. Subsequently, it's often regarded as the best time for shopping in between the earlier Memorial Day sales and the Black Friday sales in November.",
    "Most of the primo Labor Day sales tend to end on the midnight running into Tuesday September 7, however, we'll probably see things gradually wind down throughout the week. In some rare instances, such a Home Depot's Labor Day appliances sale we may even see a longer sales period - up until September 16 in last year's case.",
    "In 2020, the Labor Day sales started about a week before the actual date, although most of the top-dollar deals launched over the prior weekend and of course Labor Day itself. In general, those shopping for appliances tend to have more time to consider their purchases, while shoppers looking for cheap tech like laptops, TVs, and tablets have a shorter purchase window overall."
