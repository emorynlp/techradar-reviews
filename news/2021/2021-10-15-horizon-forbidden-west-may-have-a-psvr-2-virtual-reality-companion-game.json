    "What\u2019s better than dinosaurs? Robot dinosaurs. What\u2019s better than robot dinosaurs? Robot dinosaurs in virtual reality. And that may well be exactly what we\u2019ll all be getting when the PSVR 2 finally releases, according to a new rumor.",
    "According to Xbox Era co-founder Nick Baker, sources close to the matter claim that Sony\u2019s in-house Firespirte studio is \u201cworking on a Horizon VR game\u201d that will be distinct from the upcoming Horizon Forbidden West title, but set in the same universe.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t get told if it\u2019s a full-blown game like Half-Life: Alyx, or if it\u2019s an \u201cexperience\u201d like that Batman [Arkham VR] thing. That part I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Baker.",
    "While it\u2019s far from official confirmation, Baker has a good track record with getting accurate pre-release information, so it\u2019s definitely one rumor worth considering.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first we\u2019ve heard of a potential VR version of the Horizon games. Back in 2019, Sony\u2019s premier VR studio, Sony London Studio, was rumored to be working on a game set in the Horizon universe. But nothing seemed to come of it.",
    "Elsewhere, Sony recently purchased developer Firesprite, and its experience in making VR titles seemed to be the primary reason \u2013 its game, The Persistence, was one of the original PSVR\u2019s top horror titles.",
    "It\u2019s likely that the Horizon VR title could be a full blown adventure, rather than a short VR experience. Sony has stated that for the PSVR 2, it wants to aim for full-length, triple-A titles akin to its regular console offerings.",
    "As for when we\u2019ll see either the PSVR 2, or this rumored Horizon VR title, all we can do at the moment is speculate. Next Christmas would be a safe bet to see the headset land, and a franchise with as big an audience as Horizon would make a great companion for the hardware\u2019s launch."
