    "Hi, my name\u2019s Matt Hanson and I like giving Microsoft unwanted advice about how it should run its business. That\u2019s right, a guy who wears 15-year-old t-shirts because he has no money, thinks he knows better than a trillion-dollar company when it comes to their business. Well, I\u2019m back, and I have another corker: kill off Windows 10.",
    "That\u2019s right. Microsoft should bin it, and start again \u2013 with a completely rebooted operating system. Microsoft could simply call it \u2018Windows\u2019. However, knowing Microsoft and its funky naming conventions, it\u2019d probably go with \u2018Windows One\u2019 or \u2018Windows Series X Pro\u2019 or something.",
    "OK, so let me explain. I\u2019ve been using Windows since 3.1, and been through the highs and lows. The thrill of adding themes in Windows 98, spending ages waiting for Windows ME to boot up, working on Windows Vista: The Official Magazine, the lot.",
    "And, I have to say, Windows 10 is definitely one of the better releases. While some of its updates have been a bit, well, difficult, on the whole, it\u2019s a solid operating system that does the job well. It now boots in a flash, and features like the Reset this PC, which allows you to factory reset Windows 10 to fix issues, rather than having to do a full re-install, are genuinely great.",
    "However, it\u2019s also a bit of a mess. Undoubtedly, one of the best things about Windows 10 is that it is reasonably easy to run older apps and games on it. It\u2019s also kept many tools and programs that have been a mainstay since Windows 95 \u2013 if not older.",
    "For example, the Control Panel in Windows 10 isn\u2019t too far removed from the Control Panel in Windows 95. This is great for anyone who has been using Windows for 30-odd years \u2013 but there\u2019s a big problem.",
    "For a start, not everyone has been using Windows for 30 years, so there isn\u2019t that affection for the Control Panel, or any of the older apps or tools. What some of us would think of as iconic and irreplaceable, others will find archaic and unintuitive.",
    "Another issue is that Microsoft has been trying to modernise Windows and ween us off those older apps and features. Its boldest attempt at this was with Windows 8\u2026 and it didn\u2019t go down well.",
    "If you can\u2019t remember Windows 8 (oh, how I envy you), Microsoft tried to make an operating system that would work on both traditional laptops and PCs, as well as touch-screen tablets. The result was an ugly hotch-potch of an operating system that pleased neither PC or tablet users. PC users hated the large, over simplified Start screen that replaced the Start menu and looked awful on monitors, while tablet owners were baffled by the finicky legacy apps and menus that Microsoft kept in, and which were obviously designed for use with keyboard and mice.",
    "There\u2019s a reason why Microsoft skipped Windows 9 altogether \u2013 it couldn\u2019t get away from Windows 8 fast enough.",
    "But, in my mind, Windows 8\u2019s biggest failing was Microsoft\u2019s indecisiveness. If it has just gone fully in on the \u2018Metro\u2019 style of big buttons and simplified menus, while many of us (including me) would have moaned loudly, it would have at least been consistent.",
    "Instead, we got a disappointing compromise.",
    "While Windows 10 has done a lot to right the wrongs of Windows 8, including an interface that is much more like the Windows of old, it\u2019s also kept a lot of Windows 8\u2019s design choices as well. And that can lead to a messy operating system.",
    "It\u2019s led to many menus and settings being duplicated. For example, there\u2019s the Settings app, that gives you access to various\u2026 settings. It does the job the Control Panel used to do.",
    "The problem is, Windows 10 still also has the Control Panel \u2013 and you don\u2019t need both. And while some of the same settings can be accessed in both, others cannot, and it can mean finding a setting confusing and annoying.",
    "It\u2019s also made what was once quite simple tasks now overly complex. For example, if you wanted to change the configurations of your speakers, you used to be able to right-click the speaker icon in the taskbar, then click on \u2018Select Playback devices\u2019 to open the Sound window. From there you could configure and set the properties of your playback and recording devices, including testing out individual speakers.",
    "In Windows 10, however, while that Sounds window still exists, there\u2019s also the Sound window, which does a similar (but not exactly the same) task. You can choose the playback and recording devices, but options are limited. If you want to terst a device, you need to click \u2018Manage sound devices\u2019 then choose the device you want to test, and click \u2018Test\u2019. You can also get to the old Sounds window from here, but it\u2019s called \u2018Sound Control Panel\u2019, which may confuse people who are already in the \u2018Sound\u2019 window.",
    "It\u2019s an example of Windows 10\u2019s interface being muddled and filled with redundancies and repeated options. It shows how Windows 10 can be both too simple and overly complicated at the same time.",
    "Much of this is because Microsoft is hesitant to drop older tools and menus, while adding new ones. I can see why \u2013 the outcry would be huge from many users. You could also argue that this way gives people choice \u2013 if you like the old way of doing things, you can still do that, and if you like the new way of doing things, you\u2019re covered as well. Problems arise, however, when those two methods conflict.",
    "Good user interface design should be as simple and straightforward as possible, and Windows 10\u2019s inability to let go of the past is holding it back.",
    "So, why not just start again. Scrap everything, and build a new Windows with ONE interface and one way of doing things. They\u2019ll be resistance, but in the long run, it\u2019ll mean there\u2019s no longer the feeling that Windows is made up of two (or more) different operating systems.",
    "It also means Microsoft could start from scratch with the code as well. Over the years, Windows 10\u2019s code has become a bit messy as well, as apps and tools from older versions are repurposed, and new tools added on.",
    "When code gets too messy, it can lead to a degradation in performance and all kinds of errors. A blue screen of death can occur if there\u2019s an outdated driver for some ancient hardware, for example.",
    "Giving Windows a fresh start could let Microsoft seriously slim down the operating system\u2019s code to make it faster, more reliable and less resource intensive.",
    "That last bit would be key to making the new Windows run on older or underpowered devices. Microsoft still hasn\u2019t got an answer to Chrome OS, which powers the best Chromebooks and is a real threat to Windows\u2019 dominance in the education sector. Windows 10 S mode, is definitely not the answer \u2013 it\u2019s just another compromise.",
    "Ditching everything and starting again isn\u2019t easy. It takes a lot of time, and a lot of courage. But if the future of Windows is just more updates to Windows 10 and more sticking plasters, then it\u2019s not a very bright future.",
    "So, Microsoft. Be brave. Ditch Windows 10 and give us a bold new Windows for the future. It\u2019ll be worth it."
