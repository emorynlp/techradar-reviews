    "Amazon's Prime Day deals are over for another year, with the shopping event closing its doors on some choice discounts on cameras, lenses, drones and accessories.",
    "While Prime Day is officially finished, there are still some tech deals that didn't get the memo and are still live. Sadly, that isn't the case for our pick of the photography deals, which have now all expired.",
    "We've left the best deals that we did find below, in case you want to get a sense of the kind of Amazon Black Friday deals we might be able to expect as the next big shopping event, which takes place in November.",
    "These included a 25% price cut on the GoPro Hero 8 Black's best bundle, a 16% discount on the DJI OM 4 smartphone gimbal, and some excellent savings on a range of lenses from Viltrox and Rokinon (in the US) and Sony (in the UK).",
    "Hopefully, we'll see Black Friday match or better those deals in a few months' time. But until next year, here were the photography hits of Prime Day 2021.",
    "Most of the best Prime Day camera deals in the US were focused on camera lenses and accessories for those who are looking to start a YouTube channel (or simply improve their video conferencing game). RGB lights, Chromakey backdrops, DJI smartphone gimbals \u2013 all were given generous discounts and were good buys for those looking to take their production levels up a notch.",
    "Mirrorless cameras give your DSLR-level shooting power and image quality in smaller and more versatile bodies. Their interchangeable lenses mean they can adapt to all types of shooting situation \u2013 so whether you're looking for a travel companion or something to upgrade your YouTube shooting setup, there's likely to be a deal here for you.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the mirrorless cameras from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
