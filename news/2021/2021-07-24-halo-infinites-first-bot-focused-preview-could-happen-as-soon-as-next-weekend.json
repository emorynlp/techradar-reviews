    "As Halo Infinite\u2019s holiday release window draws closer, 343 Industries is gearing up to begin several rounds of technical previews, with the first expected to focus on Bots in the near future.",
    "Details of the first technical preview were laid out in July's Inside Infinite blog post, with 343 Industries saying that it\u2019s getting \u201cvery close\u201d to starting the flighting process and that while it\u2019s \u201ca fluid process\u201d, the team has \u201cbeen given the okay to say our first Bot-focused technical preview could happen as soon as next weekend.\u201d",
    "A firm date hasn\u2019t been set just yet but it won\u2019t land out of nowhere, with 343 confirming that it intends to host a livestream first, \u201cwhere we\u2019ll dive into the actual build and walk through nearly every facet\u201d of the technical preview.",
    "Ahead of that taking place, however, the blog post digs into what players have to look forward to, while managing some expectations. The first technical preview \u201cwill focus on Bots and a slice of the new Academy experience\u201d, introducing players to the Bot Arena and Academy Weapon Drills.",
    "Halo Infinite \"is the franchise\u2019s first foray into the world of multiplayer Bots\" and in the post, Head of Creative, Joseph Staten, says they're one of his \u201cfavorite features\u201d that the team \u201calways wanted to land but that consistently got cut due to limited time and resources.\u201d",
    "The team is looking to \u201cgather feedback on Bot behavior and online performance\u201d by testing the Bot Arena playlist, which puts 4 players against 4 Bots on Arena maps. According to Staten, there are four kinds of bots in Halo Infinite: Recruit, Marine, ODST and Spartan, with \u201ceach level representing an increase in bot skill.\u201d Bots are, he explains, challenging and able to become \u201csmarter and more resourceful\u201d but they\u2019re also \u201cfair\u201d.",
    "This particular preview will feature Slayer on the Bazaar, Recharge, and Live Fire maps. While things will start off slow, the post says the plan is to have \u201ca daily content offering that will evolve over the course of the flight based on the overall engagement of participants\u201d, ramping up steadily through the Bot skill levels \u201cto provide greater challenge and variety.\u201d",
    "343 Industries is also looking to test its Academy Weapon Drills with a limited list of weapons, dropping players into a firing range arena where they\u2019ll use bots for scored target practice \u201cto learn how each weapon functions before entering the heat of battle\u201d.",
    "Lastly, the team hopes to get some feedback on the game\u2019s menus and is particularly interested \u201cin seeing how players move through the UI to unlock their Battle Passes, check their Challenges, use the Store, and apply their earned customization elements in the Armor Hall.\u201d",
    "In order to test out Battle Passes, invited players will receive \u201ca set amount of in-game credits\u201d that they can spend as they please, however, \u201ccustomization items unlocked during technical previews will not carry over when the game releases later this year.\u201d As 343 is testing the Battle Passes and customization on a purely technical level, players should expect them to be limited and not a \u201c a showcase of our launch content.\u201d",
    "Continuing expectation management, 343 Industries makes it clear in the post that as the preview is a work-in-progress and \u201ca couple months behind\u201d the current main build, players should expect some \u201cbumps and rough edges.\u201d",
    "The main goal of the previews, the blog post says, is \u201ctruly technical in nature\u2014we are looking to push our systems and services at a larger scale than we\u2019ve been able to thus far as an important step towards ensuring we are as ready as possible when the flood gates fully open at launch this holiday. Feedback and other insights are certainly valuable, but first and foremost we are testing and stressing the technical side of Halo Infinite.\u201d",
    "Bots are just the first stages of 343 Industries\u2019 testing and further down the line, flights will \u201cexpand into more content including traditional PVP Arena and Big Team Battle.\u201d",
    "If you want a chance of taking part in Halo Infinite\u2019s flighting process, then you need to be a Halo Insider. Signing up for this is a matter of registering for the program with your gamertag and opting in for communications and flighting. Halo community manager John Junyszek has posted a Twitter thread, breaking down the steps to register in detail.",
    "While just being an Insider isn\u2019t a guarantee of being invited to take part in technical previews or flights, 343 Industries says that it\u2019ll be hosting \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of players in the first preview with hopes of inviting \u201ceven more\u201d for the next round. \u201cOur goal\u201d, the post says, \u201cis to eventually get every eligible Halo Insider a chance to go hands-on and help us achieve our goals on the road to launch. Remember, if you don\u2019t get in this time, please don\u2019t despair \u2013 more opportunities will come.\u201d",
    "Halo Infinite is still scheduled for a holiday 2021 release and it will launch exclusively on Xbox platforms and PC."
