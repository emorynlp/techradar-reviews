  "article": [
    "Microsoft cybersecurity researchers have found evidence of a new malware employed by the threat actor behind the high-profile SolarWinds attacks, to create a persistent backdoor into compromised servers.",
    "Dubbed FoggyWeb the malware, which drops a post-exploitation backdoor, was discovered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) as it continues to track the activities of the state-sponsored SolarWinds attackers they refer to as Nobelium.",
    "\u201cNobelium uses FoggyWeb to remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD FS [Active Directory Federation Services] servers, decrypted token-signing certificate, and token-decryption certificate, as well as to download and execute additional components,\u201d notes MSTIC researchers in a blog post.",
    "Based on their analysis, the Microsoft researchers believe that Nobelium has been using FoggyWeb in campaigns since as early as April 2021.",
    "Unraveling the working on the newly discovered malware, the researchers argue that it ties into Nobelium\u2019s tactics for stealing credentials after compromising the AD FS servers.",
    "\u201cOnce Nobelium obtains credentials and successfully compromises a server, the actor relies on that access to maintain persistence and deepen its infiltration using sophisticated malware and tools,\u201d argue the researchers.",
    "That\u2019s where the malware comes into play. Described as a \u201cpassive and highly targeted backdoor\u201d FoggyWeb helps attackers remotely exfiltrate sensitive information from a compromised AD FS server.",
    "Digging into the malware, MSTIC researchers learned that FoggyWeb can also receive additional malicious components from a command-and-control (C2) server for further actions on the compromised server.",
    "The researchers add that they\u2019ve shared the details of the malware, including indicators of compromise, with customers who were observed as being targeted or compromised by FoggyWeb."
