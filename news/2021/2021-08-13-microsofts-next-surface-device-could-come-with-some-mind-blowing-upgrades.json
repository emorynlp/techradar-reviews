    "A new flagship Surface laptop could be coming later this year which might replace the Surface Book range entirely, and involves a major shift in design philosophy.",
    "This is according to a respected source for all things Microsoft, Zac Bowden at Windows Central, who reckons that while the new portable is expected to supplant the Surface Book \u2013 to the extent that he\u2019s given it the placeholder name of the Surface Book 4 \u2013 it may actually arrive under the Surface Laptop brand, perhaps as the Surface Laptop Studio or Surface Laptop Pro.",
    "Bowden\u2019s theory is that Microsoft will drop the idea of the detachable 2-in-1 as seen with the Surface Book \u2013 where the display can be separated entirely \u2013 and instead produce a laptop which offers a different trick with the screen, allowing it to extend and be rotated to different angles.",
    "Rather than the display coming off, it\u2019ll be on an innovative stand mechanism that allows it to be pulled towards the user, and rotated to lie almost flat, for writing or drawing if needed \u2013 mirroring the Surface Studio in that respect. Hence the possible name of the Surface Laptop Studio, which would tie in with all this.",
    "Note that this is speculation based on the fact that Microsoft is apparently doing something new in terms of ditching the detachable model, and the sighting of the aforementioned purported nifty hinge design in a recently unearthed patent. So Bowden is putting two and two together here, given that patent and what his sources are saying.",
    "An additional aside to this equation is that Microsoft also has a patent kicking about (from some time back) for a Surface Pen with haptic feedback. Bowden further theorizes that as Windows 11, which will be the new laptop\u2019s OS, supports haptic feedback for pens, it\u2019s likely that some kind of smart pen with support for haptics will be bundled with the Surface Book 4, or whatever the portable ends up being called.",
    "Other tentative specs from Bowden\u2019s sources include the laptop having a 14-inch screen that will employ a dynamic refresh rate. This means that it might be a 120Hz panel, say, by default, but will have the ability to drop to 60Hz when nothing\u2019s happening on-screen, saving some battery juice.",
    "Nvidia RTX graphics are predicted to be on board, too, plus a capacious trackpad, and a more powerful processor would pretty much be a given. That\u2019s not just because it\u2019s a new machine that needs to sound impressive, but the shift away from a detachable 2-in-1 to a more traditional laptop form-factor (albeit with a fancy hinge) would in theory give Microsoft more room to play with for the CPU (as it would go in the main body of the portable, and wouldn\u2019t need to be crammed into the display portion to allow the tablet to function when detached).",
    "Bowden\u2019s guess for the release date of this potentially incoming Surface is that it could follow on shortly from a launch at Microsoft\u2019s regular hardware event in the fall. That press event could be in October, with maybe a late October (or perhaps November) on-sale date for the US, and other regions to get the device down the line as usually happens (sometimes with a waiting time of months \u2013 and that\u2019s been known to happen without a global chip shortage).",
    "There are a lot of interesting and exciting sounding features and specs floated here for this potential device. It all seems to fit nicely together with the idea of a laptop that takes distinct cues from the Surface Studio, and it could be a fabulous portable for creatives \u2013 given the tilting screen, and the possibility of a haptic pen. Those two elements would provide the ability to draw on a flat surface with a stylus that gives the feeling of a much more tactile and natural experience than existing pens.",
    "The concern is that this fancy new tech, including a high-quality display which can vary its refresh rate, and particularly the intricate hinge mechanism \u2013 which will have to be manufactured to guard against potentially being knocked or damaged \u2013 could mean we\u2019re looking at a pricey portable. And remember, the Surface Book is hardly cheap as it is, with higher-end specs getting eye-wateringly expensive. The pricing, then, has to be a worry if all the above pans out, and we also get a much peppier CPU and RTX GPU options into the bargain.",
    "Bowden seems to think the new machine could debut at the same starting price point as the current Surface Book 3 ($1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,649), but that seems optimistic to us.",
    "We still remain unconvinced about the fancy hinge/stand mechanism and tilting screen, too. That\u2019s the biggest leap with the speculation here, and as we\u2019ve already mentioned, the possibility that it creates a design weak point in terms of stuff that can break and go wrong, seems like something of a minefield. Hinge-gate, anyone?"
