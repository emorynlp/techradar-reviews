    "Shadow and Bone, Netflix's TV show adaptation of Leigh Bardugo's bestselling fantasy novels, walks a fine line between honoring its source material and retconning certain outdated elements.",
    "It's a balancing act that other book-to-TV adaptations have wrestled with. In Shadow and Bone's case, though, the revision of important story components was imperative.",
    "It may be a fictitious world where magic and monsters reside, but Shadow and Bone needed to better reflect our own diverse world brimming with people of various races, gender identities and cultural backgrounds.",
    "Ahead of the series' April 23 release, TechRadar sat down with Bardugo and showrunner Eric Heisserer to discuss character diversity, fantasy TV show comparisons, and how the Marvel Cinematic Universe influenced the show's action sequences.",
    "Based on Bardugo's Grisha trilogy and Six of Crows duology, Shadow and Bone tells two stories concurrently in the same timeline. The first follows Alina Starkov (Jessie Mei Li), an orphan and mapmaker who finds herself installed as savior-elect of the world.",
    "On a dangerous voyage through the Shadow Fold \u2013 a massive, unnatural wall of darkness that divides the world's largest continent and is filled with bloodthirsty beasts \u2013 Alina unleashes an extraordinary power that might be the key to freeing the kingdoms of Ravka and Shu Han.",
    "Heralded as the mythical Sun Summoner, a powerful Grisha warrior destined to destroy the Shadow Fold, Alina is whisked away from best friend Malyen (Archie Reynaux) to train under the tutelage of General Kirigan (Ben Barnes), a Grisha Shadow Summoner and Commander of Ravka\u2019s armies.",
    "Shadow and Bone charts a similar path plot-wise to its book namesake, which is the first entry in Bardugo's Grisha trilogy. But while Alina's story doesn't deviate too much from the novel, its cast of characters does \u2013 not from a personality perspective, but a diversity one.",
    "\"When Eric and I first sat down, the first thing I said to him was 'Shadow and Bone is very straight and white',\" Bardugo says. \"I was echoing a lot of the fantasy I had grown up with unconsciously. If you read through the books, you'll see that this changes. I began to reflect the world around me more authentically. There's no reason why our fantasy world shouldn't look that way, and that\u2019s what we wanted to see in the show.\"",
    "Key to this greater inclusivity push was Mei Li's casting as Alina. The character is depicted as a white, fair-haired Ravkan citizen in the novels, but her ethnicity and origins \u2013 Alina is half-Shu and half-Ravkan in the TV show \u2013 are altered in Netflix's adaptation to better reflect the world around us.",
    "\"Jessie, being mixed-race herself, has a lot of personal experiences that tie into the character we built for Alina,\" Heisserer adds.",
    "\"Being part-Shu, Alina has this pall cast over her from a young age because she looks like one of Ravka's enemies, but she fights for their army. We wanted to focus on a heroine who struggled to fit in, which feeds into the central question of the show, which is 'Where do I belong?'\"",
    "If Bardugo\u2019s original trilogy, by her own admission, is lacking in diversity, her follow-up series \u2013 the Six of Crows duology \u2013 is more inclusive. Characters including Jesper Fahey (Kit Young) and Inej Ghafa (Amita Suman), members of the Dregs gang led by Kaz Brekker (Freddy Carter) are representative of real and fantasy-world multiculturalism, and it\u2019s this trio on which Shadow and Bone season 1\u2019s second storyline is based.",
    "After getting wind of a big payday for completing a particular mission, the group moves to ensure that they\u2019re selected for the assignment. They soon realize, however, that they might be in over their heads. Why? Because they have to leave the safety of Ketterdam, the island of Kerch\u2019s main city, and cross the Shadow Fold to capture Alina and bring her back for their wealthy benefactor.",
    "Shadow and Bone, then, diverges from the Six of Crows duology\u2019s initial plot. Netflix\u2019s series tells its tales in parallel, but Six of Crows \u2013 the series\u2019 first book \u2013 takes place after the events of the Grisha trilogy. In order to tell both stories simultaneously, Heisserer and Bardugo collaborated on backstories for Kaz, Jesper and Inej that would serve as both a prequel to the duology, and enable the Dregs to eventually cross paths with Alina in the TV show. Bardugo, though, says such a proposition wasn\u2019t as daunting as it might have initially seemed.",
    "\u201cWhen we decided to bring Six of Crows and Shadow and Bone together, it felt very organic,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the books, these storylines do end up on a collision course, so it didn\u2019t feel artificial. We just had to fiddle with the timeline a little bit. We [also] wanted to give time and attention to these other characters, which would make the world feel inhabited in the way that it is when you get to the duology.\u201d",
    "Shadow and Bone isn\u2019t the only Netflix production that has followed a multi-story format. The Witcher\u2019s live-action adaptation told three stories across different timelines simultaneously that, while initially confusing to viewers, made sense by season 1\u2019s end. Comparisons between the two series, then, seem inevitable, but it\u2019s not a similarity that Heisserer concerns himself with.",
    "\u201cThe comparison [for Shadow and Bone] was always the source material,\u201d he says when we asked about the series\u2019 correlations. \u201cWe had our blueprint and roadmap, and we\u2019d stick to that. I\u2019m not really drawn to something [like The Witcher] because it reminds me of something else, but rather something I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d",
    "Another way in which Shadow and Bone differs from The Witcher is in how it portrays magic. The Witcher\u2019s version is derived from Chaos power, and often referred to as \u2018The Art\u2019 in Andrzej Sapkowski\u2019s novels. In contrast, Shadow and Bone \u2013 and the Grishaverse in general \u2013 broaches the subject from a scientific standpoint.",
    "The Grisha, in the TV show and source material, are humans who practise Small Science \u2013 a process that enables them to manipulate matter at its base level. This allows them to alter matter\u2019s makeup to control the elements, heal injuries or, in Alina and General Kirigan\u2019s cases, create light and shadow respectively.",
    "In the novels, such matter manipulation is conducted through hand gestures. For Netflix\u2019s adaptation, finger tutting, a hand movement derived from a type of dance move, was used to showcase the Grisha\u2019s unique ability. To authentically recreate such actions, Shadow and Bone\u2019s creative team looked a movie that utilized not-too-dissimilar gestures \u2013 2016 MCU movie Doctor Strange.",
    "\u201cWe have different Grisha orders [who] activate different offensive powers,\u201d Heisserer explains. \u201cSo we brought in a gesture specialist who had done lots of work on Doctor Strange, and he offered some inspiring ideas that we could use for our visual vocabulary. That, along with our choreographers and stunt coordinators, allowed us to get a layered feel to a lot of the fighting.\u201d",
    "Not every battle in Bardugo\u2019s world pits Grisha against Grisha, though, so what fighting styles were used for non-Small Science users to give them an advantage in any non-Grisha versus Grisha showdown?",
    "\u201cFor our Ketterdam dwellers, for example, our stunt leads worked on what they had known as bare-knuckle boxing, which you\u2019d find in Amsterdam,\u201d Heisserer says. \u201cThis ensures that it looked and felt different, but also just as brutal [as Grisha fights]. If you\u2019re growing up as a fighter in a world of magic, you\u2019re going to have an edge to you that doesn\u2019t necessarily exist. You know that if you don\u2019t close the distance fast you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d",
    "Grishaverse fans have been unequivocal in their excitement ahead of Shadow and Bone\u2019s arrival. Despite this ostensible display of enthusiasm, however, there will be some fans who may be unhappy over plot changes, the aesthetic of the TV show\u2019s world, or character choices. After all, fans of any book series will have a picture in their mind of how a fictional world appears. Having an actual visual representation of how something looks in Netflix's adaptation, then, may not be to every fans' liking.",
    "For Bardugo, appeasing every fan with Shadow and Bone\u2019s final look is an impossible task. However, the Grishaverse\u2019s creator believes that making the series\u2019 big decisions early on has genuinely helped to bring her two novel series together, and hopes fans will appreciate the amount of work that went into adapting \u2013 and updating \u2013 her original works.",
    "\u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly how we were going to pull it off,\u201d Bardugo admits. \u201cBut once we overcame some hurdles, I knew we were in good hands. You can\u2019t write thinking about pleasing every fan; I think that\u2019s the way to real mediocrity. I think scared artists make bad art and, instead, we had a writers\u2019 room who felt empowered to make bold choices. I think the series is much better for that.\u201d",
