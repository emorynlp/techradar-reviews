    "Shang-Chi feels like another positive step towards greater representation in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Often criticized for its over-reliance on white, cisgender male superheroes, Marvel has finally started to diversify the lead roles in its recent movies, most notably with Black Panther and Black Widow.",
    "It\u2019s a welcome, if long overdue, move and one that Shang-Chi, Marvel\u2019s latest superhero movie starring its first Asian superhero, looks to build on. With nearly 60% of the world\u2019s population living in Asia, or being of Asian descent, it\u2019s high time that an MCU film celebrated the continent\u2019s wide-ranging cultures and societal values.",
    "Set after Avengers: Endgame, the film opens with Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) masquerading as Shaun, a San Francisco native who works as a valet driver alongside best friend Katy (Awkwafina).",
    "When assassins attack Shang-Chi and steal his mother\u2019s pendant, he\u2019s forced to head home and reunite with his estranged father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) and sister Xialing (Meng\u2019er Zhang). Shang-Chi must also deal with the Ten Rings: a criminal organization led by Wenwu, who wields the all-powerful titular bracelets.",
    "Ahead of Shang-Chi\u2019s release, TechRadar sat down with director Destin Daniel Cretton to discuss the importance of making a superhero movie that authentically captures the Asian (and Asian American) experience. We also chatted about the film\u2019s frenetic fight sequences and what the future holds for Shang-Chi in the MCU.",
    "Shang-Chi is a character whose comic history is synonymous with negative Asian stereotypes. The Marvel superhero made his print debut in 1973 but, in the near 50-year period since, Shang-Chi\u2019s various comic series have come packaged with racially insensitive names and clich\u00e9s.",
    "Doing justice to Shang-Chi meant that Marvel needed to eliminate the negative stereotypes associated with the character. Renaming Shang-Chi\u2019s father (Xu Wenwu) and the mystical dragon (the Great Protector), which inhabits the pocket dimension village known as Ta Lo, were well-received first steps, but more was needed.",
    "So Shang-Chi\u2019s origins were also updated for his live-action debut. With the film opening before he flees to the US as a teenager, audiences find Shang-Chi living a secret life as Shaun \u2013 a far cry from his comic counterpart who was born (and resided) in China until he was an adult.",
    "Hiring an Asian American director, then, was vital to give this movie some creative credibility. After a lengthy worldwide search, Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy, The Glass Castle) was tapped for the role. Initially hesitant to helm a superhero movie, Cretton says that Marvel\u2019s desire to update Shang-Chi for the present day, coupled with authentically capturing the Asian experience, was key to him eventually signing on.",
    "\u201cI never had a superhero that I could dress up like on Halloween or someone who looked enough like me when I was a kid,\u201d Cretton tells us. \u201cThey [Marvel] wanted to tell this story in the right way and avoid every Asian stereotype that\u2019s been hovering around for a long time. To be able to do that for another generation of young kids was really exciting to me.\u201d",
    "Like Black Panther, whose sizable cast was made up of numerous Black actors, Shang-Chi\u2019s line-up predominantly comprises many well-known Asian actors as well as newcomers.",
    "Established stars in Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Tony Leung (In the Mood for Love), Awkwafina (The Farewell, Crazy Rich Asians), Fala Chen (The Undoing) and Benedict Wong (Doctor Strange) all feature. Meanwhile, rising star Simu Liu (Bad Blood) and Meng\u2019er Zhang, in her first-ever film role, play Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing respectively.",
    "With 13 members of its cast of Asian descent, Cretton believes that Shang-Chi will be as culturally significant for Asian populations as Black Panther was for Black communities.",
    "\u201cGrowing up, my friends were mainly Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Okinawan,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I went to mainland USA for the first time, I felt out of place. Someone came up to me in a bar and called me Bruce Lee and I realized \u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019m different here\u2019. Now, I can\u2019t wait for people to meet our characters. They\u2019re all of Asian descent and from similar ethnic backgrounds, but there\u2019s such a large array of personalities and I\u2019m excited for both Asian and non-Asian people to notice that we\u2019re just like everyone else.\u201d",
    "While Marvel wanted to avoid insensitive stereotypes in Shang-Chi, the studio was keen to retain one key aspect from the character\u2019s comic series: martial arts.",
    "Known as the Master of Kung Fu, Shang-Chi is an expert in numerous fighting styles. So honoring each form of combat, as well as Kung Fu cinema, was as important to the movie\u2019s chief creative team as other aspects of its production.",
    "The hiring of the late Bradley James Allan (Rush Hour 2, Shanghai Noon) as a second unit director and supervising stunt coordinator was key to the film\u2019s martial arts authenticity. Expert choreographers, movement artists and parkour masters were also drafted in from Mongolia, Australia and Canada to craft Shang-Chi\u2019s battle sequences.",
    "With fighting styles ranging from Hong Quan to meditative Taiji, and Krav Maga to Wushu, Shang-Chi\u2019s close-quarters combat is physically and visually impressive.",
    "Cretton, though, singles out the film\u2019s bus battle, where Shang-Chi is attacked by the Ten Rings for the first time, as the most challenging to film. With actors brawling in the bus\u2019 enclosed environment \u2013 on both a built set and a real-life moving vehicle \u2013 it proved to be a testing sequence to shoot.",
    "\u201cWe shot in an accordion bus that was 20 feet up in the air,\u201d Cretton explains. \u201cAnd that was in a gimbal that could move, twist and go through a 45-degree angle. All of those turns were timed to the practical shots that we got in San Francisco.",
    "\"We had a real bus going down the hill actually crashing into cars that, along with Brad and his team\u2019s choreography, brought added energy and humor to that fight. There was lots of coordination between departments to make sure that everything made sense and was cohesive, and it turned out to be my favorite experience in the movie.\u201d",
    "Shang-Chi should feature prominently in the MCU\u2019s future. The film\u2019s ending and post-credits scenes tease the character\u2019s involvement in Phase 4 and beyond but, right now, Cretton is unsure where his story goes from here.",
    "\u201cThose ideas [for sequels or cameo appearances] are ongoing,\u201d he teases. \u201cAnd they have been since production began. Which direction will Marvel go in the future? I\u2019m not sure, but I can assure you that it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d",
    "Regardless of where Shang-Chi appears next, the character\u2019s live-action debut is another purposeful step forward for the MCU.",
    "Where Black Panther celebrated Black communities, and Captain Marvel and Black Widow led the way in gender equality (albeit for a superhero movie series), Shang-Chi belatedly brings an authentic focus on Asia that had been missing from Marvel\u2019s multi-billion dollar empire.",
    "As part of that quartet, Shang-Chi is helping to usher in more meaningful representation in the MCU.",
    "Marvel\u2019s Eternals will introduce the first openly gay and deaf superheroes to the world\u2019s biggest cinematic universe. Ms Marvel will introduce a Muslim hero in Kamala Khan on Disney Plus, while Marvel\u2019s She-Hulk TV show will continue to build out the MCU\u2019s female hero line-up. Blade and Ironheart, too, will bring more Black superpowered beings to audiences worldwide.",
    "After numerous movies and TV shows centered on straight, white male superhumans, each new arrival is a step in the right direction. Shang-Chi is another example that shows Marvel wants to increase representation in the MCU; it\u2019s just a pity that it took until 2018\u2019s Black Panther for the studio to do so.",
    "Still, Shang-Chi is a historical moment. The character\u2019s first MCU appearance has been a long time coming and, providing audiences take to Marvel\u2019s latest live-action superhero, it won\u2019t be his last.",
    "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is in theaters now."
