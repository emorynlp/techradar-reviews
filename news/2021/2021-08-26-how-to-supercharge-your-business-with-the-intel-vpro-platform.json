  "article": [
    "It\u2019s fair to say that the last 18 months have posed previously unimaginable challenges for businesses of all sizes, with the pandemic affecting workloads, strategy and planning alike.",
    "But as the world slowly starts to come back to something like normality, and workers begin to return to the office, now could be the time for your business to supercharge its technology.",
    "Having the latest hardware can give your workers the efficiency and productivity boost they need to get your business back up and firing on all cylinders again - and laptops based on the Intel vPro platform are designed to offer just that.",
    "Hybrid working, where workers split their time between home and the office, is set to become the new normal in the post-pandemic world. Recent research estimates around 70% of the workforce will be working remotely at least five days a month by 2025, with many technology decision-makers expect nearly a third of their companies\u2019 workforces will be permanently remote working in 2021 alone, meaning your business needs to make sure its devices are able to provide all-day power and comprehensive security accordingly.",
    "The Intel vPro platform is built for business, delivering all the functionalities your workers need, whether they\u2019re at home or in the workplace, with the corresponding Intel Evo vPro Platform powering a wide range of thin and light, but still powerful devices that are ideal for your organisation.",
    "The shift to remote working has meant more attention being paid to device management and protection, as having your workforce spread across the nation can lead to major headaches.",
    "Luckily, the Intel vPro platform offers a number of remote management features through its Intel Active Management Technology (Intel AMT). Using the Intel Endpoint Management Assistant (Intel EMA) tool, IT admins can utilise the remote management capabilities of Intel AMT to monitor, repair, restore, and help protect networked PCs and other devices, no matter where they are located - even those outside of the company firewall.",
    "Whether your workforce is made up of sales people travelling to new customers and prospects, technicians making site visits, or support staff within the office, supporting these devices is easier than ever with Intel AMT on the Intel vPro platform.",
    "Working remotely also raises the possibility of cyber-attacks, as criminals look to exploit possible security lapses or shortcomings both from the worker and from the services they use.",
    "The Intel vPro platform has tough security protection built into the hardware itself, stamping out threats before they can spread, and making sure your devices stay protected.",
    "The Intel Hardware Shield ships with all Intel vPro based devices, combining Intel Threat Detection Technology, below-the-OS protection as well as comprehensive app and data security protection to make sure all risks are minimised effectively.",
    "Devices powered by the Intel Evo vPro platform will also give you everything you need to work, straight out of the box, boasting Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, Thunderbolt 4 and fast start-up times - and with all-day battery life and fast recharging, an Intel vPro platform-based device could prove to be the perfect workday companion.",
    "So, if you\u2019re looking to upgrade your hardware and give the workforce the boost it needs, then you can be sure that a device packing the Intel vPro platform will deliver just that. You can find out more about the Intel vPro platform and all the advantages it offers here."
