    "The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset is official, and if you\u2019re looking to upgrade your top-tier Android phone next year, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll find this chipset powering your new flagship device.",
    "We\u2019ve been learning about what the new chip is capable of, and you\u2019ll find everything you need to know about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in our coverage elsewhere.",
    "Just want to know the key changes? We\u2019ve put together this list of what may change on your next Android phone. There are six major features that you need to know about, and these will give you an idea of what you can expect in upcoming flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S22, OnePlus 10, Xiaomi 12 and more.",
    "Let\u2019s start with arguably the biggest change. The new chipset will allow your smartphone\u2019s camera to always be on. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be constantly snapping selfies - it\u2019s designed to allow for other features rather than taking photographs.",
    "Why would that benefit you? It will allow developers to include features that are specifically designed around using your phone\u2019s camera without you touching the device.",
    "An example Qualcomm has given is that it\u2019ll allow you to unlock your phone without touching it. Think about how you may be cooking with ingredients all over your hands, and this will allow you to unlock your phone without getting gunk on it.",
    "Some have cited security concerns about the feature, and it may worry you, too. Qualcomm insists that it\u2019s doing this in a safe way to ensure that no one can take your data from your phone\u2019s cameras, but it\u2019ll be interesting to see how people might take advantage of the feature.",
    "Aside from the always-on camera, there are lots of other upgrades that you\u2019ll find are coming to your smartphone\u2019s camera. An 18-bit image signal processor (ISP), improved night mode photography, better wide-angle shots, stronger facial recognition technology, 8K HDR video recording\u2026 the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is focused on its camera upgrade.",
    "While the always-on upgrade is the headline-grabbing feature here, there are lots of other little improvements that you may see on your next phone\u2019s snapper that will improve the overall experience.",
    "There aren\u2019t many game-changing features here, though. Camera phones are already fantastic, but these smaller upgrades are likely to slightly tweak the performance you get from your smartphone\u2019s shooter rather than overhaul the whole experience.",
    "Qualcomm\u2019s Voice Suite technology has been upgraded in 2021, and the aim here is to cut out background noise when you\u2019re being recorded. For example, if you\u2019re on a video call, this new technology will use artificial intelligence to try and cut out noises such as sirens or typing.",
    "We\u2019ve seen a demo of the technology, and in Qualcomm\u2019s examples it worked amazingly well. This was on a reference device in a demo set up by Qualcomm, so we\u2019re most interested in seeing this on a real life device to see how it works in practice.",
    "It if works as well as the demos suggested, it could change how you\u2019re recorded on calls and how you\u2019re heard by your colleagues, friends and family.",
    "This isn\u2019t going to be useful for everyone, but if you have a phenomenally good 5G connection you\u2019ll find you can reach higher speeds than ever before.",
    "Last year\u2019s Snapdragon 888 was restricted to 7.5Gbps, which is also fantastically quick. It\u2019s almost impossible to reach these speeds on an average day, but it\u2019s useful to know your 2022 flagship phone will be capable of it for the future.",
    "The bokeh effect is where you can blur the background of a subject, and it\u2019s commonplace in portrait modes throughout the Android sphere. If you\u2019ve wanted to get that effect in video recording, you haven\u2019t been able to until now.",
    "A similar technology debuted on the iPhone 13 series with Apple\u2019s Cinematic Mode feature, and now it\u2019ll be coming to Android phones through this new chipset.",
    "We don\u2019t yet know which manufacturers will include this feature, but it\u2019s likely a lot of the upcoming Android phones will install this in camera apps for you to play with. It\u2019s also capable of recording up to 4K.",
    "As to be expected, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the company\u2019s fastest chipset so it should mean your smartphone is quicker at loading up apps, playing games and anything else you throw at it.",
    "According to Qualcomm, the CPU here is 20% faster than the Snapdragon 888 and it offers 30% power savings over that chip's results as well. The Adreno GPU is 30% faster, which should mean games load quicker and look better than ever.",
    "We won\u2019t know how well the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 truly performs until we see it in new smartphones (and whatever hardware manufacturers decide to pair this with) but it\u2019s looking like a big upgrade for the biggest phones of 2022."
