    "Get ready for the unlikeliest comeback in pop music history. 20 years after fading from sight, 90s group Girls5eva - so-called because they're going to be famous 5 eva! - get their second shot at stardom when their one-hit wonder is sampled by a famous artist. Mortified by the creepiness of their old tracks, Dawn (Sara Bareilles) makes it her mission to write a hit that the band can be proud of. Follow our guide as we explain how to watch Girls5eva online and stream the new Peacock sitcom from anywhere in the world today.",
    "The group's former star Wickie (Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry), bored dentist Gloria (Paula Bell), and Real Housewives reject Summer (Busy Philipps) are all painfully aware of how desperate they might look, but couldn't be happier to get on board if it means escaping their jobs, kids and debt for a while.",
    "Unfortunately, the reunion also includes their perverted manager Larry (Jonathan Hadary), a self-proclaimed \"ally\" who's proud of being slightly less creepy than he used to be.",
    "Laden with cringe, blink-and-you'll-miss-'em jabs at the showbiz industry and a catchy original tune or two, Girls5eva has Tina Fey and Meredith Scardino's fingerprints all over it, and is looking like an instant smash hit for Peacock.",
    "Read on as we explain how to watch Girls5eva and stream the new comedy show online with Peacock.",
    "For those of you abroad when Girls5eva lands, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the new comedy series due to annoying regional restrictions.",
    "Fortunately, there is a solution in the form of a VPN. This nifty bit of software changes your IP address so that you can access all the content you normally would at home, only from anywhere in the world.",
