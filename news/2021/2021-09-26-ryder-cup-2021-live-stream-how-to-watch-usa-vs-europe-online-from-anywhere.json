  "summary": "Can Europe stop a dominant Team USA from Ryder Cup glory?",
  "article": [
    "With Team USA 11-5 up heading into Ryder Cup Sunday, the European team will be watching videos of miracles of yore. Can they pull of on of golf's greatest upsets at Whistling Straits today? Or will it be a winning procession for the dominant hosts? You can watch every drive, putt and \"Get in the hole!\" with our guide to getting a Ryder Cup live stream - no matter where in the world you are.",
    "The host team has won the past three tournaments fairly emphatically, but that may well change this year, with Team Europe featuring seven players from the 17.5 - 10.5 victory in 2018. Stalwarts Lee Westwood, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Ian Poulter will complement the likes of world No. 1 Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood.",
    "Team USA may be green, but Stricker has four of the best five golfers in the world at his service, in Dustin Johnson, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and captain's pick Xander Schauffele. That world No. 21 Scottie Scheffler is his lowest ranked player has to be a frightening prospect, even for a group that's as sure of itself as Team Europe appears to be.",
    "We're not sure Stricker will be pairing Bryson DeChambeau - who had a miserable time three years ago - with Brooks Koepka, but a successful tournament for Team USA would raise the tantalising prospect of a ceasefire between these bitter rivals, with world peace surely to follow.",
    "The stakes could barely be higher, so follow our guide as we explain how to watch a 2021 Ryder Cup live stream from anywhere.",
    "There are loads of easy ways to watch a Ryder Cup golf live stream in the UK and US, as well as the likes of Australia, Canada and Australia - scroll down for a full breakdown of options. But because of geo-restrictions, you\u2019ll need to use a VPN service if you're abroad to dial in to a location that lets you watch the golf online in the same way you would at home.",
    "A VPN is perfect for this, as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in your country of residence, where you usual streaming services and subscriptions are based. You may be surprised by how easy it is to get stared using one, too.",
    "Use a VPN to watch Ryder Cup golf online from anywhere",
    "Watching from abroad is as easy as a drive, a pitch and a putt...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - our recommendation for streamers is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the relevant server location - launch the VPN app, click on 'choose location' and select a server from your home location",
    "3. Head to the chosen broadcaster's live stream - for example, Americans can head to Peacock TV or UK golf fans to Sky Go",
    "Sunday singles",
    "The tournament tees off on Friday, September 24, with the final action set to be played on Sunday, September 26.",
    "As ever, the mornings of the first two days are reserved for foursomes, with fourballs being played in the afternoons. Both days start at 8am ET / 5am PT / 1pm BST.",
    "The final day ratchets up the tension with 12 one-on-one singles matches, the action kicking off at 12pm ET / 9am PT / 5pm BST.",
    "The 2021 Ryder Cup is being played at Whistling Straits, Kohler, for the first time.",
    "The links-style course, which sits on the west coast of Lake Michigan, has previously hosted three editions of the PGA Championship. Ominously for Team USA, an American finished runner-up on each occasion.",
    "If a links-style course, in Wisconsin, hugging one of North America's Great Lakes, didn't sound precarious enough, Friday's weather forecast could make things trickier still, with a drizzly, breezy opening day in the offing.",
    "The outlook is far more positive after that, with nothing but sunshine expected for the remainder of the tournament.",
    "The nature of match play means it's futile picking a pre-tournament favourite. Harrington has plumped for experience in his camp, with Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland and Bernd Wiesberger the three rookies in a European team whose members have 38 tournaments to their names.",
    "Team USA, meanwhile, has eschewed experience in favour of form and talent, with six players getting their first ever taste of Ryder Cup action. They have just 12 Ryder Cups' worth of experience between them, but eight of them are in the world's top 10, and nine are in the top 20.",
    "And a home crowd certainly plays its part, especially in the USA! USA! USA! The visiting team has only won 13 of 42 Ryder Cup tournaments, and nine of those went the way of Team USA.",
    "Despite a rough start for Team Europe, they turned it around to win the 2018 Ryder Cup by a distance.",
    "It was a bittersweet victory for captain Thomas Bj\u00f8rn, who then had to honour his promise of having the 17.5 - 10.5 winning score tattooed on his backside.",
    "The 2020 Ryder Cup was postponed because of Covid-19, with the next edition taking place near Rome in 2023."
