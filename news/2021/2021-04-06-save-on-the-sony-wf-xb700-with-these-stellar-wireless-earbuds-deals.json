    "If you're looking for a fantastic wireless earbuds deal, check out these brilliant discounts on the Sony WF-XB700 in the US and the UK, which sees the in-ear headphones plummet in price. (Not in the US or UK? Scroll down for the best Sony WF-XB700 prices in your region.)",
    "If you're in the US, you can get the Sony earbuds for $69, saving you over $60 on the original retail price of $129.99.",
    "The true wireless earbuds have also been discounted in the UK, with Amazon slashing the price to just \u00a369, again, saving you \u00a360.",
    "These prices aren't the absolute lowest we've seen, but they're pretty close, and well worth snapping up if you need a pair of wireless earbuds.",
    "For their price, you could do a lot worse than the Sony WF-XB700 True Wireless Headphones. They are a marked improvement on the original WF-1000X and WF-SP700N, and without a doubt our second-favorite Sony true wireless earbuds after the Sony WF-1000XM3.",
    "An IPX4 water-resistance rating means you can use these earbuds while working out, without the worry that a little sweat or rain will break them.",
    "They have a fun, energetic sound quality, feel comfortable during long listening sessions and have an 18-hour combined battery life. We don't love their radar-disc shape and their lack of noise cancellation, but these are undoubtedly Sony's second-best true wireless earbuds.",
