  "article": [
    "Update: The first Hawkeye trailer has arrived online \u2013 24 hours than we had previously thought!",
    "Despite star Jeremy Renner's claims that the first footage for Marvel's upcoming TV show would land on Tuesday, September 17, the studio has surprised everyone by releasing its first trailer a day early.",
    "Set during the Holiday season, Hawkeye appears to find Clint Barton (Renner) dealing with the ramifications of his time as Ronin, the alternate pseudonym he assumed between Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. He also winds up meeting Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), another master archer, and the pair seemingly team up to take down some bad people in humorous fashion in time for the festive period.",
    "Check out the trailer, which has big Die Hard and Home Alone energy, below \u2013 and then read on for our original story from earlier.",
    "Original story follows.",
    "The first Hawkeye trailer has received an official release date, and fans won\u2019t have to wait very long for it.",
    "Marvel\u2019s next TV series will land on Disney Plus in November but, a couple of official images aside, we've seen little of how the show will look.",
    "That, though, is about to change. Hawkeye\u2019s maiden trailer will arrive online tomorrow (Tuesday, September 17) and give us our first look at the Jeremy Renner-starring TV show. The news was revealed by the MCU actor himself on Instagram, which you can see in our grabbed screenshot below:",
    "Little is known about the plot, but the first official footage will give us a better look at what it\u2019ll entail. What we do know is that Hawkeye will explore more of the character\u2019s time as Ronin, the moniker that Clint Barton assumed between Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.",
    "We also know that Barton will end up meeting Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), who adopts the Hawkeye mantle after Barton in the comics, which brings a myriad of problems into Barton's life. The master marksman will also have to contend with Echo (Alaqua Cox) and Yelena Belova\u2019s Black Widow (Florence Pugh) \u2013 the latter of whom believes Hawkeye is responsible for the death of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in Endgame.",
    "Hawkeye will launch exclusively on Disney Plus on Wednesday, November 24.",
    "Marvel can expect another TV success when Hawkeye lands on Disney Plus. The studio has already seen fans flock to Disney\u2019s streaming platform to watch its four other shows to date, so we suspect that Hawkeye will also draw in plenty of viewers.",
    "Hawkeye, though, has to do something that Falcon and the Winter Soldier struggled with: make a non-cosmic MCU TV series that\u2019ll create plenty of fan theories and debate online.",
    "While there were some stellar moments in Falcon and the Winter Soldier, it paled somewhat in comparison to WandaVision. Marvel\u2019s first TV show was helped by numerous fan theories throughout its nine-episode run, no doubt aided by its mysterious plot, magical-based elements and sitcom show inspiration.",
    "Falcon and the Winter Soldier was more grounded and grittier. Without similarly intense speculation that followed WandaVision, however, it struggled to match its predecessor\u2019s heights.",
    "Hawkeye faces a comparable scenario. The fifth MCU TV series follows in the footsteps of Loki \u2013 arguably the best Marvel show to date \u2013 and What If\u2026?, Marvel\u2019s animated anthology series that has surprisingly performed better than some may have expected.",
    "Add in the prospect that Hawkeye will, like Falcon and the Winter Soldier, be more earthly in setting and tone, and some may claim that it\u2019s already at a disadvantage.",
    "Hawkeye could have a few tricks up its sleeve, though. It\u2019s possible that the show is set post-Loki and WandaVision, which means that the multiverse will have arrived in the MCU by its first episode.",
    "If it has, Hawkeye could mess with our heads by revealing that Kate Bishop, Echo, or other characters have been pulled into the MCU from other realities. We\u2019ve speculated on this possibility before, and we believe it would whip Marvel\u2019s fanbase into a frenzy if that proved to be the case.",
    "The inclusion of Pugh\u2019s Belova will further cement the ties between Marvel\u2019s TV shows and its movies. Meanwhile, the appearances of Bishop and Lucky the Pizza Dog \u2013 two fan favorite comic characters \u2013 are sure to provide Hawkeye\u2019s show with significant viewership boosts.",
    "Enrich Barton with more character development, provide him with a terrific antagonist (Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u2019s villains weren\u2019t great) and give us some big multiversal surprises, and Hawkeye will be the TV show that the long-time Avenger deserves."
