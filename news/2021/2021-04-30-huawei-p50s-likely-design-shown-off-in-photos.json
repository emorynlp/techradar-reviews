    "Until now our closest look at the Huawei P50 had come from renders, but now we\u2019ve seen something that might be close to the real thing, as photos that appear to show a dummy unit of the phone have leaked.",
    "Shared by leakers Digital Chat Station and Technology Yu on Weibo (a Chinese social media site), the images look like they could be showing the real phone, but an accompanying description describes it (via machine translation) as a \u201cthird-party model.\u201d",
    "That presumably means a dummy unit used by a company such as a case maker that would want to know what the phone looks like ahead of launch.",
    "Often dummy units are supplied by the phone manufacturer \u2013 or at least based on specs provided by them, so there\u2019s a good chance the phone shown in these images is an accurate representation of the Huawei P50, but there\u2019s no guarantee.",
    "In any case, the photos show a design that\u2019s much like we\u2019ve seen before in renders. There\u2019s a large camera block housing two massive circles on the rear, though it\u2019s expected that at least one of these circles will house multiple lenses, and indeed one of the images above shows two lenses in each.",
    "The front meanwhile includes a flat screen, a punch-hole camera, and the Huawei P50 is shown in both white and black shades.",
    "As ever with leaks we\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt, but with these matching what we\u2019ve seen before we\u2019d think they\u2019re likely to be accurate. We should find out soon, as the Huawei P50 is expected to land in May or June \u2013 probably alongside the Huawei P50 Pro and Huawei P50 Pro Plus.",
