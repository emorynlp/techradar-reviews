    "Hot on the heels of the Samsung Galaxy S21, the second major flagship of the year has now launched in the form of the Xiaomi Mi 11. If you thought this had already launched, you\u2019re right, but previously it was only available in China.",
    "Now it\u2019s coming to the UK, where it will go on sale sometime in March, though we don\u2019t have an exact release date yet. We also still don\u2019t know the exact price, but in euros, it will cost \u20ac749 (around $900 / \u00a3660 / AU$1,180) for a model with 128GB of storage, and \u20ac799 (roughly $960 / \u00a3700 / AU$1,260) for one with 256GB.",
    "However, we wouldn\u2019t expect an exact price conversion, and nor would we expect the Xiaomi Mi 11 to land in the US. A launch in Australia also remains unclear, though the Xiaomi Mi 10 landed there, so there\u2019s a good chance the Mi 11 will too.",
    "In any case, for that money you get a phone with a top-end Snapdragon 888 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and a 6.81-inch quad-curved AMOLED screen, with a 1440 x 3200 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.",
    "There\u2019s also a triple-lens camera, with a 108MP f/1.9 main shooter, a 13MP f/2.4 ultra-wide one, and a 5MP f/2.4 macro one, while around the front there\u2019s a 20MP selfie snapper. Xiaomi claims the camera offers improved night mode capabilities, along with a bunch of new video features such as \u2018Parallel World\u2019, which duplicates and inverts the scene.",
    "Other specs include a 4,600mAh battery with 55W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, and 10W reverse wireless charging. Plus there\u2019s an in-screen fingerprint scanner, dual speakers, and a glass back in a Midnight Grey or Horizon Blue finish.",
    "All in all the Xiaomi Mi 11 certainly sounds impressive on paper, but if you want something even higher end then bear in mind that we\u2019ve heard rumors of a Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro. We thought we might see this at the global Mi 11 launch, but even though we didn\u2019t there\u2019s a good chance it will land later."
