    "Google\u2019s run in game development was short but sweet. The company announced that it plans to shut down its internal development studio and divert all resources to enticing third-party developers to launching games on Google Stadia.",
    "Google only began making its own games in the last two years, and now will close the doors on both its Los Angeles and Montreal game studios, parting ways with Jade Raymond (founder of Ubisoft Toronto and Motive Studios) as well.",
    "\u201cCreating best-in-class games from the ground up takes many years and significant investment, and the cost is going up exponentially,\u201d Google said in a new blog post explaining the decision.",
    "\u201cGiven our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we\u2019ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games.\u201d",
    "What those near-term planned games are is anyone\u2019s guess. To date Google has yet to ship any first-party titles and has only landed a handful of exclusive titles through third parties, which makes the decision all the harder to wrap our heads around.",
    "The reasoning behind the move, according to Google, is to free up resources that will allow the company to develop the Google Stadia platform itself:",
    "\u201cHaving games streamed to any screen is the future of this industry, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in Stadia and its underlying platform to provide the best cloud gaming experience for our partners and the gaming community. This has been the vision of Stadia since the beginning.\u201d",
    "So what does that mean for Stadia going forward? Well, it means we won\u2019t ever get those first-party games Google promised (bummer) \u2013 and could possibly be seen as a move towards obsolescence \u2013 but for now there\u2019s going to be very little change for Stadia users and Stadia Pro subscribers.",
    "Your games will all still be there, and nothing is getting removed from the store."
