    "Oculus is getting into AR, and it has big repercussions for the future direction of the company and its popular line of VR headsets \u2013 especially the eventual Oculus Quest 3.",
    "The Facebook-owned company recently announced its intention to open up its Oculus platform to augmented reality developers, allowing them to use the Oculus Quest 2 headset to host AR games and apps rather than simply VR titles \u2013 setting the scene for an explosion of both consumer and business applications on the popular standalone headset.",
    "The introduction of AR in a VR headset may be confusing at first glance, especially because of how distinct AR and VR hardware has traditionally been.",
    "While VR headsets require extensive visors that cover our field of vision and immerse us in a different reality, AR products tend to take the form of smart glasses like the Google Glass or Microsoft Hololens, which overlay our surroundings with computer-generated images \u2013 in what tends to be a very limited field of view.",
    "But Facebook is angling to utilise its existing VR hardware \u2013 and existing install base \u2013 to position itself as a purveyor of AR goods too, and it might be the breakthrough move AR needs to make it to the mainstream. Rather than having to build up separate interest in AR technology, Facebook can funnel these applications directly to current VR enthusiasts, and test the waters for more AR investment down the line.",
    "What makes this possible is the series of four built-in cameras in the exterior of the Quest 2\u2019s casing. These cameras can essentially record the wearer\u2019s surroundings and show the feed on the display inside the headset, allowing anyone to look outside, as if through a window.",
    "It\u2019s ostensibly a safety precaution \u2013 so you can see who or what you\u2019re walking into \u2013 but there are clearly further applications for these camera capabilities, as shown by Facebook\u2019s foray into AR. It\u2019s very early days, of course, and without any AR apps on the platform as yet, it\u2019s mainly an invitation to developers to start working on ideas. The benefits for everyday consumers are also likely a way off.",
    "However, this one announcement could also have huge repercussions for the direction of the Oculus line of VR headsets, too, especially with the spectre of an Oculus Quest 3 or Quest Pro on the horizon. Here\u2019s why.",
    "We spoke to Peter Maddalena, director of VRCraftworks, an agency that creates VR, AR, and mixed-reality experiences for brands around the world \u2013 and has its roots in the same online VR community that saw Palmer Luckey birth the very first Oculus headset prototype.",
    "Maddalena says the introduction of AR capabilities into the Oculus headset manages to sidestep the usual \u201climitation of AR spectacles\u201d, which is the narrow field of vision they usually provide. The wide visor-like display found in a VR headset vastly expands the field of view and the reach of any augmented reality objects.",
    "\u201cAll of a sudden, instead of having that small screen, you have the whole field of view, which gives you more opportunity to actually place objects of interest around that space,\u201d Maddalena says.",
    "However, Maddalena admits that the current iterations of the Oculus Quest headsets aren\u2019t perfect carriers of AR either. \u201cThe pressure on wearables is to become lighter, thinner, more like glasses,\u201d even as VR headsets remain relatively hefty. Using an immersive headset to record and display your surroundings is a smart workaround, but it will no doubt remain a semi-isolating experience for now.",
    "The Quest 2\u2019s four-camera setup is pretty advanced compared to other commercial headsets on the market, but these cameras are still in black and white, meaning that, even if AR objects are presented in color, they\u2019ll be against a monochrome background of the wearer\u2019s surroundings. We\u2019re told by Maddalena, though, that \u201cwhat people don\u2019t realise is that there\u2019s a whole lot of AI that allows you to turn black and white images into color images\u2026 so perhaps this is a stepping stone, until the Quest comes out with color cameras.\u201d",
    "These cameras don\u2019t line up with your eyes, either, meaning you\u2019re getting a video feed from some unintuitive angles, which means your sense of depth perception likely won\u2019t be as seamless with a passthrough feed as it would be with, well, your actual vision.",
    "Of course, giving AR tools to developers is still a long way from launching their early efforts, and it may be some time before Oculus has an AR library actually worth dipping into. \u201dIt\u2019s not what I would call a killer feature,\u201d Maddalena says, \u201cbecause killer features are based on content.\u201d",
    "Of course, this early in the days of Oculus\u2019 AR efforts, the real enhancements are likely to come with later, more advanced hardware \u2013 more custom-built for the needs and requirements of AR.",
    "Smaller hardware and higher resolution screens will only help; after all, while computer-generated images can still look quite good on a low-res screen (hello Nintendo Switch), real-life images and objects can quickly look a bit pixelated, and not as we expect to perceive them. More advanced cameras that can capture color will be necessary to do this well, and that\u2019s something we can only hope to get in an Oculus Quest 3 or Quest Pro too.",
    "Leo Gebbie, a technology analyst at CCS Insight, tells us that \u201cheadsets which can seamlessly blend the real and digital worlds [...] require a strong baseline of technical specs \u2013 including a very high resolution display, and powerful external cameras \u2013 in order to deliver a compelling experience. This is where I\u2019d suggest that we\u2019re still some way away from AR passthrough on consumer VR devices being a good idea in practice.\u201d",
    "The main thing for Facebook to do at this point is to get in early, and establish itself as the best site for burgeoning AR development \u2013 though it doesn\u2019t need to do this for consumers. Oculus headsets are still being sold on their capability to deliver VR experiences alone, and by the time AR applications catch up, there\u2019ll be a huge install base ready to start trying them out with their Quest hardware.",
    "We\u2019re sure Oculus will be keen to avoid recreating the failed launch of the Magic Leap One, a consumer AR headset with a sleek design and sky-high price tag that, despite an initial wave of hype, simply didn\u2019t resonate with everyday consumers \u2013 without the audience to attract developers, or the content to attract an audience in the first place. The moderately-priced Quest 2, though, already has a user base to start with, vastly lowering the risk of its (and developers\u2019) AR investments.",
    "\u201cDevelopers will want to reach the Oculus installed user base and using Facebook\u2019s devices will be the best way to do this,\u201d Gebbie says.",
    "In April 2021 we heard from Facebook exec Andrew Bosworth about a new Quest iteration being in developmen,, though ostensibly a \u201cQuest Pro\u201d rather than a third instalment, suggesting a higher-spec model designed to sit alongside the less powerful Quest 2. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a Quest 3, there\u2019s only a Quest 2,\u201d said Bosworth, adding that \u201cwe want to introduce new functionality to the headset [...] and that\u2019s a little way off still.\u201d",
    "With the Quest 2 selling relatively well, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an appetite to replace it right away, then, and this push into AR will no doubt see the Quest 2 become a proving ground for budding AR developers hoping to make or port Oculus\u2019 first big augmented reality hit. Once those teeth are cut, though, it\u2019ll turn to a successor or more powerful model to fulfil AR\u2019s potential on the Oculus platform.",
    "Maddalena tells us that he\u2019s \u201calways found [the Quest 2] powerful enough,\u201d but future iterations are only going to improve the scale and scope of what VR and AR developers can do. \u201cI just look forward to being able to do more, more fancy lighting techniques and more interesting content, not necessarily having to worry about reducing the number of shadows or how to keep the frame rate up.\u201d",
    "Everyone we spoke to was confident in saying that Oculus\u2019 competitors were likely to follow suit, using the passthrough camera tech in the HTC Vive Pro, or HP Reverb G2, to start testing out AR applications \u2013 with a future of more fluid, capable devices in store that can dip in and out of different mixed reality experiences with ease. Given the Vive Pro only features two cameras though, this seems like yet another chance for Oculus to gain the upper hand against its competitor.",
    "As Gebbie puts it, \u201cin the longer term, I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll start to see mixed reality products which totally blur the boundaries between VR and AR, demonstrating the power of the entire XR spectrum in one device.\u201d",
    "However, we\u2019re still some way off the logistical ease needed to make VR and AR headsets as commonplace as, say, the smartphone.",
    "Faisal Galaria, CEO of Blippar \u2013 an AR technology company that creates bespoke AR experiences \u2013 predicts that we\u2019ll need headsets, \u201cboth AR and VR, to slim down so they become a natural and everyday accessory. This is when AR will become ubiquitous [...] VR headsets are still limited by portability and mobility, and not something you\u2019ll expect to see in everyday life for some years to come.\u201d",
    "Oculus is also now a subsidiary of Facebook, and it\u2019s impossible to separate the strategies of both companies entirely. Galaria suggests the hypothetical Oculus Pro will also \u201cgive users wider access to self-generated content, rather than consuming content provided to them\u201d \u2013 following the user-led content strategy of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram (the latter also being owned by the former). New Oculus users need a Facebook account, after all, while older ones will need to link one by 2023.",
    "Galaria tells us that \u201cOculus also has a captive audience in place that is signed up with a Facebook account, giving Facebook the ability to analyse users and their activities and direct personalised content their way, which really opens up potential possibilities for refined, immersive, personalised AR experiences (and possibly advertising).\u201d",
    "So the key here may not just be the work of developers\u2019 but the engagement of users in ensuring Oculus\u2019 AR platform is full of content you won\u2019t get anywhere else. Less Oculus 3, more Oculus Me."
