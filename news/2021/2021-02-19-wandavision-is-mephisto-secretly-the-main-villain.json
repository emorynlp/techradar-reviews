    "Spoilers for WandaVision episode 7 follow.",
    "WandaVision is jam-packed with mysteries that have left fans scrambling for answers. In this week's episode, we finally learned who the true villain of the Marvel series is, and who's been bothering Wanda and Vision in the town of Westview over the past few weeks.",
    "Or did we?",
    "Despite the ending reveal of WandaVision episode 7, some fans are convinced that Mephisto, Marvel's version of the devil, could still be operating behind the scenes in the show, based on one key piece of evidence. Below, we'll explore that theory in more detail, and discuss how Mephisto could possibly fit into the events of the series.",
    "Mephisto first appeared in Silver Surfer #3, of all places, all the way back in 1968. He tormented everyone\u2019s favorite chromed hero for a few years but eventually moved on to others like Thor and Ghost Rider, as well as the wider cast of Marvel characters.",
    "As far as we know, Mephisto hasn\u2019t yet appeared in the MCU. He\u2019s a little like a more devilish version of Dormammu, the antagonist from Doctor Strange\u2019s first solo movie. Though unlike Dormammu, Mephisto is more willing to bargain.",
    "One of Mephisto\u2019s more famous deals in the comics was with Spider-Man, where in exchange for erasing his marriage to Mary Jane Watson, Aunt May was saved from death and the world forgot that Peter Parker was Spider-Man. It was a very controversial storyline.",
    "After Spider-Man: Far From Home\u2019s ending, where the MCU Peter had his secret identity exposed, perhaps our favorite wall-crawler could do with making a similar deal.",
    "Importantly for WandaVision, in the Marvel comics, Mephisto played a hand in the birth of Wanda\u2019s kids. In the books, Wanda\u2019s powers are more overtly magical, like Doctor Strange\u2019s, and she drew on power from Mephisto to create her children. Later, Mephisto took that power back, and with it Wanda\u2019s kids too. That's not necessarily what's going on in WandaVision, but since Wanda and Vision's kids feature heavily, it doesn't seem totally implausible.",
    "Since WandaVision has yet to explain exactly how Billy and Tommy were born, some fans are looking to the comics for easy answers. With Mephisto playing such a key part in their birth, there, it\u2019s easy to assume he\u2019s now involved in this particular MCU storyline. But is there anything else we can go on, from what we've seen so far?",
    "Agony aunt Agnes",
    "Some of the most significant evidence that Mephisto could be the big-bad of WandaVision has come through Agnes, Wanda and Vision\u2019s friendly neighbor (played by Kathryn Hahn). We now know after episode 7 that 'Angnes' is, in fact, Agatha Harkness, a witch from the comic books who has shared a lot of similarities with the on-screen character.",
    "In the source material, Agatha is a powerful magic-user and a mentor-like figure to Wanda. She was also the one who revealed that Tommy and Billy were formed from Mephisto, and wiped Wanda\u2019s memory of them.",
    "In the show, Agatha's basement is covered in dark vines and has cabinets filled with skulls and ominous red light. If that doesn't scream devilish, we don't know what does. She also has a glowing tome on a pedestal that is awfully reminiscent of the Book of Cagliostro, the spellbook in Doctor Strange which allowed Kaecilius to summon Dormammu and use his powers.",
    "Perhaps Agatha is now doing something similar, drawing on the powers of Mephisto to manipulate Wanda. Or maybe Agatha is herself under Mephisto's control? We'll have to wait and see.",
    "Eagle-eyed viewers have been suspicious of 'Agnes' for a while. She has been more aware of Wanda\u2019s control over Westview compared to the others in the Hex, and on SWORD\u2019s board of Westview residents, Agnes is the only character who hasn\u2019t been officially identified. Sections of her document are left empty, and she doesn\u2019t have an attached driving license like the other residents.",
    "The episode 7 fly",
    "Yes, you read that right: our next piece of evidence is a fly seen in episode 7 of WandaVision. A recent Avengers comic book \u2013 issue 38 of the current run by writer Jason Aaron \u2013 depicts Mephisto's first appearance on Earth four billion years ago as a fly.",
    "When Wanda is sat in Agatha's home for the first time, she sees both a rabbit and a single fly over by the window.",
    "Bugs are known to crawl around the homes of witches and evil characters, but the fact that this was a lone pest has led fans to speculate it may be more important. Specifically, that the fly could be a disguise for Mephisto, or at least a reference to the character.",
    "Is SWORD actually SWORD?",
    "This next one is even stranger than the fly, but fans have pointed out that SWORD\u2019s icon resembles an inverted cross, a religious sign that is (sometimes) used to hint at satanic ideals. We feel like this is a little out there as fan theories go, but episode 5 did start to raise questions about the organization\u2019s intentions and episode 7 has furthered them.",
    "While the MCU has played the \u2018good organization is secretly evil\u2019 card a few times already, we can\u2019t help but be suspicious of SWORD Director Tyler Hayward. We now know that Hayward was experimenting on Vision's body to create his own weapon, so he understands hates Wanda for stealing him. But is the hatred fuelled by Mephisto?",
    "To add fuel to the fire, some have called attention to Hayward\u2019s odd office decoration, with frames on his wall arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The Hex is the name Darcy gave to the Westview phenomena, given the prevalence of the six-sided shape.",
    "Maybe the demon is puppeteering the director? Again, though, we think this is a little out there based on the evidence as it stands. SWORD is more likely a separate secondary antagonist.",
    "Quicksilver quandaries",
    "Finally, we have Quicksilver. The MCU has gone out of its way to highlight that this is indeed Evan Peters' version of the character, thanks to Darcy\u2019s \u201crecast\u201d line and an official audio description for episode 5 which said, \u201cWanda stares at the version of Pietro from the X-Men films.\u201d It doesn\u2019t get much clearer than that.",
    "Altering dimensions in such a way is not beyond the scope of Scarlet Witch in the comics, but it goes beyond her current skill set as we know it in the MCU. In fact, all of WandaVision seems to be ratcheting up Wanda\u2019s capabilities beyond what we've seen in the past. Some are assuming that Wanda could instead be drawing on some new source of power, potentially something capable of moving between dimensions.",
    "This could feasibly be related to Mephisto, a character Wanda has siphoned energy from before in Marvel comics stories, but we'll have to wait and see. Bringing people back from the dead, as we\u2019ve seemingly seen with Quicksilver and Vision, is also a tool in his wheelhouse.",
    "Mephisto wouldn\u2019t be the most leftfield villain for Wandavision, and given his mystical and multi-dimensional presence in the comics, he would make for a neat connection into Wanda\u2019s next appearance in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. Since he's a more satanic character, though, even being confused for the devil in the comics, Mephisto might be a bit out there for the more mainstream MCU.",
    "Mephisto is also not the only candidate for the show's ultimate villain, either, and more obvious suggestions are in plain sight. Agatha could be the villain in her own right, without any influence from Mephisto at all. Episode 7 made a literal song and dance about how it's been 'Agatha all along' and 'Hex' has been an obvious reference to spells and magic.",
    "The odd spellbook revealed in episode 7 may have no specific connection to Mephisto either. Some think it could be the Darkhold - a book full of evil spells like the Necronomicon - which Mephisto has used but it's mostly connected to other Marvel comics baddies like Chthon and Morgan La Fey.",
    "For those hung up on how Pietro ended up in WandaVision, we have a possible answer for that too: Wanda really could be this powerful now. She is arguably the strongest Avenger already \u2013 something the show touched on in episode 5 \u2013 and there is still the chance her abilities could be being amplified by Agnes or some other source.",
    "On top of this, Avengers: Endgame included a lot of time travel shenanigans, which have been shown to cause tears in Marvel\u2019s comics reality before. Perhaps similar tears are allowing Wanda to bring Pietro through from another universe. Again, these are all just theories until we learn more from the show.",
    "Only time will tell how this mystery will play out, and Disney will likely be glad that the WandaVision mystery is such a tough nut to crack \u2013 it no doubt keeps people watching, including us."
