    "The Google Pixel \u2018Fold\u2019 may indeed be real after all, if a leaker\u2019s tweet is to be believed.",
    "Noted leaker Jon Prosser didn\u2019t include much information in his tweet \u2013 just that the Google Pixel Fold exists, and that it\u2019s coming either late this year or early in 2022, per a follow-up message.",
    "In a reply to that tweet, DSCC founder and display analyst Ross Young concurred \u2013 and noted that he\u2019d first tweeted this information in December 2020 in a foldables forecast, noting that the second half of 2021 would see \u201cat least 3 models from Samsung, 4 models from Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi and 1 model from Google.\u201d",
    "While that doesn\u2019t add any more information about the Pixel Fold \u2013 like, for starters, if that is what it will be called \u2013 at least it\u2019s more corroboration that Google, which had released a lower-spec flagship phone at the end of 2020 with the Pixel 5, is working on a decidedly higher-tier device in a foldable.",
    "We first heard Google was working on a foldable phone in March 2019, when patents for potential designs were discovered. They described a possible clamshell foldable like the Motorola Razr 2020 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, and another that had three folding panels with three screens.",
    "The rumors thereafter have been few and far between, though a recent report alleged that Google is joining Xiaomi and Oppo in ordering displays from Samsung for its potential foldable device. Reportedly, Google is ordering 7.6-inch displays."
