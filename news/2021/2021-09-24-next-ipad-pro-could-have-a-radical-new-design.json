    "Since its inception the iPad has been a portrait-first device. The orientation of the Apple logo and the position of the cameras and other features show that, but Apple could soon make landscape the focus instead if a new leak is right.",
    "According to iOS developer and Apple analyst @dylandkt on Twitter, future models in the iPad Pro range will have a horizontal Apple logo and a horizontal camera placement, so that landscape is the default orientation.",
    "They claim to be unsure whether the iPad Pro (2022) will have this design, but supposedly this change is in the works, so it might happen sooner or later.",
    "As ever we\u2019d take leaks with a pinch of salt, especially as this would be a big change for Apple. This is also the first we\u2019ve heard of this change \u2013 though we\u2019ve previously heard that the iPad Pro (2022) could have a glass back, so some sizeable changes may be in the works.",
    "However, there\u2019s no mention of other iPads getting this orientation change, so don\u2019t count on seeing this on the iPad, iPad Air, or iPad mini range. That somewhat makes sense, as a landscape orientation is arguably better for some of the productivity tasks that an iPad Pro excels at. Then again, it\u2019s also better for videos, and only shifting one range to landscape could seem strange.",
    "If Apple really is planning to make landscape the focus for future iPad Pro models then the changes might go beyond the camera and logo orientation, as there might also be a different aspect ratio.",
    "While this hasn\u2019t been rumored, a move to 16:9 would make the iPad Pro range a better fit for movies, which is a common landscape use. Recent iPad Pro models have already moved slightly in that direction, abandoning the 4:3 aspect ratio used by most iPads, but they\u2019re still not there yet.",
    "Other changes meanwhile could include reworked software designed to make the most of the orientation, and perhaps a new camera position. It\u2019s not clear from the leak whether the cameras would move or just have a different orientation, but it\u2019s possible that they could be shifted to the middle of one of the long edges for a more central view.",
    "This is all just speculation for now, but with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 having a more landscape-friendly aspect ratio, it\u2019s certainly possible that Apple would fall in line.",
