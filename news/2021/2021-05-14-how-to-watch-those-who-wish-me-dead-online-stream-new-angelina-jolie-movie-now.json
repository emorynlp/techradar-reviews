    "Already released on May 13 Down Under, Those Who Wish Me Dead is only available in cinemas in Australia.",
    "First reactions seem to imply the movie is thoroughly entertaining while not ground-breaking. It's been noted that the subject matter (if not setting) has diverged from director Taylor Sheridan's usual shades of grey, and instead delivers a pretty black-and-white experience.",
    "As a straight up and down thriller, though, it's got a lot going for it, and we wouldn't be surprised if we saw the movie itself prove very popular - despite what our writer thought in his Those Who Wish Me Dead review."
