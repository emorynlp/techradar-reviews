    "The iPhone vs Android debate raged hard in the early days of smartphones. We\u2019ve all grown up a bit since then, so let\u2019s leave the term \u2018Apple sheep\u2019 back in 2009, okay?",
    "However, whether to buy an Android or an iPhone is arguably a more pressing question than it has ever been if you\u2019re looking to change or upgrade your phone. Top Androids like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra are far more expensive than they were a handful of years ago, and the relative price of entry for Apple hardware is much lower than in the old days.",
    "This is no longer simply a case of \u2018iPhones are for rich people\u2019 and Androids are for everyone else.",
    "We\u2019re going to break down everything you need to consider when choosing between an iPhone SE (2020) and OnePlus Nord, or an iPhone 12 Pro Max and Google Pixel 5. And everything in-between.",
    "It\u2019s time for a little backtrack. Yes, iPhones are more accessible than before, and many top Androids are now expensive enough to make your eyes water. However, the cheapest great phones are still Androids.",
    "The best ones to buy get depend on where you live, but our favorite budget manufacturers include Xiaomi, Realme, Oppo and Motorola. Spot the trend? They are all Chinese. Motorola used to be an American brand, but it is now owned by Lenovo, which is - you guessed it - Chinese.",
    "They offer unbeatable value. Xiaomi and Realme are the most aggressively priced, as of early 2021. If these brands aren\u2019t readily available or you\u2019d rather buy from a non-Chinese brand, Nokia and Samsung are your top names. They are from Finland and South Korea respectively.",
    "Apple doesn\u2019t come into the picture until your budget reaches $399 / \u00a3419 / AU$749. That nets you Apple\u2019s tiny iPhone SE (2020). It\u2019s cute, it\u2019s pocketable, and it is as powerful as plenty of four-figure Androids.",
    "However, if you play games or stream video a lot then you're probably better off with the larger (if less powerful) iPhone XR, at $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849. Its battery lasts longer too.",
    "Top Android options at around this price include the OnePlus 8T, Xiaomi Mi 10T and - a little lower end - Google\u2019s Pixel 4a.",
    "Our advice? Don\u2019t be too put off by the fact the iPhone XR is now a little old. It came out in 2018 but Apple phones are supported for a lot longer than Androids and it still compares well with new mid-range processors.",
    "The big \u2018but\u2019 is Apple doesn\u2019t offer any affordable 5G phones yet. Androids offer this faster, more advanced mobile internet for as little as around $299 / \u00a3249 / AU$500.",
    "Don\u2019t buy into the idea that Androids offer you stacks more tech in every area, though. There is a pernicious trend of filling Android phones with cameras, usually four on the back and at least one on the front. Unless you\u2019re paying big bucks it\u2019s highly likely only one of the rear cameras is any good.",
    "The Google Pixel 4a is one of our favorite affordable Android cameras, and it has just one rear camera. Apple\u2019s entry-level iPhones take the same approach. Of the two lower-cost iPhones, the iPhone XR has a larger camera sensor, so in theory it should be better. But in practice the iPhone SE (2020) often wins, by a small margin. Its video stabilization is superior, and its flash is more powerful.",
    "Of course, if you take photos for fun rather than to deep dive into the pixels, the ultra-wide cameras most Androids have are great. We love wide and zoom cams.",
    "Apple does offer that extra hit of photography at a reasonable price too, in the iPhone 11. It costs $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999, and has an ultra-wide camera alongside its main one. This last-gen phone compares well with almost any Android you can get for that amount of money.",
    "There\u2019s one other thing to consider in this Android versus Apple hardware debate. Apple is stingy on storage, and its upgrades are quite expensive. The base iPhone 11 has just 64GB of storage. Xiaomi\u2019s Mi 10T Pro, often available for less cash, has 256GB.",
    "Most people don\u2019t need that much, but we recommend 128GB these days for a comfortably lazy smartphone life. The Xiaomi, and other alternatives like the Pixel 5, also have 5G.",
    "While Apple\u2019s mid-range phones are great in terms of ease of use, power, and camera processing, you do tend to miss out on a couple of the most recent advancements.",
    "Spend big and you can get an iPhone 12-series mobile, or a top Android. These include models like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, Oppo Find X2 Pro, Sony Xperia 1 II and OnePlus 8 Pro.",
    "In previous years we would also have recommended Huawei\u2019s phones. But we can\u2019t now they don\u2019t have Google apps.",
    "At this level you get expensive features like zoom cameras, night modes that make near-pitch-black scenes look clear, and ultra-high-resolution screens. Apple\u2019s iPhone, finally, gains 5G at this price point too, with all iPhone 12 range models packing the tech.",
    "You may notice Apple\u2019s iPhones don\u2019t tend to look quite as slick as some Androids, though. Samsung, Oppo, and OnePlus all try hard to minimize screen borders, and use curved glass on the front and back to further trim down their appearance.",
    "This design style looks, and feels, great. The iPhone 12 Pro Max still has relatively significantly black bars at each side of the display, and a big notch that holds all the tech to make Apple\u2019s face recognition software work.",
    "Even Apple\u2019s most expensive phone doesn\u2019t have the same camera zoom capability as the Oppo Find X2 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra either. And both Samsung\u2019s and OnePlus\u2019s top ultra-wide cameras are better than Apple\u2019s.",
    "However, iPhone photos are tasteful and consistent, and iPhones are our go-to phones for video capture. Sure, Samsung may have an 8K mode but the quality and stabilization of Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 and 11-series 4K video is superb. Top \u2018Pro\u2019 models also have Dolby Vision HDR recording. Which is nice.",
    "A top tip for early 2021 is not to forget the OnePlus 8 Pro if you are shopping towards the lower end of the \u2018high-end\u2019 category. We had a chance to compare it directly to the iPhone 12 Pro Max and several of the most expensive Androids recently. It fared remarkably well, and has the sophisticated curved glass front you don\u2019t often get at $799 / \u00a3699 (around AU$1,030).",
    "Look at the statistics alone and you would believe Android\u2019s Google Play offers a better app library than the iPhone\u2019s App Store. There were around 2.87 million apps on Google Play in late 2020 according to Statista, and 1.96 million on the Apple App Store.",
    "However, we find that the App Store has a greater share of top-quality apps and games. There are a few reasons for this.",
    "It is easier and cheaper for developers to get apps on Google Play. But the total revenue made on the App Store is far greater, giving publishers a greater incentive to create ultra-high-quality iPhone apps.",
    "Optimizing for iPhone is also simpler, in one sense at least. There have been 17 iPhone models since 2016, and hundreds of Android phones, all with different hardware and software. That is a development headache.",
    "This, and iPhone fans\u2019 greater willingness to actually pay for apps, means we end up with more high-end productions like XCOM 2, Alba: A Wildlife Adventure, and Slay the Spire on iPhone. These may come to Android, but games like this tend to come to iOS first.",
    "Apple also offers a Netflix-like service for games called Apple Arcade. It costs $4.99 / \u00a34.99 / AU$7.99 a month and is intended to let you get away from the endless \u2018free to play\u2019 games that eventually ask you to pay to make any meaningful progress. Such apps dominate both app stores.",
    "We see the same effect in apps, in every category. Take music production as an example. iPhones have Apple\u2019s wonderful GarageBand, plus KORG Gadget, Nanostudio 2, 4Pockets Meteor Multitrack Recorder, and others. These apps let you compose songs on your phone.",
    "The selection on Android is far more limited. Steinberg made an Android version of its industry standard Cubasis 3 for Android, so you are not left high and dry. But iPhones have access to more worthwhile, truly deep creative and productivity apps.",
    "Not fussed about composing a symphony on your phone or playing an epic 20-hour adventure? We think you\u2019ll be happy with either platform.",
    "Google\u2019s looser approach to apps comes with benefits too. You won\u2019t find game console emulator apps on the App Store. Apple doesn\u2019t allow them. Emulators mimic the hardware of old consoles to play retro games, and there are many on Google Play.",
    "How any new Android phone looks and feels is largely determined by the custom interface it uses. Almost every Android has one, because it\u2019s the way manufacturers make sure their phones don\u2019t seem exactly like those of their competitors.",
    "Some of these interfaces add significant new features too, but all are based on a core version of Android. In 2021 most new phones are likely to use Android 11.",
    "This 2020 update to the system isn\u2019t going to change your life. But it did tweak some parts under the surface. For example, in some phones you\u2019ll see a panel of smart home controls when you long-press the power button.",
    "Apple\u2019s recent changes are more dramatic. iOS 14 brought widgets to iPhones. These have been in Androids since day one, in 2008. It also adds an App Library section at the end of your home screens, which arranges all your apps into folders. Again, we might compare this to the dedicated app page that has always been present in the majority of Android phones.",
    "However, if you use a MacBook you will likely appreciate Apple\u2019s AirDrop feature, a fast and easy way to share files between your phone and laptop.",
    "Comparing the software experience of Android and iOS is a little like comparing Windows 10 and Mac OS. Android, like Windows, used to be criticized as buggy, flaky, and unreliable. That is not the case anymore.",
    "New versions of iOS are just as likely to have annoying bugs as fresh Android updates. Both are great, neither is perfect. And if you switch from one to the other it will probably take you a week or so to bed in.",
    "Not very helpful? Privacy is one of the best reasons to choose an iPhone. Apple operates rather differently to Google here. For example, data used by voice assistant Siri is anonymized. And Apple plans to make a huge change to how privacy operates in iOS later this year, making it clear to us end users when an app like Facebook is collecting and sharing data about us.",
    "It\u2019s called App Tracking Transparency, and will shine a light on exactly how far, and how quickly, your information is disseminated between apps and services.",
    "Google has improved how it deals with app permissions in the last few years. You\u2019re now asked for permission as and when an app requests, for example, your location, rather than just making you allow access at the point of install.",
    "However, there\u2019s a fairly fundamental difference here. Google makes stacks of cash by collating our user data and using it to power its advertising platform. Apple doesn\u2019t, to the same extent. It does run an ad network, used in the App Store and other Apple services. But it ain\u2019t Google.",
    "This issue is moot, though, if you plan on buying an iPhone and using a bunch of Google services like Gmail and Maps anyway. The privacy policies of your phone can\u2019t fix the privacy problems of the apps you use on your phone, and elsewhere.",
    "Apple phones are also far better for software updates. Let\u2019s take the last iOS release, iOS 14, as an example.",
    "The oldest devices supported are the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. These phones were released in 2015, the year of the Samsung Galaxy S6.",
    "That Samsung phone is one of the best-supported Androids of the year, but it dropped off Samsung\u2019s official support list in 2018.",
    "Two years of software updates and three years of security updates is the best-case scenario for most Androids (though Samsung has now started offering three years of software updates for some phones).",
    "iPhones tend to get five major updates, or five years\u2019 worth from their original launch, plus additional security patches afterwards. Even the iPhone 5S from 2013 received a security update just a week before this piece was written in January 2021.",
    "Tech companies have risen to greatness and crumbled to nothing in the time the iPhone 5S has received support.",
    "Security updates are important because they contain provisions to counteract vulnerabilities cybercriminals and other nasty types can try to exploit. Ever seen the stories about scammers using Bluetooth to hack into your phone to covertly call premium-rate numbers? Updates fix problems like this.",
    "The support of Androids may be even shorter from some lesser manufactures. We have reviewed phones from some little-known Chinese names that never seemed to receive a single update from the day we first opened the box.",
    "There\u2019s another issue. Google releases one major version of Android a year. On day one, Google\u2019s Pixel phones get it. Other manufacturers then usually take several months making the new code work with their own software, before releasing it.",
    "All iPhones (the supported ones anyway) get updates as Apple releases them, as the company makes both the software and hardware. Google has tried to mitigate this over the years, splitting off its apps from the Android part so they can be updated discretely, and coming up with Project Treble. This again splits up system software to minimize the work the manufacturer needs to do.",
    "Has it helped? Not much. Android updates can take an age to arrive.",
    "This update issue and the ultra-long support cycle are two reasons iPhones tend to seem \u2018current\u2019 a lot longer than Androids. And it also feeds into their resale value.",
    "Here\u2019s how much you could trade-in the \u2018good\u2019 condition flagship phones of 2018 in at MusicMagpie, one of the UK\u2019s most popular tech resale companies:",
    "The iPhone is worth 25% of its original cost, the Samsung 17%, the LG 9.3%, the Sony 11%, and the Huawei just 5%. You should be able to get more than these figures if you sell privately, but this is a reasonably indication of their relative worth.",
    "And while these prices only apply to the UK, you can expect a similar situation in most countries.",
    "However, while Apple is the clear winner, Samsung phones also do rather well here. And the other brands\u2019 value is not helped by their drop in prominence, particularly Huawei, which makes fantastic phones but has been all but destroyed in the west after the US labeled the company a security risk.",
    "The lazy conclusion of the old Android versus Apple debate largely no longer applies. You can\u2019t claim iPhones are overpriced and Androids are great value when the corresponding Samsung models sell at a similar price, or more in some cases. Here are some of the key reasons to buy into each platform."
