    "The Apple Watch 6 is an expensive wearable, and while the Apple Watch SE is a more affordable option, it\u2019s still not cheap. But Apple has now started selling refurbished versions of both models at a significant discount.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that at the time of writing only the US Apple Store site has both models available refurbished, but you can get a refurbished Apple Watch SE in Australia. Currently neither are listed in the UK, but it will probably only be a matter of time until they\u2019re available refurbished there too.",
    "In any case, there are a range of different refurbished options available, but in the US you can currently get a refurbished Apple Watch SE from $259, which is $50 less than a new one. For pricier models, savings go up to $100.",
    "On the Australian Apple Store site, the cheapest option currently comes in at AU$399, which is an AU$80 saving over the same model full price.",
    "In both countries that cheapest option is a 44mm model though. A 40mm one with the same strap would be even cheaper, but isn\u2019t currently available refurbished. That\u2019s one problem with buying refurbished \u2013 the available stock will regularly change, so you might not always find what you want.",
    "As for the Apple Watch 6, the US Apple Store site lists that from $339, which is $60 less than the same model would be new, and savings for pricier models again go up to $100.",
    "While neither the Apple Watch 6 or SE are available refurbished in the UK yet, you can probably expect a similar sort of discount there if and when they arrive. A refurbished Apple Watch 5, for example, can be grabbed for upwards of \u00a360 less than it costs new.",
    "If you do buy a refurbished Apple Watch from Apple, it will have been thoroughly tested and cleaned, will come with a 1-year warranty, and will be repackaged in a new box with all the accessories and cables you need. There\u2019s also free delivery and returns.",
