    "After two consecutive shortened campaigns, the NHL returns to its traditional format, albeit with a midseason break for the Winter Olympics. Though the addition of expansion franchise the Seattle Kraken promises to make this the biggest season ever, with 32 teams each playing 82 regular season games!",
    "The Buffalo Sabres made defenceman Owen Power the first overall pick in the draft, the Canadian teenager adding his considerable weight behind the franchise's efforts to slake the league's longest ongoing post-season drought.",
    "The Pittsburgh Penguins, meanwhile, have their work cut out extending their 15-season playoff streak, with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin missing the start of the season, and likely more than just a few games.",
    "And, of course, Alex Ovechkin's steady march towards Wayne Gretzky's 894-goal record is the subplot we're all going to be following week by week.",
    "Read on for details on how to get a NHL live stream and watch hockey online for every game of the new 2021/22 season, no matter where you are in the world right now.",

    "A VPN will allow you to change your IP address so that you appear to be in a completely different location where the game you want to watched isn't blacked out, and let you access the content and services you already pay for back home no matter where you are.",
    "VPNs are ridiculously easy to set up and use and aren't just for watching sports from abroad - they're also a great first line of defence for your online activity and many people use them to get around other geo-blocked websites or to access foreign Netflix content.",
    "We\u2019ve tested hundreds of VPNs and can recommend ExpressVPN as the very best VPN currently available."
