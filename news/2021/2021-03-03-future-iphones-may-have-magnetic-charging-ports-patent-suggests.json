    "Apple is developing a connectivity port based on its existing MagSafe charger, a new patent suggests.",
    "A recent filing submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office shows a three-pinned \u200cMagSafe\u200c charger, similar to those used to charge older MacBooks, connecting to what appears to be an iPhone.",
    "The patent outlines several pin designs \u2013 one rounded, one with a flat surface \u2013 which indicate the Cupertino tech giant is looking towards a future without Lightning cables, the 8-pin connector it first introduced way back in 2012.",
    "There's a fair few reasons Apple might be turning its attention to magnet-based charging ports. As well as the improved charging speeds of MagSafe technology \u2013 Apple\u2019s existing magnet-based chargers for the iPhone 12 offer up to 15W of wireless charging power \u2013 a MagSafe connectivity port would also allow for easy detachment should the charger be pulled or tripped over.",
    "The introduction of a MagSafe port would also mark a further step towards a port-free future for Apple\u2019s iPhones.",
    "In spite of the industry-wide move to embrace USB-C connectivity, Apple is reluctant to swim with the tide. Recent comments made by reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (thanks, MacRumors) suggest the company is confident that its own Lightning and MagSafe connectors are already better (both in terms of exclusivity and water-tightness) than USB-C.",
    "It\u2019s clear that Apple would rather abandon Lightning for its own portless design with MagSafe rather than go backwards, as it seems to see it, by adopting USB-C.",
    "Of course, these magnet-based connectors highlighted in this latest patent wouldn\u2019t make the upcoming iPhones entirely portless \u2013 there\u2019d still be a shallow impression at the foot of the device \u2013 but they\u2019d nonetheless mark a drastic departure from the charging methods Apple has used in its smartphones for the best part of a decade.",
