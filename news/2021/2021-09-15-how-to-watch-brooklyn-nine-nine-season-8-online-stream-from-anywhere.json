    "Grab a box of tissues and a yoghurt to toast Terry as season 8 marks the last instalment of our favorite cop comedy. From copious sex tape title jokes to the last of the Jimmy Jabs, here's how to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8 online from anywhere.",
    "Not many shows have had fans go to battle for them, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has certainly been through the wars as its original network, Fox, dropped it, only for NBC to pick it up the next day following outcry. However, it's time to bid farewell to the 99th Precinct as the cast hand over their metaphorical badge and gun in the sitcom's eighth and final season. And it looks as though all our questions will be answered, wrapping on our beloved Jake, Amy, Rosa, Holt, and the rest.",
    "How will Jake and Amy handle having a baby? Will Holt get promoted to commissioner?",
    "Fans can be reassured of a satisfying ending, though, with the directors, Michael Schur and Dan Goor, experts in this field. Between the two of them they've helped write or direct Parks and Recreations, The Good Place, episodes of The Office, SNL and a host of other TV classics.",
