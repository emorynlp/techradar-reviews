    "The Panasonic Lumix S1 will soon be getting a serious boost to its video shooting powers thanks to a new firmware update \u2013 but many of the features will only be available as a paid upgrade.",
    "April 6 is set to be a big day for the full-frame mirrorless camera, as it\u2019ll get a sizable firmware 2.0 upgrade that includes new video recording options, including that headline 6K mode, and enhanced compatibility with the Atomos Ninja V external recorder.",
    "Videographers can expect the Panasonic Lumix S1 to get 5.9K/C4K and 4K60/50p 4:2:0 10-bit internal video recording as part of the upgrade, as well as 5.9K, 4K and Anamorphic (4:3) 3.5K 12-bit raw video data recording over HDMI \u2013 if you have an Atomos Ninja V attached to the Panasonic Lumix S1.",
    "The catch? These new video options don\u2019t come for free \u2013 Panasonic Lumix S1 owners will have to pay for the DMW-SFU2 software upgrade key to make use of the new 6K video features. The maximum recording time for the 6K mode is also only 15 minutes.",
    "The software key can be bought for $199 / \u00a3159 / AU$250, but if you have it already, then you\u2019ll be able to shoot in 6K when the update arrives on April 6.",
    "If you\u2019re not up for paying for the software key, though, the firmware update also introduces new features for the Panasonic Lumix S1 that won\u2019t come at a cost.",
    "These include a new anamorphic mode and timecode functions, and a selection of quality-of-life features like being able to manually toggle Dual Native ISO, the extension of the power save mode to the DMW-AC10 AC adapter, and a new orientation lock.",
    "If you own a Panasonic BGH1 or a Panasonic S1H, you\u2019ll be happy to know that those cameras are also benefiting from firmware upgrades \u2013 albeit ones that aren\u2019t quite as extensive as the S1\u2019s.",
    "From March 31, the S1H will support two raw video formats, adding the ability to output 5.9K videos in Blackmagic raw to its existing Apple ProRes raw support. As for the Panasonic Lumix BGH1, it\u2019ll be getting support for IP streaming via PCs and Apple ProRes raw video output over HDMI with Atomos peripherals, when its update lands on March 24.",
    "If you own one of these powerful Panasonic Lumix cameras, it\u2019s well worth putting those dates in your diary then \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to download the firmware updates from Panasonic\u2019s official support page when they land in the next month."
