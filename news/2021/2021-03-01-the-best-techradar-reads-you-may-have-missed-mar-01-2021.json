  "summary": "The very best of TechRadar from the week that was",
  "article": [
    "As weeks go in 2021, the last one was refreshingly uneventful. A distinct lack of political scandals, major public holidays and noisy sporting events meant the internet was a relatively quiet place as we bid farewell to February and ushered in March (already?) \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say the busy world of tech enjoyed a week off.",
    "In fact, there's been a host of tech-related news and announcements over the last few days, from the exciting (the first-ever 165-inch foldable TV) to the downright confusing (Apple is developing\u2026 fabric?).",
    "Here, we\u2019ve picked out the best TechRadar content of the week, from our round-up of the most exciting indie games coming to PC to our assessment of the title announcement for the upcoming Spider-Man movie. We\u2019ve even gone ahead and resurrected an iPhone 6s and pitted it against a shiny new iPhone 12 \u2013 you know, just to see if Apple is telling the truth about how far its hardware has come.",
    "There\u2019s also a host of review and opinion content for you to sink your teeth into, but if you\u2019re after something a little easier on the eyes (but maybe not the ears), we\u2019ve parked the latest episode of the TechRadar Noise Cancelling Podcast at the end of this article for your convenient listening pleasure.",
    "Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4 is ditching Tizen and switching to Wear OS \u2013 but we can\u2019t work out why.",
    "Samsung\u2019s software is easier to use, well optimized for smartwatches and has already done a much better job of bringing improvements and enhancements to its own platform, so we\u2019ve been left scratching our heads as to why the tech giant is switching to what seems a lesser OS.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "After some good-natured (albeit infuriating) trolling from its cast, the upcoming Spider-Man movie finally received an official title \u2013 but what could No Way Home actually mean?",
    "Here, we break down four likely explanations, from the possible comic book origins of the title to some potential multiverse-related madness.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "Last week, Austrian tech brand C-Seed announced the world\u2019s first-ever 165-inch foldable MicroLED TV, and it\u2019s not (we repeat: not) cheap.",
    "At almost half a million dollars (or around \u00a3300,000 / AU$520,000, if you\u2019re asking), the M1 4K is a beast of epic proportions \u2013 and we think it could give Samsung\u2019s equally-massive MicroLED offering, The Wall, a run for its money.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "When Amazon announced that it\u2019s newest smart display, the Echo Show 10, could follow you around the room using a rotating screen, our Homes Editor was decidedly sceptical.",
    "But after living with the device for just over a week, she may have been too quick to dismiss the value of the new feature...",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "The recent Steam Game Festival gave us an exciting taste of what's to come for indie-playing PC gamers over the next year, showcasing everything from fantasy RPGs to third-person action shooters.",
    "Here, we round up the best of the bunch \u2013 including a game called You Suck at Parking. Ouch.",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "iPhones have come a long way since Apple\u2019s first smartphone launched in 2007. When it comes to photography, web browsing and video calling, the company\u2019s older models can\u2019t lay a glove on its shiny new products.",
    "But what about when it comes to gaming? We chatted with a handful of mobile game developers about how their upcoming high-profile titles will play on an iPhone 12 \u2013 and what you might miss out on if you don\u2019t upgrade.",

    "Sonos is a huge player in the world of home audio, with its range of super-connected wireless speakers and soundbars making it a trusted brand for audiophiles and casual music listeners alike.",
    "Now it looks like the audio company is about to enter a new market, after patents and confirmation of a mystery product launch on March 9 have stoked rumors of the first Sonos headphones. Could this spell competition for the Apple AirPods Max?",
    "Read more\u2026",
    "For a company famed for its output of world-leading smartphones and computing devices, it came as quite the surprise to learn that Apple is turning its attention to fashion.",
    "Alright, it\u2019s not really getting into fashion, per se, but recent patents do suggest it\u2019s developing a form of 'smart fabric' for sportswear. Documents indicate the company is working on tech that could be integrated into hats, belts, wrist bands, headbands, socks, gloves, shirts and pants. Watch out, Nike.",
