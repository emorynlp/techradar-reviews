    "A \"next-gen\" version of The Witcher 3 for PS5 and Xbox Series X will release in the second half of 2021, developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed.",
    "In a roadmap update on Twitter, the developer revealed that AR adventure The Witcher Monster Slayer and The Witcher 3 \"next-gen update\" will both arrive in 2021, while the team also plans to further develop card game Gwent this year.",
    "In a follow-up tweet, CD Projekt Red Lead PR Manager Radek Grabowski stated that \"the next-generation update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming in the second half of 2021\".",
    "We already knew that CD Projekt Red was working on an upgraded version of The Witcher 3 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC, with the developer revealing the news in September 2020.",
