    "It\u2019s been just over a year since Westworld\u2019s third season left us scratching our heads all over again, and we\u2019ve now had our first inkling that production on season 4 is officially underway.",
    "Via an Instagram post, series mainstay Jeffrey Wright (aka Bernard) uploaded a photo of his character\u2019s name attached to what we presume is a set chair, suggesting filming on new episodes has now begun.",
    "He accompanied the post with the caption, \u201cGood morning\u2026 old friend\u201d \u2013 a less-than-cryptic reference to Bernard\u2019s relationship with Anthony Hopkins\u2019 character, Dr. Robert Ford.",
    "Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy\u2019s cerebral sci-fi series premiered back in 2016, and has so far stuck to a bi-annual release schedule. Season 2 arrived in 2018, while the show\u2019s third season landed in April last year.",
    "It follows, then, that production on Westworld season 4 is underway in anticipation of a 2022 release \u2013 provided Covid-19 restrictions don\u2019t hinder filming, that is.",
    "Unfortunately, Wright\u2019s tease offers little more than confirmation that season 4 is still going ahead. The last time we saw Bernard, he was returning from \u2018The Valley Beyond\u2019 \u2013 the virtual world Ford created for Hosts to live freely away from humans \u2013 though we were left unsure as to how long he\u2019d spent there.",
    "Of course, that\u2019s only one thread in a myriad of loose and complex ends to be tied up by Westworld\u2019s return. Season 3\u2019s finale saw the redemption \u2013 but ultimate demise \u2013 of Evan Rachel Wood\u2019s Dolores, while Aaron Paul\u2019s Caleb Nichols destroyed Rehoboam (a malicious quantum computer system \u00e0 la Skynet) to allow humanity to operate on its own terms.",
    "William (aka The Man in Black) also met his end (we think?) after returning to Delos' headquarters and finding himself face-to-face with a replica host, while the fate of Tessa Thompson\u2019s Charlotte is anyone\u2019s guess.",
    "Season 3\u2019s conclusion was all about the end of one world and the beginning of another, basically, so there\u2019s every chance season 4 will take the series to entirely new places. We've made a few predictions of our own here.",
    "Although Westworld began life with a bang, critical reception has steadily \u2013 though perhaps unfairly \u2013 waned since the premiere of the show\u2019s second season.",
    "Overnight viewing figures have decreased with each new outing, and Westworld\u2019s convoluted (and at times headache-inducing) plot has borne the brunt of criticism. Though it's possible the rise of streaming has offset that, with people able to stream the show on HBO Max.",
    "There\u2019s no question that the series remains a benchmark for TV production value and a showcase of some triple-A acting talent, but season 4 faces the challenge of figuring out what a dystopian future looks like after a massive status quo change \u2013 that's far from where Westworld started five years ago.",
    "As for what we know about the Hosts\u2019 next adventure, details are few and far between. We do know Wood won\u2019t be returning as Dolores, and that Aurora Perrineau (Prodigal Son) has been added to the cast in a major role.",
    "Given the impermanent nature of the show\u2019s deaths, though, there\u2019s no telling who will and won\u2019t make an appearance in Westworld\u2019s upcoming season.",
