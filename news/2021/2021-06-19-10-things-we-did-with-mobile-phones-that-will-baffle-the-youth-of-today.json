    "It\u2019s the year 2000. The world is breathing a sigh of collective relief after the catastrophic plane-plummeting effects of the Y2K bug fail to materialize. The PlayStation 2 launches, captivating gamers around the world. And I walk into school with swag levels I\u2019ll never come close to achieving again, thanks to the mobile phone I\u2019ve got in my pocket.",
    "It\u2019s a Nokia 8210, aka the mind-bogglingly miniature Charlie\u2019s Angel phone. While it was originally a vivid red color, I\u2019ve replaced the front and back covers with a textured basketball cover that looked and felt like the real deal. If anyone cares to look at the screen, they\u2019ll notice that the \u201cOrange\u201d network logo has been replaced by an Xtreme \u201cNo Fear\u201d logo instead.",
    "On the very rare occasion my phone rang, a crappy, monophonic rendition of Jumpin\u2019 Jumpin\u2019 by Destiny\u2019s Child would emit from the speakers. I dread to think how much money I spent on this cavalcade of tackiness.",
    "If you\u2019re reading this and connecting with me on a spiritual level, then this article will be a fuzzy, warm, and safe space, filled with the golden rays of comforting nostalgia. If, however, you\u2019re from a more recent generation, and have stumbled upon this page accidentally in between shooting a new TikTok vid or looking for a way to earn more V-Bucks, then the following section will fill you with a mixture of confusion, disbelief, and pity for the generations that came before you.",
    "Either way, we hope you enjoy a look back at the way things were in the Before Times. No touchscreens, no color, and proprietary accessories as far as the eye can see. Welcome to the pre-smartphone world.",
    "Long before the arrival of the onscreen full QWERTY keyboard, we had to make do with forging messages using the basic number keys. Each key had three letters, with the four last members of the alphabet living on the \u20189\u2019 key.",
    "If you wanted to write the letter \u2018B\u2019 for example, you\u2019d have to tap the number 2 (the abc key) twice, to cycle through to \u2018B\u2019. While it sounds like a tedious, convoluted mess, most people would still swear by the speed and accuracy of it, thanks to the magical powers of the predictive dictionary, which lets you cycle through common words based on what you\u2019ve typed so far.",
    "If you were particularly good you could even send text messages to people without even looking at your phone, for extra bragging rights. 8-)",
    "With modern smartphones mostly resembling boring rectangular slabs, the only way to really stand out from the crowd is to cover up your phone with a case.",
    "In the old days though, phones themselves had removable shells, letting you instantly and dramatically change the look without faffing around with any sticky skins or bulky cases. The cheesy, erotic 90s-fuelled ad above proves the point far better than our words ever could.",
    "Another benefit to having removable covers is the fact that you could easily swap out your battery for an instant 100% charge. Combined with the fact that handsets could last a week with heavy use without breaking a sweat, you could theoretically go travelling for a month with a few spare batteries and no charger in sight.",
    "Try doing that at a weekend festival today, and you\u2019ll be in the firm grasp of battery anxiety\u2019s ruthless hands long before you\u2019ve run out of cider.",
    "It\u2019s easy to look back on things with rose tinted glasses, but some things in the pre-smartphone world were rather annoying. Take chargers for example. The idea that you could share the same charging cable between different manufacturers\u2019 handsets wasn\u2019t even a distant pipedream \u2014 it seemed downright impossible.",
    "Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericcsson and others all had proprietary charging cables for their handsets, so if you were round a friend\u2019s house and needed to juice up, you\u2019d be out of luck unless they had the same phone.",
    "As phones developed the power to let you listen to music, they had their own specific bundled headphones too that would use all manner of strange connections rather than the normal 3.5mm audio jack we know (and miss) today. Today\u2019s world of USB-C and Lightning ports is a dream in comparison.",
    "Are you too young to remember ASCII emoticons, the precursor to the modern emoji? Without fancy graphics available, humans conveyed their emotions via text using 100% organic characters and symbols.",
    "From the classic smiley and winky faces :-) ;-) to disappointed expressions -_- and even cute little animals <(^_^)>, the world of emoticons fuelled creativity, encouraging people to come up with more and more complex ways to express themselves.",
    "Paying for ringtones seems like an utterly alien concept today, but back then we\u2019d happily part with cash for horribly rendered versions of monophonic songs.",
    "When polyphonic ringtones came out (adding multiple channels of sound), our collective minds were blown. On certain models, you could even create your own ringtones with cryptic button presses, as the above video of a 2020 meme song demonstrates.",
    "Long before the idea of custom wallpapers ever came to fruition, you could pay to have your network logo replaced with a different image. Replacing the boring \u201cOrange\u201d text with the Nike swoosh was viewed as the pinnacle of cool, and there\u2019s nothing you can say today that will change our minds.",
    "Back when phones weren\u2019t too far off the size and weight of house bricks (think SIM cards the size of credit cards), people were forced to carry them around in hideously ugly belt holsters, like the world\u2019s un-coolest six shooter.",
    "Thankfully when things began to slim down in the Nokia 3210 era, the only people still rocking ugly holsters were business folk, who wanted a fast-draw for all the important Business Calls that they were making and taking.",
    "Originally debuting on the Nokia 6110, this simple pixellated time waster sucked people in with the most addictive gameplay in videogame history.",
    "Controlling a snake so that it can gobble up a tasty square with basic up, down, left and right controls, countless hours were spent staring at screens and fending off thumb cramps.",
    "You can keep your fancy modern Call of Zombies: #2Flossing4Furious 3D games, thank you very much. We prefer the mind numbing simplicity that this legendary title brings to the table.",
    "If you drop a phone today, you\u2019ve already worked out the staggering repair costs before the glass has even smashed on the tarmac. The phones of yesteryear, however, laugh in the face of concrete.",
    "Those indestructible 3310 memes you\u2019ve seen floating around aren\u2019t works of fiction \u2014 older handsets with their all-plastic build and tiny screens were practically indestructible, as long as they were kept from falling into water. Even then, you could try the bag of rice trick as a last resort, which would often bring your beloved phone back from the brink of death."
