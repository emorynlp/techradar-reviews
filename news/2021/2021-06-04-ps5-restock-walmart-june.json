    "Update: There's no Walmart PS5 restock today, news confirmed by our PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider, who will send you alerts when stores in the US have PS5 in stock \u2013 if you follow his Twitter account and turn on notifications. Walmart had a rare skip (they often sell PS5 every other Thursday), but Matt did send out a PS5 restock Twitter alert for Best Buy; it had PS5 Disc stock (not PS5 Digital) this morning, June 3, further adding to the number of consoles Matt has helped people find through reporting restock news \u2013 over 36,400 people have been able to find the Sony console from stores like Best Buy, Walmart, Sony Direct and GameStop. We'll update this news story as soon as Walmart and other American stores sell the PS5.",
    "Click this example of a Walmart PS5 restock Twitter alert by Matt Swider. You can follow his Twitter account and turn on notifications, as he tracks 'PS5 drops' and updates you on the news of when and where it'll be in stock.",
    "We were right to say be on the lookout for a PS5 restock at Best Buy today, and we were also the first to report that Walmart wouldn't have PS5 in stock this afternoon. Miss either restock update? Then follow the account of PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider. The short week has produced very little PS5 restock news in the US, so every update counts.",
    "Technically, there was a very small Walmart PS5 Digital restock at about 3:10am this morning, June 3. However, almost no one was able to get it (less than 10 people, according to our estimates). This means that this was a non-scheduled drop; either a mistake by Walmart, or the US retailer wanted to burn off inventory when no one was looking. A majority of people saw the add-to-cart button go live, but either weren't able to add the PS5 to their carts or, in our case when we tested it, couldn't check out.",
    "While Walmart didn't have a PS5 restock at the usual 3pm EDT time today, it's often had inventory launch every other Thursday in 2021, so this was a rare skip \u2013 we're now two weeks without a PS5 drop (and next week will make it a three-week gap). The good news is that this means Walmart is building up inventory nationwide.",
    "The Walmart PS5 restock date wasn't today, June 3. We did see a few PS5 Digital consoles back in stock overnight at 3:10am (don't worry if you missed it \u2013 barely anyone got them).",
    "Walmart usually has the most consoles on hand in the US and we haven't seen Walmart deviate from console restocks on Thursdays in 2021, though it doesn't have the PS5 every Thursday. It skipped today, for example.",
    "The good news is that Matt Swider often gets an advance notice about the Walmart PS5 restock news, often with a date and time if it's a massive PS5 drop and actually got official word today that no PS5 restock was planned for this afternoon.",
    "Best Buy PS5 restock was today, June 3, as we had suggested it could be earlier this morning. The electronics retailer was also selling RTX 3080 Ti GPU stock in person at stores starting today, but this Best Buy PS5 restock today was online-only and happened in two short waves starting at 9:37am EDT. Many followers of PS5 restock Twitter tracker got it, according to our reporting.",
    "Truthfully, it's gotten harder to nail down when Best Buy will restock PS5 simply because it went from consistently launching orders at midday on Fridays (for seven weeks in a row), to opening up orders on Thursdays afternoons (for two weeks in a row), to having a restock on a Monday morning (we think that was meant for the latter half of the prior week, but Best Buy didn't have shipments in yet). Now we're back to Thursdays \u2013 but today was a Thursday afternoon.",
    "All the more reason to pay attention to our PS5 restock Twitter tracker for Best Buy alerts like this one:",
    "The GameStop PS5 restock has happened three Wednesdays in a row \u2013 until this week. It's a short week and the video game retailer is likely catching up on inventory (we were surprised it went 3-for-3 on Wednesdays without fail before). We're still tracking PS5 restock events here for the remainder of this week, and we know it's almost always at 2pm EDT (online-only not in stores). The good news is that, like Walmart, GameStop usually sends us the news in advance.",
    "GameStop has bundles, and recently, the US retailer has stuck to packing in MLB The Show and Returnal. While many Matt Swider followers complain about being forced to buy games, accessories (like an extra controller) and a gift card, making the PS5 price on average $729, this tactic does deter resellers who scoop up the PS5 console at other stores and resell it for much higher prices.",
    "When is the next Target PS5 restock date? We usually have a good idea, and in 2021, it's always on a Wednesday or Thursday at around 7:40am EDT, according to past restocks. But while our sources at Target stores throughout the United States often tell us how much inventory they have on hand, it's too early to know the approximate date, even if we're confident of the Target restock time by now.",
    "The next Thursday on the calendar is today, June 3, but since the last Target PS5 restock was on Thursday, May 27 at about 7:40am EDT and all of our Twitter replies (mostly from people who missed out) note inventory seemed light \u2013 it went fast. In other words, it may be some time before Target is able to have a PS5 restock. We'll let you know soon, but we'd guess Wednesday, June 9 or Thursday, June 10.",
    "The Sony Direct PS5 restock was two weeks ago today, and we've known that it was going to be the last one for some time simply because our Twitter replies indicated that many of the lucky PS5 buyers received 'delayed shipment' notices. This usually means that Sony Direct will halt PS5 sales for the foreseeable future. And here were are two weeks later without another PS5 drop from Sony Direct.",
    "It's nearly time for Sony's official store for the PlayStation brand to sell PS5 consoles again, judging from previous instances in which a shipment delay put the retailer on hiatus. The good news about Sony Direct PS5 restocks are they're usually fairer than other stores thanks to a virtual queue that randomizes who gets to buy the PS5.",
    "There's no indication of a Sony Direct PS5 restock this week (hence why it's at the bottom of the list), but look out for this alert when it's time:",
    "The next Amazon PS5 restock is the most controversial of them all simply because it nearly had two restocks in as many days. We saw thousands of people get a PS5 from our restock alert on Wednesday, May 26, yet no one was able to get it the next day when there was a supposed second PS5 restock (the add-to-cart button was turned on for about 30 minutes).",
    "That means one of two things: Amazon does have PS5 inventory and it'll probably have another restock soon after Memorial Day, or it was a wider Amazon.com glitch and the add-to-cart button was never meant to go live (as in they didn't actually have consoles to begin with). We're tracking Amazon just in case it's the former. But we also know Amazon has waited between 15 and 52 days between restocks, so there's no telling when PS5 will be back in stock at Amazon."
