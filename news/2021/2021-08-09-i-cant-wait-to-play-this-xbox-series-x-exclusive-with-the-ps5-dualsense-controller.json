    "The Medium was one of the few genuine Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S exclusives available for Microsoft\u2019s console when it launched back in January this year (it isn\u2019t available on Xbox One), but now the psychological horror game is coming to PS5 with full support for the DualSense controller.",
    "Developer Bloober Team believes that the DualSense\u2019s unique features should make The Medium more immersive on PS5, as the controller will act as \u201can extension of your senses\u201d. And I must admit, I\u2019m tempted to play the game again simply because of Sony\u2019s next-gen controller.",
    "In the video below, Bloober Team highlights exactly how the DualSense controller will enhance the game, such as how haptic feedback provides the weird sensation of a swarm of moths hitting the barrier of your spirit shield, how the lightbar flickers when an enemy is nearby, and how you can use the DualSense\u2019s touchpad or motion controller for a more intuitive experience when investigating clues.",
    "The PS5\u2019s clever DualSense controller continues to add that extra bit of magic to PlayStation 5 games that I can\u2019t help but miss when playing Xbox Series X games \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 the DualSense continues to be supported by developers, despite my initial pessimism that it would be largely ignored. Thankfully, its widespread support has also helped benefit one of the Xbox Series X controller\u2019s criminally underutilized features as a result.",
    "It may seem gimmicky to some, but I really enjoy the little additions and quirks the DualSense adds to an experience. It really shines in games like Returnal and the fantastic pack-in title, Astro\u2019s Playroom, wouldn\u2019t be the same without it. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that it\u2019s a selling point when it comes to third-party titles, though not every game takes full advantage of what Sony\u2019s pad can do.",
    "The DualSense controller hasn\u2019t just impressed players, though. Microsoft\u2019s head of Xbox Phil Spencer has also acknowledged that he\u2019s a fan of Sony\u2019s DualSense, and hinted that DualSense-like features could come to Xbox controllers in the future. A survey from Microsoft also suggested the company was polling players to gauge interest in adding DualSense features to its controller.",
    "The Medium is set to release on PS5 on September 3, 2021. The game is also available on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC, and Xbox Game Pass subscribers can download the game for free as part of their subscription."
