    "Firefox is set to join the growing number of web browsers that are adding a \u201cdo not sell my personal data\u201d signal referred to as global privacy control (GPC).",
    "GPC is implemented as a browser setting that sends a signal to notify websites of the visitor\u2019s privacy preferences, including whether they want their personal information to be sold or shared.",
    "\u201cAt this moment, GPC is a prerelease feature available for experimental use in Firefox Nightly. Once turned on, it sends a signal to the websites users visit telling them that the user doesn\u2019t want to be tracked and doesn\u2019t want their data to be sold,\u201d explained Mozilla.",
    "GPC is getting traction both in California and in Colorado, according to Mozilla, with California insisting that companies are obligated to honor the signal under the state\u2019s consumer privacy law.",
    "GPC is a collaborative effort by privacy-focused organizations and advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Consumer Reports.",
    "It is often touted as a successor to the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal, which couldn\u2019t get enough momentum behind it to force companies to honour it. GPC, however, has already found takers with US states such as California mandating adherence.",
    "Mozilla\u2019s CTO Eric Rescorla told the Washington Post that Firefox didn\u2019t adopt the signal right away, to see what sort of impact it would have, to avoid making privacy promises that don\u2019t hold water.",
    "GPC is already available in several other web browsers such as Brave, and privacy-centric browser add-ons including Disconnect and DuckDuckGo. However, Google Chrome, which has the largest market share, is conspicuous by its absence from the list of GPC wielding browsers.",
    "If you want to keep your online activities to yourself, browse the internet through a proxy service or better still via a VPN service."
