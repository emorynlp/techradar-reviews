    "What had been an early Black Friday deal lowering the price on the brand-new Amazon Halo View has persisted into Cyber Monday. But there's also several deals on Halo fitness trackers and Echo Frame smartglasses, too.",
    "Fitness buffs out there will appreciate the 38% saving on Amazon's brand new Halo view, which isn't even out yet and releases on December 8. It's essentially a version of the Amazon Halo fitness tracker with a display for those who want to see their workout progress in real-time, but if you don't mind checking on your phone, you can save even more with 45% off the Amazon Halo Band - which also includes 6 months of Halo membership.",
    "Alternatively, you could step into the world of smart glasses and take Alexa with you on the go thanks to the $105 saving on the Echo Frames (2nd Gen) - which come with polarized sunglass lenses to boot.",
    "(Not in the US? Scroll down for deals in your region).",
    "Amazon's Halo devices are typically cheaper than your usual smart trackers and with these sales on top, we'd be surprised if even the best Fitbit Cyber Monday deals offer something cheaper than what's here.",
    "The flip side is that you have to pay for Amazon's premium Halo membership to get access to most of your device's features (which cost $3.99/month). Considering that the Halo View and Halo Band come with free trials of Halo membership (for a year and six months respectively) you might find that the cost savings are sufficient right now - but you'll want to act before the deal on these trackers ends.",
    "The Amazon Echo Frames - like most smart glasses - are still a bit of a novelty item. Sure, it's cool to feel like Tony Stark for a few minutes while you ask your AI assistant to perform tasks for you from anywhere, but they currently don't offer much more functionality or convenience than your smartphone's voice assistant.",
    "However, with these great Cyber Monday deals available you might be more willing to take the plunge - $100 off is a very tempting offer.",
    "Wherever you live, here are the cheapest prices for Amazon Echo devices:",
