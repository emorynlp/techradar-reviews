    "The brand new Sky Glass is being billed as a powerful 4K TV, with Sky's excellent programming and hardware expertise to bear \u2013 without a satellite dish or additional set-top box needed to access the broadcaster's vast array of content. With a simplicity to its hardware, it appears to offer a 'no fuss' solution for customers that just want to kick back and relax to their favorite shows and films.",
    "However, Sky Glass\u2019 overabundance of pricing options makes working out the best deal a confusing mess. Even once you\u2019ve sorted through the literal hundreds of options you can choose between, you\u2019ll probably have to spend hours working out which combination of channels and programming is right for you \u2013 with the varying costs that can entail.",
    "Confused? So are we.",
    "At first the pricing is simple enough. For the Sky Glass TV itself, you'll find every model offers two pricing options: either contract or one-off payment. But here\u2019s our first snag as you can actually get the contract over 48 months or 24 months \u2013 really giving you three options per TV.",
    "Unless you have a specific model size in mind that means you\u2019ll have to weigh up nine different pricing options. That\u2019s not too bad, but that\u2019s just for the hardware. If you want the Sky Glass TV, you\u2019ll also need to purchase a Sky TV subscription.",
    "The most basic option here is the \u2018Sky Ultimate TV\u2019 bundle which throws together Sky\u2019s entertainment channels and TV boxsets in with a Netflix subscription. You\u2019ll need this no matter what, but that\u2019s far from all Sky has to offer.",
    "Sports fans will probably want to upgrade with a Sky Sports package, and you might also want to consider BT Sports for even more content. Movie buffs will additionally want to consider Sky Cinema and a Disney Plus add-on to have a massive library of films at their fingertips. And if you have children running around the home you might want to keep them entertained with Sky Kids.",
    "Finally if you want to enjoy Sky\u2019s own content in 4K (the same resolution as the display you\u2019ve just bought off them) you\u2019ll have to pay extra too for the UHD add-on.",
    "Thanks to those six possible additional options you\u2019ll be faced with 64 unique combinations of packages to choose between to spice up your regular \u2018Sky Ultimate TV\u2019 bundle (including not choosing any add ons at all).",
    "If you had no clue what Sky Glass TV size you want, how you want to pay for it nor what Sky TV package would best suit your needs, you\u2019ll need to compare 576 different options.",
    "That's not to mention hidden costs, like the fact that fast-forwarding of ads is included for free for the first 12 months of owning the set, but then begins to charge you \u00a35 for the privilege thereafter.",
    "Now, anyone used to Sky's bundles and packages will have a better idea than most of what channels they need, and a firm budget in mind will do most of the work of deciding when to stop adding on, well, add-ons.",
    "But for a product designed to make home entertainment simpler, it feels like the benefits of all-in-one hardware is being let down by a complicated mess of payment options \u2013 which could threaten the success of Sky Glass before it's really gotten off the ground."
