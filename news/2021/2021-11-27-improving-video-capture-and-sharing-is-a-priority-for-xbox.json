    "When it comes to making improvements to Xbox Series X/S, the team at Xbox is placing video capture quality and sharing high on its priority list.",
    "As reported by VGC, the director of program management at Xbox, Jason Ronald, recently appeared on the Iron Lords podcast, where he was asked about the company\u2019s plans for Game DVR on the consoles. Ronald replied that Game DVR \u201cis definitely a priority\u201d for the team and that it\u2019s \u201cthe one area \u2013 the capture and share experience \u2013 that I wish we were able to make more progress [on] this year than we were able to.\u201d",
    "That\u2019s not to say that the team hasn\u2019t made any headway at all with planned improvements. Ronald explains in the interview that the team \u201chave made some changes\u201d and \u201csome improvements to the reliability and the quality of the captures\u201d but adds that they \u201cdefinitely hear the feedback\u201d and \u201cknow we still have work to do here.\u201d",
    "Ronald goes on to recommend that Xbox users join the Xbox Insider program as it\u2019s a good way to get access to new features and improvements and offer feedback on them. \u201cGet on the Insider rings,\u201d he says, \u201cso that as we bring new capabilities and improvements, we want that feedback to know where we\u2019re meeting the bar, and where we\u2019re not meeting the bar.",
    "\u201cBut definitely, message heard, and like I said, it\u2019s definitely an area that I wish were able to make more progress this year than we did but it will definitely be a priority for 2022.\u201d",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time that Ronald has acknowledged player feedback around share and capture. Back in January of this year, not too long after the Xbox Series X launch, Ronald responded to a tweet to say that the team is \u201cworking on a number of improvements to the capture and share experience\u201d and that while there was nothing to share at the time, it was \u201ca priority for the team\u201d.",
    "Making improvements to the console is, however, a long-term project and Ronald tells the Iron Lords podcast that capture and share is something they will \u201ccontinue to iterate on.\u201d",
    "Back in February, when speaking to Larry Hryb on the official Xbox podcast, Ronald explained that when it comes to the Xbox platform, there\u2019s \u201ca lot of really exciting things that are coming down the pipeline over the coming months and over the coming years\u201d, adding that \u201cAt launch, we say it all the time internally, this is really just the beginning.\u201d",
    "If you\u2019re less concerned about game capture and sharing on the Xbox Series X and more concerned with just trying to get your hands on one amidst ongoing shortages, we\u2019re regularly tracking retailer stock to help you out. We\u2019re also tracking the best Xbox Series X/S Black Friday deals over the course of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale period."
