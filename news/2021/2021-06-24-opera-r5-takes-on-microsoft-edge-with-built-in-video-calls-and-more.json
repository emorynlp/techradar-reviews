    "With more of our tasks moving to the web browser, Opera has been working on a major update, releasing a version called R5 with a focus on collaboration between each other, alongside user interface improvements and a bigger focus on video calling.",
    "Opera has always been one to try and redefine what you can do in a browser, other than managing tabs and use extensions. Many built-in features have removed the need for other tabs and even applications to be used separately here, such as WhatsApp integration and more.",
    "The new update looks to address the needs of more people being online due to working from home, with a focus on features that look to help with this even more.",
    "Opera is making a big push in making features that keep users from moving away from the browser, by refining the integration of other services further that other browsers don\u2019t offer.",
    "\u201cMany people have become true power users of the web in the past year and a half. With today\u2019s release, Opera is providing smart ways to improve their online lives,\u201d said Maciej Kocemba, product director at Opera.",
    "The main improvements coming with R5 look to be useful for many, such as:",
    "With Firefox recently redesigning its UI to focus on tabs, while Microsoft Edge is seemingly getting ready to appear on Windows 11, and Apple\u2019s redesign of Safari, it looks like all systems go for web browsers to make a fresh impression on users.",
    "You can download the latest version of Opera by either going to the website, or by selecting \u2018Check for Updates\u2019 in the web browser."
