    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy is the type of superhero TV series that Netflix needs right now. Rivals have stolen a march on the streaming giant since it cancelled the last of its interconnected Marvel shows two years ago, with properties including Amazon\u2019s The Boys and Disney Plus hit Falcon and the Winter Soldier dominating the superhero landscape.",
    "It\u2019s not that Netflix hasn\u2019t tried to stay competitive; however, for every successful superhero project, such as The Umbrella Academy, there have been notable misfires like Thunder Force. To truly compete, Netflix needs its own unique superhero universe to muscle in on this increasingly popular genre.",
    "Step forward Jupiter\u2019s Legacy, the first of Netflix\u2019s upcoming TV shows based on the works of comic writer Mark Millar. Ahead of the series\u2019 launch, TechRadar sat down with Millar to discuss how Jupiter\u2019s Legacy lends itself to the TV format. We also asked about the challenge of bringing the comics\u2019 biggest action sequence to life, and why subversive superhero stories are becoming more popular with modern-day audiences.",
    "Based on Millar and Frank Quitley\u2019s comics of the same name, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy tells the story of the Union, the world\u2019s first superheroes. After a century of protecting Earth from a variety of foes, the Union\u2019s remaining members \u2013 The Utopian (Josh Duhamel), Lady Liberty (Leslie Bibb), Brainwave (Ben Daniels) and The Flare (Mike Wade) \u2013 are wrestling with the prospect of passing their responsibilities on to their ill-prepared superpowered children.",
    "As the children, for their part, struggle to live up to their parents\u2019 legacy, tensions rise between the generations \u2013 and it isn\u2019t long before loyalties are truly tested when a seemingly unsolvable mystery threatens to ignite a superhero civil war.",
    "Netflix\u2019s adaptation of Jupiter\u2019s Legacy has been three and a half years in the making. Back in August 2017, the streaming giant acquired Millarworld, the comic empire founded by Millar, with the aim of adapting his company\u2019s various properties for its platform.",
    "Before Netflix\u2019s buyout of his company, Millar\u2019s works \u2013 including Kick Ass and Kingsman \u2013 had only been turned into movies. Jupiter\u2019s Legacy, too, was being primed for a film treatment by way of a trilogy before Netflix swooped, and those plans were shelved in favor of a TV series soon after.",
    "For Millar, transforming Jupiter\u2019s Legacy into a TV show didn\u2019t initially seem like the right fit, which is understandable, given that his other properties had worked well as movies. Following a conversation with a prominent Marvel movie director, however, Millar\u2019s perceptions of television as an art form changed.",
    "\u201cIt was actually [Guardians of the Galaxy director] James Gunn's idea [for a TV show],\u201d Millar explains. \u201cBack in 2015, he said to [executive producer] Lorenzo di Bonaventura and I \u2018This isn\u2019t a movie. It isn\u2019t even a movie trilogy. It\u2019s such a big story, you need a TV show.\u2019 And he was completely right.\u201d",
    "Given that most movie runtimes sit between two and three hours these days, condensing the decades-spanning plot of Jupiter\u2019s Legacy into a potential nine-hour movie arc meant that plenty of vital story beats would have been left out.",
    "By contrast, the TV format presented the opportunity to not only explore the comic book\u2019s characters and their motivations in as much detail as possible, but also expand on specific parts of the source material that Millar wanted to add context to.",
    "\u201cIt meant we could go deeper into things that I only make reference to in the comic universe,\u201d Millar says. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment where these characters travel to the island, and the idea of that journey was initially supposed to be the first half of season 1. You realize, if this had been a movie, that journey would\u2019ve only been a five-minute opening sequence. We could never have given it that emotional depth [that it needed] if it had been a movie.\u201d",
    "It isn\u2019t just Jupiter\u2019s Legacy\u2019s character and world expansions that the TV series benefits from. The structured approach of Netflix\u2019s adaptation, too, resembles that of a comic book, particularly in how it presents its two stories set in different time periods.",
    "The first story, set in the present day, follows the Union and their children as they attempt to simultaneously work through their personal issues and solve the series\u2019 overarching mystery. The second, meanwhile, takes place during the Great Depression, and reveals how the Union\u2019s original members came into possession of their abilities.",
    "Intertwining these narratives allows audiences to unravel the series\u2019 many puzzles as the TV show progresses. It\u2019s a format similar to that employed by other comic-book series, including The Umbrella Academy, and one that required a showrunner with experience of adapting comics for the small screen. In Millar\u2019s mind, there was only one person suited for the role: Steven S. DeKnight, who had worked on superhero TV shows including Smallville and Netflix\u2019s Daredevil.",
    "\u201cNetflix said \u2018Who would you like to be the showrunner?\u2019 and I had no hesitation,\u201d Millar says. \u201cI\u2019d just watched Daredevil season one, and I thought it was brilliant. As soon as Steven started talking to me, I knew this was in good hands. I remember him sending in the series\u2019 outline, and the first half of it was set in the opening sequence of the comic. He said \u2018Trust me on this, give it time to breathe and it\u2019ll be monumental.\u2019\u201d",
    "That structuring aspect extends to the series\u2019 fights and other action set-pieces. Jupiter\u2019s Legacy\u2019s biggest battle surprisingly takes place in its first episode, a subversion of viewer expectations, given that similar scenarios play out much later in other superhero productions. As Millar explains, though, ensuring these big bouts \u2013 featuring almost 20 superpowered individuals \u2013 are believable is more important than where they take place within a story\u2019s context.",
    "\u201cThe fight coordination is extremely tricky,\u201d he says. \u201cSteven directed that [episode one\u2019s battle] and the stunt coordinators were there for weeks. I remember when we made Kick Ass, and one fight scene involving Hit Girl, which was 30 seconds of footage, was three weeks of preparation. It\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a lot of them on television as they\u2019re really expensive. It\u2019s a theoretical nightmare to get right.\u201d",
    "Netflix is positioning Jupiter\u2019s Legacy on a unique part of the superhero spectrum. It appears that the streamer\u2019s hopes lie with the series\u2019 subversive tone and style, and that it\u2019ll appeal to audiences through its distinctive features.",
    "Those aspirations are ones that Millar holds, too. Jupiter\u2019s Legacy is just the first of his company\u2019s properties due to arrive on Netflix over the next few years, and Millar believes that, now that superheroes have become such a large part of modern-day culture, viewers are ready for more stories beyond those based on Marvel and DC properties.",
    "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have told these stories without what came before,\u201d he muses. \u201cThere\u2019s been great work from Marvel and DC for 20 years, and it\u2019s got audiences in such a sophisticated state that they can handle an ensemble of 40 superheroes told over two time periods in a story as grand and ambitious as this. I think global audiences are ready for this; this is the next step.\u201d",
    "Jupiter\u2019s Legacy is available to stream now exclusively on Netflix."
