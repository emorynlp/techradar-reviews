    "Today Sony has unveiled new wireless headphones and wireless earbuds aimed at audiophiles on more of a budget.",
    "The WH-XB910N headphones will use multiple features that we loved from the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones. This includes DSEE audio upscaling to deliver better clarity to older tracks, the Dual Noise Sensors help bring great active noise cancellation and Sony\u2019s Extra Bass tech will likely offer a powerful sound you can\u2019t help but groove to.",
    "On top of that, the new wireless earphones will give you 30 hours of battery life on full charge meaning the music won\u2019t stop until you do. They\u2019re also Google Assistant and Alexa compatible, giving you voice-controlled ways to control your favorite tracks \u2013 perfect for when you need to use them hands-free.",
    "Meanwhile, the WF-C500 true wireless earbuds pack a fair amount into their compact design. Once again DSEE audio upscaling will help these buds achieve great sound clarity and you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your favorite tunes for hours on end thanks to their 10 hours of battery life on a single charge.",
    "However, it doesn\u2019t look like the WF-C500 are as comparable to Sony\u2019s top-of-the-range WF-1000XM4 true wireless earbuds as the WH-XB910N is to its high-end counterpart. But given the WF-C500 will cost a fraction of the price that was to be expected.",
    "We haven\u2019t had a chance to test out either of these audio devices quite yet, but we\u2019re confident they\u2019ll offer a decent performance. Sony makes some of the best headphones and best earbuds available in 2021, and while these more budget-friendly options likely won\u2019t offer the same level of quality you know this is a brand you can rely on for audio.",
    "If you want to try out these new Sony devices for yourself they\u2019ll be available in October. The WF-C500 true wireless earbuds will cost \u00a389 (around $120 / AU$165), while the WH-XB910N wireless headphones will set you back \u00a3179 (around $240 / AU$335)."
