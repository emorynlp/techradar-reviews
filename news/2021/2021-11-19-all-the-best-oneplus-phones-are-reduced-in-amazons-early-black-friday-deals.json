    "If you're a fan of OnePlus phones and are looking for a new one, then some early Black Friday phone deals on Amazon might give you what you need.",
    "Many modern mobiles like the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, Nord N200 and 8T are all reduced by $100 or more - most of these devices are at the lowest price they've been thanks to Black Friday.",
    "Not in the US? Scroll down for OnePlus phone deals in your region.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is the company's top-end phone of the year with a 6.7-inch screen, four rear cameras, a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and fast 65W charging.",
    "The OnePlus 9 is similar but it's slightly smaller, has one fewer rear camera, and has a lower-resolution screen. It's the only phone in the deals that has been cheaper before, but only by $10.",
    "The OnePlus 8T is the same size as the 9 but with a display that doesn't curve at the edges; it's slightly weaker in terms of processing power and camera capabilities but it's still no slouch.",
    "Finally, the Nord N200 5G is new for 2021; it has relatively low-res cameras, a weak chipset and slow charging, but with a big battery, a low price and 5G connectivity, it's a worthy mobile.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for OnePlus phones from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
