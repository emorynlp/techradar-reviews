  "article": [
    "Update: The Best Buy PS5 restock today seems imminent, and although we don't know the exact time, our PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider will send you an alert when it's in stock \u2013 if you follow his account and turn on notifications.",
    "Why today? Best Buy recently added a PS5 console bundle with Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart (a PS5-exclusive game that just launched). It says 'Sold out' but that seems to be just a placeholder. If it's today, the latest we've seen Best Buy restock the PS5 is at 3:40pm EDT, at least in 2021. We're going to keep tracking.",
    "Trust and credibility: Matt has helped 40,000 people find a next-gen console via his tweets and exclusive reporting of restock news.",
    "Here's an example of a Best Buy PS5 restock alert Matt has sent out. Click on the image to follow and turn on notifications.",
    "Here's another fact: Best Buy did an Xbox restock yesterday, and is due for a PS5 restock. The American retailer has Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart PS5 bundles in its inventory system and the game releases today, so we haven't lost hope yet for a PS5 restock this week, especially as there was no Walmart PS5 restock yesterday.",
    "We reported that we didn't anticipate a Target PS5 restock this week and our 24/7 PS5 restock Twitter tracker Matt Swider was right. We're unsure about GameStop, but always get advance notice and tweet out a restock alert so you have plenty of time (usually 90 minutes).",
    "The only highlights: We did see Sony console bundles at Newegg and Antonline earlier this week, but no major PS5 drop has happened since the Best Buy restock one week ago (on Thursday of last week). That's odd given the fact that Sony is now launching a flagship game.",
    "Sources: Our US retail sources are in charge of inventory; that add-to-cart button could go live at any time, hence the importance of alerts and the reason the PS5 restock Twitter following of Matt Swider has grown.",
    "Best Buy does in fact have PS5 inventory, according to our sources. The retailer has been all over the place with restock dates, yet we can report that it has generally has favored Thursdays or Fridays in recent weeks. The Best Buy restock time has also been very sporadic in 2021. The one takeaway is that it recently paired the PS5 with Ratchet & Clank PS5, a bundle that hints a restock may happen tomorrow.",
    "Walmart has consistently done a PS5 restock on Thursdays, though we always warn it's not every Thursday. Apparently, this week. Every Walmart restock has been at or around 3pm EDT (sometimes a bit after that, so look for the PS5 restock Twitter alert from Matt Swider). Last week they did an odd thing in that very little new stock of PS5 Digital launched at 3:10am on Thursday. Only a few people got it.",
    "Newegg had a PS5 bundle with Destruction All-Stars and MLB The Show as part of the bundle. It's always a lottery with the Newegg Shuffle, so you're never guaranteed to get it, but you also don't have to constantly try to add it to your cart. Newegg also has a massive RTX GPU restock this week.",
    "GameStop has a PS5 restock three out of the last four Wednesdays \u2013 last week was a short week due to Memorial Day, so very few retailers in the US had the Sony console in stock. We didn't see a GameStop restock this Wednesday either, but it could still happen this week.",
    "It's more than us knowing the restock date pattern. This week, GameStop's official Twitter account cryptically tweeted: \"You never know.. we have many tricks up our sleeves.\" This was regarding whether or not there would be a PS5 restock tied to the Ratchet and Clank: A Rift Apart launch. The game launches today, Friday, so you'd think it would launch a restock this afternoon.",
    "Antonline did have a brief PS5 Digital restock again on Wednesday, but the retailer was just kicking back a few consoles that were canceled from Tuesday's actual restock date. It was a blip rather than a full restock.",
    "Again, because of the Ratchet and Clank PS5-exclusive launch, you'd expect Sony Direct to have a restock of the PlayStation 5 console. We haven't received notices of the official store of the PlayStation brand sending out those exclusive invites, so we have to wait and see if a virtual queue opens up.",
    "Other retailers being tracked by Matt Swider include Amazon (which has done very random restocks, but we think it'll be at 3am EDT one day this month), Costco, Sam's Club and Newegg, as well as the aforementioned Target, which has low inventory numbers.",
    "Best Buy is one of the few US retailers to have had a PS5 restock in June. And it could be amassing more consoles for today, according to our sources who showed us the mounting inventory. Best Buy does online-only orders of the PS5, though it requires you to pick up the console in stores a few days later (the inventory ships from those warehouses to local Best Buy stores; it usually takes 3 to 5 days).",
    "That's good news because resellers can't order massive numbers of consoles, so you have a better shot at getting a PS5 from Best Buy than you do at some other stores. Though our sources have shown us PS5 inventory at warehouses, there's no telling when that add-to-cart button will go live. But we'll keep tracking PS5 stock live.",
    "Here's the last Best Buy restock alert we sent out just last week:",
    "The Walmart PS5 restock date and time to check is June 17 at 3pm EDT. The biggest retailer in the US has consistently launched new console inventory at this time, though it can be a few minutes after that official time when it actually goes live on the Walmart website.",
    "Oddly, while Walmart does a PS5 restock almost every other Thursday at 3pm EDT (meaning not this Thursday), it reversed the am/pm and had a very small PS5 Digital drop last week at 3:10am EDT (don't worry if you missed it \u2013 barely anyone got PS5 digital). The good news is that Matt Swider often gets an advance notice about the Walmart PS5 restock news, complete with a date and time if it's a massive console drop.",
    "GameStop has been the most consistent with PS5 restock opportunities in 2021, and it's easier to get it from here simply because it touts bundles that can cost as much as $729, which of course scare away most resellers. We're eager to see if one of the PS5 bundles contains Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart, which launches today.",
    "The GameStop PS5 date still happen today because \u2013 aside from the short week last week \u2013 GameStop has restocked the PS5 restock every week for three weeks in a row. The GameStop restock time is almost always at 2pm EDT, though Matt Swider usually gets a tip-off at least 90 minutes ahead of time.",
    "Here's an example of the alert from the last PS5 restock from GameStop:",
    "We don't expect a Target PS5 restock until next week, and know that the American retailer likes to restock on a Wednesday or Thursday (never any other day of the week in 2021). Our sources indicate that key Target stores in the US don't have enough consoles on hand (if it happened today, it would be the smallest Target PS5 drop in 2021 with major stores having just three consoles in their backroom, according to our tipsters).",
    "Here's what we do know. The Target restocks have always been on Wednesday or Thursday at around 7:40am EDT. The next Wednesday and Thursday on the calendar is June 16 and June 17, and since the last Target PS5 restock was on Thursday, May 27 at about 7:40am EDT, next week feels as if it'll be enough time to have stocked up on more PS5 consoles. We'll keep tracking Target every day, regardless.",
    "The last Sony Direct PS5 restock date was May 20, and while no one has sources at this official PlayStation Store (they're tight-lipped), our restock Twitter alerts have helped people enter Sony's 'virtual queue' to randomly get selected so that they can purchase the console (within 10 minutes). Hundreds of people get it each time, according to Matt Swider's Twitter replies (verified by order receipts).",
    "With the launch of the new Ratchet & Clank game, you'd expect Sony Direct to end its restock drought today. Whenever it does happen, the good news about Sony Direct PS5 restocks is they're usually fairer than other stores thanks to a virtual queue that randomizes who gets to buy the PS5.",
    "Here's an example of our Sony Direct PS5 restock from May 20:",
    "Amazon has been pivoting back and forth with its restock times: mornings (at around 10am EDT) and the middle of the night (always around 3am EDT). The last restock happened in the morning, meaning we could be in for another PS5 restock when people least suspect it.",
    "Amazon Prime Day deals will happen on June 21 and June 22, but we're questioning whether or not the retailer wants to put so much pressure on its servers with a PS5 restock when the all-important Black Friday-like event is going on.",
    "We're tracking Amazon when the restock does take place. But we also know Amazon has waited between 15 and 54 days between restocks, so there's no telling when PS5 will be back in stock at Amazon.com"
