    "A big change could be coming to future iPhones \u2013 and it\u2019s not one that Apple wants. The European Union has announced plans to force smartphone makers to include a USB-C port on their devices, so that there\u2019s a universal smartphone charger for all phone users.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that these plans aren\u2019t final, so they could still be dropped, and as things stand Apple and other companies have 24 months to make the change, meaning the iPhone 14 probably wouldn\u2019t be affected, but the iPhone 15 would be.",
    "We\u2019re focused on Apple here simply because just about every other smartphone maker already uses USB-C \u2013 as do many makers of other devices such as cameras, tablets and handheld consoles, which are also affected by the proposal.",
    "Having stuck with the Lightning port since 2012, Apple understandably isn\u2019t too happy about having to make a change here, claiming in a statement to TechRadar to \u201cremain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world.\u201d",
    "Yet there are obvious benefits to having a single charger type for all portable devices. One cable can charge everything, and there\u2019s less risk of charging ports being changed on new models and rendering your old cables useless (though presumably, USB-C won\u2019t be around forever).",
    "Whichever side you\u2019re on, the choice will likely be out of your \u2013 and Apple\u2019s \u2013 hands. But that\u2019s not to say Apple won\u2019t have options if this plan does go ahead. Below we\u2019ve highlighted three ways the iPhone could change as a result of these new rules.",
    "This is the obvious change. If the European Union says that the iPhone charging port must be USB-C, then it makes sense for Apple to switch to USB-C, whether it wants to or not. And the company has already switched to USB-C on many iPad models, so making the same change on its phones needn\u2019t be that much of a big deal.",
    "Given that the EU only has a say over how things work in its member states, it\u2019s also possible that Apple could release two different versions of future iPhones \u2013 one with a USB-C port for the EU, and one with Lightning for everywhere else. But that\u2019s likely to increase its production costs, and we reckon once it has to switch for some regions it probably would for everywhere.",
    "One way to get around the requirement for a USB-C port would be to not have a charging port at all. We\u2019ve actually heard multiple times that future iPhones could have a portless design, so this could be something Apple is working on anyway.",
    "How would that work? It would mean relying on wireless charging, but that\u2019s something the iPhone range already offers, and with MagSafe on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 it\u2019s arguably better than the wireless charging on most other phones, since this makes it easier to keep the chargers aligned.",
    "Though Apple\u2019s wireless charging isn\u2019t particularly fast at the moment, either compared to rival devices or to wired charging speeds, so that\u2019s something the company might want to work on if it does plan to go portless. Plus, professionals would need to find a convenient way to transfer large amounts of data and files without plugging the phone in, and there's no useful alternative to wires for that just yet.",
    "One other option is that Apple could include both a USB-C port and a Lightning port in future iPhones.",
    "Thierry Breton, the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, has specifically suggested as much according to the Associated Press, saying \u201cIf Apple wants to continue to have their own plug, they will have the ability to do it. It\u2019s not against innovation, it\u2019s just to make the lives of our fellow citizens a little bit more easy,\u201d and apparently adding that Apple and others could still put two different ports on their phones if they want.",
    "You could look at that as the best of both worlds, allowing people to use whichever port they want. But the space and expense required to do that would probably make it an unappealing solution, so we\u2019d say this is least likely to be the road Apple will go down."
