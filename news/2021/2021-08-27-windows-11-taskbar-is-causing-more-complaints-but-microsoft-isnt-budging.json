  "article": [
    "Windows 11 has witnessed various changes to the functionality of the taskbar which haven\u2019t been popular, and in that vein, a fresh removal has been highlighted \u2013 namely the stripping back of the calendar flyout.",
    "The story here, as relayed by Windows Latest, is that the calendar flyout from the taskbar \u2013 the panel which pops up when you click on the time/date in the system tray, far-right \u2013 no longer has events integration at the bottom. In other words, there\u2019s no agenda visible handily flagging up at-a-glance events and reminders anymore.",
    "Similarly, at the top, there\u2019s no longer a large version of the clock display which additionally shows the number of seconds (not just the hour and minutes).",
    "As Windows Latest points out, those testing Windows 11 had previously assumed that the missing events integration was just a bug in the calendar flyout, but it turns out that this isn\u2019t the case, and Microsoft has actually removed the facility.",
    "Instead, the software giant wants people to use the widgets panel to access calendar events and reminders. Microsoft told one user who complained: \u201cThank you so much for giving us your feedback. While we\u2019ll continue to use your feedback to guide the future of features like this, currently on Windows 11, there is a calendar option in the new widgets experience that you can use to quickly see your personal calendar and its events.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s no shortage of complaints about this issue on Microsoft\u2019s Feedback Hub, and in other places like Reddit.",
    "One user posted in the Feedback Hub: \u201cWidget does not have all your calendars and is full of news and unnecessary stuff. Please make it available as before, as it was PERFECT, and you had the option to create events for whatever accounts you have linked at the spot.\u201d",
    "With Windows 11 seemingly poised on moving into the final stages of testing before release (possibly in October), things are unlikely to change, it seems, given Microsoft\u2019s above comment.",
    "By the way, for those Windows 11 testers who are missing the large clock display at the top of the calendar flyout, the more positive news is that you can actually bring this back by heading to Settings > Time & Language > Date & Time > Additional clocks, where there\u2019s the option to show up to two clocks. However, note that they won\u2019t display the readout of seconds as seen in Windows 10, just the hour and minutes.",
    "It\u2019s a worrying theme that with certain bits of the Windows 11 interface, Microsoft seems to be stubbornly forcing through what are already unpopular changes even going by tester feedback (a limited set of users, of course, compared to the wider general computing public who are eventually going to come face-to-face with all these missing bits of functionality).",
    "Why not have events integration with the taskbar\u2019s calendar flyout? Or at least have it as a possible option? Well, we know why in this case, and it\u2019s to funnel folks into using the widgets panel (which pushes MSN content, and opens stuff in the Edge browser to boot).",
    "Why not allow the clock on the flyout to display seconds? There\u2019s no good answer for that we can think of, except it\u2019s just a streamlining measure, and part of making the overall appearance of Windows 11 cleaner. But some folks like the option of seeing the exact seconds, so is there really any harm in allowing them a choice to switch that back on when adding a clock back to the calendar flyout?",
    "For that matter, what about the other baffling and unpopular taskbar changes that we\u2019ve highlighted in the past, like removing the ability to drag and drop app icons onto the taskbar to quickly and easily make a shortcut there, or to drop files onto taskbar app icons to open them?",
    "More choice is always good in the main, surely? But with Windows 11, it\u2019s starting to feel like Microsoft is distancing itself more from the \u2018we\u2019re listening to feedback\u2019 philosophy that came around with the launch of Windows 10, and is leaning more towards telling folks how things should be done \u2013 much more in the vein of Windows 8. And we don\u2019t need to tell you how dangerous that stance is\u2026"
