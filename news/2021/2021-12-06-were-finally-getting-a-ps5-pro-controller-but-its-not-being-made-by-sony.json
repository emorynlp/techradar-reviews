  "article": [
    "A PS5 pro controller is finally on the way thanks to renowned manufacturer Scuf, which should give PlayStation gamers an edge when playing online.",
    "Sony doesn\u2019t have its own version of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, but the Scuf Reflex promises to deliver the types of competitive features pro gamers have come to expect.",
    "A full reveal of the Scuf Reflex is yet to take place, but the company says it has been \u201cpainstakingly designed from the ground up for instantaneous reaction times to get you the most wins.\u201d The PS5 pro controller will also include \u201cremovable paddles\u201d and \u201cbumpers that make all your movements smoother than ever before.\u201d",
    "With pro gaming and esports continuing to rise in popularity, more gamers are investing in hardware that can help make them as competitive as possible. Having the right controller can work wonders, and definitely deliver a competitive advantage in titles like Call of Duty: Vanguard and Fortnite.",
    "You can sign up to be among the first to purchase the Scuf Reflex here.",
    "Unlike Microsoft, Sony hasn\u2019t created an official pro controller for its consoles yet. Instead, it chose to release the DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment add-on for the PS4, which added two remappable paddles that are often found on competitive pads.",
    "Unfortunately, though, the DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment doesn\u2019t work on the PS5 DualSense controller, and the only other professional-grade pad available right now is the HexGaming Esports Rival Controller 2, which isn\u2019t cheap.",
    "We\u2019re expecting the Scuf Reflex to retail for a similar price to the company\u2019s Xbox-specific Scuf Instinct and Scuf Instinct Pro controllers, which cost $170 / \u00a3159.99 and $200 / \u00a3189.99 respectively.",
    "With online multiplayer games continuing to be some of the most played titles out there, it\u2019s honestly surprising that Sony hasn\u2019t made its own version of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, which has proven there is a huge market available. Scuf will be hoping to capitalize on this, especially if Sony chooses not to release a pro controller for PS5 this generation."
