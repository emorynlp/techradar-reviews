    "It\u2019s been a busy year for HTC and virtual reality (VR), but recent teaser images suggest the Taiwanese company has yet another product up its sleeve in 2021.",
    "Ahead of the brand\u2019s cryptic \u2018Go with the Flow\u2019 event on October 14, HTC tweeted the date, a link to its Vive website and an image showing a mysterious-looking canister sitting next to a laptop.",
    "The company then followed up by sharing further tweets that seem to hint at a wellness-focused VR product, which recent trademark filings suggest could be called the Vive Flow \u2013 and we think, if it\u2019s a headset, it\u2019ll be a rival to the portable Oculus Go.",
    "HTC\u2019s latest mixed reality product, the HTC Vive Focus 3, was an impressive but business-focused VR headset that catered to a niche market, and while the HTC Vive still ranks among our picks for the best VR headset you can buy today, it could be time for the company to launch a new cheaper, wireless VR option for casual consumers.",
    "Well, if these teaser images are anything to go by, the Vive Flow could be just that.",
    "According to a recent report by UploadVR \u2013 which, incidentally, was retweeted by HTC itself \u2013 the speculatively named Vive Flow has been attributed with the same Statement of Use trademark as the aforementioned Vive Focus, suggesting HTC is gearing up to release an entirely new headset or, at least, some new controllers.",
    "Interestingly, Vive China President Alvin Wang Graylin also teased that the event will deliver \u201cbig news in a small package,\u201d accompanying his tweet with an image revealing key art that appears to show two lens-like shapes. You can check it out below.",
    "That\u2019s about all we have so far for official teasers, but could we see HTC unveil a wireless VR headset small enough to be enclosed (and possibly charged) in a portable case? The combination of images we have so far suggests so.",
    "Exactly (or even remotely) how the Vive Flow touches upon the work and wellbeing iconography hinted at by HTC in this cryptic marketing material, though, remains unclear.",
    "Still, you\u2019d best believe we\u2019ll be tuning in on October 14 to find out \u2013 especially as the event comes just two weeks prior to Facebook\u2019s own Oculus-related showcase."
