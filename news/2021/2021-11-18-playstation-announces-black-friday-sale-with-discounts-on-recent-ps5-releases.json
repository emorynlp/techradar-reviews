    "Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced its plans for Black Friday 2021and they include PlayStation Store discounts on some fairly recent releases for PS4 and PS5.",
    "In an official PlayStation Blog post, Chris Howe, the Group Manager for Content Lifecycle Marketing at SIE confirmed that PlayStation\u2019s Black Friday deals will begin on November 19 at midnight local time, with \u201cgreat deals\u201d and \u201cdeep discounts\u201d to be expected on \u201ca variety of titles on the PlayStation Store\u201d.",
    "This is followed by a long list of all the titles that PlayStation players can expect to see discounted on the PlayStation Store when the sale begins. There are some pretty attention-grabbing recent releases for both PS4 and PS5 in the list, including Deathloop, Far Cry 6 and FIFA 22. PS5 exclusives Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart and Returnal are even in there, too.",
    "Aside from recent releases, there are some other great games in there that you might have missed when they were first released but should definitely experience at some point. Titles like Hitman 3, Demon\u2019s Souls, Dishonored 2 and Red Dead Redemption 2 really stand out. And, hey, if you\u2019re a fan of The Sims 4 on console then it\u2019s a good time to pick up some expansion packs as there are plenty of them up for grabs\u201413 in total.",
    "Of course, while it\u2019s exciting to see it confirmed that such recent releases are going to be discounted in a mere matter of hours, the post doesn\u2019t actually confirm exact prices for the games. Instead, it says that \u201call discounts will be revealed on PlayStation Store tomorrow\u201d, so right now it\u2019s a case of keeping your fingers crossed and hoping that the games you have your heart set on will get the deepest discounts. The sale will last until November 29, 23.59pm local time, so there\u2019s a fairly decent window of time in which you can consider your purchases.",
    "PlayStation Direct will also have deals to look out for, with a promise that these will include \u201cthe DualSense wireless controller + NBA 2K21 Jumpstart Bundle\u201d as well as \u201cnumerous PS5 and PS4 titles\u201d. Away from games, the blog post mentions a 20% discount on apparel, accessories, collectables and more at the PlayStation Gear Store. Getting that discount is just a matter of using the code \"BLACKFRIDAY20\" at the checkout.",
    "Black Friday is generally a pretty good time to pick up games that you\u2019ve had your eye on for a while or games that you don't want to take a chance on unless you're getting money off them. It\u2019s not everyone that can pick up every game as soon as it\u2019s released, whether due to constraints on time or money. If you have been holding out for a title, Black Friday is generally the time to go for it as, on top of finally getting a game you want, often you\u2019re also getting the added bonus of a small (or maybe even large) discount.",
    "It\u2019s not just games that are good to pick up on Black Friday, either. For PlayStation owners especially, it\u2019s a great time to renew your PlayStation Plus membership. The blog post does state that there\u2019ll be \u201cdeals on PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now memberships\u201d so it could be a pretty good time to pick up a 12 month membership and not have to worry about it again until next Black Friday, when you can usually be pretty sure you\u2019ll get it for a decent bit of money off again.",
    "At TechRadar we\u2019re tracking the best Black Friday deals so keep checking the site for the latest. Aside from the games, for those who are still seeking the elusive PS5 console, we\u2019re also tracking PS5 Black Friday deals and even the best PS5 SSD deals for when you do finally get your hands on one and want to fill it up with all your discounted titles."
