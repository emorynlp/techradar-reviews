    "A new Call of Duty: Vanguard trailer just launched, and while it's more of a teaser, it sets the stage for the WW2 shooter.",
    "The CoD Vanguard trailer \u2013 embedded via YouTube below \u2013 shows off a war-torn Eastern Front and the fact that the FPS series is returning to its Nazi-killing roots. It doesn\u2019t actually show true gameplay or any characters \u2013 it's a ghost town \u2013 but the in-game locales look well-detailed and fit for next-gen consoles.",
    "The biggest tease comes from the text at the end, which says a full reveal will take place on August 19 at 1:30pm ET / 10:30am PT, and it's coming inside Call of Duty's largest battle royale game, Call of Duty Warzone.",
    "Activision\u2019s annual Call of Duty release is possible because it employs a number of developers who continually churn out entries in the series \u2013 sometimes with multiple developers handling different aspects of the game.",
    "This year, it\u2019s developer Sledgehammer Games\u2019 turn.",
    "In the past, Sledgehammer was responsible for Call of Duty: WW2 and helped Infinity Ward, another one of Activision\u2019s developers, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and the Modern Warfare reboot.",
    "Expectations will certainly be high for Vanguard as the franchise is one of Activision/Blizzard's biggest releases each year, however, its announcement comes just one month after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard Inc following a two-year investigation into the company\u2019s alleged discrimination against female employees.",
    "That investigation will continue to play out as we creep closer to the eventual Call of Duty: Vanguard release date \u2013 likely in October or November of this year \u2013 and may certainly have an impact on how gamers receive the game when it\u2019s launched."
