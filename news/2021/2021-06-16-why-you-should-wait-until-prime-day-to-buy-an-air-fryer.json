    "Air fryers have become incredibly popular recently and if you\u2019re thinking about stepping into the world of air frying, or just want to replace your existing model, don\u2019t buy one...yet.",
    "Amazon Prime Day kicks off on Monday, June 21 this year, and it\u2019s the perfect time to grab one of the best air fryers at a heavily discounted price. We\u2019re expecting to see Prime Day deals on Amazon\u2019s bestselling brands including Cosori, and models such as the NuWave Brio 6-Quart Air Fryer, and perhaps highly-rated options such as the Instant Pot Vortex.",
    "Last year saw discounts as big as $70 / \u00a350 / AU$90 on air fryers and due to the huge surge in popularity, we\u2019re expecting this year to be just as good - if not better.",
    "Air fryers are a lot more versatile than you might first think. These appliances can be used to cook foods you\u2019d otherwise deep fry, but with an air fryer, there\u2019s very little need for any oil at all.",
    "You can also cook everything from homemade fries to salmon, steaks, and even cakes in one of these machines. Air fryers work by circulating hot air around food until it\u2019s crisp and evenly cooked on all sides. Most of these appliances come with frying baskets that have lots of little holes in them, and it\u2019s these holes that allow the hot air to reach your food.",
    "In fact, there are very few things that you won\u2019t be able to cook in an air fryer and you might just find you don\u2019t use your oven as much, or you\u2019re simply able to cook for a crowd because you won\u2019t be using up oven space when you cook with your air fryer.",
    "You can get budget air fryers for around $60 / \u00a342 / AU$77 but the premium options can cost as much as $200 / \u00a3141 / AU$259 which is why waiting for Prime Day is always a good idea if you don\u2019t want to pay full price.",
    "It\u2019s not just older models that we\u2019re expecting discounts on either, some of the most recent and bestselling air fryers will likely be reduced in price, so we\u2019ll be keeping you up to date with all the deals that you won\u2019t want to miss."
