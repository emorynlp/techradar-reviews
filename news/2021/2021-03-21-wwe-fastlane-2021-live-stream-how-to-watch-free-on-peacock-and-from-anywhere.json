    "It's the final WWE pay-per-view event to grace the standard WWE Network channel, and the first to air on Peacock's brand new WWE home. We're showing you how to watch Fastlane with a WWE live stream wherever you are in the world, because you won't want to miss the final PPV step on the road to Wrestlemania.",
    "We're back in the WWE ThunderDome at Tropicana Field for the sixth Fastlane event in WWE history - and the first since 2019. While fans won't be able to return to the auditorium just yet, a live audience of virtual viewers will be putting a 2021 spin on Fastlane's return to our screens.",
    "Wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown will be facing off in a series of Championship fights tonight. Confirmed matchups will see Roman Reigns taking on Daniel Bryan before he faces off against Edge at WrestleMania, and with such a great match between these two contenders at Fastlane 2015 you can bet this will be one to watch.",
    "However, Big E and Apollo Crews will also be using their new found aggression to battle it out for the Intercontinental Championship as well. With tag team matchups featuring Nik Jax and Shayna Baszler facing off against Sasha Banks and Bianca Belair and Alexa Bliss taking on Randy Orton in the inter gender match, there's plenty of action on the cards tonight.",
    "We're making sure you don't miss a second, and showing you how to watch a WWE Fastlane 2021 live stream online - especially now that there's a brand new service on which to watch with a free trial. Keep reading for options in the US and around the globe.",
    "You'll be able to watch WWE Fastlane from a wide range of countries with WWE Network, but if you don't want to grab a new membership there are plenty more live streams available. We're rounding up all the best places to watch in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, Japan, and India just below.",
    "If there aren't any reliable WWE live streams in your country, or if you're away from home and your plans have been scuppered by geo-blocking, we've got a top tip to make sure you don't miss out as well.",
    "Watch a WWE live stream from anywhere",
    "If you're an existing WWE Network member, we'd recommend taking advantage of this offer because after April 4 the WWE Network as we know it today will shut down. Yep... if you want to tune into WrestleMania this year, then Peacock will be your only option stateside.",
    "Outside that, other pay-per-view providers including Dish and Xfinity are showing WWE Fastlane but they cost upwards of $44.99. So Peacock seems the obvious place to go.",
    "The pre-show kicks off at 6pm ET / 3pm PT, with the main action starting an hour afterwards.",
    "WWE's move to Peacock won't affect Canadian viewers, so the best place to watch Fastlane will be WWE Network. However, you'll also find coverage via SaskTel, Shaw or BellMTS but expect to pay similar prices to PPV providers in the US."
