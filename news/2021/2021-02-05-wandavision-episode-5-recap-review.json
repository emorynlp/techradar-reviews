    "Spoilers for the latest episode of WandaVision follow. Watch it first before reading this.",
    "We begin with an \u201980s-style piano sting, the sort of massive suburban house that everyone in \u201980s sitcoms seemed to own\u2026",
    "Wanda tries to get baby Tommy to sleep, telling him he\u2019ll be her favorite twin if he does. Vision comes down the stairs with Billy, who\u2019s also restless. Wanda sends Vision to grab the boys\u2019 binkies (pacifiers), and decides to try a \u201cshort cut\u201d \u2013 using her magic to put them to sleep. It doesn\u2019t work \u2013 instead the babies just laugh.",
    "Vision returns with the pacifiers in his ears, quickly realizing that \u201cnoise cancellation is not their primary function\u201d. Wanda puts the pacifiers in the boys\u2019 mouths, but they spit them out. Wanda wonders where they\u2019re going wrong, but Vision says they\u2019ll figure it out.",
    "The doorbell rings. Vision turns into human form as Agnes walks through the door. She was on her way to Jazzercise when she heard the babies were on a sleep strike. She offers a couple of tricks to help, as Vision does the whole worried dad thing.",
    "Agnes pauses. \u201cDo you want me to take that again?\u201d she asks Wanda. \u201cShould we just take it from the top?\u201d It\u2019s as if she\u2019s an actor asking their director if they want another take. Wanda looks confused \u2013 but nowhere near as confused as Vision. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly,\u201d Wanda jokes, and tells Vision to let Agnes give it a try. The women laugh but Vision looks uneasy. He calls Wanda over to ask, \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d She dodges the subject and they\u2019re soon distracted by Agnes spraying lavender over the children. \u201cWanda, did you really not see what I saw?\u201d",
    "Agnes goes to the kitchen to get some dark liquor \u2013 \u201cnot for me, for the twins. What kind of babysitter do you think I am?\u201d \u2013 and Wanda tells Vision to accept her help. They realize that the twins have gone quiet, but when they look at their cots, they\u2019re empty. \u201cMommy? Daddy?\u201d come two voices from the stairs. They\u2019re now five years old.",
    "\u201cKids, you can\u2019t control \u2019em, no matter hard you try,\u201d says Agnes.",
    "The \u201980s-themed opening credits show an idyllic family life in Westview: \u201cYou wander the world with a vision, of what life could be\u2026\u201d",
    "Back in the real world, SWORD director Hayward asks Captain Monica Rambeau about the first thing she remembers. \u201cPain,\u201d she replies. \u201cAnd then, Wanda\u2019s voice in my head.\u201d Did she try to resist? She says there was a feeling keeping her down, a hopeless feeling like drowning \u2013 \u201cit was grief\u201d.",
    "Monica asks the doctor if she\u2019s cleared to leave sick bay \u2013 the doc says she is when she\u2019s looked at her scans. She also says her uniform is in analysis. Jimmy Woo introduces Dr Darcy Lewis to Monica \u2013 Darcy says she\u2019s a big fan. The doctor says they\u2019re going to need to take the scans again because the images are blank. Monica laughs and says they\u2019re done, getting up to leave.",
    "Hayward leads the briefing. He explains that Wanda was originally assumed to be one of the many victims but they now know she\u2019s the \u201cprincipal victimizer\u201d. Woo gives a quick bio, explaining Wanda\u2019s childhood and powers, as Hayward tries to emphasize her connections to HYDRA, the times she was an enemy of the Avengers, and incidents in Lagos and Germany.",
    "Monica says Wanda isn\u2019t a terrorist. Hayward counters that Rambeau described the experience of being under her mind control as \u201cexcruciating, terrifying, a violation\u201d. Monica says the point she was trying to make is that she doesn\u2019t think Wanda has any political agenda, or an inclination towards destruction \u2013 she says she survived being blasted out of Westview because Wanda chose to protect her. She doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a pre-meditated act of aggression.",
    "Hayward shares top secret surveillance video footage from nine days earlier, showing Wanda storming a maximum security SWORD facility to recover Vision\u2019s body. Woo says that\u2019s in violation of Section 36B of the Sokovia Accords \u2013 and also against Vision\u2019s living will, adds Hayward.",
    "Woo asks how she managed to bring Vision back without the Mind Stone. Darcy doesn\u2019t know, but points out she has the world\u2019s only vibranium Synthezoid playing \u2018father knows best\u2019 in suburbia. \u201cWhat happens when he learns the truth?\u201d",
    "Back in the sitcom, Tommy and Billy are washing a dog in the kitchen sink, hoping that if he\u2019s clean, their mom will let them keep him. They try to hide the dog, but she moves them out of the way. \u201cCan we keep him, mommy?\u201d they ask, as the dog gives maximum cute. She notes that the dog has no collar, but reminds the boys that dogs need a lot of looking after.",
    "Vision comes downstairs. He\u2019s in human form, because he had the feeling someone might pop over\u2026 \u201cwith exactly the item we require\u201d.",
    "At that moment, Agnes walks in carrying a kennel. \u201cMy kitchen window told me someone got a new pooch,\u201d she says. The dog makes an electrical socket spark, so they decide to call him Sparky. Wanda magics up a collar to make it official. Vision questions her using her powers in front of Agnes, but she says Agnes didn\u2019t even notice when the babies turned from babies to five-year-olds. Vision reminds her they agreed to keep their powers hidden. She says that maybe he shouldn\u2019t hide his powers either.",
    "The boys ask again if they can keep the dog. Wanda says they don\u2019t think they\u2019re old enough to take responsibility for an animal until they\u2019re at least 10. The boys look at each other and instantly morph into 10-year-olds.",
    "In the SWORD base, Rambeau says she needs a fallout shelter on wheels. With that, she believes she\u2019d be able to safely re-enter Westview. \u201cYes, theoretically,\u201d agrees Darcy. Monica says she knows an aerospace engineer who\u2019d be up for the challenge and sends a message on her phone. Darcy points out that she can\u2019t guarantee the Hex \u2013 her name for the anomaly, thanks to its hexagonal shape \u2013 won\u2019t just wipe her mind when she goes in.",
    "Jimmy asks if they\u2019ve identified the kids yet, but Monica explains that everything in there is real \u2013 \u201ceverything might look fake in the TV but everything in there is real.\u201d Darcy says that if all the sets and wardrobes are solid matter, Wanda is wielding an insane amount of power \u2013 beyond anything she\u2019s displayed before. But, as Monica points out, she did come close to taking out Thanos on her own. \u201cNobody else came close.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019d argue that Captain Marvel came close,\u201d says Jimmy, but Monica says, \u201cWe are not talking about her. We are talking about Wanda.\u201d",
    "Monica makes a breakthrough and heads to the lab. She fires bullets at the clothes she was wearing in Westview. They\u2019re completely unaffected. \u201cYou had a bulletproof vest on when you entered Westview, didn\u2019t you?\u201d asks Jimmy. Monica says the pants were 87% Kevlar \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not an illusion, Wanda is rewriting reality.\u201d What happens if they send something in that requires no change?",
    "Back in the sitcom, Vision turns on his new computer at Computational Services, Inc. He asks Norm if he wants to surf the internet. \u201cCowabunga, dude,\u201d he replies. They\u2019ve received an email, a top secret communique from SWORD. All of the office staff start reciting the message about Dr Darcy Lewis\u2019s findings on the \u2018Maximoff Anomaly\u2019 \u2013 there are high levels of radiation at the perimeter, and its effect on Westview residents is unknown. They all burst out laughing.",
    "Vision touches Norm\u2019s head and his personality instantly changes. He asks for help, wondering how long he\u2019s been trapped, and looking for his phone so he can call his sister about their sick father. \u201cYou have to stop her,\u201d he tells Vision, saying she\u2019s in his head and it hurts. Vision touches Norm\u2019s head again and he\u2019s back to normal.",
    "Billy and Tommy play with Sparky. They want to show Vision the dog\u2019s new tricks, but Wanda says he\u2019s at work. When they point out it\u2019s Saturday, she says it\u2019s actually Monday. When they assure her it\u2019s Saturday, she changes the story to say there\u2019s an emergency at work and he had to go in. Then she says he needed a distraction \u2013 the kids wonder if he needs a distraction from them. She explains that sometimes she and Vision aren\u2019t quite on the same page \u2013 the same way that brothers argue. They ask if she has a brother \u2013 she says she does but he\u2019s very far away.",
    "Sparky notices a disturbance outside. Monica is piloting a vintage \u201980s drone that has successfully made it inside Westview \u2013 it\u2019s invisible on the sitcom feed because Wanda decides what makes it into the show and what doesn\u2019t. The drone moves in on Wanda and Vision\u2019s house. Monica speaks on the radio, telling Wanda she wants to talk. Wanda\u2019s eyes start glowing red, so Hayward instantly orders them to take the shot. Monica doesn\u2019t believe the drone to be armed, so asks what he\u2019s up to. The video feed from the drone goes blank, as an alarm signals a breach in the energy field.",
    "Everyone rushes outside to see a hole form in the energy field. Wanda \u2013 wearing her usual Avengers attire \u2013 walks out, carrying the wrecked drone. \u201cIs this yours?\u201d she asks, flinging it back. Hayward says the missile was just a precaution, but Wanda tells him this is their only warning to stay out of her home \u2013 if they don\u2019t bother her, she won\u2019t bother them. Hayward reminds her that she\u2019s taken a town hostage. Wanda says she\u2019s not the one with the guns, but Monica says Wanda is the one in control.",
    "Monica says she didn\u2019t know the drones were armed, but reminds Wanda that she, a telepath, must have known she was inviting a SWORD agent into her home \u2013 and that she trusted her to deliver her babies. On some level, Rambeau says, Wanda must know she\u2019s an ally \u2013 and that she wants to help. \u201cHow?\u201d asks Wanda. \u201cWhat could you possibly have to offer me? I have what I want and no one will ever take it from me again.\u201d",
    "Wanda turns all of the soldiers\u2019 guns on Hayward and walks away, back into the sitcom world. A red power surge flows through the energy field.",
    "COMMERCIAL BREAK!",
    "A kid spills bright red drink on the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a mess. And you\u2019re still using the next leading brand? You need Lagos brand paper towels, the most absorbent paper towel available. Husbands can use it too, you know. Lagos: for when you make a mess you didn\u2019t need to.\u201d",
    "Back in the sitcom, Wanda and the boys are looking for Sparky. A postman says they\u2019ll find him, making a pointed reference to the fact their mom won\u2019t let him get far. Agnes emerges from a bush holding Sparky wrapped in a blanket. He\u2019s been eating poisonous azalea leaves. The boys look at each other the way they did when they turned themselves into 10-year-olds. Wanda stops them ageing themselves up, acknowledging that the urge to run from grief is powerful, but that they have to face it.",
    "They say she can fix anything, so she should fix the dead. \u201cYou can do that?\u201d asks Agnes. Wanda says there are rules in life \u2013 we can\u2019t rush ageing because it\u2019s convenient, and we can\u2019t reverse death, no matter how much it hurts us.",
    "In the kitchen that evening, Vision asks how the boys are. Wanda says they\u2019re heartbroken. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you get a dog and bury them the same day,\u201d says Vision. \u201cWell life moves pretty fast out in the suburbs,\u201d she says.",
    "Vision tells her he unearthed Norm\u2019s personality and spoke to him free of her oversight. He tells her Norm was in pain. She tries to dodge the subject but Vision doesn\u2019t just want to watch TV or turn in for the night so Wanda can change everything over again. He says she can\u2019t control him the way she does them. \u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d she asks.",
    "The end credits roll but Vision refuses to leave it. He asks her what the Maximoff Anomaly is, and says he has to believe that the sitcom world was unconscious at first and she only recently became aware of it. Switching back to his Synthezoid form, he reminds Wanda that Norm has a family who he can\u2019t reach \u2013 because she won\u2019t let him.",
    "She says she doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cStop lying to me,\u201d he yells, launching into the air. Wanda does the same, her hands glowing red, telling him, \u201cThis, all of this is for us. So let me handle it.\u201d",
    "He asks what\u2019s outside Westview, but she tells him he doesn\u2019t want to know. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make that choice for me, Wanda!\u201d he shouts. She says he\u2019s never talked to her like this before. He says he doesn\u2019t know who he is and he\u2019s scared. She tells him he\u2019s her husband, and Tommy and Billy\u2019s father. He asks why there are no other children in Westview\u2026",
    "Wanda wonders if Vision really believes she\u2019s in charge of everything in Westview, saying she doesn\u2019t know how any of this started. He tells her that what she\u2019s doing here is wrong.",
    "The doorbell rings \u2013 she says she didn\u2019t make it happen. She doesn\u2019t think he believes her \u2013 he wants to \u201cbut at this point I\u2019m ignoring statistics entirely\u201d.",
    "She answers the door.",
    "Darcy tunes into the transmission.",
    "Wanda\u2019s brother, Pietro, is revealed, to loud audience cheers. \u201cLong lost bro get to squeeze his stinkin\u2019 sister to death or what?\u201d he says.",
    "\u201cShe recast Pietro?\u201d asks Darcy, acknowledging the fact it\u2019s the X-Men version of the character, rather than the Avengers Pietro.",
    "They hug. \u201cWho\u2019s the popsicle?\u201d Pietro asks as the audience applauds.",
    "PLEASE STAND BY.",
    "Verdict:",
    "Up to now, WandaVision has mostly kept its sitcom and \u2018real\u2019 worlds separate. That all changes in this middle episode of the season \u2013 also WandaVision\u2019s longest outing to date \u2013 as the show\u2019s two storylines interweave like never before. There's so much other stuff going on that the typically brilliant, fun \u201980s sitcom pastiche almost feels like an afterthought \u2013 it's starting to look more and more like a traditional Marvel assignment.",
    "After the previous episode\u2019s big revelation that \u201cit\u2019s all Wanda\u201d, the extent of her influence on sitcom world becomes more and more pronounced, to the point Vision can no longer pretend there isn\u2019t something very, very odd going on.",
    "We\u2019d already seen several jump cuts and instances of Wanda rewinding the show, but Agnes\u2019s offer to take a scene \u201cfrom the top\u201d suggests that the imprisoned residents of Westview have rather more awareness than we suspected. Some of the hints are subtle \u2013 a postman saying Wanda won\u2019t let a missing dog get far, for example \u2013 but when Vision temporarily frees Norm from Wanda\u2019s influence, we see how much pain and distress their televisual prison is causing.",
    "It\u2019s a real game-changer \u2013 is Wanda truly the antagonist, or is there something (or someone) else involved? While we all sympathize with her grief over Vision\u2019s death, can that justify her actions? There\u2019s also a question over how much control she wields over Westview. Does anyone have free will?",
    "SWORD director Hayward clearly sees Wanda as the villain, and turns into the sort of stereotypical, \u2018attack first, ask questions later\u2019 military boss we\u2019ve seen in countless other movies and TV shows. But is there more to him than initially seems? Could there be an ulterior motive to his desire to take Wanda down? In the MCU, few characters are entirely as they seem.",
    "With Vision starting to piece the mystery together \u2013 it can only be a matter of time before he encounters his \u2018dead\u2019 self \u2013 it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where WandaVision goes next. Especially now that Wanda\u2019s late twin brother, Pietro (aka Quicksilver), has turned up on the doorstep. The biggest talking point, perhaps, is that he\u2019s played by the X-Men franchise\u2019s Evan Peters, rather than Age of Ultron\u2019s Aaron Taylor-Johnson.",
    "This has long been rumored \u2013 and the big question is whether this Fox version of the character is here to stay, bleeding between the two realities, or if this is just a reference designed to make fans lose their minds. Clearly, Peters' version of the character was very well-liked by fans \u2013 and we know that Deadpool 3 will be an MCU film, suggesting that Marvel Studios will retain some of the X-Men movies' best elements, rather than rendering all of them non-canonical.",
    "Is this just the start for Peters in the MCU? We\u2019ll hopefully be getting an on-screen explanation for the \u2018recasting\u2019 imminently\u2026",
    "New episodes of WandaVision are available every Friday on Disney Plus."
