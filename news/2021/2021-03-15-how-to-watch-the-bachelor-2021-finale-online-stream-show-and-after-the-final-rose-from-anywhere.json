    "Who will our eligible bachelor end up engaged to? Well, tonight we get to find out! Make sure you know how to watch The Bachelor 2021 finale in what is gearing up to be nothing like the 'happy ever after' we expected as Matt James, our charming, 28-year-old real estate broker faces the show's continuous controversy head on.",
    "The first Black bachelor to be featured on a show that has had its difficulties with race issues, it's clear its history of lacking diversity is by no means over as we head into the final of The Bachelor.",
    "Down to Rachael Kirkconnell and Michelle Young vying for Matt James' hand in marriage, the former has had old social media posts resurface, including Kirkconnell 'liking' a friend's picture featuring a Confederate flag and attending an 'Old South' party at university with a slavery theme. What's more, ABC Entertainment announced Chris Harrison, The Bachelor's host, won't be returning for the next season following his defence of Kirkconnell.",
    "With one rose to go, though, who will Matt choose to spend the rest of his life with, and what will the fallout be for Kirkconnell in After the Final Rose when she's confronted by host, Emmanuel Acho.",
    "Considering Matt's awareness from the get-go of the significance of being the first Black male lead since The Bachelor began, it's unsurprising this has largely overshadowed the otherwise butterfly-inducing season finale.",
    "Make sure you're tuned in for the tears by finding out how to watch The Bachelor 2021 season finale online.",
    "Taking a well-earned vacation or out of the country on business? Not a problem. You can easily keep up with new episodes of The Bachelor from almost anywhere, despite geo-blocking restrictions.",
    "The solution is simple. Just download a VPN, to alter your IP address to your home country, which will then let you watch your favorite shows \u2013 like The Bachelor \u2013 no matter where you are. Once installed, select the location of your home country and simply click connect. Viola! You\u2019ll then be privy to all the backbiting and interpersonal drama that the new series has to offer.",
    "And don't forget that a VPN isn't just for reality TV - there's loads you can do with these clever bits of software. From unblocking restricted sites and watching Netflix in other countries, to adding an extra layer of security for online shopping and banking, Virtual Private Networks offer loads of benefits beyond streaming TV.",
    "Matt has already been a massive hit with Bachelor Nation, having been recast for The Bachelor after originally been in the running for one of the 32 contestants in season 16 of The Bachelorette. He looks the complete package, combining good looks with a golden heart.",
    "A real-estate broker by trade, the 28-year-old heartthrob from North Carolina has also founded a charity that aims to encourage physical and mental wellbeing in kids from under-served communities in New York City.",
    "He also tried out for the NFL franchises Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints as a wide receiver, and is best friends with fan fave Tyler Cameron, who finished runner-up in season 15 of The Bachelorette."
