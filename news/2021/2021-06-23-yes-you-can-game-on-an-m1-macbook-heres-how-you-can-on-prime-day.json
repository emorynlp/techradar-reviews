    "There's been plenty of great Prime Day deals for MacBooks this year as it concludes, so you may be tempted to upgrade your existing Mac to one of the M1 models.",
    "Even though Windows 11 is rumored to be on the horizon, these deals may be good enough to make you switch to Apple's macOS operating system instead.",
    "With the M1 chip designed by Apple, it's designed to be a workhorse but with low voltage and a long-lasting battery. With games, there have been some surprising results, even with its emulation app, called Rosetta. This translates to a game that runs on Intel Macs, onto M1 Macs. You can easily play Shadow of the Tomb Raider for example, with almost no slowdown on medium settings.",
    "For example, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) with a 256GB SSD, which is our pick as the best laptop in the world right now, has had a hefty price cut of \u00a3106, and is now just \u00a3893 at Amazon.",
    "With Apple's commitment to games with Apple Arcade on iOS, it's also allowed these games to be played on the Mac as well, thanks to the M1 chips as well. We may see a further improvement where more sophisticated games arrive to the Mac with Apple Arcade, but time will tell.",
    "Thanks to a recent macOS update, you can use your Xbox or PS5 controller with your Mac, saving you the trouble of trying to game on the trackpad and keyboard. You can definitely play games on a Mac with ease, and with the deals below, you can have a great gaming machine on the Mac, with a great controller to boot.",
    "Not in the UK? Scroll down for MacBook deals in your region.",
    "These MacBook deals temporarily went out of stock earlier, so they must be very popular.",
    "While the UK has seen some great MacBook deals, the US hasn't, sadly. The best we've found is the below from Best Buy, which knocks $50 off the price of the new MacBook Air. Not a huge amount, but a price cut is a price cut.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for MacBooks from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
