    "A part of the Olympic program since the 1984 Los Angeles Games, rhythmic gymnastics requires athletes to perform expressive acrobatic moves with a hoop, a ribbon, a pair of clubs, and a ball. Gymnasts are rated on the virtuosity of their performances along with the skill with which they perform their apparatus maneuvers. Read on for how to watch a rhythmic gymnastics live stream for all the Olympics 2020 action.",
    "Individual gymnasts perform four times, using each piece of equipment once for a total of 75 to 90 seconds, with group events requiring a team of five gymnasts to perform twice, using multiple apparatus simultaneously.",
    "As the discipline draws on European influences from dance and ballet, it\u2019s no surprise that countries from that continent excel in rhythmic gymnastics. Russia has long dominated the sport, taking the gold in both the individual all-around and group events from 2000 to 2016. In Tokyo, twin siblings Dina and Arina Averina aim to defend Russia\u2019s golden streak.",
    "But will anyone knock Russia from the top spot? Watch rhythmic gymnastics at Olympics 2020 to find out. Below, we\u2019ll show you how to live stream Olympics events, plus some key dates you don\u2019t want to miss.",
