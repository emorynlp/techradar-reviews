    "Looking for a new OTT streaming service to replace your cable subscription? Hulu has thousands of movies and TV shows, including the Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Little Fires Everywhere, as well as 65 channels with its Live TV package for you to watch. Why not kickstart your Hulu free trial and see if this service and its library of online content is for you.",
    "You can get a taste of Hulu\u2019s impressive library without dropping a cent. From classic movies to new hit titles, as well as incredible Hulu Originals, there\u2019s something for everyone on this streaming service. Use the Hulu free trial to see what takes your fancy.",
    "If you want to know how to get a free trial of up to 30 days of Hulu, keep reading. We\u2019ll also talk you through the cheapest way to watch Hulu after the free trial period ends so you can make the most of the three plans on offer.",
    "If you\u2019re new to Hulu you can get a free trial, the duration of which is dependent on which plan you go for. You can opt for the with or without ads plan, both of which come with a 30-day free trial. Or, if you\u2019re looking for a cable alternative, the Hulu + Live TV offers a shorter 7-day free trial.",
    "Students that sign up for the discounted rate of $1.99 a month won\u2019t be eligible for a free trial period, however, this is hardly a loss when you\u2019re getting 65% off a subscription plan.",
    "Signing up for the Hulu free trial is really straight forward. Simply follow the bullet points below:",
    "You will need a valid credit card to set up and start your Hulu free trial. Not to worry, though - you won't be charged until after the trial period ends. If you don't want to continue with the service and get charged, simply cancel your subscription before your trial expires.",
    "There are three options when it comes to Hulu subscriptions. You can get Hulu's most popular plan for $5.99 a month or $59.99 a year. This essentially gets you two months out of the year for free, but does include ads.",
    "Want to binge without interruption? You can pay $11.99 a month for Hulu's without ads option.",
    "For those who still want access to Hulu\u2019s live broadcasts, you can opt for a Hulu + Live TV plan. This is usually $64.99 a month but you can currently save $10 a month on your first three months of the cable replacement plan. Be aware, unlike the other two packages which come with a 30-day free trial, you'll only get a 7-day free trial with the live TV package.",
    "Of course, not forgetting the Hulu bundle - otherwise known as the Disney Plus bundle. This throws together three streaming services for one uber affordable, umbrella price. Get Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus for only $13.99 a month, or $19.99 a month if you choose Hulu without ads.",
    "If you're after a great saving, the basic Hulu package for $59.99 a year is definitely the way to go to save 20% on your subscription. However, if you're after great value for money, the Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus package gets you access to three streaming platforms, all with extensive libraries, for a really great price.",
    "- Sold? Head to the Hulu website to sign up to your chosen plan now!",
    "Promising 'All the TV you love' (and you can see what we think about that in our Hulu review) it has an extensive library filled with incredible TV shows and movies, including exclusive titles, Hulu Originals, and shows for the kids. Amongst award winning, gripping titles like The Handmaid's Tale and Little Fires Everywhere, you can also find ridiculously entertaining movies like Palm Springs. Fancy a cartoon tailored for adults? Watch Solar Opposites and its two seasons available now.",
    "Blitz through boxset after boxset with much-loved shows like The Mindy Project, Drake and Josh, and America's Next Top Model. Into horror? 'Hulu horror movies' certainly has a nice ring to it. Hulu is home to FX, with over 40 horror movie titles like American Horror Story, Sons of Anarchy, and Fargo.",
    "For documentary lovers, watch environmentalist Greta Thunberg in I Am Greta, or find out more about the origins of The Handmaid's Tale with Margaret Atwood: A Word After a Word After a Word is Power. You can even watch 2020's Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Parasite, right here.",
    "With plenty to get your teeth into, sign up to the 30-day free trial on Hulu now and benefit from a huge range of gritty entertainment.",
