    "A device that could be the Surface Laptop 4 has been spotted passing through Bluetooth certification in the United States, suggesting that Microsoft could be planning to launch a flagship laptop pretty soon.",
    "As spotted by Windows Latest, four Surface Laptop devices have passed through Bluetooth certification, and according to the listing, these new devices will come with Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 \u2013 so when it comes to wireless connectivity, they will be pretty cutting edge.",
    "The four model numbers seen in the certification hint at a range of Surface Laptop configurations, including different screen sizes (again, probably 13.5-inch and 15-inch options), and could also offer a choice of Intel or AMD processors.",
    "Interestingly, the certification lists the product name as \u2018Surface Laptop 3\u2019 and links to the Surface Laptop 3 product page on Microsoft\u2019s website.",
    "So, that could mean that the next generation Surface Laptop won\u2019t be called the Surface Laptop 4, like many expect, but could be the Surface Laptop 3 (2021) or Surface Laptop 3+.",
    "If that\u2019s the route Microsoft goes down (and we really hope it doesn\u2019t), then it could mean these new Surface Laptops are minor updates over the Surface Laptop 3, which was launched back in October 2019.",
    "We wouldn\u2019t like that for a number of reasons. For a start, the Surface Laptop is well overdue a big update, so a minor one will disappoint a lot of people.",
    "Also, Microsoft is well known for its confusing product names (skipping Windows 9, for example, or the controversy over the Xbox Series X name), so we\u2019d hope it goes for a straightforward Surface Laptop 4 name here.",
    "Hopefully these new devices aren\u2019t too far off from being released, so we should find out more soon."
