    "Despite cyber assaults such as ransomware rising in numbers over recent years, many organizations still don\u2019t have a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). What\u2019s more, some of them are under the impression that they don\u2019t even need one, with others saying they are struggling to find the right candidate due to the growing skills gap and the so-called \u201cGreat resignation\u201d.",
    "A new report published by Navisite surveying 130 security, IT, and compliance professionals found that almost half (45%) don\u2019t employ a CISO. Of that group, just a slim majority (58%) think they should have one in the team.",
    "Most organizations have a cybersecurity strategy, but for the majority (60%), it was developed by teams and people other than the CISO - it was either the IT department, compliance department, or executive leadership.",
    "In fact, some companies (21%) don\u2019t even have a person dedicated solely to cybersecurity, at all, while most of them (75%) experienced an increase in overall cybersecurity threat volume in the past 12 months.",
    "Not having an executive to handle cybersecurity hurts the confidence of these companies, the report further said. Among firms with a Chief Security Officer, 70% were confident in the effectiveness of their strategies, while among those without one - 58% were confident.",
    "Finally, many respondents would love to see their organization spend a little more money on cybersecurity solutions, staff, and training.",
    "\u201cThe survey results support what we\u2019re seeing across the board: organizations prioritized their security efforts during Covid, but at the same time, they\u2019re acutely aware of how much more they need to do to effectively defend against cyber threats,\u201d said Aaron Boissonnault, Navisite CISO.",
    "\u201cThe data also points to an ongoing problem in the industry: a cybersecurity skills shortage that extends to the highest levels. Companies value and want cybersecurity leadership, but it is increasingly difficult to find and retain these individuals.\u201d"
