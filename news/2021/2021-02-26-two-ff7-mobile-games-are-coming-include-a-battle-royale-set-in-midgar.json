  "article": [
    "A surprise announcement followed Sony\u2019s February State of Play and the FF7 Remake Intergrade news: there are two Final Fantasy 7-themed mobile games coming for iOS and Android...one of which is a battle royale, while the other is an abridged retelling of the original game. If you want Final Fantasy 7 on your phone with modern graphics, it's coming.",
    "But first, yes, Square Enix finally made a a Final Fantasy battle royale. Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier is \u2018set in Midgar before the events of FFVII,\u2019 according to the game\u2019s description, and will be available worldwide sometime in 2021. The trailer shows players kitted in Soldier-like gear, firing guns and swinging swords at other players and classic FF baddies like Bombs and Ifrit.",
    "The second game, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, is a sort of pint-sized remake of FF7 that looks to abbreviate the game\u2019s plot into a series of highlights much Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition did. And like that adaptation, Ever Crisis will also feature cutesy versions of the FF7 cast (though they look more like they\u2019ve passed through a Kingdom Hearts filter) in the overworld, but in battle, character models look straight out of FF7 Remake.",
    "Oh, and Ever Crisis won\u2019t just tell the story of Final Fantasy VII \u2013 it\u2019s bundling in a compilation of moments from Advent Children, Before Crisis Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core, and Dirge of Cerberus. Sadly, you\u2019ll have to wait a bit to play: Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis is due out in 2022 for iOS and Android.",
    "The big news for Final Fantasy 7 Remake fans is, of course, DLC and PS5 news, which was the finale announcement of Sony's State of Play show.",
    "In summary, the DLC, called Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, adds more story starring everyone's favorite giant shuriken-wielding ninja, Yuffie, who's come to Midgar in an adorable moogle coat to apparently steal materia. We got highlights and not much else, including exact release date or price, but at least we know more of what it'll be about \u2013 and that it's coming this year.",
    "The DLC will be released alongside the PS5-enhanced version of FF7 Remake, and Sony showed off side-by-side footage of the game on PS4 and PS5. Not much has changed \u2013 the game still looks like it's using the same models \u2013 but reflective lighting and particle effects have improved, loading times are faster, and there will be a photo mode, Sony promised. And the upgrade? Free."
