    "Update: The latest PS5 restock at Walmart has now sold out. We're keeping an eye on all the latest console restock news in our guide on where to buy the PS5. Check in with that regularly for all the latest on the next console drop.",
    "Another PS5 restock is now live at Walmart, but once again this latest batch of consoles will only be available to Walmart+ members. Here's how to get yourself signed up and be ready to go for the drop on December 8.",
    "If you're not already a Walmart+ member, you can sign up for $12.95 per month. It might sound like a hefty price to pay when you aren't guaranteed to get a console, Walmart has been one of the best retailers to get a PS5 since they introduced this system.",
    "If you don't want to pay for a membership then there will likely be a general sale that goes live after this members-only window. However, based on previous restocks, the PS5 will almost certainly sell out before this even begins.",
    "That's been the case with practically every retailer that also makes use of these exclusivity windows from the ones we've been tracking in our where to buy the PS5 and where to buy the Xbox Series X guides.",
    "Once you've signed up - or if you're already a member - you can follow the links below once the PS5 restock begins.",
    "We would definitely suggest getting your membership sorted and having these pages open or bookmarked way ahead of schedule because it's always a chaotic rush once a PS5 restock goes live. Sites tend to struggle with the demand and you usually have only a matter of minutes to get a console in your basket and check out successfully. If all goes to plan, though, you should be the proud owner of a brand new PS5 console. Then it'll be time to take a look at some cheap PS5 games to go with it.",
    "This latest drop follows a pair of PS5 restocks held by Walmart over Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In recent months, the retailer has been the best place in the US to secure a PS5 console, though there has also been some availability at Amazon and GameStop.",
    "If this latest restock comes and goes and you aren't successful this time, do stick with us as we'll be following all the latest restock news leading up to Christmas and into 2022. You can also use the quick links below to check for stock at any time at all the top retailers."
