  "article": [
    "A Portuguese court has reportedly ordered Telegram to block access to more than a dozen piracy-related channels with millions of members in total.",
    "TorrentFreak shares that the Portuguese court was acting on a complaint filed by Visapress, which represents several newspaper and magazine publishers, and the Portuguese film industry association, GEDIPE.",
    "Although an encrypted instant messaging app, Telegram enables users to create channels using which they can send messages to all their members. It is this feature, together with Telegram\u2019s ability to host large files, that\u2019s regularly abused by pirates to share copyrighted content.",
    "Interestingly, while the court recognized that ordering a block may not be perfect, it argued that it's better than taking no action at all.",
    "Speaking to TorrentFreak, Carlos Eug\u00e9nio, Executive Director of Visapress, hailed the order as an important victory in the battle against online piracy, though he too acknowledged that the blocking measures can be circumvented.",
    "\u201cChanging the name of the groups and chats is a simple way that their administrators have to bypass the court order but Telegram knows this. In my opinion, this decision obliges them to remove or block access to these groups and chats,\u201d Eug\u00e9nio told TorrentFreak.",
    "Notably, the order was issued in the absence of Telegram, which couldn\u2019t be contacted through its Dubai address, despite help from the local embassy.",
    "While Telegram didn\u2019t get the opportunity to defend itself in court, Eug\u00e9nio hopes that the company will comply with the orders, else Visapress would have no choice, but to try and get Telegram blocked entirely.",
    "Meanwhile, if you are really concerned about privacy, you should consider using one of these best VPN or proxy services."
