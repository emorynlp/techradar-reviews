  "article": [
    "Candidly speaking, I don\u2019t really like the Marvel franchise \u2013 or more specifically, the films.",
    "That may border on blasphemy in some circles, but I sort of rue the day that Marvel\u2019s cast of characters leapt from the comic book pages and onto the big screen.",
    "To put things into perspective, I never made it to the end of 2014\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy film starring Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista, simply because I couldn\u2019t stand to watch it any longer.",
    "Imagine my face, then, when I attended a confidential pre-E3 2021 briefing, only for the grand reveal to be a Guardians of the Galaxy game... To say I was disappointed was an understatement.",
    "But here\u2019s the thing: despite my initial reservations (and underlying resentment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe clouding my judgment), I actually think that this original take on the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise could be right up my street \u2013 but I\u2019m only cautiously optimistic for now.",
    "Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Eidos Montreal and published by Square Enix. You play as Peter Quill, otherwise known as Star-Lord. He\u2019s the same devilishly handsome and happy-go-lucky guy that\u2019s depicted in the comics, and he\u2019s the leader of a rag-tag team known as the Guardians. It\u2019s your job to bring this band of misfits together and stop a chain of cataclysmic events from destroying the galaxy.",
    "At first glance, Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy looks a lot like Crystal Dynamic\u2019s Marvel\u2019s Avengers that was released last year, which may cause alarm bells to ring. Avengers was a multiplayer-focused action-RPG experience that wasn\u2019t particularly well-received by fans or critics, mostly due to its repetitive gameplay and focus on arbitrary grinding. Seeing signs of its DNA in Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy, then, is cause for concern.",
    "Just like Marvel\u2019s Avengers, the Guardians aren\u2019t modelled on their Hollywood counterparts \u2013 which is slightly jarring at first. However, the Guardians who will accompany you on this galactic adventure \u2013 Rocket Raccoon, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora and Groot \u2013 are all presented with a painstaking-level of detail that helps make the lack of recognizable faces easier to overcome. Rocket in particular looks extremely convincing, as talking raccoons go.",
    "While the Guardians looking like cosplayers is a minor complaint that I think is easy to overcome, the biggest worry I have is the game\u2019s combat. It looks uncomfortably close to the button mashing bore fest that was present in Marvel\u2019s Avengers, and I really hope that\u2019s not the case.",
    "I saw Star-Lord and co. unleash various powerful attacks as they fought against a variety of creatures and villains, taken from years of Galaxy of the Guardians history. You can also call upon your fellow Guardians to pull off spectacular and devastating moves, as they\u2019ll always be battling by your side.",
    "It was all very flashy and stylish, and fans of Star-Lord will certainly get a kick out of being able to use his elemental blasters and hover boots in combat, or when traversing the game\u2019s alien environments. But the admittedly brief footage I saw failed to convince me that the game\u2019s combat won\u2019t become overly repetitive after a few hours. Yes, you\u2019ll be able to gain experience points after each encounter, rack up style points, and the usual skill tree containing countless new abilities to unlock will be present \u2013 but it\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t seen before, and was one of the reasons so many grew tired of Marvel\u2019s Avengers shortly after launch.",
    "Thankfully, the game\u2019s story looks like it could be a real winner. Developer Eidos Montreal focused on delivering a single-player, narrative-driven experience, one that's influenced by your interactions with the other Guardians. You\u2019ll be challenged to make decisions that can have light-hearted consequences or haunting repercussions, and the game\u2019s dialog will react accordingly.",
    "For example, to activate a bridge on the other side of a chasm, Drax picks up Rocket with the intention of unceremoniously throwing him over. Before he does so, however, you\u2019re given the choice as to whether he should chuck your furry friend or not. In the clip I saw, the decision was made to throw Rocket, which led to him being furious at your actions. How this situation plays out if you chose not to throw Rocket remains to be seen.",
    "Another section of the game included choosing which Guardian should be offered as a \u201cprisoner\u201d and why, with the dialog branching into multiple options for you to select. Interestingly, this decision could be undone at a later point, but every encounter was refreshingly organic and seemed to have a tangible cause and effect.",
    "It\u2019s this side of the game that really appeals to me, as I found myself genuinely enjoying the banter of the Guardians, and was curious to see what the outcomes of future decisions could be. It should be noted, however, that the game\u2019s beginning and ending will play out the same way, which some may find slightly disappointing. Still, there will be plenty of shenanigans leading up to that point that you can shape how you see fit.",
    "The Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy game has a lot of promise, then, even for someone who openly dislikes most Marvel content. That in itself is a small win for the game, but I expect that those who are positively mad about Marvel will be far more enamoured than I when the game releases on October 26, 2021 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and PC."
