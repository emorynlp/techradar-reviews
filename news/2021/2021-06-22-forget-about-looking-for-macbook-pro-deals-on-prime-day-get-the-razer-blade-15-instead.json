    "You\u2019re scouring all the best Prime Day deals, and you\u2019ve been casting a gazing eye towards the MacBook Pro, hoping for a big discount. It\u2019s a nice laptop after all, but the best laptop deal isn\u2019t coming from Apple.",
    "The Razer Blade 15 base model has seen its price literally slashed for Amazon Prime Day 2021, with an absolutely incredible discount in the UK (unfortunately the U.S. deal has now expired). Sure, it\u2019s not a Mac, but it\u2019s a better purchase than a MacBook Pro anyway.",
    "Don\u2019t be fooled by the term 'base model' either. This is a serious gaming laptop with specs you won't normally find at this price. The Razer Blade 15 is one of the very best gaming laptops around, and this is an opportunity you simply can\u2019t miss. The deal is into its final day now, so if you're still on the fence, this is why you should buy one.",
    "(Not in the UK? Scroll down for the best Razer Blade 15 prices where you are).",
    "The Razer Blade 15 base model is the most affordable configuration but that doesn\u2019t mean Razer has cut corners on it. You still get a high refresh rate display of 120Hz, a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 6-core processor, an Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti 6GB dedicated GPU, a host of connectivity options and you can even upgrade the RAM. This deal is so hot it\u2019s actually on fire.",
    "When is there ever a truly exceptional deal on a MacBook Pro? Apple doesn\u2019t participate in big sales events traditionally, even somehow manipulating Black Friday so that the only \u2018discount\u2019 you get requires you to spend even more money in their store. So if you are hunting for a MacBook Pro deal, sorry, you just won\u2019t find one.",
    "Definitely not on this scale, at least.",
    "In the UK, this Razer Blade 15 deal brings this potent gaming laptop down to a price significantly below that of the MacBook Air even. And what a lot of laptop you\u2019re getting.",
    "The Razer Blade 15 is targeted at gamers, Razer makes no secret of that, and non-gamers have the more subtle Razer Book 13 at their disposal. But it isn\u2019t just gamers that get a great laptop out of the Razer Blade 15.",
    "In part, that\u2019s down to its design. Even today, many gaming laptops are quite large and bulky, whereas the Razer Blade 15 is a sleek, slim laptop that doesn\u2019t feel like a 15-incher. It\u2019s incredibly well balanced, not too heavy, and the keyboard is perfectly central since there\u2019s no number pad. After all...gamers don\u2019t really need those.",
    "Razer can also be compared to Apple in a number of ways when it comes to its laptop design. The design clearly matters, and even though you need to consider less glamorous things like cooling, Razer still manages to come out with an incredibly sophisticated design. All metal, slim, but still packing massive horsepower and the ability to get excess heat out of the way.",
    "This all makes the Razer Blade 15 an attractive buy for creators as well, or any professional looking for strong CPU performance and the ability to accelerate workflows with a dedicated GPU. Streamers will also love the NVENC capabilities of the GTX 1660 Ti, as it comes with the same encoding chip as the more expensive RTX GPUs.",
    "Simply put, if you want a new, powerful laptop, don\u2019t waste time looking for MacBook Pro deals. Get the Razer Blade 15 instead.",
    "No matter where you live, you'll find all the lowest prices for the Razer Blade 15 from around the web right here, with offers available in your region."
