    "When looking to steal data, cybercrime groups rarely care about the organization\u2019s size, and as time goes by, the cost of these data breaches only rises. However, while large enterprises may survive the financial fallout of a major data breach, that can\u2019t be said for most small and medium-sized businesses (SMB).",
    "A new report from cybersecurity experts Acronis claims the average cost of a data breach is now roughly $3.56 million. At the same time, the average ransomware payment rose by a third (33%), to more than $100,000.",
    "Regardless of company size, a data breach is a major financial hit, but for most SMB\u2019s, Acronis says, it would \u201csound the death-knell\u201d. To make matters worse, SMBs don\u2019t have the resources to tackle the threat in-house, so they\u2019re forced to turn towards service providers. And when those service providers are compromised, it\u2019s checkmate for SMBs.",
    "\u201cUnlike larger corporations, small and medium-sized companies don\u2019t have the money, resources, or staffing expertise needed to counter today\u2019s threats,\u201d explains Candid W\u00fcest, Acronis VP of Cyber Protection Research. \u201cThat\u2019s why they turn to IT service providers \u2013 but if those service providers are compromised, those SMBs are at the mercy of the attackers.\u201d",
    "To stay secure, Acronis says, SMBs need to pay close attention to their employees. Phishing is rampant, and the number of these types of malicious emails rose 62% from Q1 to Q2. With many employees today working remotely, away from the relative protection of the corporate network and the IT team, they\u2019ve become a prime target for many criminals.",
    "SMBs should educate their workforce on the dangers of phishing and social engineering, and make sure their employees verify the email sender\u2019s identity before clicking on any links in the email, or downloading any type of attachments."
