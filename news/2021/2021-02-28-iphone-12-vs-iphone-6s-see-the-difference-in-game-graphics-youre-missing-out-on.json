    "The iPhone 12 Pro is undoubtedly the most powerful phone Apple has ever released, and on sheer digital muscle, it ranks at the top of benchmarks in our testing. But what does that mean for gaming? We chatted with a handful of devs about how their upcoming high-profile games will play on an iPhone 12 \u2013 and what you might miss out on if you don\u2019t upgrade.",
    "Broadly speaking, iPhones get better and better internals every year, with better specs powering better graphics. Playing the newest games on older phones means you\u2019ll miss out on effects that add graphical polish, like advanced lighting, depth of field, and environmental touches like clouds or shadows. Gaming on new phones means a superior visual experience, and these days, mobile game graphics aren\u2019t too far behind consoles.",
    "When it comes to older and lower-spec phones, developers prioritize something other than graphical flourishes. To preserve playability, they strive for a consistent framerate, explains Ethan Young, development director of Realm of Champions, which launched in December 2020. A spinoff of Kabam\u2019s previous hit one-on-one fighting mobile game Marvel Contest of Champions, the new Realm of Champions has players team up with two other gamers in 3-on-3 arena fights.",
    "\u201cWe always prioritize a stable frame rate in order to level the playing field and keep our games running smoothly on all tiers of devices,\u201d Young told TechRadar. \u201cTo accomplish this, we built a rendering system with scalable quality levels for our shaders, lighting, shadows, post-effects, and more. This system allows our games to look great on all supported devices, and really shine on the newest models.\u201d",
    "The game analyzes which device you\u2019re using and uses a priority system to rank which effects are most important to show, Young explained. The scalable quality levels are driven by a device\u2019s GPU, as well as frame rate data collected and monitored over time, and the game serves up the best graphics possible \u2013 even on an older iPhone.",
    "\u201cDevices are tuned in such a way that no matter how new or old they are, they will receive the best possible visuals while maintaining a stable frame rate,\u201d Young assured.",
    "We put these claims into action, but given most of these games haven\u2019t come out yet. Of the games in this article, we were only able to test Marvel Realm of Champions across multiple devices. We pitted an iPhone 12 Pro against an iPhone 6S and observed the differences \u2013 which weren\u2019t as huge as you\u2019d think.",
    "Kabam\u2019s claim about maintaining stable frame rates held up: while playing the game in identical conditions (home WiFi), it ran seamlessly on both the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 6S. Despite tons of effects going off at once, which didn\u2019t seem to be more prevalent on the newer and more powerful iPhone, the game was responsive on both phones and didn\u2019t suffer any slowdown \u2013 which is key in a real-time arena combat game.",
    "The big difference lies in the graphics \u2013 and while the iPhone 6S is no slouch here, it does show lower-resolution character models and maps, which are especially clear in side-by-side images. You\u2019ll notice in these end-of-match screens that the characters in the first image (of the 6S) is noticeably grainier, while the second (iPhone 12 Pro) are much smoother \u2013 and other effects, like depth of field blurring the background, are present.",
    "(In the comparison photos below, remember that the iPhone 6S has chunky top and bottom bezels with a big home button, while the iPhone 12 Pro has an edge-to-edge display. All photo galleries show the iPhone 6S first, then the iPhone 12 Pro.)",
    "This graphical divide extends throughout the game, with the iPhone 12 Pro having overall smoother character models, richer colors, and vivid environmental effects. Some of this is for obvious reasons (the 12 Pro\u2019s newer A14 Bionic chipset vs. the 6S\u2019s A9 chipset), but also due to differences between the new iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s higher-resolution (2532 x 1170) 6.1-inch OLED display with HDR10 vs. the iPhone 6S\u2019s lower-resolution (1334 x 750) 4.7-inch IPS LCD display.",
    "Suffice to say that the additional screen real estate in the newer iPhone 12 Pro also makes it a bit easier to see what\u2019s going on as your thumbs will be less in the way of the action, and thus a superior gaming experience. That extra screen area didn\u2019t exactly mean we played better, of course, but it\u2019s certainly more enjoyable to play.",
    "How else did the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s better specs help? Noticeably lower load times: in a side by side comparison, the iPhone 6S took 2-3 seconds longer to load into matches. Again, you\u2019d only catch this if you set up both phones at the starting line and have them launch into games at the same time, but for every normal person who won\u2019t have these extreme ends of the current iPhone lineup handy to test, it\u2019s nice to know what upgrading gets you.",
    "It makes sense that developers would prioritize framerate for smooth gameplay, but it takes on even greater importance when player performance depends on it in competitive matches. And nothing is expected to be more competitive than the upcoming League of Legends: Wild Rift mobile game, which takes the popular mobile battle arena (MOBA) and shrinks it down to be playable on smartphones.",
    "It does need to be playable on a range of iPhones, too \u2013 and most importantly, retain a consistent framerate, explains Riot Games\u2019 Trent Campbell, Principal Technical Project Manager on Wild Rift. (Currently, the game is in open beta in several Southeast Asian and other countries, and is coming to the Americas in March. It's had open play on Android phones and limited tests on iOS devices.)",
    "\u201cOn devices like the iPhone 6S (our minimum spec on iOS), our data shows a consistent framerate of near 30fps, and players have the option to change graphic quality settings to match their needs,\u201d Campbell stated in an emailed reply to TechRadar\u2019s questions. \u201cWe think the game still looks and feels great at the lowest graphics setting!\u201d",
    "Riot Games has experience making games run on low-specced devices: the joke goes that its mainstay title, League of Legends, could run on a toaster. Its wide compatibility with lower-performance computers has contributed to its popularity as arguably the leading esport around the world. Making it easier for the game\u2019s mobile version, which is slowly rolling out in beta around the world (live in Southeast Asian countries, coming to the Americas in March), has been a priority, Campbell noted.",
    "\u201cWe want to ensure players have a good experience playing Wild Rift on all supported devices, and we think it\u2019s super important for Wild Rift to support a very wide range of them,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cFor players using high-end devices like the iPhone 12, we want to wow them with incredible visuals and animations, but also ensure that the game is as accessible as it can be for those that don\u2019t have access to high-end phones.\u201d",
    "Shortly after Wild Rift launched in beta, the team working on it posted expected minimum specs to play - including, yes, the iPhone 6S as the oldest iPhone capable of running the game. This shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given that\u2019s the threshold for devices that will run iOS 14, the latest version of the operating system.",
    "Unlike Android phones that vary in hardware performance, iPhones have universally gotten more powerful with each generation, with the latest iPhone 12 lineup\u2019s A14 Bionic chipsets outperforming any previous model. But the aging older models are still capable of running the newest games - though they\u2019ll generally analyze and automatically set the graphics level according to the phone\u2019s limits.",
    "Even non-competitive games use this kind of auto-analysis \u2013 like the upcoming Crash Bandicoot: On The Run!, a Temple Run-style game built in the famous franchise\u2019s world by King Games, best known for the Candy Crush mobile games.",
    "\u201cThe way we do it is to automatically detect a quality level based on a database where we have relative performance differences between the devices,\u201d Robert Woodburn, senior producer at King Games, told TechRadar over email. \u201cWith this data we can slot each device into a quality level slot: Ultra Low, Low, Medium and High. Knowing what quality level a device has makes it possible to tweak the graphics settings and change shaders.\u201d",
    "This database is key to setting graphical levels: should Apple release a less powerful iPhone, its specs will be compared with readings on the database and graphics set accordingly - hence why an older iPhone running Crash Bandicoot won\u2019t have the same graphics as an iPhone 12 Pro running the upcoming game.",
    "\u201cThe users on an iPhone 6 will not have the same graphical fidelity in terms of image resolution, shader quality, texture quality, lod distance,\u201d Woodburn said. \u201cThe main goal has been to make the game playable at all supported phones while still enjoying a Crash experience.\u201d",
    "What this ultimately means is that the potential for mobile gaming may be restricted by requiring games to support the lowest spec, but that minimum is so low \u2013 reaching back six years to the iPhone 6S, in these cases \u2013 that it\u2019s accessible to many more users. Around 90% of iPhone users have a 6S or newer, according to a DeviceAtlas survey circa December 2020, and all will be able to play some form of the games above \u2013 they just won\u2019t be as easy on the eyes as playing on a new iPhone 12."
