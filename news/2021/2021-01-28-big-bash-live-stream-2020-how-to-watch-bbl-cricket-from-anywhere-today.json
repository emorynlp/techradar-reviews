    "A number of changes have been introduced for the Big Bash 2020/21 season with a view to maximising viewer interest in this year's T20 cricket competition.",
    "What is a Power Surge in Big Bash cricket? The first new feature to the current BBL season is called 'Power Surge' - a two-over period when the fielding team are only allowed to play two outfield players. The side batting can instigate this from the 11th over of their innings - and means that the traditional Powerplay at the beginning of an innings has been reduced to four overs.",
    "What is an X-factor in Big Bash cricket? The 'X-factor player' is another new addition to BBL cricket and is essentially a substitute - the 12th or 13th player named to the side's team sheet - that can be brought into the game from the 10th over. They can replace any player who has yet to bat, or has bowled more than one over.",
    "What is Bash Boost in BBL cricket? This one's a bit more nuanced. A 'Bash Boost' is a bonus point that can be awarded to either team halfway through the second innings of a BBL match - either to to the chasing team if they're scoring better than the 10-over mark set by their opponents, or the fielding side if they're not. Crucially, teams will now be awarded three points for winning a match, compared to two in previous Big Bash seasons."
