    "Google is known for hidden Easter egg games throughout the years, such as Pac-Man, Atari Breakout and even a DVD screensaver, however a new one has appeared, in the form of pinball.",
    "There was a time that a pinball game on Windows XP was the highlight of using the operating system to some, trying to beat the high score or just seeing what else could be done with the game. While there\u2019s still others who want a remake of this for Windows 11, Google has seemingly filled this void for now.",
    "Accessible only through the Google app on iPhone, it\u2019s a great little timewaster that almost has us clamoring for a full version of it.",
    "But as other Easter egg games go, this one can be a bit more challenging to find, as it\u2019s not activated through a simple search phrase or a combination of buttons.",
    "Unlike other Easter eggs from Google, this one requires a bit more effort than usual. You need to make sure that the app is updated to the latest version from the App Store first, then navigate to Tabs.",
    "You\u2019ll start to see some shapes appear from the bottom, and once you do, swipe up from the bottom. These shapes will then form as flippers, and by pressing either the left or right side of the screen, you will find yourself in a pinball game, trying to hit certain shapes to achieve a high score.",
    "It\u2019s oddly addictive, especially when you\u2019re trying to beat a high score. It\u2019s only available on iPhone running iOS 13 and above, and not iPad (we tried), but it\u2019s a great little game to play while you\u2019re in a queue or you just have some time to kill."
