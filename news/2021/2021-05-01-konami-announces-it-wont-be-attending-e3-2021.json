    "Konami, the publisher behind gaming franchises like Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, has announced that it will not be attending E3 2021.",
    "This may come as something of a surprise, given Konami was among the publishers listed as early commitments to attend the show back when it was confirmed in March 2021.",
    "However, in a tweet from its official account, Konami explains that \u201cdue to timing we will not be ready to present at E3 this year.\u201d That\u2019s not to say, though, that Konami doesn\u2019t have things in the pipeline. The publisher\u2019s statement goes on to say that it\u2019s \u201cin deep development on a number of key projects\u201d and fans should expect updates on these \u201cin the coming months\u201d.",
    "Konami also expresses \u201crespect for the ESA\u201d in its statement and a promise of continued support. The ESA for its part released a statement (via GamesRadar) in which it states its support for Konami\u2019s decision to miss out E3 2021, adding its excitement \u201cto see what they\u2019ll be announcing in the future when they\u2019re ready to do so. We can\u2019t wait for their return to E3 2022, but in the meantime, we look forward to sharing all of the highly-anticipated reveals, programming and so much more at this year\u2019s E3.\u201d",
    "This means, then, that those looking forward to E3 this year shouldn\u2019t expect anything about those long-rumored Silent Hill games at the show. That said, the promise of \u201ca number of key projects\u201d being in development is promising and is sure to create plenty of excited speculation.",
    "Konami isn\u2019t the only publisher that\u2019s sitting out E3 2021\u2014Sony has already confirmed that it won\u2019t be in attendance. But this year\u2019s all-digital show does still have good backing, with Nintendo, Xbox, Ubisoft, Take-Two, Square Enix and more on the list of confirmed attendees that are sure to have big things to share.",
    "After being cancelled in 2020, E3 is going completely online for 2021. Taking place between June 12 and June 15, it\u2019s going to offer a mix of streamed press conferences with announcements from publishers alongside a four-day broadcast with commentary and interviews.",
    "We\u2019re still waiting for a solid lineup for E3 2021\u2019s press conferences, with only Ubisoft so far confirming that its Ubisoft Forward stream will take place on June 12. We\u2019re sure that with the event drawing closer, it won\u2019t be long before there are more dates and times to put in the calendar."
