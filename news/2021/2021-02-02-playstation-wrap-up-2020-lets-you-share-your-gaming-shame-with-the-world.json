    "Sony\u2019s PlayStation Wrap Up is back to remind us all that 2020 was a fantastic year for gaming \u2013 not just because of the stellar lineup of titles that came out on PS4 and the landmark release of the PS5, but honestly... there wasn\u2019t much else we could do thanks to Covid-19.",
    "If you\u2019ve ever wondered how many hours you\u2019ve sunk into Call of Duty: Warzone or Demon\u2019s Souls then, it\u2019s time to face some hard numbers. You\u2019ll be able to see how many games you played, the amount of trophies you unlocked, and which titles you spent the most time with \u2013 you\u2019ll even be congratulated if you bought a PS5, as cruel as that may be for some. (If you\u2019re having trouble finding Sony\u2019s new console, we\u2019re doing our best to help you buy a PS5.)",
    "The PlayStation Wrap Up site also includes some collective stats achieved by PlayStation users in 2020, such as how many enemies collapsed in fear of Ghost of Tsushima (hint: it\u2019s a lot). You\u2019ll also see how much time gamers spent on The Last of Us 2, and the amount of home runs that were scored in MLB: The Show 20.",
    "Of course, half the fun of these wrap ups is sharing your personal stats with your friends and the world, no matter how embarrassing they may be. And if you\u2019re proud that you spent 40 hours playing Knack, go for it \u2013 who are we to judge?",
    "If you take part in the PlayStation Wrap Up, you\u2019ll be able to grab a free dynamic PS4 theme so there\u2019s an extra incentive to give it a go. You\u2019ll need to have a registered PSN account, be 18 years or older, and have played on a PS4 for at least 10 hours during 2020 to see any stats, though.",
    "It's likely that next year's PlayStation Wrap Up will be dominated by new PS5 games, and with Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Horizon: Forbidden West and God of War: Ragnarok on the horizon, there's a lot to look forward to."
