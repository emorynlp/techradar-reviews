  "article": [
    "Counting your steps is so\u2026 pre-pandemic. Can that band on your wrist measure your heart rate? Can it monitor your blood pressure? Does it detect early symptoms of Covid-19? Today\u2019s latest and greatest fitness wearables can already do some of that, but even they\u2019re but a tiny taste of the data-driven complexities of your next fitness wearable.",
    "Here\u2019s why we\u2019re entering a brave new world for wearables \u2013 and what you can expect to be strapping to your body in the years to come.",
    "The last year has seen many of us take our fitness into our own hands and into our own homes. We\u2019re working from home and we\u2019re working out at home.",
    "Not surprisingly we\u2019re buying more fitness wearables and we\u2019re demanding more from them. \u201cWellbeing, fitness and activity tracking became a priority for many,\u201d says Leo Gebbie, Senior Analyst for Wearables and XR at CCS Insight, about the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "\u201cExercise and activity regimes moved from gyms to outdoor spaces, making a smartwatch or a fitness band that tracks steps, distance, heart rate and other activity metrics more attractive than ever for lots of people.\u201d",
    "If you want to know what\u2019s coming next to fitness wearables, just look at the smartwatch market. \u201cFitness trackers tend to see their feature set roll down from more advanced smartwatches,\u201d says Gebbie. \u201cThe advanced health-tracking features on some of today\u2019s top-end smartwatches may trickle down to fitness trackers in time.\u201d",
    "However, even smartwatch-makers are having to up their game. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer enough to provide the basics,\u201d says Teg Dosanjh, Director of Connected Services and Technology at Samsung Electronics. \u201cThe last two years have seen an increase in the importance of functions and metrics \u2026 fitness enthusiasts expect products to incorporate blood pressure monitoring or electrocardiogram (ECG).\u201d",
    "GPS and heart rate monitoring might be today\u2019s must-have features, but tomorrow\u2019s include ECG measurements, which are found on the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and Fitbit Sense. We\u2019re talking about serious health tracking here that can detect medical conditions and sleep problems you don\u2019t even know you have.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve advanced from simply counting steps to bringing health information once only available from a lab or clinical environment \u2013 like heart rate and sleep tracking \u2013 directly to consumers\u2019 wrists,\u201d says Dr Conor Heneghan, Lead Research Scientist at Fitbit. That\u2019s the first step in fitness trackers detecting medical conditions and then helping manage those conditions.",
    "Dr Heneghan says Fitbit is making progress in the areas of sleep apnea and AFib, two of the most common health conditions worldwide, while recently published findings from its COVID-19 study suggest its devices have the potential to identify signs of illness before you show symptoms.",
    "\u201cAs we all take a greater interest in our health the idea of illness detection will be even more in the spotlight,\u201d says Dr Heneghan. \u201cWe believe that wearables can help bridge the gap between visits to the doctor, and facilitate conversations between patients and their doctor.\u201d",
    "The trouble with fitness wearables and smartwatches is that, for now, they\u2019re as much about fashion as health monitoring. Cue Apple Watch\u2019s limiting 48-hour battery life. That\u2019s all going to change.",
    "\u201cThe next generation of trackers will see a dialling-up on the technical side, so losing the always-on screens and the bright displays to really double-down on things like blood glucose, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pain management and medication dosage,\u201d says Nicholas Kelly, co-founder of care group Axela, whose cAIR:ID app brings together medical records and data from fitness trackers to predict mini-strokes.",
    "He expects to soon see more focused monitoring from medical-grade devices that collect data on all the vital signs a hospital would gather from a patient \u2013 but in the community.",
    "Some think that personalized, data-driven medicine is the future of healthcare \u2013 and that it\u2019s going to be driven by next-gen fitness wearables that passively monitor a person\u2019s heart rate and blood oxygen levels, for example. The goal is a future where health is about monitoring, prevention and early intervention rather than fixing health problems.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to track changes over time, relative to an individual, rather than at a point in time relative to a population,\u201d says Harry Briggs, Managing Partner at OMERS Ventures, which has made investments in health tech companies. \u201cWe may even be able to understand root causes and give people positive feedback loops around the kinds of lifestyle choices that work best for their individual health.\u201d",
    "It could also mean that if and when you end up in hospital with a health issue your doctor can easily access long-term data on your vital signs.",
    "What to do with all that big data? Add a dollop of artificial intelligence (AI), of course. So get ready for data-driven decisions around when and what to eat, how long to sleep and when to workout.",
    "\u201cIn the same way that Netflix learns what TV shows users like and then makes recommendations, consumers increasingly expect experiential work-outs, personalisation, and smart recommendations,\u201d says Jean-Michel Fournier, CEO Les Mills Media. He thinks that AI will play a key role in democratising fitness for the global good.",
    "\u201cHealthier, fitter populations are just better for the planet, from the transport choices they make, to the food they consume, to the money they save on healthcare budgets \u2013 and AI will be at the centre of this transformation.\u201d",
    "Algorithms that tell you what food to eat \u2013 also known as \u2018nutrient loss\u2019 and \u2018recovery tracking\u2019 are the next big thing in fitness wearables. Some devices already tell users how long it will take for their body to fully recover from their latest workout.",
    "An effort to offer the kind of insight only a blood test could comes from nutrient-loss algorithm app Fuelbetter, which picks up data collected by fitness wearables. \u201cOur algorithms provide high-resolution quantification of the nutrients lost during your workouts and they were developed using real-world and experimental data from athletes and non-athletes,\u201d says Dr Douglas McCabe, founder and CEO of Fuelbetter.",
    "\u201cIt also knows the deep nutritional content of every food on the planet.\u201d Fuelbetter detects when you are deficient in a nutrient and what exactly you should eat or drink to fix that by reverse-engineering recipes and back-of-pack information.",
    "Why wear a fitness band or smartwatch when your \u2018smart\u2019 running gear could do their job? Juniper Research predicts that \u2018smart clothing\u2019 will contribute over $11 billion to the fitness wearables market by 2025.",
    "Cue Apple, which has a patent for \u2018smart fabric buttons' that could be used to connect devices, but also clothing. Not to be outdone, Google\u2019s Project Jacquard uses conductive yarns, sensors and 'buttons' to connect clothing to a phone.",
    "Published in Nature last month is a new flexible, breathable and durable electronic textile that weaves conductive fibers and luminescent fibres together with cotton to create a fabric display.",
    "\u201cWe are trying to integrate other electronic devices with the display textile [\u2026] it\u2019s particularly promising for wearable devices,\u201d says Professor Huisheng Peng at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University and a co-author of the paper. \u201cI believe there will be a huge market for these new technologies.\u201d",
    "Others aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cThe concept of smart fabrics and intelligent clothing has floated around the wearables arena for some time,\u201d says Gebbie. \u201cBut these garments have largely failed to move beyond niche offerings because of high prices, limited use cases, or both.\u201d",
    "There\u2019s now an army of fitness wearables, from \u2018traditional\u2019 smart bands and smartwatches to shoes that gather biometric data as you run. How could everything link-up to provide a holistic real-world view of your health in real-time across all platforms and apps? The answer, of course, is 5G. We\u2019re talking speeds 100 times that of 4G and near-instant network latency. And that means instantly-available personalised recommendations in real-time and as many augmented reality experiences you can think of.",
    "Fitness wearables can easily be dismissed as a passing fad, but with more sensors, more meaningful data and more AI they have the potential to change the health of billions of people.",
    "Not bad for a rubber band that used to count steps."
