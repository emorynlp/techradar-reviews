    "The 25th anniversary of Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s first appearance on the GameBoy is coming up soon, on February 27th \u2013 and rumor has it that remakes of the Gen IV Diamond and Pearl games could be announced.",
    "The rumor comes courtesy of Spanish fan site Centro Pok\u00e9mon, with the key information roughly translating to the below (thanks, NintendoLife).",
    "\"Centro Pok\u00e9mon can confirm that, according to sources close to the company, remakes of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Pearl, originally released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS, are in development for the Nintendo Switch.\"",
    "Diamond and Pearl were the first generation of Pok\u00e9mon games made for Nintendo DS, taking the Pok\u00e9mon formula to the region of Sinnoh, where Team Galactic are up to nefarious sci-fi deeds. It features some of this writer\u2019s most beloved Pok\u00e9mon creations, such as the grass/ice heavyweight Abomasnow, but the rumor is largely interesting because of what it doesn\u2019t include.",
    "Nintendo is largely expected to release another iteration of its Let\u2019s Go Pikachu and Eevee titles on Switch, taking place in the Gen II region of Johto. It would be surprising to see the publisher skip remakes of Gen II and Gen III, though it\u2019s worth noting that the Gold/Silver and Ruby/Sapphire games did all get remakes for the Nintendo 3DS, making Diamond/Pearl the oldest mainline Pok\u00e9mon games to have gone without a revisit so far.",
    "Even more notable is that the rumor suggests these remakes won\u2019t be in the Let\u2019s Go format, meaning we could get a brand new style or something closer to the original releases \u2013 a boon for those after more serious mainline releases than the accessible Let\u2019s Go versions.",
    "While the announcement is expected during a February Pok\u00e9mon Direct, it\u2019s likely the games wouldn\u2019t release until late 2021.",
    "Nintendo certainly has a lot of celebration going on: 2020 saw the 35th anniversary of the Super Mario games, with a 3D All Stars collection of old titles, revamped red-and-blue console, and even a battle royale game made to commemorate the occasion.",
    "It's pretty certain that Nintendo will have something planned for Pok\u00e9mon's anniversary, though the exact details won't be firm until we hear it from Nintendo itself.",
    "With The Legend of Zelda series also turning 35 this year, you can be sure something will be in the works there too \u2013 Breath of the Wild 2, perhaps?"
