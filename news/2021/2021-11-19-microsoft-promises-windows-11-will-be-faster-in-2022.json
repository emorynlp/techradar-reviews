  "article": [
    "Windows 11 has core elements of the desktop interface which are performing disappointingly sluggishly for some users, with Microsoft working on fixes for well-documented issues with File Explorer \u2013 and the software giant further promising that it\u2019ll concentrate on improving performance levels in the OS next year.",
    "In a Reddit AMA (\u2018Ask Me Anything\u2019, meaning a Q&A session) with the Windows Developer team, spotted by Windows Latest, one user commented on a trend towards UI sluggishness continued in Windows 11, to which the Microsoft team responded: \u201cPerformance will be an area of focus for us in 2022,\u201d including having UI elements rendering on the screen faster.",
    "The questioner carried on to clarify their main bugbears with poor performance in Windows 11 (and with Windows 10, too), with the central issues being around File Explorer as already mentioned, and the sluggish right click menu which \u201cactually made me go back to [Windows] 10 on my home machines.\u201d",
    "Microsoft replied: \u201cSome of what you mentioned is performance dictated by WinUI, but also some is likely unrelated to anything our team does but still important/valid feedback for Windows as a whole. Internally, in addition to wanting to focus some of our UX framework\u2019s time on [performance] in 2022, we also have a dedicated team formed recently to tackle this topic more holistically.\u201d",
    "Incidentally, those who are suffering any kind of gremlins with Microsoft\u2019s new OS might find it useful to check out our extensive guide on Windows 11 problems and how to fix the most common issues.",
    "Clearly, then, this is an issue Microsoft is taking seriously \u2013 as it should be. Anything which makes Windows 11 feel less than responsive when tackling basic tasks like going into folders and browsing through files, or invoking the right click menu, is really not good, and is bound to leave a sour taste in the mouth of users who have upgraded to what (obviously) should be a superior OS.",
    "Going back to Windows 10 because of the performance of the right click menu, as mentioned by the above complainant, really isn\u2019t something that should be happening at all, ever; so this is pretty embarrassing for Microsoft.",
    "While it\u2019s good to hear that performance will be a priority next year, and it\u2019s also laudable that Microsoft is being upfront about what\u2019s going on here, we \u2013 and doubtless others \u2013 are left wondering exactly how the release version of an OS got shipped with these kind of basic UI issues affecting some users or hardware configurations (particularly lower-end machines, as you might expect)."
