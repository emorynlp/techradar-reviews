    "The same day the Samsung Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G and A72 were revealed at a Samsung Unpacked event, a leaked \u2018mini-roadmap\u2019 alleges that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will launch at a similar event in August.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE (Fan Edition) is the rumored follow-up to last year\u2019s Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, which was a more affordable version of that year\u2019s flagship phones released later in the year \u2013 in October 2020.",
    "But according to this \u2018mini-roadmap,\u2019 which was publicized by noted leaker Evan Blass in a Voice post, means we\u2019d be seeing the S21 FE a lot earlier in the year than its predecessor.",
    "Why would the S21 FE\u2019s release window be moved up several months? Possibly because Samsung\u2019s CEO heavily implied that the next Samsung Galaxy Note 21 will be delayed until 2022, leaving a gap in the company\u2019s launch lineup. Since Note phones typically drop in August, Blass\u2019s roadmap suggests the Samsung S21 FE will replace it \u2013 on August 19, if the leak is accurate.",
    "Blass\u2019s mini-roadmap offered potential release dates for other products launching this year. Most notably, it predicts an Unpacked event dedicated to PCs, which likely refer to more Chrome-powered Galaxy Chromebooks and/or Windows-running Galaxy Book laptops, will happen on April 14.",
    "The roadmap also anticipates an affordable Galaxy Tab S7 Lite launch at some point in June, along with a follow-up to the cheaper Samsung Galaxy A21 phones \u2013 the Galaxy A22 and Galaxy A22 5G \u2013 in July.",
    "Finally, Blass claimed that another phone that wasn\u2019t on the roadmap is also slated to come out this year: the Samsung Galaxy A82 5G, a follow-up to the 2019 Galaxy A80 phone that used the same cameras for rear and front-facing shots with an ingenious flip-system. We\u2019ve heard rumors this is coming, so it\u2019s nice to hear support for it.",
