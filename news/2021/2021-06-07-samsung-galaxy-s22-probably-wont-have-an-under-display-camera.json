    "Not so long ago it was rumored that the Samsung Galaxy S22 would have an under-display camera, but now another source is claiming it\u2019s not to be, and for some good reasons.",
    "In a blog post on Naver (a South Korean site), a source claims that the production yield is currently too low to build enough units for a phone as popular as the Samsung Galaxy S22 is sure to be. On top of that, the image quality apparently doesn\u2019t meet Samsung\u2019s standards, and the camera itself is apparently still slightly visible under the screen.",
    "None of this is surprising. The ZTE Axon 20 5G included the first under-display smartphone camera, and that was both slightly visible and uninspiring in terms of photo quality. So it makes sense that Samsung would wait until these problems are solved before equipping its main flagships with such a snapper.",
    "The source appears to additionally say that \u2013 as has long been rumored \u2013 the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 will launch this year with an under-display camera. We say \u2018appears to\u2019 because this is via slightly clunky machine translation.",
    "Still, we\u2019d expect that phone to have this snapper, as beyond it having been repeatedly rumored, given that the Z Fold 3 will probably have a secondary selfie camera, the quality concerns are less significant. It's also sure to sell a lot less than the Galaxy S22 range, so the limited production yield is less likely to be a problem.",
    "Apparently the first perfected under-display camera (with ideal photo quality and no visible lens) is now planned for the second half of 2022 at the earliest, with next year\u2019s Samsung Galaxy Note model (if there is such a phone) being a likely candidate for it.",
    "As ever with leaks we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt, but these claims sound convincing, especially as a recent leak from @UniverseIce (a leaker with a solid track record) supports the idea that Samsung\u2019s under-display camera hasn\u2019t been perfected just yet, with a mosaic-like effect apparently visible where the lens sits under the Z Fold 3\u2019s display.",
