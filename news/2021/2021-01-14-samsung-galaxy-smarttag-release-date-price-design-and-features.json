  "article": [
    "The Samsung Galaxy SmartTags product tracker was unveiled alongside the Galaxy S21 phones at Samsung's January 2021 Unpacked event. They're Tile-like location trackers that can help you find lost possessions and devices.",
    "You can attach one of these to a phone or pair of keys, slip them in your purse or wallet, or even attach one to a coat, or a teddy that your child is prone to dropping or leaving, and use the Samsung SmartThings Find app to locate them using your phone.",
    "There are also SmartTags Plus, with extra features \u2013 you can find out what differentiates the models below.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy SmartTags go on sale on January 29, alongside the Galaxy S21. The SmartTags Plus will follow at a later date, which is yet to be confirmed by Samsung.",
    "If you pre-order one of the new Galaxy S21 phones in many regions you'll get at least one SmartTag thrown in, and maybe more \u2013 Samsung hasn't been clear on that so far.",
    "The Samsung SmartTag price is $29 / \u00a329 per tag \u2013 pricing for other regions is yet to be confirmed. That's pretty steep \u2013 it's more than Tile's trackers, and a lot more than some generic trackers you can find online. In the US you can buy a pack of two tags for $49.99, or a four-pack for $84.99 \u2013 bundle pricing for other regions is also tbc. The Samsung Galaxy SmartTags are listed now on Samsung's US and UK websites, but there's no mention of them yet on its Australian site, although the Galaxy S21 phones and Galaxy Buds Pro and S21 phones are listed. That suggests the SmartTags will be launched later in Australia, assuming they're launched there at all. At time of writing you can pre-order the single SmartTags in black or oatmeal in the US and UK, but other colors will be available later, including teal and pink, and multi-packs. Samsung also showed off some branded versions, including one with Bart Simpson's face on it.",
    "Samsung confirmed single, two- and four-packs of SmartTags in the US, while in the UK it seems they'll only be available in single and two-packs, though at time of writing only individual tags can be pre-ordered.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag is a small rectangle, made of plastic, with a hole that you can use to slot it onto keys, your pet's collar, or other suitable attachments.",
    "The SmartTags work in conjunction with the Samsung's SmartThings Find app, which currently lets you track the location of your Samsung smartphone and other devices. You'll now be able to use the app to track your SmartTags as well.",
    "The Tags send Bluetooth signals to nearby Samsung devices, whether they're yours or other people's, which then gives you a location depending on your proximity to the device. The SmartTags have a replaceable coin battery that Samsung says will last 'months'.",
    "This even works when the tag is offline or out of range, and you can find a history of the tag's locations too.",
    "The SmartTags also have a button on them, and you can assign this a smart-home function. For example, you can map it so pressing the button turns on your home lights, or boots the TV up, for example.",
    "What do the SmartTags Plus do that the standard ones don't? Well, the SmartTags Plus use UWB (ultra wide-band) tech for spatial and directional tracking, so you can use get more accurate locational data, and also use the AR Finder on your phone to hunt down the tags.",
    "The SmartTag Plus is priced at $39.99, or $64.99 for a pair \u2013 pricing for other regions is yet to be confirmed \u2013 and will be available in blue, grey and oatmeal."
