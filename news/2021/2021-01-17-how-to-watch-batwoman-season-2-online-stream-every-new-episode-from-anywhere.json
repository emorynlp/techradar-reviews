    "While the first season followed Kate Kane, Bruce Wayne\u2019s cousin as the justice-serving superhero, actress Ruby Rose's shock departure means something of a major overhaul for the show.",
    "Instead of recasting the character, the season premiere instead sees Kate go missing and explores the subsequent fall out among her allies, before tech support team Luke Fox (Camrus Johson) and Mary Hamilton (Nicole Kang) eventually turn to another hero-in-waiting to take up the Batwoman mantle.",
    "Taking over the cowl is Ryan - a street smart, ex-con who is living out of a van after serving time for a crime she didn't commit.",
    "Leslie certainly sounds a great fit to play the sassy all-action new character, having come from a background in Muay Thai and having performed many of her own stunts for the new season.",
    "The new series also introduces some familiar villains from the DC universe into the show, with Safiyah, the underworld ruler of Coryana and Gotham City crime boss Black Mask all set to feature as protagonists.",

For those abroad on business or getting some winter sun when Batwoman: Season 2 airs its final episode, you\u2019ll be unable to watch the sci-fi mainstay conclude its epic run due to annoying regional restrictions.",
