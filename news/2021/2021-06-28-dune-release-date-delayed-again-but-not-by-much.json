    "Denis Villeneuve's hotly-anticipated sci-fi epic, Dune, has been delayed again \u2013 though only until October 22.",
    "According to a Variety report, the move to shift the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet-led film's release by a further three weeks comes as part of a broader schedule shuffle at Warner Bros., which also includes delays to Sopranos prequel The Many Saints of Newark and Clint Eastwood\u2019s Cry Macho.",
    "This marks the third time Dune\u2019s release date has been pushed back. Pandemic-related restrictions meant the movie was first delayed until October 1, 2021, from an original December 18, 2020 release date \u2013 though this latest shift isn\u2019t nearly as severe.",
    "From what we can tell, the delay won\u2019t affect the studio\u2019s plans to release Dune concurrently on HBO Max and in theatres, a decision director Villeneuve described as \u201call about the survival of a telecom mammoth\u201d last year.",
    "We previously reported on the potential legal challenge by the movie\u2019s distributor, Legendary Entertainment, against Warner Bros. regarding the controversial move, though the latest news suggests Dune will release concurrently as planned.",
    "There were murmerings that the steady reopening of theatres might force Warner Bros. to reconsider its release schedule, though the studio\u2019s head of communications, Johanna Fuentes, recently took to Twitter to refute the claims.",
    "Dune, an adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s seminal 1965 novel, will follow the story of Paul Atreides, a gifted young prince forced to travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the survival of his people.",
    "The film\u2019s A-list cast includes Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem, and it\u2019s set to premiere at September\u2019s Venice Film Festival.",
    "We had also assumed Dune was all-but set up for a sequel, given the size of its source material, though recent comments made by the movie\u2019s co-writer suggest it will be up to audiences to decide the theatrical future of the franchise.",
    "Speaking to Collider, screenwriter Eric Roth admitted he had written a script treatment for Dune 2, though it would depend on whether \u201cpeople love Dune so much that they do want to have a second part.\u201d",
    "That being said, with a TV spin-off series \u2013 titled Dune: The Sisterhood \u2013 already being developed for HBO Max, coupled with Villeneuve\u2019s very public desire to make a second movie, we\u2019re fairly sure we\u2019ll see more of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's Paul Atreides after Dune drops on October 22."
