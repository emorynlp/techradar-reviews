  "article": [
    "Even though the Steam Deck hasn\u2019t even launched yet, Valve appears to have big ambitions for future handheld gaming devices, and Nintendo, the company that\u2019s dominated that market in the past, should be worried.",
    "While Valve CEO Gabe Newell has already said that the Steam Deck is designed to establish \u201ca product category that ourselves and other PC manufacturers are going to be able to participate in,\u201d and which is \u201cgoing to have long-term benefits for us,\u201d Greg Coomer, a designer involved with the Steam Deck, has shed more light on Valve\u2019s handheld plans.",
    "As PC Gamer reports, Coomer reveals that Valve will \u201ccontinue making devices in this product line.\u201d So, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see hardware refreshes and other variations. Whether this is a Steam Deck 2, Steam Deck Pro or something else entirely isn\u2019t obvious at the moment.",
    "What is clear, however, is that Nintendo should be worried.",
    "Ever since the iconic Game Boy, Nintendo has been the market leader in handheld consoles, easily seeing off the threats from its competitors like Sega and Sony. While it\u2019s unlikely that Sony will release a new PlayStation Portable console, and Microsoft doesn\u2019t seem interested in a handheld Xbox (and why should it, if the Steam Deck can be made to run Windows 11 and play Xbox games?), Nintendo\u2019s Switch console is immensely popular.",
    "This proves there\u2019s a desire for handheld consoles, but up until now, Nintendo has largely been unchallenged. This could all change with the Steam Deck.",
    "For a start, its hardware is a lot more ambitious than the Switch, which should mean it\u2019s more capable of playing modern games with impressive visuals. There were rumors that Nintendo was working on a more powerful \u2018Switch Pro\u2019 console, but that ended up just being the Switch OLED refresh, which comes with a better, larger, screen, but no hardware upgrades. And anyone disappointed by this could now be eying up the Steam Deck.",
    "There\u2019s also the fact that the Steam Deck appears to be much more open. While it runs Linux-based SteamOS software, it can run Windows games thanks to Valve\u2019s Proton compatibility software. If you already have a packed Steam library, then you\u2019ll have a huge amount of games ready to play when you get the Steam Deck.",
    "And, if you really can run Windows 11 on the Steam Deck (Valve isn\u2019t prohibiting you from installing your own operating system), then you\u2019ll be able to run games from other launchers, such as Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store \u2013 again giving you access to a library of games that other handheld consoles can only dream of.",
    "Coomer also suggested that we could see more Steam Deck-like consoles \u2013 but not from Valve.",
    "Of course, as we saw with the Sega Game Gear and PlayStation Portable, no matter how good the offering is, it\u2019s no easy feat to beat Nintendo in the handheld market. There\u2019s no guarantee that the Steam Deck will be a hit to rival the Switch.",
    "For a start, Valve has been here before, when it tried to launch Steam Machines a few years ago. These were compact gaming PCs that were aimed at taking on consoles \u2013 and they didn\u2019t take off.",
    "The Steam Deck\u2019s openness and customisability may also be a plus to PC gamers who are used to that, but for console gamers who want something more user friendly, they may not be interested.",
    "And while the Steam Deck will be able to play a wide range of games, including Xbox and some PlayStation games, there\u2019s one company that will keep its games off the Steam Deck (officially, at least): Nintendo. So if you want to play Breath of the Wild 2 or the next Mario game, you\u2019re going to need to stick with Nintendo."
