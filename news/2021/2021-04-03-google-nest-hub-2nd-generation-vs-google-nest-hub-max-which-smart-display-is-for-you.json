    "Google\u2019s latest smart display, the Nest Hub (2nd generation), has gone on sale \u2013 and while it may look similar to its predecessor, under the hood there have been a few improvements. Notably, the inclusion of technology that can track sleep, which may have left you wondering whether you should pick up one of the best smart displays for your home.",
    "Google has two of these speaker and smart screen devices with Google Assistant built in in its repertoire, ready to help with every command or question you fire its way: the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) and the Google Nest Hub Max. Aside from the screen sizes, you may be wondering just exactly what the differences are. We have all the details you need to help you decide which one you should pick.",
    "Read on to find out just how these smart displays compare \u2013 or, if you know which Google Nest device you want, check out the best prices right now for both products below:",
    "The Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) is Google\u2019s smallest smart display. It has the same floating-screen design as its predecessor, alongside a compact, oval-shaped base that's home to a full-range speaker with a 1.7-inch driver. The base is wrapped in fabric that's made from recycle bottles and is available in four different colors: Chalk (pale grey), Charcoal (dark grey), Sand (pink) and Mist (pale blue)",
    "The 7-inch screen has a resolution of 1024 x 600. It has three microphones positioned along the top, so Google can pick up your voice from anywhere in the room. There's a mute button, too, to stop Google Assistant listening. You'll find a rocker switch for volume control behind the right-hand side of the screen.",
    "A 10-inch HD display with a resolution of 1280 x 800 means the Google Nest Hub Max is the largest smart display Google offers. It looks similar to its smaller sibling, sporting the same floating-screen design. However, since it measures 7.17 x 9.85 x 3.99in, it has a larger footprint.",
    "The base is home to a stereo speaker system made up of two 10W tweeters and one 30W woofer for a room-filling sound. There\u2019s also a 6.5-megapixel front-facing camera that can be used for video calls, or as a security camera to keep an eye on your home when you\u2019re out \u2013 something the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) doesn\u2019t offer. As you\u2019d expect, the Google Nest Hub Max has an identical microphone array to the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) on top and volume and privacy switches, too. It's available in just two colors, though: pale grey or dark grey.",
    "The size of the screen and addition of the front-facing cameras in the Google Nest Hub Max are the most obvious differences between the two smart displays \u2013 if you plan to watch a lot of videos, you\u2019ll likely prefer the 10-inch screen. However, these are the only differences.",
    "Sound quality between the two devices also differs, particularly in terms of loudness and the greater power of the bass on the Google Nest Hub Max. And, if you prefer to make video rather than audio calls, then the Google Nest Hub Max is the smart display for you.",
    "One feature that the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) offers that's missing from the Google Nest Hub Max is sleep tracking. As a result of radar technology built into the former smart display, it detect the smallest of movements \u2013 such as the rise and fall of the chest.",
    "As such, the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) will be handy for those wishing to track their sleep, but who don\u2019t want to wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker. However, in our own tests we did find that the sleep-tracking feature wasn't as effective if you share a bed.",
    "Both Google Nest smart displays excel when delivering content or responding to queries and commands via Google Assistant, and they perform equally well. As such, the one you opt for will depends largely on the size of screen you prefer, whether sleep tracking will be a useful feature, and the size of your budget.",
    "The Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) costs $99.99 / \u00a389 / AU$149 \u2013 and although it has only just launched, keep an eye out for deals, as it may be discounted.",
    "The Google Nest Hub Max costs $229 / \u00a3219 / $349, which is considerably more than the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) \u2013 but, again, it may well be discounted later in the year, particularly around Black Friday and Cyber Monday."
