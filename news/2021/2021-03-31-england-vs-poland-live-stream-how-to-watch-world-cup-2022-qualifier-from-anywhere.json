    "Poland also come into the match unbeaten after their first two qualifiers, having registered a creditable 3-3 draw away against Hungary in their opening game, followed by a 3-0 dispatch of Andorra last Sunday.",
    "The Three Lions have however been handed a huge boost in the run up to this key qualifier with Poland's star man Robert Lewandowski ruled out of the encounter thanks to a knee ligament injury. Lewandowski has already bagged three goals in Poland's 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign so far, and while his absence means viewers will be deprived of the much anticipated striker showdown between the Bayern Munich star and England's Harry Kane, for Southgate it will come as a huge relief that his defenders will not have to face the threat of the free-scoring 32-year-old.",
    "While Southgate is unlikely to make radical changes to his side, uncertainty over the injured Jordan Henderson's availability for this summer's Euros means the England boss may look to partner Declan Rice with his good friend Mason Mount in central midfield for this game, following the Chelsea star's impressive showing on Sunday against Albania.",
