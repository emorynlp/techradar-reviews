    "Storage drives have gotten a whole lot better over the past few years. Gone are the days when you couldn\u2019t run software from them or move them around too much during use. These days, we have solid-state drives -- and the SanDisk Extreme Pro\u00ae Portable SSD takes solid state storage to the next level.",
    "There are a number of things that make the SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD such a great drive, but perhaps at the top of that list is the fact that it\u2019s lightning fast. In fact, the SanDisk Extreme Pro portable drives leverage Western Digital\u2019s NVMe technology to increase transfer speeds, and with these drives, you\u2019ll get up to a massive 2000MB/s*, fully taking advantage of the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface. That should be more than fast enough to transfer your files with ease, or even run games or your operating system directly from the drive.",
    "You could have plenty of data to transfer too. SanDisk Extreme Pro drives come in a few different storage amounts, with options including 1TB, 2TB, and all the way up to 4TB*! Safe to say, whether you need a drive for basic file storage, storing your games, or for your creative projects, there should be something for your needs.",
    "SanDisk Extreme Pro drives go beyond offering a great spec sheet. These drives are built for on-the-go use, and feature a rugged design with a strong aluminum body to protect the drive\u2019s core. That aluminum body is even coated with rubber for high impact resistance, and to give the drive an IP55 rating for water and dust resistance**.",
    "Given the combination of rubber and aluminum, you might assume that SanDisk Extreme Pro drives are big and chunky, but nothing could be further from the truth. Extreme Pro drives are incredibly small and can easily fit in your pocket.",
    "No matter what your situation, SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD should work for you. The drives support PCs and Macs, so they should work right out of the box. The cable in the box is a USB-C cable, which is perfect for newer computers, but in case you don\u2019t have a newer computer just yet, they also come with a USB-C to USB-A adapter.",

    "*Up to stated speed. Based on internal testing; performance may vary depending on host device, usage conditions, drive capacity, and other factors. 1MB = one million bytes. As used for storage capacity, 1TB = one trillion bytes. Actual user capacity less.",
    "**Based on internal testing. IPEC 60529 IP 55: Tested to withstand water flow (30 kPa) at 3 min.; limited dust contact does not interfere with operation. Must be clean and dry before use."
