    "Hitman 3 developer IO Interactive is planning on releasing some DLC for its hugely popular stealth game but, unlike previous DLC releases, it might not introduce any new locations.",
    "In an interview with The Gamer, IO Interactive executive producer Forest Swartout Large confirmed that the team is \u201cdefinitely going to be doing some DLC, but we haven\u2019t defined what that is,\u201d adding \u201cI think for now we are not looking at new maps like the bank and the island.\"",
    "Large went on to explain that rather than creating entirely new locations to Hitman 3's DLC, \u201cWe\u2019re more looking at using existing locations and reimagining them, twisting them. And this time around, we can use the whole trilogy. We can look back at Hitman 2016 maps, Hitman 2 maps - we have all the locations.\u201d",
    "Having already looked back at some of our favorite Hitman levels from across the series, with some of the most notable being in the very first instalment, we can certainly think of a few locations we wouldn\u2019t mind revisiting with new challenges and twists.",
    "DLC isn\u2019t the only thing in Hitman 3\u2019s future to look forward to; IO has previously confirmed that Elusive Targets will be returning at some point with a change to the formula and Xbox Series X and Series S players can look forward to the addition of ray tracing down the line.",
    "We had a great time with Hitman 3 and in our full review we said that \"As a final bow to this trilogy of excellent games, Hitman 3 offers some all-time classic levels and a thrilling storyline.\"",
    "Of course, IO Interactive is also currently at work on a new James Bond game, dubbed Project 007, but thanks to the studio\u2019s multi-team approach it seems there\u2019s space for both projects and according to Large IO Interactive is \u201ccontinuously working on Hitman so we are already looking to the future.\u201d"
