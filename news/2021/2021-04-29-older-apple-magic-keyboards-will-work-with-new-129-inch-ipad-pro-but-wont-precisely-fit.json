  "article": [
    "While a report previously discovered that the larger 12.9-inch version of the new iPad Pro 2021 was incompatible with older pricey Apple Magic Keyboards, Apple now claims the new tablet is technically compatible...it just may not \u2018precisely fit\u2019 when the keyboard-and-case is folded closed.",
    "That comes out of a new support article quietly posted by Apple, which states that \u201cDue to the slightly thicker dimensions of this new iPad Pro, it's possible that the Magic Keyboard may not precisely fit when closed, especially when screen protectors are applied.\u201d",
    "Obviously, this isn\u2019t ideal, especially for anyone who spent $349 / \u00a3329 / AU$449 for the Magic Keyboards that worked with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2018 and 2020 models. But at least Apple has confirmed that the older accessories at least function with the new tablet, which is 0.5mm thicker, likely owing to its new Liquid Retina XDR display with mini LED tech.",
    "While we still don\u2019t have an official release date for the iPad Pro 2021, which was first shown off at the April Apple Spring Loaded event, a rumor points to May 21 as a potential launch date.",
    "But during the Apple Q2 2021 earnings call, which indicated record sales across Apple\u2019s entire product portfolio, CEO Tim Cook responded to a question about the global chipset shortage\u2019s impact by admitting that Apple products due to be released in 2021 may suffer supply shortages. iPads and Macs would primarily be affected, which presumably includes the new iPad Pro 2021. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how much this affects the new M1-powered tablets.",
