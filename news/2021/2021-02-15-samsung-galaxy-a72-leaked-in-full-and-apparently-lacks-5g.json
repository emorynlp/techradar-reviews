    "If you were hoping the rumored Samsung Galaxy A72 would be an affordable way to get a mid-range 5G Samsung phone, you might be out of luck, as the latest leak details the phone in full, and states that it only supports 4G.",
    "That\u2019s according to a report on WinFuture.de written by Roland Quandt (a leaker with a good track record). However, he only says that the Galaxy A72 will \u201cinitially\u201d appear in a 4G version, suggesting that a 5G version might follow, and indeed we\u2019ve previously seen mention of a Samsung Galaxy A72 5G, so there\u2019s still hope for one.",
    "In any case, according to Quandt, this 4G version of the Samsung Galaxy A72 will have a Snapdragon 720G chipset. That\u2019s mid-range but not capable of 5G, so if a 5G model does land it will need a different chipset.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy A72 is also said to have a 6.7-inch 1080 x 2400 Super AMOLED screen with an in-screen fingerprint scanner and a 90Hz refresh rate.",
    "There\u2019s apparently a 32MP punch-hole camera, while around the back there\u2019s said to be a quad-lens camera with a 64MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide, a 2MP macro, and an 8MP camera that\u2019s described as having around \u201ctwice the magnification\u201d \u2013 presumably meaning it\u2019s a telephoto lens.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy A72 is also said to come in variants with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage, along with a microSD card slot. There\u2019s also apparently a 5,000mAh battery, Android 11, and a 3.5mm headphone port.",
    "Moving on to the build, that\u2019s apparently plastic, but IP67-certified, meaning it would be water resistant. Finally, the Samsung Galaxy A72 will apparently cost 449 euros (around $545 / \u00a3390 / AU$700). There\u2019s no word here on when the Galaxy A72 might launch, but with so many details having leaked we\u2019d expect to see it soon."
