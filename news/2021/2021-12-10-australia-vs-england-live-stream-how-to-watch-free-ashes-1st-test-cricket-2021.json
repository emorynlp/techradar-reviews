    "After two seriously less than ideal days of the 2021-22 Ashes for England - and a glorious beginning for Australia - Joe Root is leading the fight back at the Gabba-toire. Don't miss another minute - read on as we explain how to watch an Ashes 1st Test live stream from wherever you are in the world.",
    "The tourists have already been written off for this year's Ashes by many with England without doubt the underdogs, a status that has only been solidified by a dreadful first day that started with Rory Burns being clean bowled by Mitchell Starc with the very first ball of the series.",
    "And things didn't get much better from there for the visitors, with Travis Head scoring a masterful century for the Aussies as they built a massive lead. Now it's captain Root and Dawid Malan who are hoping to take the 1st Test all the way to a fifth day and put the result in the balance.",
    "The fun is just beginning, though, so follow our guide for all the details you need to find a reliable Australia vs England live stream and watch the Ashes 1st Test online from anywhere - best of all, fans in Australia can watch the Ashes for free on Channel 7 (with online Ashes live stream is available on Kayo Sports - you can watch for free with a 14-day Kayo Sports trial).",
    "Below we've got you covered with your official broadcasting options for major cricket loving countries (and the US!), but if you're outside your country of residence and try to start streaming Ashes cricket via your local broadcaster, you'll soon discover that you can't, as it's location restricted. But there is a way to tune in regardless.",
    "By downloading and installing a VPN, you can effectively trick your computer into thinking that it's back at home. That way you can enjoy your home coverage without having to find an illegal stream - assuming you comply with the broadcaster's fine print, of course - specifically its terms and conditions.",
    "Use a VPN to live stream Ashes cricket from anywhere",
    "Using a VPN is as easy as one-two-three...",
    "1. Download and install a VPN - as we say, our top choice is ExpressVPN",
    "2. Connect to the appropriate server location - open the VPN app, hit 'choose location' and select the appropriate location",
    "3. Go to the broadcaster's stream - head to your home broadcaster's site or app and watch as if you were at home - so that's Kayo Sports for Aussies and BT Sport for UK cricket fans"
