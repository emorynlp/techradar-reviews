    "Rachel Uchitel isn't the only insider to open up about life (and their relationship) with the global superstar, though. High school girlfriend Dina Para, longtime caddy Steve Williams, and fellow golf legend Sir Nick Faldo also feature prominently, with the new Tiger Woods documentary paying particular attention to Woods' famously close relationship with his father and golf mentor, Earl Woods Jr.",
    "Specifically, how the proud Dad influenced his son's development not only on the golf course - but also helped him craft a very particular public image off of it.
