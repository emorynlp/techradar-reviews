  "article": [
    "LG\u2019s next flagship, the supposedly-called LG Rainbow, might have been delayed indefinitely after reports emerged that the phone\u2019s pre-release field testing has been put on hold. While the phone was expected to come out in March, it\u2019s unclear if it will come out at all.",
    "LG and mobile network operators chose not to proceed with field testing that was scheduled for the end of February, which would precede a March release window, a source told Korean outlet Chosun.",
    "The Rainbow, which followed last year\u2019s LG Velvet, had gotten far enough in development to have produced a prototype that packed a Snapdragon 888 and used a stylus, the report continued.",
    "It\u2019s unclear whether the testing will be temporary or result in permanent cancellation of the Rainbow, especially given the contradictory rumors on LG\u2019s phone business. Shortly after CES 2021, the company\u2019s CEO strongly denied that LG\u2019s smartphone department was shuttering, though he reportedly told employees the company was considering withdrawing from phones (among other potential actions) in an internal memo later in the month.",
    "Naturally, that led to doubt that the company\u2019s LG Rollable, which it had publicly revealed during a CES 2021 presentation and confirmed to CNET would be coming later in 2021, may not reach the market at all. The brand denied it has delayed or cancelled the rollable, but time will tell if LG\u2019s great leap in phone tech gets released."
