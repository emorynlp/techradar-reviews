    "One of the longest running crime dramas is back, as The Blacklist and star James Spader return to TV for an eighth run that promises to be its most impactful yet. Having aired its first two episodes before going on a short holiday hiatus, the show is now back to finish its latest (and possibly final) run. Follow our guide as we explain how to watch The Blacklist season 8 online wherever you are and stream all-new episode 3.",
    "In fact, the first three episodes of The Blacklist season 8, including episode 3 titled '16 Ounces', were originally intended to be the final instalments of season 7 of the series. But with Covid-19 bringing a halt to production, that run ended abruptly.",
    "Spoiler alert: anyone who isn't fully up-to-date with The Blacklist may find unwanted surprises below. If that sounds like you, just scroll down for a country-by-country guide to watching The Blacklist season 8, which is completely spoiler-free.",
    "In addition to Spader's return as Raymond 'Red' Reddington, The Blacklist season 8 will see the return of most of the core series cast, including Megan Boone as Liz Keen, Laila Robins as Katarina Rostova, Diego Klattenhoff as Donald Ressler, Harry Lennix as Harold Cooper and Laura Sohn as Alina Park. However, a couple of Blacklist favorites sadly won't be returning, as actors Brian Dennehy (Dom) and Clark Middleton (Glen) both passed away this year.",
    "We're expected to learn more about Red's mysterious illness this season, as well as get some kind of resolution to Liz's at times fanatical attempts to 'bring him to justice' - and see whether or not she really can trust her mother, likely super spy Katerina. Read on as we explain how to watch The Blacklist season 8 online and stream episode of the hit show from anywhere today.",
    "Those who already have a streaming service they use to watch The Blacklist online may find themselves unable to access it when abroad, due to pesky geo-blocking restrictions. While we're aware that most people aren't going anywhere in the immediate future, global travel is slowly creeping back onto the horizon - you may even be stuck abroad for any number of reasons.",
    "Fortunately, there's an easy solution to geo-blocking. Downloading a VPN will allow you to watch your favorite shows no matter where you are. This simple bit of software changes your IP address so that you can access episodes on demand just like you would at home.",
