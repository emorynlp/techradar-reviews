    "Fans of premium Windows devices should head on over to the official Microsoft store this week if they want to take advantage of a ton of excellent $300 plus price cuts on both Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptop 3 devices.",
    "Microsoft's range of Surface Pro deals starts with the baseline Core i3, 128GB SSD version for just $649.99 right now - not an amazing price by itself, but Microsoft is sweetening the deal by throwing in a Type Cover bundle for just $50. With that accessory, which is normally worth $159.99 by itself, you'll be able to turn these slick, premium tablets into a handy laptop whenever you see fit. If you're interested in a more upgraded spec, those are also on sale right now with price cuts of up to $430 for the most premium configurations too.",
    "For those looking for an ultrabook, you can score yourself a Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 for just $999.99 (was $1,299) right now on the baseline Core i5, 256GB SSD version. With a whole range of configurations and colors also available, these premium machines are a great Windows-based MacBook alternative if you're wanting something really well-built, stylish, but also portable and powerful.",
    "We've rounded up the best prices on these Microsoft Surface deals just down below, but if you're also interested in non-Microsoft machines, the retailer is also knocking off plenty of bucks on Lenovo, Acer, and Asus machines, which you can see just here.",
    "If you'd like to do a little bit more reading about Microsoft's excellent range of premium tablets, we've got a page for this week's best Surface Pro deals, featuring prices for all the range. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to the Surface Laptop 3, we recommend checking out this week's best cheap laptop deals."
