    "Windows 10\u2019s nasty bug which messes with gamers is still hanging around, according to reports, even though the latest cumulative update for July (released just over a week ago) was supposed to cure it.",
    "This particular bug causes stuttering frame rates and generally \u2018lower than expected performance in games\u2019 as Microsoft describes it, and has been plaguing a minority of gamers (running Windows 10 21H1, 20H2, or 20H1) since this year\u2019s April (preview) update, according to the software giant.",
    "The fix arrived in preview back in June, and fully rolled out with July\u2019s round of Windows 10 patching by Microsoft \u2013 update KB5004237 \u2013 but seemingly that doesn\u2019t resolve the gaming glitches for everyone.",
    "As Windows Latest reports, there are several complaints on Reddit that the bug is still around. One such post observes: \u201cOnce again, I am still having gaming performance issues since KB5000842\u201d.",
    "And a reply states: \u201cYep, I can confirm. Nothing has changed since KB5000842. I have submitted feedback, I have talked with Microsoft developers, etc... Months of hearing from Microsoft that they have a fix coming or that KIR patch fixed it but nothing changes.\u201d",
    "Windows Latest notes that the problem seems to be a bug with Windows 10 power plans not functioning as they should, and this is underlined in the above Reddit thread, where the original poster observes that setting their power plan to \u2018high performance\u2019 is a workaround.",
    "The tech site further notes that Microsoft is aware of these complaints and the company is working on another update to smooth over the gremlins in the works. That patch is now in testing on the Release Preview Ring, apparently, so hopefully it\u2019ll arrive in the near future to come to the rescue of those suffering frame rate drops in Windows 10.",
    "Until then, the aforementioned power plan workaround is your only apparent recourse.",
    "Windows 10 bugs have been a consistent thorn in the side for some users, and worse still, the phenomenon where a patch to solve an issue fails to do so \u2013 as is seemingly the case here in some instances \u2013 or introduces another entirely new problem seems to have happened far too often with Microsoft\u2019s OS.",
    "Even this far down the line with Windows 10 \u2013 which is now six years old \u2013 this is still happening, and it\u2019s a pretty frustrating ongoing situation, not to mention a sizeable blot on Microsoft\u2019s reputation as we\u2019ve pointed out in the past.",
    "With Windows 11 now on the horizon, as a fresh start (of sorts), maybe Microsoft should be looking at ensuring the new OS works more smoothly when it comes to patching and updates, and ramping up the thoroughness of its quality assurance processes in general. Never mind giving the desktop a coat of fresh paint and rounding the corners of boxes."
