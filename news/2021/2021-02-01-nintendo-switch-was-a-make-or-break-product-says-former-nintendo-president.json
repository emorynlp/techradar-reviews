    "The Nintendo Switch continues to be a phenomenal success, but as Nintendo of America\u2019s former president Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 has revealed, it basically had to be.",
    "Speaking during an appearance on the New York Gaming Awards Twitch stream (thanks, Nintendo Life), Fils-Aim\u00e9 admitted that the Nintendo Switch became \u201ca make or break product\u201d for Nintendo after the Wii U\u2019s dire performance, and that helping the company transition to the hybrid console was his defining moment during his 23 years of service.",
    "\"People forget, when the Wii U launched, the performance over that life cycle was so poor, I mean it was the worst-selling platform, I think maybe Virtual Boy was a little bit worse, but Wii U underperformed pretty radically in the marketplace,\" Fils-Aim\u00e9 said.",
    "The Virtual Boy sold 770,000 units before being discontinued, and was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D graphics. It\u2019s notoriously Nintendo\u2019s biggest failure in the console space to date.",
    "Speaking about his proudest moment, Fils-Aim\u00e9 went on to add: \"...for the company to come up with the concept, to bring it to life, to bring it to the marketplace, to have not only great first-party content but great third-party and independent developer content - that is going to be something I will always be proud of,\u201d Fils-Aim\u00e9 said. \"Along with so many of the other things I was part of, but the Switch really was a make or break product for the company and luckily it was a hit.\"",
    "After the poor sales of the Wii U, which shifted a mere 13 million units, Nintendo was being written off by almost every industry expert and analyst before the Nintendo Switch\u2019s big reveal. However, unlike the Wii U, which many consumers thought was just a quirky add-on to the Wii, the Switch\u2019s selling point was immediately obvious from the outset.",
    "Along with an appealing concept, the Nintendo Switch has benefited from some exceptional first-party titles and strong third-party support. The console has also given new life to numerous Wii U titles that were initially overlooked. It\u2019s helped spur the console onto 79.87 million units shipped (around 74 million sold) and 532.34 million software sales. It\u2019s now surpassed sales of the Nintendo 3DS and become Nintendo\u2019s fifth best-selling console of all time.",
