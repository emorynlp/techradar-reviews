    "If you're a gamer thinking about upgrading in the near future, we've spotted a couple of Alienware deals that feature powerful GeForce RTX graphics cards and reasonable prices that won't see you ripped off.",
    "Take this RTX 2070 equipped M15 R3 laptop for $1,299.99 (was $1,949.99) for example. A huge $600 discount means this machine is generally around $200 less than the cheapest RTX 3070 laptops currently while also offering a really premium chassis and a 300Hz refresh rate display that most brands simply can't touch. Its 10th gen Intel Core i7-10750H, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD are also more than speedy and should give you some great 1080p performance for at least a few years.",
    "If you're a desktop user who's clamoring for that latest GeForce RTX 3000 series graphics card, however, check out this Alienware Aurora R10 with an RTX 3060Ti for $1,449.99 (was $1,919). A $450 discount makes this machine only around $200 more expensive than the going rate of these graphics cards by themselves right now on eBay, and that's forgetting the AMD Ryzen 9-3900, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD this machine also comes packed with.",
    "Both these machines are quite good buys right now in our eyes - especially if you're looking to upgrade in the next few months. While pre-built PCs and Alienware especially haven't exactly been synonymous with value historically, these discounts are decent and a good option if you want a quality machine and don't want to wait for graphics card prices to return to somewhat manageable levels.",
    "Looking for something cheaper? See a roundup of the best cheap gaming PC and gaming laptop deals in your region just below.",
    "For more reading on these excellent gaming machines, we recommend heading over to our main Alienware gaming laptop deals and Alienware Aurora deals pages. We've also got a roundup of this week's best cheap gaming laptop deals too if you're needing something a little cheaper."
