When contacted, Norton experts can access your PC remotely to help diagnose and resolve problems (and so you\u2019ll need a \u2018high-speed\u2019 internet connection to facilitate this, the company notes).",
    "This service can be used with Windows 10 (not including Windows 10 S Mode, or Windows on ARM machines) or Windows 8 PCs, and Macs running OS X 10.5 or newer. You must have admin access for the computer in question.",

    "There\u2019s a host of troubleshooting features available here, and some interesting extras like system optimization that we\u2019ve already touched on. Our highlights of the Ultimate Help Desk service are as follows:",
    "Advanced Diagnostics & Resolution",
    "If you\u2019ve got a serious gremlin in the works with your device, a Norton expert will be on hand to tackle the problem and implement a solution. For example, you might have a situation where your PC is suffering from a persistent crash, one that\u2019s frustrating you by occurring regularly, and this is the kind of thorny issue that the Help Desk should be able to deal with.",
    "Network & Mobile Support",
    "Norton can help set up your home network or get devices working on it. So, for example, if you\u2019ve just bought a new laptop, a tech expert can help you connect it to your Wi-Fi network at home.",
    "OS Upgrades",
    "Is your operating system ready for an upgrade? Maybe to Windows 11? Norton can talk you through any upgrade process if you feel intimidated at the prospect, and keeping your device up-to-date is crucial for robust security (updates contain a whole raft of elements like patches against new exploits).",

    "Should malware strike your system, as you would hope from an antivirus software company, Norton can get on the case and help clear up the mess.",
    "Backup Setup",
