    "While CES 2021 blazes on, the Samsung Galaxy S21 phones are days away from being revealed on January 14, but we\u2019re still seeing leaks \u2013 including a new one for the S21 Ultra showing exactly where its S Pen will be stored.",
    "We\u2019ve heard several rumors that the S21 Ultra will support the S Pen, but as it\u2019s not expected to have a physical slot to house the stylus like the Note 20 series, we didn\u2019t know where it would be stored... until a recent leak suggested it could be stored in a folio case with a cover. But new images released by WinFuture show a regular case with the same functional S Pen slot on the side:",
    "We don\u2019t have to belabor how much more popular a standard case will be over a folio \u2013 not everyone wants a flap over their flagship phone, especially with a handset like the S21 Ultra that\u2019s massive enough to have an expected 6.8-inch display. It also looks like a slimmer case overall, with just enough room to tuck a stylus.",
    "And yes, these images (which may be renders and not press photos) show an S Pen similar to those that come with the Tab series of Samsung tablets, unlike the styluses with pop-up buttons at the end to help pry them out of Note phones.",
    "We\u2019ve heard a ton of rumors about the Samsung S21 phone design, prices, and release dates. Based on several reports, the S21 will have a 6.2-inch display, the S21 Plus a 6.7-inch display, and both will max out at Full HD resolution to save cost \u2013 which another rumor suggested will have Korean pricing at 990,000 won (around $904 / \u00a3666 / AU$1,163) for the S21, and the S21 Plus will cost 1,199,000 won (around $1,095 / \u00a3807 / AU$1,410). Even with currency conversions, that\u2019s lower than last year\u2019s Samsung Galaxy S20 launch prices.",
    "The same rumor claimed the S21 Ultra is also getting a price cut to 1,450,000 won (around $1,324 / \u00a3976 / AU$1,706), down from the previous year\u2019s 1,595,000 won pricetag ($1,399 / \u00a31,199 / AU$1,999) for the S20 Ultra. In addition to the larger 6.8-inch display and S Pen integration, the S21 Ultra is rumored to have top specs \u2013 and per another rumor, may finally be able to support 120Hz refresh rate and WQHD Plus resolution at the same time.",
