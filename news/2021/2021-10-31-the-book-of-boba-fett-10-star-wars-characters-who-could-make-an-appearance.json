  "article": [
    "Spoilers follow for The Mandalorian season 2.",
    "In traditional Lucasfilm and Disney style, The Book of Boba Fett is shrouded in mystery \u2013 aside from the return of the eponymous bounty hunter (played by Temuera Morrison) and his associate Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen), The Mandalorian spin-off is playing its Sabacc cards extremely close to its chest. In fact, when it comes to solid intel on the characters who\u2019ll be crossing paths with the galaxy\u2019s most infamous mercenary, even Bothan spies would be pulling their hair out.",
    "But when Fett killed Bib Fortuna to take control of Jabba the Hutt\u2019s vast crime empire, he opened the door to potential encounters with numerous classic Star Wars characters \u2013 from fellow bounty hunters, to Imperials and veterans of the Rebel Alliance.",
    "So, making the assumption that if a character isn\u2019t dead they\u2019re fair game for a return \u2013 and that even those who are deceased could appear in flashbacks \u2013 we\u2019ve assembled a list of the Star Wars heroes and villains who may show up in The Book of Boba Fett.",
    "Everything you\u2019ll read below is based on official Star Wars canon \u2013 movies, TV, books and comics \u2013 unless we specify otherwise.",
    "\u201cBounty hunters: we don\u2019t need their scum,\u201d Admiral Piett sneered at an underling in The Empire Strikes Back, but it would be surprising if The Book of Boba Fett shared his point of view. Even before he hooked up with Fennec Shand in The Mandalorian, Boba Fett had a long history of working with other mercenaries.",
    "The famous usual suspects line-up from Darth Vader's Star Destroyer would seem a good place to start recruiting for the new show \u2013 because although it was disintegrations specialist Fett who eventually captured Han Solo, it\u2019s likely that most of the other bounty hunters involved would still be in business six years later.",
    "Both Bossk and Dengar have history with Fett, having worked with the aspiring bounty hunter during The Clone Wars (where Dengar was voiced by Simon Pegg). Both make brief background appearances in Return of the Jedi \u2013 Dengar in Jabba\u2019s Palace, Bossk on his sail barge \u2013 so, assuming neither was on board the latter when it blew up above the Sarlacc, both could have lived to fight another day. In fact, a report in SlashFilm suggests Dengar survives through to The Rise of Skywalker \u2013 set three decades after The Book of Boba Fett \u2013 in the twisted form of cyborg Rothgar Deng.",
    "IG-88, Zuckuss and 4-LOM completed the famous assortment of mercenaries hired to track down the Millennium Falcon. While it\u2019s widely believed that Boba Fett defeated IG-88 before capturing Han Solo, leaving him for scrap on Cloud City, the droid \u2018brother\u2019 of The Mandalorian\u2019s heroic IG-11 was resurrected in the Darth Vader comic book series, where he was hired to eliminate the Emperor\u2019s right-hand man.",
    "Zuckuss and his droid partner 4-LOM, meanwhile, both appear in the Star Wars: Bounty Hunters comic set after The Empire Strikes Back, so are presumably still looking for work by the time The Book of Boba Fett rolls around.",
    "Cad Bane is yet to appear in live-action, but that didn\u2019t bother The Mandalorian when it brought Clone Wars veterans Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan Kryze into the fold. Bane, a blue-skinned, Clint Eastwood-channelling bounty hunter, was a regular threat throughout The Clone Wars, and has also turned up in spin-off show The Bad Batch. He hasn\u2019t made any canonical appearances beyond his recent Bad Batch appearance, but the fact he appears in some graffiti in Rebels suggests he was still infamous decades later. It therefore wouldn\u2019t be a stretch for him to crop up in The Book of Boba Fett, especially as Bane\u2019s a former associate of Boba\u2019s dad, Jango.",
    "Unless she gets some flashback scenes, one member of the Bossk/Dengar gang who won\u2019t be showing up is Boba\u2019s old mentor, Aurra Sing \u2013 during Solo: A Star Wars Story, it\u2019s confirmed that Tobias Beckett killed her.",
    "And if The Book of Boba Fett production team are looking for a seriously deep dive, there\u2019s one other important Star Wars mercenary who\u2019s long overdue a canonical appearance. \u201cThe bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell,\u201d is casually referenced by Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back, yet has never appeared on screen. Non-canon 1981 comic The Bounty Hunter of Ord Mantell told the story of Skorr and his encounter with Solo \u2013 could this be the time he\u2019s finally introduced into official continuity?",
    "While Leia made sure that Jabba the Hutt was definitively dead \u2013 even before his sail barge exploded \u2013 we know that his master of ceremonies, Bib Fortuna, survived to take control of his old boss\u2019s crime empire. Fett assassinated Fortuna in The Mandalorian season 2 finale, but who\u2019s to say there aren\u2019t other members of Jabba\u2019s entourage out there?",
    "Cackling Kowakian monkey-lizard court jester Salacious B Crumb, for example, could have jumped ship after snacking on C-3PO\u2019s eye. (That said, he\u2019d be advised to steer clear of Nevarro, where roasted monkey-lizard is sometimes on the menu.)",
    "Mad scientist Dr Evazan and his sidekick Ponda Baba survived their Mos Eisley bar brawl with Obi-Wan Kenobi, so could still be at large. And Ochi, the Sith assassin who killed Rey\u2019s parents (as referenced in The Rise of Skywalker) previously had connections with criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn, whose interests could collide with Fett\u2019s own black-market aspirations.",
    "Any Crimson Dawn entanglements could be made even more intriguing if we see the return of Qi\u2019ra, Han Solo\u2019s ex (played by Game of Thrones\u2019 Emilia Clarke) who became a major player in the organisation. The War of the Bounty Hunters comic reveals that Qi\u2019ra stole the carbonite-encased Solo from Fett in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, eventually auctioning him off to the highest bidder. Boba Fett may still hold a grudge\u2026",
    "And on the less scummy and villainous side of the underworld there\u2019s pirate queen Maz Kanata, whose castle on Takodana is also a haven for the morally flexible. She even has a Mandalorian flag outside the front door, so may welcome certain bounty hunting visitors.",
    "With Luke Skywalker busy training Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) in the ways of the Force, and Han Solo, Leia and Chewbacca probably having their hands full raising toddler son (and future Kylo Ren) Ben, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll have a reunion with Boba Fett \u2013 even though there\u2019s bound to be some residual animosity on both sides. There\u2019s slightly more chance of a return for Lando Calrissian (who, like Fett, briefly worked for Jabba the Hutt), but we suspect The Book of Boba Fett will largely steer clear of Star Wars\u2019 biggest names.",
    "There are other Rebel Alliance veterans in play at this point in the timeline, however. Pilot Nien Nunb is a former smuggler, so has experience of the underworld, while fellow flying ace Wedge Antilles may have a few more years of action in him before retiring to a quiet life in the Outer Rim with his wife Norra Wexley \u2013 the mother of future Resistance pilot Temmin \u2018Snap\u2019 Wexley.",
    "We also never found out what happened to former Clone Troopers Rex and Wolffe after the fall of the Empire. They\u2019d surely be intrigued to meet their bounty hunting \u2018brother\u2019 Boba \u2013 the fact they\u2019re all clones of Jango Fett (also played by Temuera Morrison) means the casting should be easy\u2026",
    "With The Mandalorian season 3 storylines to consider, the destinies of Din Djarin (aka Mando) and Grogu are almost definitely separate from Boba Fett\u2019s. There are, however, other characters from the parent show who could crop up in The Book of Boba Fett.",
    "Cobb Vanth, the Mos Pelgo town marshal who kept Fett\u2019s armor warm during his enforced absence, is also on Tatooine, and may have a part to play in the story of how Boba escaped from lunch-by-Sarlacc. And while Mandalorian princess Bo-Katan Kryze has little love for Fett \u2013 who she regards as an imposter and a disgrace to the armor \u2013 there are plenty of reasons their paths could cross once again.",
    "Former Imperial sharp shooter-turned-career criminal Mayfeld pulled off a successful heist with Fett in The Mandalorian season 2 episode 7, so it may be mutually beneficial for them to work together again.",
    "It\u2019s also unlikely that the newly established New Republic will turn a blind eye to criminal activities across the galaxy, so don\u2019t be surprised if pilots/space cops Carson Teva and Trapper Wolf stick their noses into Boba Fett\u2019s business from time to time.",
    "After the Battle of Jakku \u2013 which took place four years before the events of The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett \u2013 the remains of the Empire signed a peace treaty with the New Republic. According to Chuck Wendig\u2019s Aftermath novels, Imperial bigwigs \u2013 including Admiral Rae Sloane and Commandant Brendol Hux (father of General Hux) \u2013 travelled to the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, where they went on to build the First Order.",
    "While the Empire as we knew it is no longer in business, however, we know from The Mandalorian that there are sizeable, and dangerous, Imperial remnants making their presence felt across the galaxy \u2013 much like the one led by the now-incarcerated Moff Gideon.",
    "The question is, how much will their operations come into Boba Fett\u2019s orbit? The two sides do have a history of working together if their interests align, so don\u2019t be surprised to see Fett joining forces with people dressed in Imperial uniforms once again.",
    "The Book of Boba Fett streams on Disney Plus from December 29."
