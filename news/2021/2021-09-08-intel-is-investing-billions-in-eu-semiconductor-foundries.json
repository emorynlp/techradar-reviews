    "Intel has revealed plans to build new chip-making facilities in Europe with an $95 billion funding plan over the next decade to boost the region's chip capacity",
    "The commitment was revealed by company CEO Pat Gelsinger at Munich's IAA auto show, and is a major step up from the previously announced $20 billion-worth investments to build new fabrication units in the EU.",
    "The previous commitment was announced in July 2021 after Gelsinger met with French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Mario Draghi to discuss the global chip shortage.",
    "According to reports, at the IAA auto show Gelsinger reaffirmed that the company was planning two new chip factories in the EU and could potentially expand its plans, ballooning its investment over a decade to about \u20ac80 billion (about $94.77 billion).",
    "Gelsinger added that the upcoming facilities would cater to ever-rising demand for semiconductors and \u201cwould be a catalyst for the semiconductor industry... a catalyst for the entire technology industry.\"",
    "\u201cThis new era of sustained demand for semiconductors needs bold, big thinking,\u201d he said at the auto-industry event, reports the Wall Street Journal.",
    "Earlier this year, Gelsinger announced the launch of a new Intel Foundry Services (IFS) division, which will drive Intel\u2019s efforts to manufacture chips for other commercial customers.",
    "As part of the company\u2019s European moves, Gelsinger said the company will open up its semiconductor plant in Ireland for automakers, which he reportedly considers as a \u201ckey strategic priority.\u201d",
    "Referring to cars as \u201ccomputers with tires,\u201d Gelsinger said that Intel believes chips will make up 20% of the cost of vehicles by 2030, which is a five-fold increase from 4% of the cost in 2019.",
    "\u201cYou need us and we need you... The aim is to create a centre of innovation in Europe, for Europe,\" remarked Gelsinger.",
