  "article": [
    "Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang isn\u2019t overly worried about rival AMD\u2019s powerful new Instinct MI200 heavyweight graphics cards, built for high-performance computing (HPC), and essentially said that the idea of an \u2018Nvidia killer\u2019 of a product was nothing new or alarming.",
    "In an interview with The Next Platform highlighted by Wccftech, on the topic of AMD\u2019s \u2018Aldebaran\u2019 GPU accelerators \u2013 which benefit from a multi-die GPU design, basically being two graphics cards in one \u2013 interviewer Timothy Prickett Morgan asked \u201cwhat is your response to this competition from AMD\u201d, and Huang insisted that he wasn\u2019t remotely concerned.",
    "Huang replied that: \u201cFirst of all, we have competition all the time. So it is not true that this is the first so-called Nvidia killer that has come out. Every year there\u2019s an Nvidia killer and people call it that.\u201d",
    "In other words, there\u2019s nothing particularly out of the ordinary happening with AMD\u2019s latest launch, although the MI200 is quite an achievement by anyone\u2019s standards, offering 3.2TB per second of (peak theoretical) memory bandwidth, which is 2.7x better than previous-gen Instinct cards. It offers up to 47.9TFlops in terms of FP64 performance, too.",
    "Of course, as Nvidia\u2019s top exec, it\u2019s Huang\u2019s job not to be moved or outwardly impressed by what AMD has achieved with its Instinct MI200 GPUs.",
    "But those specs speak for themselves, really, as does the fact that HPC orders are gaining momentum, with systems like the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory set to run with MI200s, along with the Adastra supercomputer in France.",
    "While this may not mean much to the average consumer, what is interesting is that gaming graphics cards are also looking at shifting to a multi-chip GPU model. Indeed, the rumor mill is busy peddling the idea that AMD could maybe go this route with its next-gen RDNA 3 flagship graphics card \u2013 tripling the core count compared to the RX 6900 XT as a result (massive handfuls of salt, naturally).",
    "As Huang points out, though, boasts of \u2018Nvidia killer\u2019 are nothing new, and indeed were bandied about when Big Navi was working its way through the rumor mill almost two years ago now. And doubtless we will be hearing this phrase again in the future, with a suitable amount of skepticism always to be employed with material from the GPU grapevine.",
