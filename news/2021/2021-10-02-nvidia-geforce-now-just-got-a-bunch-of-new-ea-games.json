    "GeForce Now only previously had one EA game available to stream \u2013 the popular battle royale Apex Legends \u2013 but a cluster of new games, or to be precise four of them, have just arrived on Nvidia\u2019s service.",
    "Those games are Dragon Age: Inquisition, Battlefield 1 Revolution, Mirror\u2019s Edge Catalyst, and Unravel Two (a co-op platformer).",
    "There were other additions to GeForce Now revealed this week as well as those EA titles, and the full list runs as follows:",
    "While the EA titles introduced here might be pretty old \u2013 Dragon Age is a big franchise name, of course, but Inquisition was released way back in 2014 \u2013 the fact that a number of EA games are now present on GeForce Now is a good sign.",
    "It bodes well for further products to come across from the major publisher in the future, hopefully before too long. (And yes, as you might guess, there are already gamers clamoring for FIFA 22 to come to the streaming service \u2013 but the next titles to arrive will doubtless be lower-key affairs, naturally).",
    "In July 2021, Nvidia announced that GeForce Now supports over 1,000 games, so it\u2019s clearly making some good strides in terms of beefing up its library, following the desertion of some big-name publishers right after the launch of the service. In other words, things are being turned around, and in our dabbling with GeForce Now at TechRadar, we\u2019ve had a mostly positive experience, too."
