    "WB Games Montreal has revealed that the combat system for its upcoming Batman game, Gotham Knights, has been designed with two player co-op in mind.",
    "In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Gotham Knights\u2019 executive producer Fleur Marty said that players should expect something slightly different to WB Montreal\u2019s previous Batman game Arkham: Origins, explaining that they \u201chave entirely redesigned the combat system in order for it to work well in co-op.\u201d",
    "Unlike the Arkham Batman games, Gotham Knights isn\u2019t going to be focused on playing solo as the caped crusader. Set in a separate universe to the Arkham series, it features four playable characters\u2014Nightwing, Robin, Red Hood, and Batgirl\u2014giving players the option to fluidly switch between them and team up with a friend to take Gotham City back from its many villains.",
    "While Marty noted that Gotham Knights is \u201cstill a brawler\u201d and \u201csome of the mechanics won\u2019t feel totally alien for people who played and enjoyed the Arkham series\u201d, he added that \u201cit is in many ways very different.\u201d",
    "Though its combat has been designed with co-op in mind, there does seem to be a good degree of flexibility in how Gotham Knights can be played. According to Marty, it will still be possible to play Gotham Knights entirely solo and the co-op element is conveniently \u201cdrop-in drop-out\u201d, so you\u2019re not entirely dependent on another player.",
    "In addition to that, story progression is shared between all the characters so you can switch between heroes as you please, provided you\u2019re in The Belfry, and invite a friend to join you without the worry that they\u2019ll pick that one underpowered character you haven't played as at all.",
    "Even with that flexibility, though, it certainly does seem that the idea and spirit of the \u201cteam-up\u201d is important to the overall game.",
    "According to Creative Director Patrick Redding, \u201cThe two-player dynamic fits the fantasy and the Gotham City setting. The \u2018duo\u2019 or team-up is such a central feature of the universe that there\u2019s a literal shorthand for it in the comics, in animation, in the film and TV versions.\u201d",
    "In fact, the space necessary for fun co-op play has even been taken into consideration in the design of Gotham City itself, with Redding adding that \u201cGotham is a city of alleyways and rooftops, so the footprint for gameplay needs to be compatible with that.\u201d",
    "We already got the chance to see Gotham Knights' co-op in action last year when the game was announced at DC FanDome and you can catch up on that below.",
    "Gotham Knights doesn\u2019t have an exact release date just yet but it\u2019s expected to arrive on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X/S, and PC at some point this year."
