    "We have a very good idea of what the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE looks like at this point, thanks to a range of leaks, and now we\u2019ve had another look at the likely design of the phone, this time in five different colors.",
    "These renders, which you can see below, were shared by Evan Blass (a leaker with a great track record). He actually recently shared some other renders of the phone, but these newer ones include updated and additional colors and angles.",
    "The colors in question are green, white, blue, violet and grey, with the violet and green looking lighter here than in Blass\u2019s previous leak. It\u2019s not clear whether the grey shade meanwhile is a more accurate version of the black color Blass previously shared or if this is an additional shade.",
    "In any case, it sounds like these five colors are probably quite accurate, at least to the best of Blass\u2019s knowledge. Whether there will also be other shades remains to be seen.",
    "As for the design, we\u2019ve seen it all before really, with a punch-hole camera in the top-center of the screen, a triple-lens camera on the back, and no headphone port. It\u2019s a design that\u2019s very similar to the standard Samsung Galaxy S21, and given how many times we\u2019ve now seen this design we\u2019d think it\u2019s likely accurate.",
    "We should find out for sure in August, as that\u2019s when it\u2019s rumored that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will land, perhaps alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3."
