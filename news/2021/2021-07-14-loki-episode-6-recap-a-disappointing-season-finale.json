    "Spoilers for all six episodes of Loki follow.",
    "The Matrix Reloaded was arguably the most hotly anticipated blockbuster of 2003. As the follow-up to a genuinely game-changing movie, expectations were sky-high as the world waited to learn the mysteries of the computer simulation that was keeping humanity enslaved. Then came the final act letdown, as Keanu Reeves\u2019 Neo bumped into an old guy who called himself the Architect and talked like he\u2019d swallowed a thesaurus. Ergo and concordantly, the sequel ended in a colossal info-dump of exposition.",
    "If you\u2019re thinking that a review of the Loki season 1 finale is an odd place to revisit an 18-year-old action movie, you probably haven\u2019t seen the latest instalment of the show. \u2018For All Time. Always\u2019 is effectively the infamous Architect scene stretched out over 40+ minutes, as Loki and Sylvie reach the Citadel at the End of Time, and run into an ancient being known simply as He Who Remains.",
    "Like the Architect, he has a penchant for lengthy monologues, along with a deep-seated belief that removing free will is the best way to run a complex society with billions of moving parts. And despite the best efforts of Lovecraft Country\u2019s Jonathan Majors to have some fun with the role, He Who Remains shares the Architect\u2019s ability to suck the narrative drive out of a story.",
    "Thanks to Loki Laufeyson\u2019s TVA file being stamped with the important message that \u201cLoki will return in season 2\u201d \u2013 probably the lowest-budget mid-credits sting in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe \u2013 we now know that Loki was never supposed to be a one-off limited series in the vein of WandaVision. Even so, this is a disappointing season finale that seems to throw out everything that made its predecessors memorable.",
    "Even in a series that\u2019s displayed a tendency to shapeshift from week-to-week, this feels like a quantum leap too far. At times, \u2018For All Time. Always\u2019 barely feels like the god of mischief\u2019s show at all, with Loki and Sylvie effectively spending the episode as captive students in He Who Remains\u2019 intensive class about the history of the Multiverse \u2013 we don\u2019t even get an acerbic alligator sidekick to lighten the mood.",
    "In an episode with less humor and fun than its predecessors, it feels like the spiky back-and-forth that\u2019s characterized the duo\u2019s relationship was left behind with Alioth in the Void. As they dutifully listen to He Who Remains\u2019 31st century origins, his recollections of a Multiversal War, and his justifications for the existence of the TVA, they\u2019re relegated to mere bystanders. Why would an (allegedly) all-seeing cosmic being offer a pair of extremely problematic Variants the chance to run the TVA after his retirement? If he\u2019d paid proper attention to the previous five episodes, he\u2019d understand why it\u2019s such a ludicrous proposition.",
    "Though, just as time works differently in the TVA, plausibility seems to be an alien concept in He Who Remains\u2019 spooky mansion. These scenes should be among the most pivotal in the show, but they\u2019re let down by some extremely clunky, exposition-heavy scripting. Having spent the entire season redeeming Loki (and even turning him into a voice of reason), you never really feel that the temptation of his own throne, an Infinity Gauntlet and the chance to kill Thanos will tempt him back to the dark side \u2013 Loki\u2019s protestations that he \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted\u201d feel like a desperate reminder that he used to be bad.",
    "His fight with Sylvie over whether or not to kill He Who Remains \u2013 and potentially unleash a legion of less sympathetic Variants \u2013 also feels half-hearted, both of them seemingly pulling their punches. Their long-awaited kiss is a nice moment, but there\u2019s an element of subterfuge to it, as Sylvie sends Loki back to the TVA, stabs He Who Remains, and confirms what we\u2019ve suspected for a long time now: she might just be the superior Loki after all...",
    "Where Loki and Sylvie are short-changed by the episode, however, Mobius is totally wasted. What was the point of going to all the effort of getting him back to the TVA if his efforts to reform a corrupt organization go no further than a heated argument with his former BFF, Renslayer? Renslayer\u2019s escape hints she\u2019ll have a role to play in Loki season 2 \u2013 the introduction of the original schoolteacher Renslayer in 2018 Ohio is likely to have its own glorious purpose \u2013 but it\u2019s one of many loose story threads left hanging by an episode that needed at least a degree of closure.",
    "Indeed, it looks like Marvel has fallen into a trap it\u2019s been caught out by before \u2013 namely, prioritizing the next instalment of the franchise at the expense of what it\u2019s working on right now. The MCU is undeniably one of the most impressive achievements in the history of blockbuster filmmaking, all those interweaving storylines across 24 movies and three TV shows requiring an impeccable grip on story arcs, the like of which Hollywood has never seen. It works best when the connecting tissue is subtle \u2013 a sly nod to a character or event, perhaps, or a mid-credits sting from leftfield. But when setting up the next stage of the saga becomes more important than the story at hand \u2013 as it did in Iron Man 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron and even WandaVision \u2013 you can start to short-change your lead characters.",
    "The Multiverse will clearly be a big deal for Marvel, as will Majors\u2019 new incarnation as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Big Bad Kang the Conqueror. But Tom Hiddleston\u2019s Loki deserved to be the star of his own story. Hopefully he\u2019ll find his way in a timeline where nobody knows his name\u2026",
    "Verdict:",
    "In terms of setting up Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Loki episode 6 is a triumph, opening up the fractured timelines of the Multiverse in spectacular fashion, and answering a lot of big questions about the inner workings of the MCU along the way. Jonathan Majors\u2019 fun performance does enough to suggest he\u2019ll make a memorable villain when he rematerializes as Kang the Conqueror, while Loki finding himself in an alternative TVA is enough to hint that the MCU is about to head off in some exciting new directions.",
    "Taken on its own merits, however, the episode is a big letdown. When Loki feels like a bystander in the season finale of a show that bears his name, something\u2019s clearly gone a bit wrong. As one of Marvel\u2019s MVPs, he deserved better than seeing his own story sacrificed in the name of the all-encompassing Marvel story arc.",
    "The whole of Loki season 1 is now available on Disney Plus."
