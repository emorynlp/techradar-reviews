    "As the fall semester approaches, the best back to school accessories for MacBook are just a part of the long list of supplies students need as they prepare for the year ahead. But, these accessories can make school life much easier, or at least more comfortable.",
    "MacBooks are among the best laptops available, machines that will last a full school day on a single charge, are easy to carry, and are powerful enough for any schoolwork a student may encounter. And, the best back to school accessories for MacBook can help get the most out of that Apple portable, whether it\u2019s expanding storage space, getting more screen real estate, or making it easier to work on.",
    "To help you (or your student) find the best back to school accessories for MacBook, we\u2019ve collected our top picks here, from external monitors and hard drives to laptop stands and more. If you find Apple machines a bit too pricey for a student, consider buying one of the best Chromebooks out there, since they have similar portability and battery life as well as surprising performance yet cost much less than an Apple laptop.",
    "This backpack has enough space to accommodate any MacBook or MacBook Pro, as well as books, pencils, pens, and other school supplies. Features four exterior pockets for various necessities like a portable hard drive or SSD, and is available in several excellent colors.",
    "Fun and affordable, with a clip-on design, 10 hours of playtime, IPX67 waterproof rating, six color options and plenty of volume for something so small, JBL\u2019s Clip 4 is just the portable speaker for students with a more active lifestyle. It\u2019s made to easily connect to any device via Bluetooth as well, including that brand-new MacBook you just splurged on. Simply press the Bluetooth button, connect with your laptop, and you\u2019re playing tunes in seconds. Just what you need for a hectic back to school season.",
    "Best for dorm rooms where you don\u2019t necessarily have a lot of space, this small yet impressive Bluetooth speaker from B&O has a powerful set of lungs packed in an elegant design that you\u2019d be tempted to bring with you to the beach and college parties \u2013 good thing it\u2019s got a IPX67 rating. It has \"True 360\" omnidirectional sound so you'll hear it loud and clear from any side, as well as a whopping 18 hours of playtime. Best of all, it has Alexa built-in so it can moonlight as a smart speaker, saving space.",
    "If you like to use your MacBook with an external monitor, this Twelve South stand is an excellent choice. It stylishly keeps your MacBook from taking up a lot of precious desk space and comes in either silver or space gray.",
    "For those that use your laptop without an external monitor, but want to elevate it and get a little extra cooling, check out Bestand's aluminum cooling stand. Elevating your MacBook at an angle, this stand offers a little extra help keeping your computer cool, and is great for use with external accessories like keyboards and mice.",
    "Upgrade your typing experience this back to school season. It\u2019s true that MacBooks have among the best keyboards out there, but if you want to sit away from that screen a bit, the Logitech K380 might just be the ticket. It\u2019s among the best small keyboards we\u2019ve tested, slim and compact yet also incredibly comfortable to type on and very affordable. It also has three-device simultaneous connectivity so you can switch from your laptop to your iPad to your iPhone seamlessly.",
    "Satechi is known for its solid products that feel like they could take a beating, even this X2 Bluetooth keyboard that\u2019s among the slimmest keyboards we\u2019ve used. Optimized for Mac, it boasts backlit keys that are amazingly comfortable to type on, multi-device connectivity (up to 4, in fact), and the exact color scheme that most MacBooks have for a match made in Apple heaven.",
    "It\u2019s almost impossible that something so tiny and lightweight \u2013 small enough to easily slip in your shirt pocket \u2013 can carry up to 1TB of data. It\u2019s also built to be robust. In fact, Seagate is so confident about its build, it\u2019s added a loop so you can attach it to a carabiner clip to hang on your backpack. We also love its smart woven fabric exterior. Since it\u2019s an SSD, you can be assured that it\u2019s fast and secure.",
    "Keeping your files safe and portable may be this external SSD\u2019s top priority, but it also takes pride in its rugged build. This thin and tiny storage drive comes with a two-meter drop protection and an IP55 rating, which means it\u2019s protected from dust ingress and low pressure water jets. Rain or shine, it can take a beating, making it your ideal companion for doing on-the-field school work and projects.",
    "We can honestly say that the HP E14 G4 portable monitor is the most appealing portable monitor we\u2019ve used (and we\u2019ve tested quite a few of them). Touting a 1080p resolution and a whopping 400 nits of brightness in an unbelievably thin and light form, this might just be all you need if you need a bit of extra screen space. It\u2019s even got a 65W power passthrough and a nifty anti-glare feature.",
    "If you\u2019re ready to upgrade to a 4K monitor, you cannot go wrong with Dell\u2019s curved offering. The \u200b\u200bDell 4K S3221QS is a 32-incher with a stunning woven back design in white, making it better looking than most monitors, and a deep 1800R curvature for an even more immersive experience. Because it is Dell, it\u2019s got 300 nits of brightness, much like the popular XPS line.",
    "This new release from Beats is a more accessible alternative to those premium Airpod Pros you\u2019ve been eyeing. It\u2019s more affordable for back to school season than the classic Airpods while offering features that are more on par with the Pros, including ANC, transparency mode, on-ear touch controls, and a great sound. It\u2019s also easy to use and has a good battery life that slightly beats out that of the pros."
