    "The Suicide Squad, James Gunn's upcoming DCEU movie, is only five months from release on HBO Max. Up until now, we'd only been treated to snippets of the movie through a variety of HBO Max trailers, but that's changed at long last.",
    "That's right, the movie's first trailer has landed online - and it looks about as gory, hilarious, and action-packed as you'd expect. The official trailer, which provides plenty of footage throughout its three-minute runtime, was expected to drop today after Gunn confirmed as much on Twitter on Thursday.",
    "Check out The Suicide Squad's first trailer below:",
    "The Suicide Squad's trailer isn't the only treat that Gunn gifted to his fan base. The Guardians of the Galaxy and Slither director also released a new poster, which provides another colorful look at the team of eclectic supervillains who will star in his film:",
    "For those unfamiliar with the upcoming flick, The Suicide Squad is a sort-of follow-up to David Ayer's 2016 Suicide Squad, even though it's not considered to be a series reboot or canon sequel as Gunn has previously confirmed (h/t Empire).",
    "Much like Ayer's movie, however, The Suicide Squad will follow a gang of DC supervillains \u2013 including Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, and Captain Boomerang \u2013 who are sent to the fictional island of Corto Maltese to destroy Jotunheim, a Nazi-era prison and laboratory where experiments are carried out on its inmates.",
    "As The Suicide Squad will be R-rated, you can expect plenty of blood, violence, swearing, and supervillain deaths aplenty. Gunn has already revealed that no bad guy or girl is safe from the chop in his flick (h/t Deadline) so it's best not to get attached to any on character when the film is finally released.",
    "The Suicide Squad has an all-star cast that, alongside Robbie's Harley Quinn, will feature the likes of Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Peter Capaldi, and Sean Gunn.",
    "The Suicide Squad will arrive in theaters and on HBO Max on August 6."
