    "Will there be a Samsung Galaxy Note 21? That\u2019s one of the big questions in smartphones this year, with numerous sources suggesting there won\u2019t be \u2013 a claim that looks more feasible now that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has launched with S Pen support \u2013 but others saying there will. Now Samsung itself has joined the fray, with a comment that\u2019s hopeful, but rather unclear.",
    "In a statement to T3, a Samsung spokesperson said: \u201cWhilst we have expanded our S Pen experience across our wider Galaxy range, this does not mean we are not committed to the Galaxy Note category. To provide the best mobile experience to all customers, we will actively listen to their feedback and reflect this in our product innovation\u201d.",
    "That suggests the company is committed to the Galaxy Note range, though the wording leaves some wiggle room. Still, we\u2019d think it\u2019s likely based on this statement that there will be at least one more Samsung Galaxy Note handset.",
    "But will it be the Samsung Galaxy Note 21? That\u2019s much less clear, especially as a recent leak suggested that there wouldn\u2019t be a Note 21 but that there might be a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 FE, which would likely be a cheaper take on the Note 20 range.",
    "That\u2019s certainly possible, as all Samsung\u2019s statement really suggests is that there will probably be at least one more product with Note in the name, and even that is uncertain, especially as the last part of the statement suggests that feedback from customers might affect the Note range\u2019s future.",
    "So, if you\u2019re hoping for a new Samsung Galaxy Note, we\u2019d say this statement makes the possibility of one a little more likely, but whether it will land as the Samsung Galaxy Note 21 is just as unclear as ever."
