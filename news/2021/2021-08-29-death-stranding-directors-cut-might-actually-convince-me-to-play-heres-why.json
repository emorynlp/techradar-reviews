    "As the adage goes, there are two types of gamers, and I\u2019m the type that bounced off Hideo Kojima\u2019s oeuvre and didn\u2019t pick up his long-awaited opus, Death Stranding, when it finally released in late 2019. When I read reviews detailing the extensive length of the game, much of which is spent simply walking and meditating on the world, I felt reaffirmed in skipping it. But the changes coming in the Death Stranding Director\u2019s Cut are just the things to get me to finally play the game.",
    "We all got an in-depth look at the new features coming in the Director\u2019s Cut during the Gamescom 2021 Opening Night Live showcase. While the \u2018various updates\u2019 include indisputably positive additions like 4K support and a 60fps performance mode in the game\u2019s PS5 version, I\u2019m focused on the extras that make the lengthy travel easier and faster.",
    "Before you say anything \u2013 yes, I know I\u2019ll be robbing myself of how the game is intended to be played as Sam Bridges, the lonely everyman tasked with connecting the world one parcel delivery at a time. I know that walking the long, unpeopled expanse of the world is the point, giving players time for their minds to wander just like they would during a real-world jaunt outside civilization.",
    "As our reviewer Cian Maher put it, the game opens with the player \u201ctravers[ing] harsh terrain while keeping delicate cargo intact. As you cross impassable abysses and sinuous rivers, the involuntary descent into loneliness is juxtaposed with a solemnity that is, despite itself, quite warm.\u201d",
    "But I can\u2019t deny feeling some relief at the prospect of launching that cargo out of a catapult to save me some time.",
    "Or climbing atop 'Buddy Bot' \u2013 a pair of autonomous legs \u2013 as they ferry me and my awkwardly large backpack.",
    "Or hurling myself off a misty cliff and letting vernier jets bring me to a soft landing instead of trudging down a hill.",
    "Even to someone who\u2019s not spent a moment in the game, these \u201cdelivery support\u201d options feel ludicrously alien, both to the world and to how players are meant to explore it. Ease betrays fidelity to Sam\u2019s journey, cheapens the impact of his shipping pilgrimage, and so on.",
    "But if it\u2019s the choice between balking at a game that\u2019s just over 40 hours just doing the main story, as the site How Long To Beat suggests, and trying out Death Stranding with shortcuts at hand that could trim that down, I\u2019ll take the latter.",
    "Part of this comes down to time \u2013 schedules and commitments mean I rarely stick with a game longer than 20 hours, and I think many games that do last longer overstay their welcome with repetitive padding (most recently, NieR: Automata, an intriguing 15-hour game that plods on for 20 more hours after). As the years go on, my tolerance for lengthy single-player experience has waned, especially since it competes with multiplayer gaming with friends online \u2013 which has been most of my social interaction in the last year-plus of lockdown.",
    "Here\u2019s the thing \u2013 I do regret not feeling able to spare the time to enjoy Death Stranding like everyone else did when it launched in November 2019, especially once it became eerily prophetic in early 2020 as Covid lockdown set in. I lament that stress over unfinished projects, family commitments, and daily obligations keeps me from even relaxing into a long play of a game like Death Stranding.",
    "The Director\u2019s Cut\u2019s bizarre transportation additions to the game ease that stress; they\u2019re little relief ripcords I can pull if I reach a ridge and realize I need to scramble down a valley and up the other side. Just having the options available makes the game feel less intimidating and more accessible.",
    "But I\u2019m also relieved that these easements aren\u2019t the result of a mod \u2013 like it or not, they are Kojima-blessed, as part of (and I\u2019ll quote the trailer\u2019s massive text here) \u201cT H E DEFINITIVE EXPERIENCE.\u201d At least his seal of approval means these extras don\u2019t violate the spirit of his game too much, at least from his perspective.",
    "Some players will probably disagree. As Kotaku\u2019s Ethan Gach writes, \u201cDeath Stranding elevated the mundane drudgery of safely delivering packages undamaged by the elements into an irresistibly tense existential crisis. Drones are fun, but I\u2019m not sure how cutting through obstacles by delivering cargo via remote control plays into that.\u201d",
    "I might have agreed if I'd played the game at launch \u2013 and maybe I still will, if I come to accept that those extras dilute the experience too much. But at least they\u2019ll get me in the door to try out a game that I just didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get around to. And hopefully more of these kinds of pain point-easing options get added to games in the future for later-wave players who just needed that one thing to ensure the game might be for them, too."
