    "Pok\u00e9mon Go developer Niantic looks like it\u2019s been hard at work developing its own pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses, as evidenced by a post on Twitter from Niantic CEO John Hanke. The preview image makes the product look non-intrusive and stylish enough that they won\u2019t look too out of the ordinary when wearing them out in public. In the tweet, Hanke specifically states the desire to \u201cenable new kinds of devices that leverage our platform.\u201d Likely, this means that Niantic\u2019s AR glasses will benefit the most from the company\u2019s in-house projects like Pok\u00e9mon Go and its upcoming Pikmin mobile game.",
    "Currently we have nothing to go on in terms of the tech used for the device, or even a release date, and Niantic itself hasn\u2019t released any info outside of Hanke\u2019s tweet. Last month though, Microsoft showed off a Pok\u00e9mon Go proof of concept demo with its own HoloLens mixed reality device. This suggests that Niantic has been playing with the technology for some time now, and could be gearing up for a full announcement later in the year.",
    "We think there\u2019s great potential waiting to be tapped into with Niantic\u2019s AR glasses, especially when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon Go. And it makes sense that Niantic would want to grow the app even further, as Pok\u00e9mon Go had a phenomenal 2020, making $1 billion in revenue over a ten month period.",
    "If Pok\u00e9mon Go continues to grow year on year, then it\u2019s understandable that Niantic would want to supplement that growth with new ways to play. Niantic\u2019s AR glasses would likely overlay Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s augmented reality gameplay over your current real world location.",
    "The Pok\u00e9mon Go app might then be used as it normally is: aiming and throwing your Pok\u00e9ball to catch any critter you\u2019ve come across. We must admit, having your thrown Pok\u00e9ball immediately show up through the lenses of Niantic\u2019s AR glasses sounds like it could be a blast, if the transition from phone to glasses display is as smooth as it needs to be."
