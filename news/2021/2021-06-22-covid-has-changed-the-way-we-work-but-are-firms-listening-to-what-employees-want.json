  "summary": "Most employees want to work from home, but less than half of employers will allow it",
  "article": [
    "The vast majority of employees want to work from home in some capacity post lockdown - but fewer than half of employers will allow it, our new survey has found.",
    "The survey of over 1,200 US-based professionals, conducted by TechRadar Pro with SmartBrief, shows that there has been a seismic shift in attitudes towards hybrid working from both employers and employees.",
    "Fewer than 15% of workers said they wanted to return to the office full time, 85% said they wanted to work from home at least one day a week, with more than 25% preferring to work from home permanently.",
    "There has been some change in attitude from employers towards remote working, yet fewer than half (38%) have offered staff an opportunity to work from home either on a permanent or part-time basis yet, with nearly 20% of employees expected to return to the office full time as lockdown lifts.",
    "This attitude is reflected by the fact that only a quarter of employers will be implementing \u2018hot-desking\u2019 as part of their return to the office planning \u2013 a beneficial strategy if a company is looking to reduce office space with fewer staff coming into the workplace.",
    "This is in spite of the fact that, according to our data, employees would be fine having their work and hours tracked with software.",
    "Yet there are plenty of companies who are embracing the \u2018new normal\u2019 of office work.",
    "Google changed its stance on remote working after some pushback from its staff earlier in the year, while businesses such as HSBC, Salesforce, and Coinbase have all said they will provide more flexible working conditions in future, while 43 of the 50 biggest companies in the UK have said that employees won\u2019t come into the office full-time, with a mix of remote and office working.",
    "So is there an opportunity here for employers to scalp the best talent, if their flexible working policies match the aspirations of prospective staff?",
