    "ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, has just closed a deal to acquire Pico, one of HTC and Oculus\u2019 main rivals, and makers of the Pico Goblin 2 and Pico Neo 2 headsets.",
    "The financial details around the deal have yet to be disclosed, but according to CNBC ByteDance says that Pico\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive suite of software and hardware technologies, as well as the talent and deep expertise of the team, will support both our entry to the VR space and long-term investment in this emerging field.\u201d",
    "What\u2019s worth paying attention to in that statement is Pico\u2019s intention to enter the VR space and its plans to support VR long-term \u2013 language that mirrors what Facebook has said about Oculus in the past.",
    "On the surface, Oculus and Pico do have a lot in common: they each make standalone headsets with comparable specs and are supported by their own proprietary software. The fact that each is now tied to a major social media platform is both interesting and could be a bit of foreshadowing about where the VR space might be heading in the years to come.",
    "With so few details about the acquisition and ByteDance\u2019s plans for the future of Pico, it\u2019s hard to make any definitive predictions about what\u2019s going to happen in the VR space. That being said, the fact that ByteDance has a foothold in the social media space does seem to suggest that we\u2019ll see some interplay between the two companies.",
    "As UploadVR points out in its coverage of the story, there hasn\u2019t been any information about ByteDance expanding too far outside of its home in mainland China. That contrasts with HTC in Taiwan \u2013 makers of the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Focus headsets \u2013 which has become more of a household name.",
    "Should Pico make its way into international markets it\u2019s going to have a real fight on its hands against the Oculus Quest 2 \u2013 easily one of the best VR headsets out there right now \u2013 but with TikTok in its pocket, it has a captive audience to advertise to when it finally goes global."
