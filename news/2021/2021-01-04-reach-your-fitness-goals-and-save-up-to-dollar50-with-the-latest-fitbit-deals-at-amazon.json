    "For those who have New Year's fitness goals in mind, Amazon's latest Fitbit deals could just be the step you need to start the year on the right foot.",
    "Running on a budget? We recommend the new Fitbit Inspire 2 for just $78.95 (was $99) today at Amazon. This is the latest 'stripped-down' fitness tracker from Fitbit that forgoes GPS but retains all that activity and sleep monitoring Fitbits are known for. Another top budget option is the FitBit Charge 4 for $118.95 (was $149.95), which again offers a lightweight bangle-style build but gets you that coveted GPS functionality - great if you're planning on taking your activities offroad and want to monitor your levels over a long hike.",
    "The FitBit Versa 2 for $148.95 (was $179.95) is the next step up again and gets you that more 'smartwatchey' form-factor, GPS, music playback, and even Amazon Alexa functionality. Although not the latest version (See the Versa 3), it's still a great buy for those who want an all-in-one fitness and lifestyle device without breaking the bank.",
    "For those, however, who don't mind breaking the bank, we recommend checking out the new Fitbit Sense for $278.95 (was $329.95). This is the swankiest new fitness tracker from FitBit and features a gorgeous glass AMOLED screen, alongside a host of trackers that look to not only monitor your fitness and sleep, but also your stress levels.",
