    "The Moto G9 range didn\u2019t launch all that long ago but the next generation of the G range could be landing soon, as a source claims that the Moto G10 is \u2018upcoming\u2019. But that\u2019s not all \u2013 it will apparently be joined by the Moto G30 and Moto G100.",
    "That claim comes from leaker @Sudhanshu1414 on Twitter, and it would be a new naming scheme for Motorola, but no specs were shared so it\u2019s unclear how this trio will stack up. From the name it sounds like the Moto G100 could be a big upgrade on the Moto G10, but it might equally end up being essentially a Moto G10 Plus.",
    "Motorola had previously said though that it plans to use a Snapdragon 800-series chipset in some future Moto G phones. Those are high-end chipsets, so a phone with a name like the Moto G100 would be a clear candidate for it.",
    "We\u2019ve also previously seen the Moto G Nio leaked, which could be an alternate name for one of these phones. That itself is said to have a high-end Snapdragon 865 chipset, along with 8GB of RAM, a 5,000mAh battery, and a screen with a 105Hz refresh rate.",
    "In any case, while an exact release date wasn\u2019t shared, the claim that these phones are \u2018upcoming\u2019 suggests they\u2019ll probably land soon (assuming this leaker is right) so we might know their specs before long.",
    "And these three phones apparently aren\u2019t the only upcoming Motorola ones, as the source mentions the Moto E6i, Moto E7 Power, and Moto E7i Power too. No details on those are provided either, but they\u2019ll presumably join the rest of the Moto E7 range as super affordable handsets."
