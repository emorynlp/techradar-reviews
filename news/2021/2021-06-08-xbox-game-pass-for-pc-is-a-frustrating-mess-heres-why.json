  "article": [
    "There\u2019s no denying that Xbox Game Pass is one of the most appealing business models around. It lets subscribers download and play hundreds of games that span multiple genres, from triple-A blockbusters to indie darlings, all for a low monthly fee.",
    "This would usually be cause for much praise, but today we\u2019re talking about Xbox Game Pass for PC, where the situation isn\u2019t quite so rosy.",
    "Xbox Game Pass for PC is the antithesis of its console counterpart. While Game Pass on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S features its own neat and tidy section on the dashboard, the PC app remains an unorganized nightmare. Plagued with issues from day one like a confusing interface, semi-hidden options, poor optimization, page load bugs and more, Xbox Game Pass for PC is barely worth a look as it stands.",
    "And that\u2019s a crying shame, considering the things Xbox Game Pass for PC gets right. For one, it\u2019s bolted onto your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, so there\u2019s no need to pay extra for the service. There\u2019s also a bunch of games available to play on PC that aren\u2019t on the console version on Game Pass, such as Crusader Kings 3 and the Age of Empires series. Xbox Game Pass for PC could be great, but the following five issues are holding the service back.",
    "Checking out all games available on Xbox Game Pass for PC should be an easy endeavor, but the app makes sure this isn\u2019t the case. Clicking the \u201cAll PC Games\u201d tab does indeed take you to an overview of every game available on the app, but it routinely seems to arbitrarily give up loading the page.",
    "Sifting through the list, you\u2019ll often hit a block where the page ceases to scroll. That\u2019s not because you\u2019ve reached the end of the page (that\u2019s right, MotoGP 20 certainly isn\u2019t alphabetically the last game in the list), but rather that the page has decided it won\u2019t load anymore.",
    "This can be fixed by scrolling back up a bit, then scrolling down again to reveal more games that the app previously refused to show. But this has to be done continuously until you\u2019ve reached the end of the page, and sometimes even that doesn\u2019t work. For comparison\u2019s sake, Xbox Game Pass on console doesn\u2019t have this issue \u2013 \u201cAll Games\u201d will indeed show you all games from the get-go, making this PC bug all the more aggravating.",
    "Xbox Game Pass for PC is home to many games with significant file sizes, such as Gears 5, Control and Dirt 5. What you might not know is that you may want to think twice before even installing them on your system, lest you potentially forfeit that storage space long after you\u2019ve uninstalled the game.",
    "The issue here is that you technically don\u2019t own the games present on the Xbox Game Pass service. Your monthly subscription instead grants you access to the games in the library, most of which are only there for a limited period of time. As such, your PC often has to store crucial files in a \u201clocked away\u201d part of your storage to ensure they can be managed server side.",
    "This changes on a game-by-game basis, but some users have reported not being able to get that storage space back again after they\u2019ve uninstalled a game \u2013 those files are still being locked away for good.",
    "What\u2019s worse is that the official workaround from Microsoft seems to be to either reboot your PC via the Run function or seek help through the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter, hardly helpful advice for those who aren\u2019t as PC savvy \u2013 and an annoying workaround for those that are.",
    "Strangely, this isn\u2019t a bug. Xbox Game Pass for PC may not work as intended if you\u2019re not signed in on two different storefronts with the same account. In layman\u2019s terms, you have to be signed in to the Xbox Game Pass for PC app, and the Microsoft Store using the same account.",
    "Why? Because the app is tied to Windows 10\u2019s disaster of a storefront. If you haven\u2019t signed in to the Microsoft Store, you won\u2019t be able to run the games you\u2019ve downloaded on the Xbox Game Pass for PC app.",
    "To remedy this, click your account\u2019s icon in the top right corner of the Xbox Game Pass for PC app, followed by Settings. On the Account tab, click \u201cChange my Microsoft Store account\u201d and ensure you\u2019re logged in on both services with the same account. This shouldn\u2019t even need to be a step, but it\u2019s something you need to keep in mind each time you open the Xbox Game Pass for PC app.",
    "If you\u2019re an avid PC gamer, you likely won\u2019t have as many games installed via Xbox Game Pass for PC as you would on Steam, for example, so you'd think that sorting through your minimal library of downloaded games would be easy. And yet, the former\u2019s game sorting options are way too basic.",
    "The Collection tab on the left of the Xbox Game Pass for PC app displays all the games you have installed. The problem here is that there\u2019s little to no options to sort these games to your liking. You can display them in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order, and that\u2019s about it.",
    "Let\u2019s compare this to Steam, where sorting options are much more robust. You can create your own folders for specific types of games, for example. I personally love fighting games, so I have a folder in my Steam library dedicated to just that.",
    "On Xbox Game Pass for PC, I\u2019m simply not able to sort my installed games by genre, file size or anything of the sort. Granted, most installed libraries on Xbox Game Pass for PC won\u2019t be monolithic, but extra sorting options can never hurt and only add to the app\u2019s overall accessibility.",
    "Xbox Game Pass for PC falls into the same trap Windows 8 and (to a lesser extent) Windows 10 did: the need to make the app look flashy and stylish while leaving functionality as an afterthought.",
    "As a result, Xbox Game Pass for PC isn\u2019t well optimized, especially if your PC isn\u2019t blessed with high-end components that are required to run the app adequately.",
    "It doesn\u2019t help that screenshots, purchase options, DLC and achievements are placed front and center on each game\u2019s dedicated page, either. System requirements are buried under the \u201cMore\u201d option that\u2019s a lot smaller than it should be, and crucial accessibility information like photosensitivity warnings are tucked away at the very bottom of this menu, too, instead of being shown on any game\u2019s front page to help minimize risk.",
    "Xbox Game Pass for PC has a lot of work ahead of it, then, if it wants to become as organized and easy to use as its Xbox console counterpart. If Microsoft can address these issues, though, it will show that Xbox Game Pass is a formidable platform across both console and PC. So here's hoping the above issues can eventually become a thing of the past."
