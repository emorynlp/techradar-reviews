    "Microsoft has dismissed the idea that design elements set to debut with Windows 11 could have a detrimental effect on performance.",
    "In a Q&A session for developers, the company set out its vision for Fluent Design, a framework applied by Microsoft in-house and used by developers to create apps that feel as if they were designed natively for Windows.",
    "Microsoft also shared information about a new \u201cdesign material\u201d called Mica, housed under Fluent Design , which aligns the background color of certain applications (e.g. Edge, Teams, Settings) with the desktop, and creates a \u201ccolor hierarchy\u201d that helps distinguish between multiple open instances of the same app.",
    "In Windows 11, Mica will be applied in a range of scenarios, but Microsoft insists the introduction of greater intelligence to design elements will not come at the cost of performance.",
    "\u201cPerformance is really a top priority for us and we want to ensure that all these new functionalities (Mica and rounded corners) are super fast and don\u2019t impact the OS,\u201d explained the firm.",
    "\u201cFor example, Mica was specifically designed for higher performance when compared to things like Acrylic (ed: another design material). And for rounded corners, we optimized our rendering performance so you shouldn\u2019t notice any difference to square corners.\u201d",
    "Microsoft also took the opportunity to squash rumors that some Windows 11 design components (such as the new Start menu and rounded corners) were inspired by Apple\u2019s macOS.",
    "\u201cGood design tends to be similar,\u201d noted Kevin Gallo, Head of Developer Platform at Microsoft. \u201cWe learn from each other, but Fluent has been around a long time.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re evolving with how people use our devices - and that\u2019s changing all the time. [The design elements] may look familiar, but our goal is that they feel natural and normal.\u201d",
    "While Mica and other Fluid Design elements have already begun to bleed into Windows 11 preview builds, the process will be incremental as Microsoft slowly optimizes its new operating system. It won\u2019t be until launch, then, that users get to experience the fruit of Microsoft\u2019s new approach to design.",
