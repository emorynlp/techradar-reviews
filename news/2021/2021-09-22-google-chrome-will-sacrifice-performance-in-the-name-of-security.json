  "article": [
    "Future versions of Google Chrome may run slower in order to help safeguard user security, the team behind the web browser has revealed.",
    "Quoting earlier research that revealed that 70% of all security issues in Chrome concern memory safety bugs, the developers listed the various approaches it could take to improve the security of the browser, including imposing a slight performance penalty on future versions if this helps make it more secure.",
    "In a joint post, the members of the Chrome security team called application security a \u201ccat and mouse game\u201d, before discussing the available approaches and arguing that any practical solution would come with a slight performance hit.",
    "\u201cIn each case, we hope to eliminate a sizable fraction of our exploitable security bugs, but we also expect some performance penalty,\u201d wrote the researchers.",
    "In broad terms, compile-time checks, runtime checks, and using a memory safe language, are the three approaches that the developers reason could help make Chrome more secure.",
    "In an ideal world, they say they\u2019d have loved to make C++ safer at compile time, if it wasn\u2019t for the design limitations of the language.",
    "\u201cSo, we\u2019re mostly left with options 2 and 3 - make C++ safer (but slower!) or start to use a different language. Chrome Security is experimenting with both of these approaches,\u201d explain the developers.",
    "The developers list MiraclePtr as one of the solutions that will play a significant role in future Chrome security initiatives.",
    "Although the solution involves earmarking a portion of memory, which is a precious resource on a mobile device, the solution could help eliminate over half of the use-after-free bugs in the browser, according to the developers.",
    "At the same time, the team is continuing to look at how it can use a memory safe language, such as Rust, for parts of Chrome in the future.",
    "The search giant has some experience using Rust for this purpose as its Android security team is experimenting using the language in the mobile operating system\u2019s low-level system-code to reign in the number of Android memory-based security vulnerabilities.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve started to land limited, non-user-facing Rust experiments in the Chromium source code tree, but we\u2019re not yet using it in production versions of Chrome - we remain in an experimental phase,\u201d say the researchers, explaining that the use of Rust brings with it its own set of complexities."
