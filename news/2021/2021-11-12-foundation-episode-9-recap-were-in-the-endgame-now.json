    "Spoilers follow for Foundation episodes 1 to 9. Watch them before reading on.",
    "Foundation isn\u2019t messing around anymore. Apple\u2019s adaptation of Isaac Asimov\u2019s iconic sci-fi novels has had its ups and downs throughout season 1, but the show seems like it\u2019s finally delivering a spectacle worthy of its source material.",
    "That\u2019s true of Foundation episode 9, aka The First Crisis, at least. Foundation\u2019s latest entry provides a pulsating penultimate season 1 entry, with numerous shocks, well-choreographed action sequences and intriguing drama setting us up for a potentially explosive finale. And, no matter how good (or bad) episode 10 is, The First Crisis teases plenty of alluring plot threads that are likely to be picked up again in season 2 and beyond.",
    "For the first time since episode 5, Foundation focuses on two, not three, of its branching narratives. We\u2019ve been critical of previous entries that have only followed two storylines \u2013 they\u2019ve felt ponderous, for one \u2013 so we expected Foundation episode 9 to suffer a similar fate.",
    "And yet, from a storytelling perspective, The First Crisis flows really well. It doesn\u2019t feel slow nor struggles to fill its 57-minute runtime. In fact, it flies by so quickly, and is so enjoyable, that we were left disappointed when the episode was over.",
    "Of episode 9\u2019s two storylines, its Trantor-based one is arguably less important than the events of its Terminus arc \u2013 but only just.",
    "Picking up where things left off in episode 7, we find Brother Dawn and Azura plotting their escape from the Empire. Their plan to run away together, though, is far from straightforward.",
    "Why? Well, Brother Dusk is onto them. Meeting Dawn at the Empire\u2019s gigantic mural, Dusk subliminally reveals that he knows Dawn lied to him about how many gilliraptors he killed \u2013 six, not three as he\u2019d claimed \u2013 during their hunt in episode 6. He also lets on that he knows about Dawn\u2019s differences, including his color blindness.",
    "Startled by this revelation, Dawn hastily packs his belongings and decides to leave immediately. That is, until he\u2019s interrupted by Shadow Master Obrecht, who tells Dawn that Dusk wishes to see him. Assuming that Dusk\u2019s guards will whisk him away and kill him, Dawn repurposes his aura shield bracelet and knocks Obrecht out with a concussive blast. He escapes the pursuing guards, trades his bracelet for a poor person\u2019s jacket to use as a disguise in Trantor\u2019s slums, and makes his way to Azura\u2019s apartment.",
    "Given that Foundation has tended to weave seemingly small-scale moments into its narratives, which may have big pay-offs in the future, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if Dawn\u2019s trade with this beggar has repercussions. Will the bracelet fall into the hands of those who can determine how it works, manufacture it on a large scale and sell it to Trantor\u2019s population to protect them from the Empire\u2019s guards? It\u2019d be interesting if they did.",
    "Regardless, it\u2019s fascinating to see more of Trantor\u2019s societal hierarchy, which we last glimpsed in episode 2. Dawn\u2019s walk through Trantor\u2019s poorer districts offers us a window into a world outside of the imperial palace\u2019s aristocratic sensibilities, which allows us to see how Trantor\u2019s citizens struggle to survive even with the Empire on their proverbial doorstep.",
    "Dawn reunites with Azura and they prepare to escape. After Azura leaves the room for a brief moment, though, she returns in an unusual ensemble \u2013 and with a gun in hand. Cue shocked faces all round.",
    "Dawn evades her shots and, confused and feeling betrayed, tries to escape. He doesn\u2019t get far, however, before he\u2019s surrounded by Azura\u2019s friends, knocked unconscious and taken to an undisclosed location.",
    "This is where one of episode 9\u2019s major reveals takes place: there\u2019s another Dawn clone who escaped the imperial palace \u2013 and this one is in league with Azura and her gang.",
    "Wait, how is this possible? We learn that this other Dawn was stolen from the Empire\u2019s clone facility by Azura\u2019s gang, which was a plan decades in the making. Again, this speaks to Foundation\u2019s ability to lay the brickwork for events yet to come, showing that past narratives get some form of payoff in later episodes.",
    "But we digress: it was always the plan for Azura\u2019s gang to capture the escaping Dawn and, if successful, transfer his nanobots to their reprogrammed Dawn clone. The latter would return to the palace and act as their spy, who could help to bring about the fall of the Cleonic clone dynasty. Oh, and Azura\u2019s gang was also responsible for Dawn\u2019s color blindness and other differences. They altered his genetic makeup before he was \u2018born\u2019: further proof that they\u2019ve been playing the long game.",
    "While he\u2019s part of this cyclical dynasty that\u2019s tyrannically ruled over the galaxy, it\u2019s hard not to feel sorry for the Dawn that we\u2019ve followed throughout season 1. He\u2019s had no choice in any of this and, as a clone who seems to want to change how the Empire rules its citizens, it\u2019s slightly upsetting to see him used as a pawn in this way.",
    "When it appears that Azura\u2019s gang is about to get away with everything, though, hope (if that\u2019s the right word) springs eternal. Having followed the escaping Dawn using a dragonfly drone \u2013 the same one that Dawn used to spy on Azura in episode 3 \u2013 Dusk, Obrecht and the Empire\u2019s guards storm Azura\u2019s hideout. They kill the Dawn clone and everyone except Azura, who is arrested and told she\u2019ll stand trial ahead of her likely execution.",
    "Dusk berates Dawn for his naivety, which isn\u2019t surprising: Dawn has been extremely ignorant throughout this particular storyline. Dusk confirms that he knows of Dawn\u2019s differences, too, and the pair agree \u2013 reluctantly on Dawn\u2019s part \u2013 that Dawn\u2019s future will be decided by Brother Day, whose return from Maiden is imminent. It seems, then, that episode 10 may be the last time we see Azura and this incarnation of Dawn.",
    "As for the Terminus storyline, we\u2019re finally rewarded for sticking out season 1\u2019s most arduous narrative arc.",
    "Following episode 8\u2019s climactic scene, the Invictus has surprisingly space jumped to Terminus. Knowing that she doesn\u2019t have much time before it randomly jumps again, Salvor makes a potentially ill-fated attempt to reach Hugo\u2019s spacecraft, which she spots floating nearby.",
    "Before that, Salvor remembers to tend to the injured Lewis\u2019 wounds. Or she would if he wasn\u2019t already dead. Poignantly, it was Lewis who plugged himself into the Invictus\u2019 navigation module and transported them back to Terminus. Doing so, however, cost his life and, despite their differing opinions, his death hits Salvor hard.",
    "But there\u2019s no time to wallow in sadness. Salvor makes the perilous journey from the Invictus to Hugo\u2019s spaceship (just about) to try to contact Terminus\u2019 forces. When no one responds, Salvor realizes that the Vault\u2019s null field must have expanded in her absence. The race is on, then, to rescue everyone.",
    "Thankfully, Salvor\u2019s not alone in her attempts to do so. Hugo \u2013 yep, he\u2019s back again \u2013 suddenly reappears. He reveals that the Thespin Lancers, one of which he was stationed on, got caught in the Invictus\u2019 space jump and inadvertently travelled to Terminus, too. After a tearful reunion, the pair concoct a plan: Hugo and the Thespins will work out how to stop the Invictus from jumping again, and Salvor will head planetside to stop the Vault\u2019s null field from growing even more.",
    "Salvor lands on Terminus and the true extent of the Vault\u2019s impact is revealed: every living creature has been knocked unconscious and, if she doesn\u2019t hurry, they may not survive.",
    "Racing to the Vault\u2019s location, Salvor finds her mother near its original border \u2013 and she\u2019s holding Hari\u2019s Prime Radiant. Remembering that she tried to use the device once before, Salvor makes a connection between the Vault and Hari\u2019s prized possession. She purposefully instigates one of her mind seizures, which provides her with a link to Hari and Gaal Dornick\u2019s past conversations, to find out how to unlock the Prime Radiant.",
    "Returning to the present, Salvor uses the Prime Radiant to open the Vault and deactivate its force field. It all feels a bit easy from a plot device perspective but, hopefully, we\u2019ll get some proper answers about Salvor\u2019s links to Hari and Gaal in episode 10. Is she the daughter of one of them? Given that she\u2019s able to warp into their memories, we\u2019d be amazed if she isn\u2019t at this point.",
    "With the null field disabled, Terminus\u2019 population and its Anacreon invaders regain consciousness. It seems that a happy ending is in order \u2013 until the Thespins make landfall. A Western-style standoff ensues between all three parties until Salvor makes a proposition: Terminus, Thespis and Anacreon should form an alliance and use the Invictus as leverage to prevent the Empire (or any other invading forces) from attacking them.",
    "It\u2019s a proposal that everyone agrees to, apart from Phara. The Anacreons\u2019 leader, who had evaded the clutches of Hugo and the Thespins earlier on, still wants revenge on the Empire and refuses to cooperate.",
    "Suddenly, the Vault sends a pulse of light into the atmosphere. Thinking that it\u2019s an Empire weapon that\u2019ll destroy them all, Phara opens fire on it. Knowing she has to stop Phara, Salvor grabs Phara\u2019s bow and looses an arrow at her adversary. It flies into Phara\u2019s neck, which unsurprisingly causes her to choke to death. It\u2019s a grisly and slightly ironic death, all things considered.",
    "Just when it seems like episode 9 can\u2019t deliver any more enthralling moments, it has one left up its sleeve. A mysterious figure emerges from the Vault and, to everyone\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s Hari. Or, rather, it\u2019s a digital construct \u2013 similar to the one we saw with Gaal on the Raven \u2013 of the Foundation\u2019s former leader. Is it the same AI we\u2019ve previously seen or a new version? We\u2019ll have to wait until next week to find out.",
    "Foundation episode 9 is the series\u2019 best entry yet. The First Crisis superbly dials up the tension and draws two of its main storylines toward their respectively ominous and intriguing conclusions.",
    "Not only that, but it also provides action and drama in equal measure, delivers on the narrative promises that were set up earlier in the season, and produces numerous shocks and surprises. With no noticeable issues with its pacing, character decisions or set-pieces, too, The First Crisis is everything that we expected Foundation to be and more.",
    "With one entry left before the curtain falls on its first season, Foundation has definitely found its feet, and it seems set to supply a grandstand finish that\u2019s sure to leave us anticipating season 2\u2019s arrival. Here\u2019s hoping that it\u2019s all been worth it.",
    "New episodes of Foundation debut exclusively on Apple TV Plus every Friday."
