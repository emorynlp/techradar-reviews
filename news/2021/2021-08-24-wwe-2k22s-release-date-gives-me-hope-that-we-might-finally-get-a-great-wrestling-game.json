    "After months of speculation, WWE 2K22 finally has a release date \u2013 or more specifically, a release window of March 2022.",
    "Despite slipping to next year, I\u2019m delighted to see that developer Visual Concepts is taking the time it needs to deliver what will hopefully be a great wrestling game.",
    "After all, WWE 2K22 can\u2019t afford to be another flop that\u2019s panned by critics and ridiculed by players alike. The bug-riddled WWE 2K20 and prompt cancellation of WWE 2K21 means that there\u2019s extra pressure to get this one right. Should Visual Concepts fail to do so, it\u2019s hard to see any way back for a series that needs more than just hardcore wrestling fans to buy it, if it\u2019s to be successful.",
    "WWE 2K22 has to \u201chit different\u201d, then, just like the game\u2019s marketing slogan claims. And from the gameplay trailers we\u2019ve been shown, it\u2019s at least easy on the eye.",
    "Thousands of new animations and the use of an all-new face-scanning technology should make WWE 2K22\u2019s broad-shouldered superstars look like the real deal, but it\u2019s the gameplay that will ultimately decide whether WWE 2K22 will be king of the ring or another botch job.",
    "And wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a great wrestling game again? There was a period of time, particularly on the Nintendo 64, where wrestling games were some of the best titles available. From WCW vs nWo: Revenge to WWF: Wrestlemania 2000, wrestling games on the N64 provided a golden age for those who liked to knock the taste out of an opponent\u2019s mouth \u2013 and it\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t been replicated since.",
    "Aside from the odd Smackdown! title on PS2 like Here Comes The Pain and the unexpectedly brilliant Def Jam Vendetta, wrestling video games have consistently struggled to evolve as the generations have passed, culminating in the abysmal WWE 2K20 that only typified the problem.",
    "Encouragingly, we\u2019ve heard that WWE 2K22 features new controls that are \u201cmuch cleaner\u201d than previous titles, according to Forbes\u2019 Brian Mazique, who also said that the game is \u201clooking fantastic\u201d.",
    "But it\u2019s Mazique\u2019s quote that WWE 2K22 \u201cfeels like a wrestling fan\u2019s wrestling game\u201d that has me excited. I\u2019ve always felt that, despite nailing the core gameplay foundations that underpin every wrestling game many decades ago, nothing has come close to replicating the excellent rock-paper-scissors style setup of developer AKI\u2019s N64 games. The spirit meter, a mechanic that dictated the ebb and flow of a match, also hasn\u2019t been implemented in quite the same way.",
    "I\u2019m quietly optimistic, then, that WWE 2K22\u2019s overhaul of the controls and focus on pleasing core fans can only result in a positive outcome. The game needs to be accessible to those that are new to the series, of course, but deep enough to satisfy veteran players.",
    "WWE 2K22\u2019s delay into 2022 should be seen as a positive, but it\u2019s apparently put a strain on 2K Sports and developer Visual Concepts\u2019 relationship with WWE itself (thanks, Sports Gamers Online). According to SGO\u2019s sources, WWE hasn\u2019t been too happy with the game\u2019s slow development speed, and has reportedly gone as far as to threaten to cancel its contract with 2K Games and find another publisher.",
    "This has caused some tension between the development studio, who are desperate to get things right, and WWE who want to see a return on its investment sooner rather than later. Ultimately, though, the game was granted a delay, which should give Visual Concepts the time it needs to turn WWE 2K22 into a title contender.",
    "It should also give the developer time to ensure the game\u2019s roster is as up to date as it can be. WWE has released some notable superstars in recent months, including the likes of Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt, Rick Flair and Lana, so it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to hear that these superstars were previously scanned into the game but are now surplus to requirements.",
    "Like fighting on top of the hell in a cell, WWE 2K22 has no room for error. If the game fails to deliver, it's a long drop into obscurity."
