  "article": [
    "For a long time, the only thing Fitbit charged for was its devices and Fitbit Coach, the standalone exercise app that offers guided workouts. But in 2019, Fitbit launched Premium, a new paid-for service that puts several features behind a paywall.",
    "Premium is designed to be an enhanced version of the standard, free Fitbit app, but it also includes the workout programs previously exclusive to Fitbit Coach.",
    "There\u2019s a lot of neat stuff in Premium, but the service isn\u2019t for everyone. Below, we\u2019re going to explain exactly what it does, how much it costs, and who we think it\u2019s for.",
    "Fitbit Premium usually costs $9.99/\u00a37.99/AU$15.49 per month. You can subscribe from the Fitbit app by tapping the Premium tab and following the instructions.",
    "It\u2019s not a cheap service, but the good news is that Fitbit has extended its free trial from seven to 90 days, so you can try it for three months and, if it\u2019s not for you, cancel without paying a fee.",
    "Let\u2019s start with one of the first things you\u2019ll see if you subscribe to Fitbit Premium: Guided Programs. It\u2019s also one of the service\u2019s best features: this is where you can tailor your goals to the things that matter most to you.",
    "There are several programs to choose from including one for getting more sleep, one for kicking your sugar habit, and one to help anyone who\u2019s just getting into running.",
    "Each program runs for a select number of weeks and each will make you pick goals and reminders to ensure you\u2019re sticking to the schedule. The Get More Sleep program, for example, lasts two weeks and makes you set reminders to go to bed, and even offers up relaxing nature sounds to help you drift off.",
    "Meanwhile, the Get Active program will ask you to set daily step goals, as well as choosing a day of the week to push yourself a little further than usual. We like how these programs can be customized to make them work for your schedule and needs \u2013 they\u2019re not a one-size-fits-all.",
    "If you\u2019re tracking your slumber using Fitbit\u2019s free app, you\u2019re already getting some decent data to chew over, and even a few insightful bites of feedback.",
    "In Premium, you get two extra features: a \u2018Sleep Score\u2019, which is an overall number out of 100 that values the quality of sleep; and a \u2018Restoration\u2019 graph, which shows your sleeping heart rate and how much time you spent tossing and turning in the night.",
    "Our opinion? The sleep features aren\u2019t yet good enough to justify the Premium subscription; the features available in the free tier are definitely good enough.",
    "Premium also grants you access to a range of workouts inside the app, ranging from 15-minute yoga and HIIT sessions to 30-minute dance and kickboxing cardio. All of these come in the form of a video that you can watch in the app and workout along to \u2013 handy for perfecting your form and keeping you motivated, especially over those longer sessions.",
    "Each session is marked as 'Easy', 'Medium' or 'Hard' and gives you details on the parts of the body you\u2019ll be targeting and the number of calories the workout should burn. Once you\u2019re done with a workout, you\u2019ll be given the option to log the exercise to the app.",
    "It\u2019s important to note that while Fitbit Premium pulls in all of the exercises found on Fitbit Coach, the Coach app remains standalone, and there are still Fitbit Coach workouts you can do on-device with Fitbit\u2019s smartwatches. However, you\u2019ll need to open the Fitbit Coach app on the watch to do these, and they\u2019ll sync after.",
    "Back to Premium, and Fitbit also offers up some special \u2018Challenges\u2019 you won\u2019t get in the free tier, including a custom challenge that lets you set your own step, distance or active minute challenge. Fitbit\u2019s challenges are ways to compete with other users \u2013 think of them as another way to motivate yourself, and others.",
    "Insights are one of our favourite features of Premium, serving up useful observations about your activity and sleep. For example, it might tell you that your heart rate has been a little higher than usual and recommend ideas to relax.",
    "Fitbit will try to connect dots between different factors here, such as sleep, steps, heart rate etc for more advanced personalised insights. However, right now a lot of these insights often feel too generic. Our hope is that Fitbit\u2019s software becomes smarter over time as it gets to know us better.",
    "Another great feature of Fitbit Premium is that it will allow you to generate a wellness report containing heart rate, weight, sleep and activity data into an easy-to-read 30-day overview, followed by more detailed graphs for each.",
    "The idea is that you can share these reports with your doctor, your nutritionist, or anyone else with a vested interest in your health. Of course, how useful this is depends on how much your doctor/other trusts it, but it\u2019s much better than showing them an app.",
    "Speaking of, Premium\u2019s best feature may be yet to come. When the service was unveiled in 2019, Fitbit said it would eventually roll out a Health Coaching section where subscribers could speak one-on-one with a certified health coach through the app.",
    "To start with, Fitbit will be targeting users with chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, and coaches will work with users to build personalised programs and keep them on track.",
    "Sadly, this feature still hasn\u2019t rolled out at the time of writing, but we hope it won\u2019t be long.",
    "Right now, we think Fitbit Premium has two standout features. First, the guided programs, which can be effective for those who get easily overwhelmed by health and fitness programs, or those who just need to keep being nudged along.",
    "The second feature worth considering is the library of workouts that you can follow along. Some people find this a more motivating form of exercise \u2013 and it\u2019s cheaper than paying for an actual class!",
    "However, Premium still feels a little underbaked. The health coaching feature, which will connect users to trained professionals, still hasn\u2019t launched, and the sleep tracking improvements aren\u2019t yet worth it. For the time being, Premium will be most valuable for those who simply desire a bit more structure to their fitness \u2013 and if it\u2019s not working after a few months, you can always cancel it."
