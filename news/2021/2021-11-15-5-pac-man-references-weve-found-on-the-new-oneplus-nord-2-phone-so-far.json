    "By the end of 2021, the OnePlus Nord 2 Pac-Man Edition will be ready to buy, and it brings together one of the year\u2019s best mid-range smartphones with the gaming icon that first appeared in arcades in 1980.",
    "It\u2019s an odd pairing, but the new Pac-Man edition of the phone is packed full of references to the pizza-shaped hungry boy, and his first 40 years of gaming. OnePlus wants to position itself as a gaming phone brand, so this makes sense for those who like the look of the company\u2019s handsets and retro games.",
    "In terms of tech, this is the same OnePlus Nord 2 that we gave a 4.5-star review to earlier in 2021. That means it features a 6.43-inch 90Hz display, MediaTek Dimensity 1200 chipset, 50MP main camera, 32MP selfie camera and more.",
    "All the Pac-Man changes here are cosmetic - it just comes in a 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage variant - but we\u2019re able to run you through five differences we\u2019ve spotted while using the smartphone for the last few days.",
    "If you like Pac-Man, you\u2019ll enjoy the fact the mascot is adorning the rear of your phone alongside a grid of dots that he\u2019s likely planning on swallowing whole. There\u2019s no sign of any spooky ghosts on the rear of the OnePlus Nord 2, thankfully.",
    "Near the camera, you\u2019ll find the name of the handset is emblazoned down the side of the phone. That\u2019s it in terms of the design changes, until you use the OnePlus Nord 2 in a dark room.",
    "There\u2019s a glow in the dark effect, which reveals a hidden maze on the back of the handset. It looks like the maze you\u2019d find in Pac-Man 256 with the OnePlus logo hidden in it and the word Nord on the rear.",
    "This is a neat touch, and it isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve seen used on a smartphone before. It isn\u2019t bright enough to annoy you when you\u2019re trying to sleep with the handset nearby, so don\u2019t be too worried about it keeping you up at night.",
    "If an app on the OnePlus Nord 2 is made by OnePlus, you can expect it to have an 8-bit themed look. But this is just for the logo on the main page of the handset, so don\u2019t expect any theming when you open up apps.",
    "For example, the Calculator, Camera, Clock, Community, Files, Zen Mode and Gaming apps all come with this 8-bit look for the logo. It\u2019s a neat little touch, which some retro game fans will especially like on their phone\u2019s display.",
    "As soon as you boot up the Pac-Man edition, you\u2019ll find an animated wallpaper that is unique to the OnePlus Nord 2. You can\u2019t get this anywhere else.",
    "If you don\u2019t like this one, there are three other more subtle Pac-Man wallpapers that you can choose from if you want to change up the look. This is something we expected from the phone, but it\u2019s nevertheless a constant reminder that you\u2019ve bought a special edition handset.",
    "This won\u2019t be for everyone, but the mobile game Pac-Man 256 is pre-installed on the phone. It\u2019s an endless runner from the development studio that made Crossy Road, so expect a similar style of game.",
    "If you\u2019re into Pac-Man, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve already played this title as it was released in 2015. It\u2019s ready and waiting to play as soon as you boot up the phone though, so you won\u2019t need to download the game from the Google Play Store.",
    "A more subtle easter egg is that the small dot that tells you what page of the Quick Settings you\u2019re on has been swapped for a small Pac-Man. When you move pages, he\u2019ll switch directions and eat the dot to his side.",
    "It isn\u2019t a reason to buy this phone, but it\u2019s one of the more subtle easter eggs we\u2019ve spotted so far on this handset that makes it an interesting edition for retro game fans.",
    "We\u2019re sure there are many more easter eggs buried away in the OnePlus Nord 2 Pac-Man Edition. The company has been teasing them, and we\u2019re likely to see more people discover them when this handset comes out later in 2021."
