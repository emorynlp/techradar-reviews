    "Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) is already a pretty powerful little being in the Star Wars universe. In season 1 of The Mandalorian, the doe-eyed internet sensation used telekinesis to block and redirect flames, force choke foes (and sometimes friends) and launch a storming Mudhorn across the desert floor.",
    "Then, in season 2, the same Force-sensitive child meditated atop the Seeing Stone, levitating surrounding stones and creating a repellent forcefield that sent Mando (Pedro Pascal) flying.",
    "But Grogu may have even more powers up his sleeve for The Mandalorian season 3 \u2013 including one reserved for only the most powerful Jedi.",
    "According to recent comments made by series villain Giancarlo Esposito at GalaxyCon, Moff Gideon\u2019s pursuit of Grogu is \u201cfor a very different reason than many people think.\"",
    "\"This child has magic powers, [is] 50 years old, and can see the future,\u201d Esposito told a young fan, \u201cand we want everyone to know, eventually on this show, that [Grogu] could save our universe.\"",
    "So, in addition to levitating, choking and shield-making, Baby Yoda can apparently see the future \u2013 which is an ability we\u2019ve come across before in the troubled visions of Anakin and Luke Skywalker.",
    "It\u2019s fairly safe to assume, then, that Grogu will be returning for the show\u2019s third season, despite being whisked away by Luke for Jedi training during the dramatic season 2 finale.",
    "We already knew Gideon was interested in Grogu because of the latter\u2019s high midichlorian-count \u2013 which in turn led viewers to conclude that the villain\u2019s motive lay in reproducing and wielding Grogu\u2019s power in other beings \u2013 but it now seems the little green alien has a much higher purpose.",
    "If Grogu can \u201csave [the] universe,\u201d that means the universe must be in danger. At present, that existential danger isn\u2019t clear in the show \u2013 the main stakes have so far come from Mando\u2019s paternal relationship with Grogu.",
    "Interestingly, both Anakin and Luke were considered \u2018chosen ones\u2019 with a destiny to bring balance to the force. That sounds a lot like a destiny to save the universe, and if the parallels between Grogu and the Skywalkers continue, might the former have more in common with the dark side than we think?",
    "We\u2019ll have to wait until season 3 to find out \u2013 though that isn\u2019t likely to be before 2022. A spin-off show, The Book of Boba Fett, will be arriving first, and is anticipated to arrive in December 2021.",
