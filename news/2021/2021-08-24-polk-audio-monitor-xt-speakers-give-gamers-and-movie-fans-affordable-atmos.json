    "Polk Audio has unleashed a new Monitor XT range of speakers, giving various mix and match options for those who want to build their own hi-fi or home theater system, while still keeping things relatively affordable.",
    "The Monitor XT Series comprises of the XT70 and XT60 floor-standing speakers, the XT30 center channel speaker (or alternatively the XT35 low-profile center speaker), and the XT20 and XT15 bookshelf speakers, with the XT12 subwoofer.",
    "The range comes certified for Hi-Res Audio and Dolby Atmos, and in the latter case there\u2019s also the option of buying dedicated height speakers (XT90) which can sit atop the floor-standers (or XT20 bookshelf speakers), or indeed they can just be placed on a shelf.",
    "All these different speakers are timbre-matched, so you can buy whichever models you wish to put together into a system and be sure that the resulting overall sound will be consistent. In Polk\u2019s words: \u201cMatched components provide a unified sound field with seamless speaker-to-speaker blending for truly immersive listening experiences.\u201d",
    "Polk boasts that the Monitor XT speakers are good all-rounders and capable of enhancing the \u201cexperience of music, movies, TV and game sound\u201d.",
    "The subwoofer is a 12-inch 100W powered model and it provides \u201cpowerful and effortless\u201d bass, with the floor-standers also offering plenty of oomph in terms of their bass performance.",
    "The loudspeakers benefit from Hi-Res Audio Certified Terylene dome tweeters, and these enable playback up to 40kHz \u2013 beyond the range of human ears \u2013 to give a clear and spacious sound, Polk notes.",
    "The Monitor XT range comes in midnight black and the speakers are up on the Polk website now, although you can\u2019t order just yet \u2013 but they are labeled as \u201ccoming soon\u201d, so it shouldn\u2019t be long now. Pricing runs as follows:"
