    "A new Halo Infinite map has apparently leaked online, showing what could potentially be another Slayer arena for the game\u2019s popular multiplayer mode.",
    "Twitter user @LeakyHalo, who you won't want to follow if you want to stay free of spoilers, posted a two minute tour of what they\u2019re claiming is one of Halo Infinite\u2019s new multiplayer maps \u2013 and it certainly looks convincing.",
    "Using a free-roaming camera, it appears the map takes place in a hangar facility, with rockets taking off in the distance against the backdrop of a shattered moon. We also see a Sabre, one of Halo\u2019s iconic vehicles that was first seen in Halo Reach, though it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re able to commandeer it. The leaked map is clearly designed for Slayer and not Big Team Battle where vehicles come into play.",
    "This new Halo Infinite map isn\u2019t a complete surprise, however. Screenshots have been out in the wild for some time, as they were discovered in Halo Infinite\u2019s first big leak that occurred during the Halo Infinite technical preview. Details about the game\u2019s campaign also leaked, along with a voice recording that could point to a battle royale mode in Halo Infinite. This is our closest look yet of the leaked map\u2019s layout, though.",
    "We\u2019ve seen five Halo Infinite multiplayer maps in total so far: Live Fire, Bazaar, Recharge, Behemoth and Fragmentation, with Live Fire, Recharge and Bazaar all being playable during the Halo Infinite technical preview.",
    "If the multiplayer map leaks tell us anything, it\u2019s that Halo Infinite\u2019s development is close to being complete. The question is: can 343 Industries keep some surprises under wraps in the run up to launch?",
    "While Halo Infinite still doesn\u2019t have a confirmed release date outside of \u201cHoliday 2021\u201d, which falls between November and December, it feels like only a matter of time before Microsoft provides a definite launch date.",
    "Halo Infinite is set to release on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC, and will be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on day one. It marks a bumper year for Microsoft\u2019s new console with the releases of Flight Simulator, Psychonauts 2, Back 4 Blood, Forza Horizon 5 and Halo Infinite all coming to Xbox before 2022 rolls around."
