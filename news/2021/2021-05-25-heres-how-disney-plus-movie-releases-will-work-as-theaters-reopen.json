    "Disney CEO Bob Chapek has hinted at the future of the studio\u2019s theatrical releases and how this might impact Disney Plus\u2019 Premier Access service.",
    "In light of pandemic-induced cinema closures across the world, the media giant has so far opted for a hybrid release schedule in 2021, with some movies releasing directly to Disney Plus (Pixar\u2019s Luca, for example) and others heading straight to theatres (Shang Chi and Free Guy). A few titles, like Marvel\u2019s Black Widow, are releasing simultaneously in theatres and on Disney Plus\u2019 paid Premier Access service.",
    "At a JP Morgan talk, Chapek suggested Disney intends to \u201ccelebrate flexibility\u201d in terms of when and how its future products are made available to audiences, adding that the worldwide recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 coupled with the response to its imminent 2021 releases \u2013 will determine the number of movies released in any given format going forward.",
    "In many ways, then, the next few months represent a trial period for Disney. Chapek did, however, acknowledge the benefits of theatrical releases over straight-to-streaming equivalents, though clarified that the company\u2019s future strategy is largely dependent on audiences\u2019 willingness to return to theatres.",
    "\u201cTheatrical exhibition for us is a very good thing because it helps us build our franchises,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re seeing some hesitancy to return in a way that would look anything like normal.\u201d",
    "So, can we expect hybrid releases to continue indefinitely? \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to give consumers some flexibility,\u201d Chapek suggested, \u201cwhether we\u2019re looking at a theatrical exclusive window with a fairly dramatically shortened timing window between the first and second offerings, or whether we\u2019re looking at theatrical plus Premier Access or whether we\u2019re looking at taking something directly to our service.\u201d",
    "As for how Disney determines which movies are released via which strategy, Chapek confirmed that it\u2019s all dependent on the scale of the title. \u201cIf it\u2019s something like a Marvel movie or a Lucas [Star Wars] movie, something that\u2019s going to have a lot of legs playing into a larger mythology, then [going to a theater] is the way that fans tend to prefer to consume those movies.\u201d",
    "It\u2019s clear, then, that Disney\u2019s preference is to keep its big-budget franchises premiering in cinemas for the foreseeable future, albeit with shorter release windows and a greater emphasis on seeing those movies transition to streamers as quickly as possible.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like things are going to return to exactly how Disney released films pre-pandemic,\u201d Chapek confirmed, \u201cbut films will be arriving much quicker, and Disney Plus Premier Access may stick around a little longer if consumer habits change and it\u2019s financially successful.\u201d",
    "In some telling closing remarks, Chapek also hinted at the future of other major Disney properties.",
    "He said the company is ready to \u201cstep on the gas\u201d to shift its linear businesses like ESPN to a streaming-first model if it has to, though he also noted that these still generate a lot of income that help fund Disney's streaming offerings.",
    "Chapek also confirmed Disney\u2019s intention to integrate its theme parks with its streaming business, saying that, once parks re-open, the company will \u201caggressively move\u201d to tie the two together \u2013 whatever that might mean.",
    "Essentially, then, Disney has big plans for the future of its entertainment properties \u2013 but it\u2019s falling to audiences and the rate of pandemic recovery to determine when those plans are implemented."
