  "title": "Intel Alder Lake flagship CPU may not boost as fast as rumor mill hoped",
  "category": "computing",

  "summary": "But Core i9-12900K could still outperform Ryzen 5950X, speculation indicates",
  "article": [
    "Intel\u2019s Alder Lake flagship processor is the subject of a fresh leak, with a purported engineering sample having been spotted with a maximum (single-core) Turbo boost of 5.3GHz.",
    "The spec revelation came alongside a bit of benchmarking speculation, and was uncovered on the NGA.cn forum by renowned leaker @9550pro.",
    "The QS, or Qualification Sample, of the purported Core i9-12900K shows a top boost speed of 5.3GHz for the full-power cores, and 3.9GHz for the low-power cores, but as an engineering model, this CPU is not representative of the final product.",
    "Put your sceptical hat on here, because the source looks sketchier than usual, and doesn\u2019t provide any firm evidence like screen grabs for the benchmarking (which is also guesstimated; more on that later).",
    "So, we definitely shouldn\u2019t get too carried away with the idea that the max Turbo will be 5.3GHz, although it does make some sense in that it equals the Rocket Lake (11900K) flagship.",
    "As Wccftech, which flagged this up, reports, chatter online indicates some disappointment that a previous rumor of a 5.5GHz top speed for the 12900K isn\u2019t borne out here, but that seems like a stretch anyway (remember, Intel is purportedly cramming in a lot of cores here: 16 to be precise, even if half of them are low-power ones for the flagship).",
    "Naturally, performance isn\u2019t all about raw clock speeds anyway. Architectural gains supposedly promise something like a 20% improvement over Rocket Lake, and those \u2018little\u2019 low-power cores \u2013 which come alongside the standard full-power ones \u2013 could help to up overall performance considerably. We\u2019ve heard that before from prolific leaker Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead, and this new rumor also notes that the \u2018Gracemont\u2019 (power-efficient) cores are \u2018very powerful\u2019 in their own right (and not just something that\u2019ll be useful for laptops and battery preservation).",
    "That\u2019s a potential source of excitement, for sure, and the benchmarking provided with this leak shows a Cinebench R20 multi-core result where the 12900K outdoes the current AMD flagship Ryzen 5950X by almost 10%. However, this is actually only so much guesswork, building in a projected faster performance (and Turbo speed) than the engineering sample, meaning we need to employ huge pinches of salt here.",
    "Another interesting point with this Alder Lake spillage is the reinforcing of the rumor that Windows 11 is needed to get the most from these hybrid CPUs, due to that revamped operating system\u2019s scheduler improvements which are designed to get the most out of the mix of big and little cores.",
    "That could also mean that the performance of Alder Lake silicon won\u2019t just depend on the hardware itself, but also how Microsoft comes through in terms of tuning Windows 11 for Intel\u2019s next-gen CPUs. Given that, and the entirely different approach with the big.LITTLE-style architecture, there are a lot of variables in terms of how the 12th-gen processors will shape up.",
    "Intel\u2019s Alder Lake CPUs are expected to emerge towards the end of 2021, possibly around the close of October, though another rumor has pointed to November."
