    "The Asus VG248QE is proving that while 4K panels are beginning to take over the market, the days of 3D monitors aren\u2019t completely behind us. And, with Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals starting to pop up, they\u2019re certainly worth considering if you\u2019re looking to save some money.",
    "While we\u2019re undoubtedly glad that monitor and TV manufacturers have turned their efforts towards making 4K displays \u2013 and they\u2019re certainly making converts out of many of us, 3D monitors have been some of the most useful display tech we\u2019ve ever had. That\u2019s been exemplified by the Asus VG range of 144Hz monitors.",
    "The elevated refresh rate necessary to achieve stereoscopic 3D has led to some amazing advances in modern gaming monitors. We\u2019re now getting more accurate color reproduction than yesteryear\u2019s TN panels, with faster response times, which will just be awesome for users that play fast paced games.",
    "However, it\u2019s still the 144Hz refresh rate that gets us hyped about the surviving models of the latest 3D movement. This means the TN panels with their fast refresh rates can get a bit expensive. In fact, you can pick up a decent 27-inch 10-bit IPS display for about the same price as this Asus TN panel. So, it can be hard to figure out what\u2019s right for you.",
    "More specifically, is the Asus VG248QE right for you?",
    "Asus's VG range of 3D screens have all been solid performers, offering the full Nvidia 3D Vision 2 experience, with Lightboost tech to make the best of the stereoscopic 3D's numerous failings.",
    "Outside of the 3D modes they're great monitors, offering a smooth desktop experience with a top-of-the-range 144Hz refresh rate and that excellent new spin on TN technology.",
    "The Taiwanese company has also been smart in removing the built-in IR receiver and bundled 3D Vision goggles from the most recent screens, such as the VG278HE. Now you won't find yourself accidentally firing up Skyrim with a hunk of plastic strapped to your face, filling you head with blistering headaches.",
    "Luckily, it\u2019s more affordable this time. It\u2019s just a shame that this 24-inch version isn't all that cheaper than the 27-inch model. We were hoping the smaller size would represent a more budget-oriented entry into the glorious new 144Hz world, but you\u2019re only saving about \u00a360.",
    "That said you are still getting the same native resolution, full tilt/rotation, a VESA-compatible stand and great image quality, but a sub-\u00a3300 price-tag would have been nice. That's especially true given what BenQ has managed to do with its XL2411T. It's almost \u00a3100 cheaper than this 24-inch Asus screen, and the only real difference we can make out is that this panel is rated at 144Hz, as opposed to the 120Hz of the BenQ.",
    "Most users would agree that a decent 120-144Hz monitor is great for gaming, minus forking out for an Nvidia 3D Vision bundle. Sure, Asus has some impressive screen tech in its monitor lineup, but it needs to get a lot more competitive in terms of pricing, given the value on offer from both BenQ and Iiyama at the time of this writing."
