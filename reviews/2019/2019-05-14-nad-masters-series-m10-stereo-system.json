    "There was a time when hi-fi made a virtue of complexity. If a system wasn\u2019t made up of multiple components and a lavish amount of wiring, well... it just wasn\u2019t proper hi-fi, was it? Those days, thankfully, are gone \u2013 and the latest product in NAD\u2019s Masters Series, the M10 stereo system, is a testament to how far we\u2019ve come.",
    "There\u2019s no merit to making products that are difficult to use, a pain in the neck to maintain or ruin our otherwise-delightful interior decor: give us performance and convenience, or get out of our sight.",
    "Today\u2019s market leading products are sure to combine performance and convenience in a manner unlike the traditional hi-fi we started out with \u2013 even if, at $2499 (\u00a32,199 / AU$3,999) the M10 needs quite an investment to do so.",
    "So it is with the Masters Series M10, which manages to make an all-in-one stereo system look like the simplest thing in the world.",
    "The M10 may be nicely compact at just 10 x 22 x 26cm, but it looks and feels like a premium product \u2013 as it should, given the premium pricing.",
    "The subtly brushed aluminium chassis, which is gently curved at the corners, is of a single piece. The top panel and display screen as covered with expensive, high-performance Gorilla glass. As far as creating a strong visual impression and offering a bit of unexpected tactility too, the NAD is right on the money.",
    "Better still is the big, bright, high-resolution TFT touchscreen display. The display is customisable, so you can name inputs as you please, tag them with visual icons, and show off album artwork in a big way during listening sessions. Not to mention the virtual VR meters, which offer a pleasing throwback to the flickering volume displays of old.",
    "It\u2019s easy to get carried away when designing something as self-consciously lifestyle-orientated as the M10, but NAD has confidently walked the thin line between \u2018sophisticated\u2019 and \u2018dull\u2019. The M10 is quite obviously a high-spec, high-price product, but it doesn\u2019t make a song and dance about it.",
    "So can there possibly be room inside such a discreet box for all the hi-fi functionality the discerning customer craves? Well, the NAD M10 may not be the answer to every single one of your home entertainment desires, but it\u2019s had a pretty good stab at covering most of them.",
    "In terms of attaching sources to the M10, you\u2019ve plenty of options. Ethernet and wi-fi connectivity is available, naturally, and in addition there\u2019s digital coaxial, digital optical, an eARC HDMI input, two analogue stereo RCA connections and aptX HD Bluetooth for good measure. Bluetooth pairing is available via NFC and, as the M10 acts as both receiver and transmitter, it\u2019s ready to pair with wireless headphones \u2013 just as well, seeing as there\u2019s no physical headphone output.",
    "There are, however, outputs for loudspeakers as well as pre-outs for use with a power amplifier, and not one but two pre-outs for use with additional subwoofers \u2013 in case you love bass enough to really risk ruining your relationship with your neighbours. Connections for 12v triggers and IR relays are also available should you wish your M10 to become part of a wider custom-install system.",
    "This generous selection of inputs all lead to 100 watts of NAD\u2019s \u2018Hypex nCore\u2019 amplification, which should be ample to drive even truculent loudspeakers. \u2018Hypex nCore\u2019 is an unnecessarily complicated way of describing NAD\u2019s take on Class D amplification \u2013 the idea being it provides all the Class D advantages of efficiency with none of the noise or distortion drawbacks. It\u2019s certainly proved effective in the NAD Masters Series products it\u2019s appeared in before now.",
    "The digital inputs are served by an over-specified ESS Sabre 9028 DAC. This 32bit/384kHz monster puts hi-res audio firmly on the menu via DSD, FLAC, MQA or any other file variety you may favour. As far as DACs for domestic use go, it\u2019s as low-noise, low-jitter and thoroughly accurate a device as you\u2019ll come across.",
    "Controlling the M10 can be done using that big touchscreen display \u2013 it\u2019s fast and responsive. But if poking at your hi-fi isn\u2019t what you want from 21st century home entertainment, you may prefer to use the BluOS control app (iOS and Android).",
    "The BluOS app bundles in Spotify, Amazon Music, Tidal and Deezer streaming functionality as well as internet radio (Radio Paradise, Tuneln, and the like) and a host of lesser-known services inside the app. With BluOS running on any number of well-received Bluesound and DALI products, too, the wider world of multiroom functionality is within the M10\u2019s grasp too.",
    "The BluOS app has a clean interface and is straightforward to use, but isn\u2019t 100% reliable. The app can freeze when switching between one of the physical inputs and a streaming service \u2013 very occasionally, but still more than we\u2019d like.",
    "There\u2019s also the option to control the NAD using Amazon Alexa via the BluOS skill in the Alexa app. And if Siri is not available by the time you read this, it very soon will be.",
    "The NAD M10 comes complete with Dirac Live room correction technology. Using the bundled mic and yet another almost-entirely-reliable app, Dirac Live will analyse your room and speakers to optimise the M10\u2019s performance. It\u2019s a proven system and it works pretty well.",
    "So your room\u2019s been corrected and you\u2019ve added your Tidal account to the BluOS app. As everyone knows, Tidal Masters (which is MQA-based) is the world\u2019s best-sounding streaming service, so what better place to start?",
    "Turn the Light (Karen O and Danger Mouse) shows exactly what the NAD is capable of. The simmering, low-temperature recording sounds spacious, detailed and completely natural. The management of rhythm and tempo has the sort of effortless accuracy that\u2019s the hallmark of a thoroughly capable device.",
    "The fluid bass guitar underpins the tune with real authority, giving the classic disco tempo weight and agility. The voice in the midrange is loaded with character, the tiny details of tongue and teeth meaning the M10 paints a complete vocal picture, while at the top end the percussive sounds shine without sounding harsh or overstated.",
    "The whole of the frequency range is confidently integrated, meaning there\u2019s a genuine sense of unity to the recording. This sense of timing is by no means a hi-fi given, no matter how much money you part with, but the NAD sounds assured.",
    "A switch to the perky orchestral grind of Saint-Saens\u2019 Suite in D Minor: Tarantelle (as a 24bit/96kHz download) gives the M10 the chance to show off its dynamic prowess as well as its ability to organise a soundstage. There\u2019s proper coherence to the way the NAD lays out a stereo image, making the position of each player in the orchestra relative to his or her colleagues quite explicit. And it puts meaningful distance between the quiet, tension-filled moments of a piece and the all-out climactic assault.",
    "It\u2019s a similarly full-figured, well-organised and generously detailed story when trading downwards (in file-quality terms) to a CD of Mild High Club\u2019s Timeline, or listening to a vinyl copy (via a Leema phono stage) of Four Tops\u2019 Greatest Hits. The M10 paints a broad and believable picture, letting the music speak for itself without sticking its oar in too noticeably.",
    "Perhaps its only meaningful shortcoming concerns the levels of attack and drive it\u2019s able \u2013 or unable \u2013 to muster. Nobody wants to hear a song as controlled and calculated as the Danger Mouse/Karen O collaboration prodded forward against its will. But some music needs \u2013 in fact, demands \u2013 to be shown the whip.",
    "Giving full rein to Sonic Youth\u2019s 100% (via Tidal Masters) is pretty much essential, but the NAD seems a little reticent. It\u2019s reluctant to properly sink its teeth into the tune, which is a scuzzy amalgam of overdriven bass, further-overdriven guitar and what sounds like Mike Tyson on drums \u2013 and the result is a sound that\u2019s a little too polite for its own good.",
    "For any number of prospective customers, of course, erring on the side of caution is never a bad thing: nobody wants a system that\u2019s constantly got its eyes out on stalks. But some music thrives on the dirt beneath its fingernails, and when push comes to shove the M10 is just a little tentative.",
    "The pluses outweigh the minuses in quite a big way here. It\u2019s expensive, sure, but the NAD M10 is a beautifully made, extensively specified all-in-one stereo system (with a hint of home cinema functionality thrown in) with about as much future-proofing as anyone without a foolproof crystal ball can realistically provide.",
    "The M10 is almost as lovely to look at as it is to listen to, and as long as your music tastes don\u2019t center exclusively around amphetamine-crazed thrashers, it\u2019s a grown-up and talented listen. As long as you can budget for the speakers to do it some justice, there\u2019s really no reason not to consider the M10 for your home stereo system."
