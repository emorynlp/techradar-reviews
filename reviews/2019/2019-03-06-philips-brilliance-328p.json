    "The Philips Brilliance 328P is a little more expensive than many other 4K panels thanks to a price of $655 (about \u00a3499, AU$925) \u2013 but it does provide loads of features to try and justify that cost to a professional audience.",
    "It\u2019s got its huge 4K resolution, of course, and it also serves up HDR, a 10-bit screen and lashings of versatility. Can we be convinced?",
    "This screen will set you back about $655 (about \u00a3499, AU$925).",
    "That price has come down by around $100 (about \u00a3100, AU$100) since the 328P made its debut, but it\u2019s still around $100 (about \u00a3100, AU$100) more than you\u2019ll pay for a more affordable 4K screen \u2013 although those panels probably won\u2019t have 10-bit color or HDR.",
    "It\u2019s also possible to save a little more cash if you opt for a 28in 4K screen, although moving to a smaller panel has its own pros and cons \u2013 namely a sharper image but a physically smaller panel.",
    "The Philips Brilliance 328P\u2019s 10-bit screen is a solid start for work tasks where color accuracy is key \u2013 that attribute means that the Philips can display 1.07 billion shades of colour. Many other 4K panels use 8-bit screens that can only display 16.7 million colors.",
    "That\u2019s vital for high-end design work \u2013 the extra colors mean better individual tones, more depth and subtler gradation between shades.",
    "The 3,840 x 2,160 resolution delivers a density level of 140ppi, which is great \u2013 text, images and applications will be pleasingly crisp. It also means you\u2019ll have loads of real estate for multiple windows and applications.",
    "The Philips stacks up against the LG 27UD88, which costs $630 (about \u00a3600, AU$1,122). That panel has a 4K resolution too, but its 27in diagonal means a density level of 163ppi. Its images will be a little crisper, but you may prefer the physically larger size of the 32in Philips for work.",
    "The 328P has HDR, and the protocol used is called VESA DisplayHDR 600. As far as HDR standards go, it\u2019s mid-range \u2013 VESA has weaker DisplayHDR 400 and 500 protocols, but a DisplayHDR 1000 specification that\u2019s better.",
    "The DisplayHDR 600 standard demands a screen achieves a 600cd/m2 backlight level for short periods and a 350cd/m2 backlight for prolonged periods in order to give HDR content the requisite boost to color and contrast.",
    "DisplayHDR 600 also requires a 0.1cd/m2 black level, and 90% coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut.",
    "The LG 27UD88 doesn\u2019t have HDR, but it\u2019s not unusual to find this technology creeping into 4K panels at this price. However, they often use the DisplayHDR 400 standard, which only requires a 320cd/m2 prolonged brightness level and a 400cd/m2 burst brightness \u2013 easier figures to achieve on cheaper screens, of course, but figures that make for a less impactful HDR experience.",
    "By way of contrast, the DisplayHDR 1000 standard specifies a 1,000cd/m2 burst measurement and a 600cd/m2 consistent backlight \u2013 so it will have more impact on HDR content than DisplayHDR 600.",
    "And then there\u2019s the question of the content itself. There isn\u2019t a vast amount of HDR content around \u2013 so you\u2019ll only see the true benefit in the future.",
    "The 328P doesn\u2019t have a clean bill of health when it comes to its headline feature, and in other areas its hardware continues to toe the line between impressive and ordinary.",
    "Take the VA screen. VA technology generally delivers great contrast that beats IPS panels, but VA usually falls behind when it comes to color accuracy.",
    "The 328P\u2019s reliance on VA comes down to cost \u2013 as VA screens are cheaper than IPS equivalents. Screens with 32in, 4K IPS screens tend to cost a couple of hundred pounds or dollars more than the Philips.",
    "The 60Hz refresh rate is ordinary, and isn\u2019t accompanied by any syncing technology. That\u2019s fine for work, but it does mean that this screen won\u2019t be noticeably fluid when compared to panels that do have syncing or higher refresh rates.",
    "The response time is middling, too, at 4ms \u2013 fine for work, but not good for fast-paced movement.",
    "The 328P\u2019s base attaches to the stand with one screw, and four more secure the stand to the screen. The attachment at the rear can also be used with VESA 100 mounts.",
    "This screen means business when it comes to aesthetics. It\u2019s got chunky bezel, dark plastic and metal, and a subtle stand. It\u2019s not eye-catching, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.",
    "It does weigh 20.3 pounds (9.23kg), though, and it has a maximum height and width of 25.8in (657mm) and 29.2in (742mm) \u2013 so it\u2019s reasonably large and heavy.",
    "The 328P has huge versatility. There\u2019s a lofty 7in (180mm) of height adjustment alongside swivelling, tilting and portrait mode operation. LG\u2019s panel has all of this except swivelling.",
    "At the rear you get two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 connector. There are four USB 3.1 ports and a USB Type-C connector. The LG had plenty of ports, but it wasn\u2019t quite as good here.",
    "The two 3W speakers produce adequate sound for casual music, and there\u2019s a Gigabit Ethernet port at the back \u2013 a rare and welcome addition.",
    "It\u2019s not all good news, though. The screen is little wobbly and the vertical movement is a little stiff. The ports face downwards and are installed at the back, which makes them awkward.",
    "The OSD offers inconsistent quality, too \u2013 the actual on-screen display is sensibly organised, but the four touch-sensitive buttons aren\u2019t good.",
    "They\u2019re very sensitive, there\u2019s no haptic feedback, they have icons that are tricky to see and they\u2019re next to the identical power button \u2013 so it\u2019s too easy to press a button repeatedly or even turn the screen off by accident.",
    "So, to sum up, the Philips Brilliance 328P has impressive brightness, black point and contrast levels, and it delivers a reasonable boost to HDR content \u2013 but other HDR products will offer more dramatic improvements.",
    "Color accuracy and gamut coverage is good, but the most demanding designers and workers won\u2019t be sated by this screen\u2019s backlight inconsistency and lack of Adobe RGB adherence.",
    "The Philips Brilliance 328P delivers good image quality, but it rarely ascends beyond that level.",
    "Take its brightness measurement of 456cd/m2. It\u2019s a fantastic figure for any normal screen, and it exceeds the 350cd/m2 figure required for consistent DisplayHDR 600 \u2013 but it\u2019s short of that protocol\u2019s burst brightness requirement.",
    "The black measurement of 0.14cd/m2 is great, too, but it\u2019s not quite as low as the 0.1cd/m2 black point demanded by DisplayHDR 600.",
    "What does this mean in the real world? For starters, a contrast ratio of 3,257:1. In conventional terms, that\u2019s brilliant.",
    "It means that you\u2019ll get incredible quality when it comes to vibrancy, depth and variety at light and dark ends of the spectrum. That\u2019s great for work, because it means more detail, more complex colours and better depth \u2013 and it\u2019ll make movies and games look top-notch too.",
    "However, when it comes to HDR, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. HDR content does look pretty punchy on this screen when compared to normal content, and the 328P does offer a more dramatic improvement than screens that adhere to the weaker DisplayHDR 400 and 500 standards",
    "However, those brightness and black point figures could be better when it comes to HDR, so it also means that pricier HDR panels that meet the DisplayHDR 600 standard \u2013 or higher protocols still \u2013 will give better results. On the 328P you get an improvement from HDR, but not a transformation.",
    "Philips claims that the 328P has a sub-2 Delta E, but the monitor only hit this figure in its sRGB mode, where it delivered a great result of 1.25. At factory settings it could only manage a 2.52 Delta E. Neither results are bad, but we\u2019d definitely use the sRGB mode at all times.",
    "The panel\u2019s color temperature of 6,639K is better, but these figures do mean that colours aren\u2019t quite as accurate as they could be.",
    "The 328P displayed 100% of the sRGB colour gamut, which is superb for most work. The screen also displayed 96.2% of the DCI-P3 gamut, which is used for HDR.",
    "However, this screen only handled 83.3% of the Adobe RGB gamut \u2013 which means that the panel does fall short when it comes to handling the extra colors required for high-end design work.",
    "Uniformity isn\u2019t great, either. The 328P lost 22% and 17% of its backlight strength in its top-left and top-right corners. That\u2019s not ruinous, but the 328P could be more consistent.",
    "The Philips Brilliance 328P has fantastic contrast, which means vibrancy and depth in normal situations as well as a reasonable HDR boost. Color quality is good, too.",
    "Its solid performance \u2013 alongside its 32in diagonal and 4K resolution \u2013 mean that it offers ample quality for most work tasks and for HDR content.",
    "The 328P offers loads of port and position versatility, too, and the price is decent considering the features on offer.",
    "However, while HDR content does look acceptable on this panel, it could be better \u2013 because the 328P doesn\u2019t quite meet all the requirements of its mid-range HDR specification.",
    "The screen falls short of covering the Adobe RGB gamut, which will impact on some high-end work tasks, and Delta E only improved when we fiddled with the settings.",
    "Uniformity is also a little disappointing, movement can be awkward, and the ports aren\u2019t too accessible.",
    "For the vast majority of people, the Philips 328P performs well \u2013 you\u2019ll only need to look elsewhere if you\u2019re particularly demanding. And, while its HDR could be better, it\u2019s a reasonable offering considering the price. The 328P is an excellent screen, and you\u2019ll only have to spend more if you\u2019re one of the minority who needs something with even more quality and accuracy.",
