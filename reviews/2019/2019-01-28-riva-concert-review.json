  "summary": "A Sonos challenger with greater ambition than execution",
  "verdict": "Despite its overwhelming likeness to Sonos\u2019 most affordable smart speakers, the Riva Concert bravely stands out from the smart speaker crowd with a couple of unique selling points - vast connectivity, and portability via an optional built-in battery. But it fails to truly compete with similarly priced, class-leading rivals, such as the Sonos One, when it comes to sound quality - and that prevents it from gaining our wholehearted approval.",
  "pros": [
    "Reliable and intuitive Riva Voice app",
    "Vast connectivity",
    "Loud, very listenable sound"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Lacks the sonic clarity and insight of class leaders",
    "No multi-room support yet",
    "Absent of some music streaming apps"

    "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...in which case Sonos should be truly honored by the Riva Concert\u2019s arrival. The smallest of Riva Audio\u2019s two Alexa-enabled WiFi speakers, the Concert bears more than a passing resemblance to the Sonos Play:1 with its cylindrical build, wraparound aluminum mesh top, tailed by a black strip, and top-panel control buttons. Universal aesthetic appeal: check.",
    "The likeness is about as subtle as Shaggy and Scooby, but you\u2019d quickly ring a few disparities in a Spot The Difference. Firstly, the Concert is slightly larger in every dimension \u2013 taller (at 7 inches), wider and deeper (both at nearly 5 inches) \u2013 although we\u2019re talking mere millimeters difference.",
    "The prominent buttons are more akin to those you\u2019d spy on an Amazon Echo smart speaker, complete with the iconic blue light ring that illuminates to show source selection. Plus, the Riva logo (which lights up during Alexa commands) is proudly brandished on the front.",
    "But actually, the newer Sonos One speaker is generally the more apt comparison \u2013 what with the Concert\u2019s Amazon Alexa voice assistant support and the same $199 / \u00a3199 price tag hung around its neck (that works out at around AU$365, but it doesn't look like the Concert's available in Australia just yet.)",
    "The question is, can the Riva Concert further that analogy by matching its rival for class-leading features and performance?",
    "Things get off to a strong start. Power up the Concert, and once you\u2019ve downloaded and opened the Riva Voice app (free from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store), the in-app set-up instructions are intuitive and grandparent-proof. The whole process is only as long as it takes to make a brew.",
    "From there, you have a choice of music sources. Streaming services span Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited and TuneIn Radio, with Airplay, as well as DLNA for streaming networked files (up to 24-bit/192kHz) stored on a media server, also available over WiFi.",
    "Internet down? Then you have 3.5mm and USB (the latter is also a charging port) inputs in addition to Bluetooth. So while you miss out on the built-in access to other streaming services such as Apple Music, Tidal and Deezer, the Riva can at least play their catalogues via Bluetooth.",
    "Offline connectivity also justifies the existence of Riva\u2019s optional Arena battery pack, which offers 15 hours playback on the fly \u2013 plenty of juice for even the most hardcore summertime picnic-er.",
    "The Riva app is more functional than fancy \u2013 scrolling through media server libraries is in list form, which can be fairly wearisome when they are thousands of songs strong. But credit to Riva, and to borrow a Steve Jobs adage, \u201cit just works\u201d.",
    "We can only hope that bringing extra Riva speakers into a multi-room mix won\u2019t spoil app stability, however at this time multi-room functionality (that is, the ability to group and simultaneously control multiple Riva speakers around a household) is on the Concert\u2019s \u2018coming soon\u2019 list.",
    "Present and correct at this time is Amazon Alexa voice control, which, for the uninitiated, allows users to control music playback and ask questions from their Riva hands-free with just the sound of their voice.",
    "You can, for example, demand that a specific song, artist, album, radio channel or playlist be played, or that volume level be changed to a figure between one and ten. You can ask for weather, calendar and local information, set an alarm, control other Alexa-enabled home devices or simply save yourself a Google search. What\u2019s the distance between London, UK and Sydney, Australia? \u201c10,600 miles as the crow flies,\u201d apparently. Take note, though: Alexa calling and messaging is not currently supported on the Riva Concert.",
    "Riva has clearly built adequately sensitive microphones into the Concert, as even across a room, and even during music playback at mid-to-high volume levels, you don\u2019t have to raise your voice to be heard and obeyed.",
    "There\u2019s a privacy button to mute the speaker\u2019s microphones so there\u2019s no risk of Alexa interrupting, and even more handy is the ability to change the volume of Alexa independently of your music\u2019s volume in the app settings. Because let\u2019s face it, Alexa can be annoying.",
    "By and large, the Concert\u2019s user experience receives the same acknowledgement as a lucky losing Gladiator: a thumbs-up approval. They move towards a middling position when it comes to sound quality, mind you.",
    "The Concert\u2019s three ADX drivers and three passive radiators (one each on the speaker\u2019s front and both sides) chuck out a room-filling sound that belies the speaker\u2019s compact size and modest-on-paper 50-watt output. Whether we stream directly from Spotify, or play BBC Radio 2 over AirPlay, or Tidal over Bluetooth, the Concert\u2019s rendition of whatever is thrown at it is very listenable. Musical, even.",
    "There\u2019s a likable warmth and tonal balance to the Riva\u2019s presentation, and as we tune into Spoon\u2019s 'Inside Out' we\u2019re pleased with the bass heft on offer.",
    "But compared to the forerunning Sonos One, it\u2019s performance is lacking. We play Patrick Wolf\u2019s 'The Magic Position' on both speakers and the opening guitar strums and violin scrapes are much more tangible through the Sonos. There\u2019s a greater sense of space between instruments and more detail goes hand in hand with greater dynamic insight.",
    "Over to 'The Optimist' by Anna von Hausswolff, and the Riva\u2019s rendition lacks the dynamic variation in the piano-playing, as well as the transparency to uncover the subtle inflections of her haunting vocal, to really pull you in.",
    "The Sonos is much clearer, too, making the Concert sound comparably compressed, like it\u2019s been sat on. That\u2019s only made worse by selecting the \u2018power\u2019 mode in the app, so we\u2019d keep it on its default setting, \u2018Trillium\u2019 \u2013 Riva\u2019s patented technology that works to upmix a song\u2019s stereo signal and outputs it through three channels to virtually create a bigger soundstage.",
    "It\u2019s an easy technology to praise considering the sizable sound kicked out by the Riva, but ultimately the world is well furnished with better-sounding smart speakers.",
    "The Riva Concert has immediate appeal thanks to its well thought-out design, vast connectivity and positive user experience.",
    "But unless you\u2019re particularly keen on physical connections and/or the Concert\u2019s portability option, we can\u2019t recommend that it take the top spot on your smart speaker shopping list due to its uncompetitive sound quality at its price. And because of that, our thumbs are still horizontal."
