    "Asus has been long known to make some interesting looking laptops and PCs. Their ROG lineup regularly features impressive specifications, RGB lights aplenty, and price tags that you\u2019ll have to do a double-take over.",
    "The Asus ROG Mothership follows in these footsteps, and might be the company\u2019s most ambitious device ever. Part laptop, part desktop, it\u2019s a hybrid machine that features some insane specifications, and an equally eye-watering price tag to go along with it. While the Asus ROG Mothership clearly has its sights set on gamers, it\u2019s actually built like an entry-level workstation, so those looking for sheer power for intense applications like 3D rendering or AutoCAD may actually benefit from owning one of these.",
    "The Asus Mothership is available now, but stocks will vary slightly based on where you are. For example in the Middle East, Asus has said that the few units that were up for pre-order have already been sold, surprisingly snatched up by architects rather than gamers.",
    "Regardless of where you buy one, the Mothership is not a cheap purchase. Our review configuration is priced at a whopping $6,806 (\u00a35,457, AUD$10,054, AED 24,999) - that\u2019s more expensive than an iMac Pro, which currently sits at $5,000 (\u00a34,009, AUD$7,386, AED 20,999).",
    "This is a machine that pretty much sticks with you once you\u2019ve bought it \u2013 upgrading a few internal components is possible (more on that later), but whatever configuration you get should hopefully be good enough to see you for at least the next four to five years.",
    "It\u2019s entertaining to try and refer to the Mothership as a laptop, because the only time it looks like a normal laptop is when it\u2019s closed and lying flat on a table. Prop it up, and an automatic kickstand deploys at the back to provide some strong support. You can then lower the bottom lip to reveal the keyboard and trackpad, similar to how you\u2019d set up a Microsoft Surface.",
    "No matter which angle you look at it from, the Mothership is an intimidating piece of tech to have on your desk.",
    "The metal chassis and flashing LED lights certainly tout its gamer-inspired styling, but turn off all of the fancy lights and you\u2019ll still be left with a rather impressive-looking desktop replacement.",
    "Should you want a bit more flexibility when using the Asus ROG Mothership, you can quickly detach the keyboard and fold it in half, turning it into a wireless keyboard or even tethered via the included USB-C cable. Asus says that this was done to make the Mothership more adaptive to different use scenarios, as gamers may want to reposition the keyboard when gaming, but have it attached as normal when typing emails or browsing the web.",
    "There are ports aplenty on the Mothership, so connectivity is not going to be an issue. There\u2019s a decent amount of USB Type-A ports, as well as Thunderbolt 3 / DisplayPort 1.4 and an HDMI 2.0 port for driving additional external displays.",
    "An unfortunate side effect of having this much power available is that you need two power bricks to drive the Mothership, which makes it a little less effective when (and if) you do decide to take it anywhere. The machine itself is heavy to carry around, so if you\u2019re adding two power bricks to your backpack, you\u2019re not going to be carrying this for very long.",
    "Asus claims that the upright nature of the ROG Mothership improves the machine\u2019s cooling mechanisms, as it\u2019s easier to funnel hot air straight up and out of the machine at the top and sides. Two internal fans and a myriad of cooling pipes across the CPU and GPU help to keep temperatures in check, but a fair word of warning that the top and sides of the Mothership can get really hot under heavy usage, as the system works to expel hot air.",
    "When Asus first revealed the ROG Mothership to us, we were told that both a Full HD and a 4k version would be available for sale. It\u2019s worth noting that those who do eventually opt for the 4k panel will get a 60Hz, 25ms version, with 100% Adobe RGB compatibility. Our review version was equipped with a Full HD display, which is a bit of a shame as we would have liked to see at least a 2k resolution on such a powerful machine.",
    "Despite sporting just a Full HD display, you\u2019ll still get enjoy 144Hz refresh rates and Nvidia G-sync technologies, so gaming on the Mothership is an absolute dream when it comes to response times. While the Full HD panel only provides sRGB support, it\u2019s still quite decent for multimedia work such as video or photo editing.",
    "Viewing angles are also fairly decent, though we imagine that most of your time will be spent looking at the Mothership head-on, rather than trying to swivel it around to show something to someone nearby.",
    "Performance with external displays was very good, both across HDMI and Thunderbolt 3, so those looking to use 4k displays won\u2019t be disappointed. The Mothership was able to comfortably drive two external displays without any performance issues, so you can play around with your setup to find something that meets your gaming or design needs.",
    "The keyboard is an interesting feature of the ROG Mothership. Detach the keyboard and you have to wait probably a second or two for the system to automatically detect the keyboard running in wireless mode. There\u2019s a manual switch on the keyboard that turns the wireless mode off or on, but leaving it on doesn\u2019t cause any issues, even when it\u2019s attached.",
    "Typing is quite comfortable, as the keys have been slightly curved to cradle your fingers better. With 2.5mm of key travel, you don\u2019t have to press as hard to register a keystroke, so long hours of gaming shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The keyboard also supports per-key RGB lighting, so you can pick a visual style that matches your preferences, or just turn off the lighting altogether.",
    "A point to note is that when the keyboard is attached, there\u2019s an alarming amount of flex to it at the part where the hinge is attached just above the keys. We\u2019d be quite worried if something heavy fell on this keyboard as it most certainly would cause some damage to it.",
    "The other annoyance is the second hinge the connects the keyboard to the Asus ROG Mothership often takes a bit of fiddling to properly connect. It\u2019s not as quick as connecting a keyboard cover to an iPad or even the Microsoft Surface, so you\u2019re going to spend a good few seconds wriggling things about until the keyboard is seated properly.",
    "When detached from the Mothership, the typing experience does turn a bit sour, since the keyboard is so flat that it makes typing slightly uncomfortable for long periods. There\u2019s unfortunately no way to elevate the keyboard, so we would stick to just using it while still attached to the Mothership.",
    "Asus has also built a trackpad to the side of the keyboard, which doubles as a numeric keypad. While this may be a thoughtful addition, in practice the trackpad is simply abysmal. It\u2019s too cramped to navigate without difficulty, so you\u2019d only end up using it in dire circumstances when you don\u2019t have an external mouse attached."
