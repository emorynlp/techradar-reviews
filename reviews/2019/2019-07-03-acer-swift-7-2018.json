  "verdict": "Between a touchpad that doesn\u2019t click and its aging, fanless processor, the Acer Swift 7 is an absolutely gorgeous Ultrabook \u2013 the \u2018world\u2019s thinnest,\u2019 in fact \u2013 that we simply can\u2019t recommend in a sea of laptops that are far more powerful and not much thicker for the same price or less.",

    "When the Acer Swift 7 was unveiled at CES 2018, it was touted as the \u2018world\u2019s thinnest laptop\u2019 that also maintains a large 14-inch display and a svelte design. Unfortunately, the Acer Swift 7 sacrifices far too much in order to keep that precious thin laptop crown.",
    "The touchpad, for instance, is unique in that it doesn\u2019t click \u2013 either haptically, like the MacBook Pro, or physically. Acer made this compromise to retain thinness, but it\u2019s definitely not worth it. Luckily, Acer has addressed this touchpad issue in the Acer Swift 7 for 2019.",
    "The trackpad isn\u2019t the only compromise the Acer Swift 7 makes. This super-thin Ultrabook is held back by an old, fanless 7th-generation Intel Core Y-series processor, which sees it lag behind comparably priced Ultrabooks.",
    "It\u2019s a gorgeous device, to be sure, and even squeezes in LTE compatibility. However, it\u2019s hard to recommend the Acer Swift 7 when there are so many better laptops on the market.",
    "The Acer Swift 7 comes in just a single configuration, calling for $1,699 (about \u00a31,280, AU$2,275) in an all-black or black on gold color option. This will get you everything listed to the right, plus a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello login, as well as an LTE modem and eSIM built in.",
    "The HP Spectre 13 is just a sixth of an inch thicker than the Acer Swift 7 and features a beefier Intel Kaby Lake Refresh Core i7 processor with comparable storage and memory. But, the kicker is that HP\u2019s laptop is less expensive, at $1,399 (about \u00a31,055, AU$1,873). However, the HP Spectre 13\u2019s display is an inch smaller, but it can be configured with 16GB of RAM and a larger SSD than the Acer Swift 7 for just 10 bucks more.",
    "The latest 12-inch MacBook from Apple measures slightly thicker at 0.52 inches, and would cost $400 less to match the Acer laptop on memory, storage and graphics, as well as provide a sharper display, though it\u2019s missing biometric login and some screen real estate.",
    "Then, you have the Huawei MateBook X Pro (2018), a 14-inch laptop that\u2019s just $1,399 (about \u00a31,097, AU$1,996) and wipes the floor with the Acer Swift 7 from a value perspective. It\u2019s not quite as thin and light, but it\u2019s not that far off, especially considering the fact that it offers twice the RAM and storage, as well as a stronger Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU and a newer 8th-generation Intel Core processor. Oh, and the display is much sharper at 3,000 x 2,000 pixels.",
    "At this point, the Acer Swift 7 just has an unhealthy obsession with connectivity, thinness and mobility \u2013 much to the detriment of everything else. You might be able to find some deals that help the Acer Swift 7 carve a decent niche, but it probably won\u2019t be enough.",
    "Acer has clearly designed this laptop with thinness, lightness and portability in mind. The Acer Swift 7\u2019s weight comes in at just 2.6 pounds, and it measures just 0.35 inches (8.98mm) thin.",
    "Undeniably, this laptop is stunning, encased in this all-black, brushed aluminum unibody chassis with two sturdy hinges holding the display in place. Acer\u2019s latest Swift 7 is certainly one of the most elegant laptops we\u2019ve ever used. Even the screen bezels and trackpad are wrapped in chrome bands \u2013 as is the fingerprint reader.",
    "Luckily, the keyboard on the Acer Swift 7 2018 is backlit and feels comfortable to type on \u2013 even with the very shallow travel. Turning up the feedback force helps a lot here. However, we can\u2019t say the same for the trackpad.",
    "Acer decided to completely eliminate the clicking functionality from the trackpad for the sake of landmark thinness. So, you\u2019re left with tap to click as the only means of interacting with Windows 10 \u2013 barring using an external mouse.",
    "This clickless trackpad considerably reduced the speed at which we were able to navigate through Windows 10, preventing us from moving the cursor with our index finger and clicking on items with our thumb, like many laptop users are used to.",
    "Before purchasing the Acer Swift 7, you should really consider how important the trackpad experience is to you before picking it up \u2013 it\u2019s something you\u2019ll be stuck with for the life of the notebook. We definitely weren\u2019t into it, and you may not be, either.",
    "We could go on all day about this weird design choice, but just know this omission brings a serious learning curve or leveling of expectations. Even though we\u2019re huge tap to click fans, we found using the Acer Swift 7 to be a bit torturous without being able to click at all. Without it, moving and resizing windows requires precise double taps, which gets tedious fast.",
    "Acer has at least gone through great lengths to improve the Swift 7\u2019s multimedia features. Now, the touchscreen is 14 inches on the diagonal, thanks to far more narrow bezels. The IPS screen makes colors absolutely pop and offers up wide viewing angles for sharing content, which could come in handy when pushing the display down 180 degrees. Movies and still photos look vibrant and crisp through the CineCrystal LED display.",
    "However, those pursuits have also produced new drawbacks of their own. Acer appears to have been forced to move the webcam to beneath the display in order to reduce the side bezel width. Of course, we\u2019re no less miffed by this on the Acer Swift 7 than we\u2019ve been with that of the Dell XPS 13: centered but beneath the display rather than above it.",
    "We\u2019ve seen Ultrabooks achieve similarly thin bezels with typically positioned webcams, so there\u2019s really little excuse here.",
    "When it comes to audio, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that it\u2019s poor due to the Acer Swift 7\u2019s thin frame. The laptop\u2019s design leaves room for only the smallest audio drivers that fire from the bottom of its base, leaving you with thin and tinny sound in movies and music. Just be grateful that Acer didn\u2019t also sacrifice the headphone jack in making the world\u2019s thinnest laptop.",
