    "Monday.com is a project management system designed to give you a flexible and transparent way to organize your work. With a highly visual scheduling interface and customizable workflows, Monday.com adapts to the unique way members of your team approach their projects.",
    "But just how well does this software work? As you\u2019ll discover over the course of this Monday.com review, the platform is leading the industry when it comes to ease of use and security but may be lacking when it comes to advanced functionality.",
    "There are four different levels of Monday.com membership: Basic, Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Prices vary depending on the number of user accounts you require, with the cheapest memberships only allowing you to add two users and top-end options supporting more than 200 accounts.",
    "Whichever membership tier and user capacity you pick, you\u2019ll pay for Monday.com through monthly or annual payments. Opting for yearly billing will save you 18% in membership fees.",
    "The Basic subscription is Monday.com\u2019s cheapest plan, costing $49 per month for 10 users. With a Basic membership, you\u2019ll be able to organize your team using Kanban boards which are simple ways to visualize workflows. Each Basic Monday.com system includes with 5GB of storage space, so you\u2019ll probably want to upgrade if you have a large team.",
    "Another major limitation is the fact that Basic Monday.com systems only store user activity logs for one week. If you intend to keep business-critical files on your Monday.com system, this could be a serious problem as you won\u2019t be able to see who modified them.",
    "A step up from the Basic membership is the Monday.com Standard plan which costs $79 per month for a 10 person team. For most Monday.com customers, the extra investment will be worth it as the Standard package comes with a far more comprehensive feature set.",
    "Take visual workflow management, for example. With a Standard account, you gain the ability to display project tasks on a highly-visual timeline, a bit like a Gantt chart. You also get 50GB of file storage space and unlimited user activity tracking.",
    "Next is the Pro membership tier, priced at $119 per month for 10 user accounts. If you want to connect your Monday.com dashboard with other platforms, this is likely to be the right option for you as it supports up to 25,000 integration actions per month.",
    "At this membership level, storage space is unlimited which is great news if you need to work with a lot of large multimedia files. Pro subscriptions unlock lots of useful project tools too, such as chart views, time tracking, and private task boards.",
    "Enterprise is Monday.com\u2019s flagship package. Unfortunately, no public pricing information is available for this type of membership as Enterprise installations are customized to the unique needs of each customer.",
    "Enterprise accounts come with a 99.9% SLA uptime guarantee, which means you can rely on them for mission-critical tasks and storing important files. They can also be used to create audit logs and set individual account permissions.",
    "You can think of Monday.com as a comprehensive productivity suite that includes all the features needed to divide up the work of your team, monitor project progress, and ensure individual tasks are completed to schedule.",
    "To help you do that, Monday.com comes with project templates that you build your system on top off when you first set up a Monday.com account. These include options for daily task management, departmental planning, and video production.",
    "Once you\u2019ve picked a workflow design to use, you\u2019ll have plenty of freedom to tailor it to the particular needs of your organization. For example, you can add a star system to show the priority of different tasks. Also, there are numerous display options available, such as maps and calendar views.",
    "One way that Monday.com simplifies project management is by making it easy to assign individual tasks to different members of your team. After you\u2019ve done so, you\u2019ll be able to access a comprehensive \u201cTimeline\u201d view of your various projects. At a glance, this feature will show you who is responsible for each part of a project, and when different tasks will be completed.",
    "But Monday.com doesn\u2019t just make it easier to organize your work, it actually makes it easier for you to do it too. That\u2019s because this platform features advanced collaboration tools that let your team message each other, share key files, and comment on work progress.",
    "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Monday.com can integrate with dozens of third-party productivity platforms such as Mailchimp and Shopify. If you\u2019re already invested in other tools, that\u2019s great news as Monday.com will work with your current tech stack.",
    "The Monday.com system looks awesome with colourful designs and big buttons that make it easy to navigate between different screens. Core features such as your message inbox, weekly tasks, and shared project boards can all be quickly accessed via a panel on the left-hand side of the interface.",
    "Things are just as straightforward on the mobile version of the platform, which can be accessed through Android and iOS applications. These days it\u2019s super common to work on the move, so it\u2019s great that Monday.com makes adding new tasks and keeping track of your teammates\u2019 progress easy on your mobile.",
    "Wherever you are in the Monday.com system, you\u2019ll be able to access support through a little \u201chelp\u201d icon at the bottom right of the screen. Support is available via live messenger, tickets, and pre-arranged webinars.",
    "There\u2019s no question that Monday.com lacks some of the advanced features available with alternative project management platforms like Microsoft Project. However, the design of the Monday.com system is more user-friendly, making it a better choice if you don\u2019t want to spend hours training your team to use it.",
    "Monday.com is the ideal project management tool for anyone looking for an accessible system that their team will actually use. Unfortunately, some important features, like calendar views, are only available with its more expensive subscriptions. All the same, Monday.com stands out for its slick design and adaptable third-party integrations."
