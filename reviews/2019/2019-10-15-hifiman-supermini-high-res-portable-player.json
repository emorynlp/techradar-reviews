    "Your phone is a pretty capable machine. It can make calls, play music, take photos, and browse the web \u2013 all in one device.",
    "But it doesn\u2019t do most of things as well as professional equipment can. For example, if you\u2019re a pro photographer, you\u2019ll still probably want a nice DSLR. If you\u2019re an audiophile, you may still want to invest in a decent player \u2013 like the HiFiMan SuperMini.",
    "The SuperMini is more than just a run-of-the-mill MP3 player \u2013 it\u2019s built to offer an excellent audio quality, and is able to play high-res audio, including FLAC, OGG, and even DSD formats.",
    "Since its 2016 release, the SuperMini has more than halved in price, coming down from $399 to a much more palatable $150 (around \u00a3120 / AU$220). So, while our original review is based on the 2016 RRP, it's worth bearing in mind that this MP3 player is significantly cheaper nowadays.",
    "The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the HiFiMan SuperMini is its design: It\u2019s not a bad-looking device by any means. Good looking as it may be, the player is relatively small, coming in at 1.77-inches wide and 4.09-inches tall \u2013 so it should fit nice and snugly into your pocket without any discomfort.",
    "The display covers a little more than half of the front of the device, and directly under that display is where you\u2019ll find the three control buttons: a central selection button and two navigation buttons.",
    "On the right and bottom of the player is where you\u2019ll find other buttons, ports and slots. To the left, you\u2019ve got volume and and down buttons, as well as a back button and a power button. On the bottom, you\u2019ll find the microSD slot, a microUSB port and two headphone jacks \u2013 one standard, and one balanced.",
    "In general, the player is pretty well laid-out, though it\u2019ll take a few minutes to get used to the controls. It was a little random that the majority of the interface controls were on the front but the back button on the right side, for example. Sure, it\u2019s expensive to use a touch screen, and a touch screen probably isn\u2019t even necessary here, but the controls should at least all be in the same area.",
    "As mentioned there\u2019s a microSD card slot on the bottom, and it\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to use \u2013 the internal storage is reserved solely for the operating system. You\u2019ll want to keep that in mind when figuring out your budget for a player. You don\u2019t get a microSD card in the box, and while they are getting cheaper, it\u2019s still an extra cost to consider.",
    "The build-quality of the HiFiMan SuperMini is pretty good, too. It\u2019s machined from a piece of solid aluminum, and we never felt like the player would break. That\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t be careful with it \u2013 you most definitely should \u2013 but it should last a long while without breaking down.",
    "As mentioned, the device does not feature a touch screen, but that\u2019s not necessarily a huge deal. It does mean that the interface isn\u2019t as intuitive for smartphone users as the Onkyo DP-X1A, which basically just runs a full version of Android, but we still found it relatively easy to navigate through the different sections of the software. The main screen allows you to browse music by artist, album, genre or song, and you\u2019ll also get a file explorer and the ability to see what song is currently playing.",
    "When you\u2019re listening to music, you\u2019ll be able to see all the details you would need to see, including the file format, the bit rate, where you are in the song, and so on. You\u2019ll also be able to switch to the next song or go back to the previous song \u2013 as anyone would expect from a player made in the last decade.",
    "There are a few features that we would have liked to see from the interface, though. For one, there\u2019s no EQ. While the player sounds excellent without one, sometimes it\u2019s nice to be able to tune music depending on your headphones or overall listening preferences. It\u2019s a pretty major omission for audiophiles, too.",
    "There\u2019s not all that much to say about the interface \u2013 it\u2019s basic, to be sure, but it serves its purpose. The monochrome display may not be the best if you\u2019re into seeing things like album art when you listen, but if all you care about is being able to easily access your music, you\u2019ll have no trouble with the interface on offer by the HiFiMan SuperMini.",
    "Design and ease-of-use are important \u2013 but if you\u2019re an audiophile looking for a great MP3 player, you\u2019re looking for a top-performer. Thankfully, the HiFiMan SuperMini performs beautifully. It carries a super neutral tone as well \u2013 which is great news for the audiophiles among us.",
    "Instead of a dedicated digital-to-analog converter that you might find in other high-end music players, the HiFiMan SuperMini makes use of a built-in DAC \u2013 or one that\u2019s implemented onto a controller chip.",
    "Now, often that would be a bad thing. Built-in DACs are often sub-par in audio quality, but they consume a lot less power. Here, however, that\u2019s kind of the point. HiFiMan has tuned the built-in DAC to offer a much better sound profile overall, while still using less power and offering a better battery life. And we have to say, the company has done a great job at doing so.",
    "The SuperMini is capable of supporting up to 24-bit audio at up to 192kHz sample rate. The frequency response is 20Hz - 20kHz, which is pretty standard.",
    "The low-end on this player is deep and powerful, without adding any annoying bass bumps you might expect from consumer headphones or music players. There\u2019s enough sub-bass content to make bass fans happy, while in the bass range, where things like kick drums and the tone of bass guitars live, you\u2019ll find plenty of response. The bass is relatively tight and controlled, and the layer responds quickly to bass, which is a good thing. (Some cheaper players, on the contrary, get a little sloppy with their bass response and the result is a slight muddiness, which you won\u2019t find here.)",
    "The mid-range is also very tuned, and as mentioned, very natural. It\u2019s clearly defined in that it\u2019s easy to hear the details of instruments that live in the mids \u2013 like guitars and vocals \u2013 and there\u2019s no so-called \u201cveil\u201d or sense of barrier between you, the listener, and the instruments. That\u2019s a pretty big deal for a player in the sub-$500 category, and puts the SuperMini in competition with much more expensive devices.",
    "The high-end is, in our opinion, where this player really shines. Audio was clear and crisp, and while it did seem as though there was a slight boost in the high-end to help achieve that, we didn\u2019t mind it one bit. It never got overbearing or shrill \u2013 on the contrary, it made for a much more exciting listening experience. It\u2019s also important to note that if there is a boost it\u2019s very subtle.",
    "In general, the soundstage here was decent, and the player was easily able to drive most headphones.",
    "The HiFiMan SuperMini is an excellent player. It\u2019s decently designed despite some somewhat random button choices, and highly portable, which is always good. While some might be wary of the device considering the embedded DAC, we would argue that there\u2019s no need to worry \u2013 the player is capable of pumping out an audio quality that would make even seasoned audiophiles drool.",
    "Not only that, but SuperMini offers excellent value for money, coming in at just $399 (\u00a3400, AU$599), despite the fact that it could easily compete with much more expensive devices."
