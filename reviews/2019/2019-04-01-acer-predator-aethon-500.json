    "When you think of the best gaming keyboards, what comes to mind? Do you think of giant RGB behemoths with lightning-fast mechanical switches, with all the bells and whistles? Or do you think of an even balance between price and performance without going overboard on unnecessary features? We here at TechRadar are squarely in the second camp, and keyboards like the Acer Predator Aethon 500 are kind of perplexing to us.",
    "This is because, while it is generally a competent keyboard with extravagant RGB lighting and all the macro keys and volume knobs you could ask for, its high-price tag and low-budget key switches sour the deal significantly \u2014 especially at its high price point.",
    "The Acer Predator Aethon 500 isn\u2019t an awful keyboard by any means \u2014 it\u2019s functional and stylish enough to impress most people. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard to recommend at this price point, when there are so many other keyboards to choose from.",
    "The Acer Predator Aethon 500 is available now for $179 (\u00a3199, AU$299). That\u2019s a lot to ask for a gaming keyboard, especially one with Kailh Blue switches. These switches are generally found in inexpensive knock-off keyboards, and generally imitate Cherry MX Blues. These switches aren\u2019t bad on their own, just disappointing at this price point.",
    "For the same amount or less cash, you can get some of the best gaming keyboards around, like the $199 (\u00a3199, AU$339) Razer Huntsman Elite or the $159 (\u00a3149, about AU$200) Roccat Vulcan 120 Aimo \u2013 both of which are premium keyboards with all the bells and whistles, that don\u2019t compromise on the quality of the mechanical switches.",
    "We spent a lot of time trying to figure out why this keyboard is so damn expensive, and we keep coming up short. Maybe it\u2019s the Acer Predator branding, but we\u2019re not sure that it has the audience or the aesthetic to demand such a high price tag.",
    "So, it may be way too expensive, but you can\u2019t deny that the Acer Predator Aethon 500 is one attractive gaming keyboard. Its aluminum chassis looks and feels premium, and the metallic keys only add to the appeal. There is a button in the top left corner of the keyboard that switches between predetermined RGB lighting effects and a volume wheel that extends beyond the chassis on the top right.",
    "You can customize the RGB lighting beyond these packaged effects, if you so please, but it\u2019s going to take some doing. You\u2019ll have to download the software, and for some reason it\u2019s not very convenient to find \u2013 we had to do some digging online to find it, and we\u2019ve included the link to the download here.",
    "This software also allows you to mess around with macros if you\u2019re feeling frisky, but because the macro keys are placed directly to the left of the regular keys, we don\u2019t really use them all that much \u2014 we keep hitting them on accident, especially in the middle of frantic Battlefield matches.",
    "We don\u2019t know why Acer couldn\u2019t just link to the software on the product page like every other manufacturer on the planet \u2014 especially when it\u2019s so crucial to using the keyboard on a day to day basis. Acer is already asking for an arm and a leg for a keyboard that arguably isn\u2019t worth it, the least it could do is make the software easy to find.",
    "Then, there\u2019s the wrist rest. Acer didn\u2019t really need to include it in the package, but man, it\u2019s uncomfortable. Rather than being padded in any way, the wrist rest is made of this rigid plastic that was arguably less comfortable than not using a wrist rest at all. We don\u2019t get it: this is priced like a premium device, everything attached to it should at least be competent, right?",
    "The design on its own would be fine in a keyboard that costs half as much as the Acer Predator Aethon 500, but when you\u2019re spending this much money on the keyboard you should demand only the utmost quality. You could literally buy 16GB of DDR4 RAM instead \u2013 the RGB stuff, too.",
    "As is the common theme with the Acer Predator Aethon 500, it performs well, but not quite at the level we\u2019d expect at its price range. The Kailh Blue switches are fine, and we didn\u2019t run into any problems while playing games.",
    "But, because these switches are basically Cherry MX Blue knockoffs, they\u2019re awful at productivity work. They\u2019re both loud and uncomfortable, which is a combination that isn\u2019t going to win it any wistful looks in an office environment.",
    "With 50 grams of actuation force needed and 1.9mm of travel, the Acer Predator Aethon 500 is just as \u2018fine\u2019 on paper as it is in practice. This keyboard is going to get the job done, but it\u2019s really not much to write home about. At least it features all-key rollover, and the switches are rated at 70 million keystrokes.",
    "While testing this keyboard, we are playing some Battlefield 1 \u2013 a game that almost requires a decent keyboard, what with all the different commands you have to give. And, we don\u2019t notice anything holding us back at all. You\u2019ll be able to rely on this gaming keyboard to get the job done, which is something we would assume given its price.",
    "If you can find this keyboard on a deep sale for, say, $99, then you\u2019re going to get one hell of a keyboard that has all the features you really need. However, at its list price, the Acer Predator Aethon 500 is just not up to snuff.",
    "With its knock-off key switches, obscure software and uncomfortable wrist rest, it\u2019s extraordinarily hard to recommend this keyboard to anyone. Even for users that are irrationally attached to the Acer Predator brand and aesthetic: just go out and buy a set of stickers or something.",
    "This is a keyboard that does the bare minimum that a decent gaming keyboard should strive for, and at almost 200 bucks, it just isn\u2019t enough. If you\u2019re willing to spend this much money, you might want to look elsewhere for your gaming keyboard needs."
