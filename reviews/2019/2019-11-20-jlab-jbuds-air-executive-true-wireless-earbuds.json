    "You can get true wireless earbuds for a better price than ever now. If you want a model from the likes of Sony, Apple, Beats and Bose, of course, you'll have to drop a lot more cash, but more competitors are now releasing AirPods challengers for less than $100.",
    "JLab\u2019s JBuds Air Executive True Wireless earbuds are one of the alternatives in that price range, but do they have what it takes when it comes to connectivity, battery life, and sound quality? Let's find out.",
    "The Jbuds Air Executive True Wireless Earbuds are available to buy for $69, which works out at around \u00a355 / AU$100.",
    "That\u2019s a lot cheaper than the reigning most-popular true wireless earbuds, the Apple AirPods (2019), which cost upwards of $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249, and most other models we\u2019ve tested.",
    "Still, prices below $100 aren\u2019t unheard of in the world of true wireless earbuds \u2013 the Optoma NuForce BE Free5s cost $99 (around \u00a375 / AU$135) at launch, and can regularly be found on sale for less.",
    "Similarly, the Funcl A1 true wireless headphones are available to buy for $79 (around $60 / AU$110).",
    "The JBuds Air Executive buds aren\u2019t the prettiest earbuds we\u2019ve seen, sporting chunky black housings with the JLab logo in silver \u2013 with their protruding stems, they look like a beefed-up and less polished version of the Apple AirPods.",
    "The housings are touch-sensitive, and can be used to control your music playback, summon your device\u2019s voice assistant, answer and reject phone calls, and control the EQ settings of the earbuds.",
    "We found that these touch controls worked well enough; however, with myriad different functions assigned to each bud, you\u2019ll need to remember a number of different \u2018tap\u2019 combinations, which can become confusing.",
    "Tapping the right earbud three times activates Be Aware Mode; this allows environmental noise to pass through the buds, which is great if you\u2019re crossing a busy street and need to be aware of your surroundings.",
    "We found the eartips a little uncomfortable initially; however, JLab includes three alternative sizes as well as fins to help keep the buds in place, so after a little trial and error we settled on the smallest tips and found they were much more comfortable, creating a better seal against our ear canals.",
    "The JBuds Air Executive buds feel pretty secure once fitted, and with an IP55 dustproof/waterproof rating, they should be suitable for working out.",
    "They come in a compact, ring box-sized charging case made from plastic and vegan faux-leather; we really like its pocket-friendly size and grown-up design.",
    "The top of the case has a small cut-out to reveal three LEDs that indicate the battery status of the charging case, while a USB charging cable fits snugly in a groove running along its sides.",
    "The JLab JBud Air Executive True Wireless earbuds offer six hours of battery life, while the charging case provides an additional 24 hours \u2013 that's not bad for true wireless buds, and it should be more than enough to get you through a long-haul flight.",
    "Pairing the earbuds to our smartphone was a breeze, and we didn\u2019t experience any connection dropouts while we were using them.",
    "Once you\u2019ve connected to these buds once, they\u2019ll automatically pair with your device when you remove them from the charging case; while this process isn\u2019t as quick as the Apple AirPods' lightning-fast connectivity, it\u2019s still a helpful feature that will save you the tedious job of scrolling through your Bluetooth settings to pair them manually.",
    "Generally, the audio quality of the JLab Audio Air Executives is passable; they provide a warm, rounded-off soundstage that\u2019s enjoyable to listen to and easy on the ears.",
    "They don\u2019t get particularly loud, but if you can achieve a good seal (you should be able to do this by trying out the different eartips included in the box), you\u2019ll find the listening experience far more immersive.",
    "This warm soundstage causes the lowest bass frequencies to bleed into the mids, resulting in a slightly muddy tone; it\u2019s not a huge issue if you\u2019re going to use these earbuds for casual listening on your commute or during a workout, but audiophiles will likely be frustrated by the lack of clarity and separation between frequencies.",
    "This is particularly noticeable when you have the earbuds on the default EQ setting, JLab Signature, which is supposed to amplify the vocals and bass; it definitely achieves this, but at the cost of sounding unnaturally manipulated.",
    "We used this setting when listening to Dark Parts by Perfume Genius, and we found that the bass drums sounded a little muddy \u2013 but the rest of the instrumentation sounded fantastic.",
    "The piano was clear and sympathetically presented, while dissonant vocal harmonies blended beautifully. As the track progressed and the instrumentation fell away, the fragility of the lead vocal was revealed, unveiled magnificently by the earbuds.",
    "Toggling through the different EQ settings, we tried Balanced, which provided a more accurate-sounding reproduction of our music, with a drier, clearer sound; this setting will likely appeal to audio purists, but it does come across as a little thin and underwhelming \u2013 it won\u2019t have you tapping your feet, put it that way.",
    "Listening to Little Dragon\u2019s Paris, we were impressed by the snappy percussion and resonant vocals, while dripping synth ostinatos danced around the mix with clarity.",
    "We also listened to this track using the final EQ setting, Bass Boost. We found this made the lowest frequencies overpowering, while simultaneously diminishing the impact of the vocals \u2013 probably not the best setting for general listening.",
    "However, we can see the application of this setting for working out: if you run to a beat, Bass Boost could be just the thing to bolster your performance with strong, thunderous bass and sub-bass.",
    "For the price, the JLab JBud Air Executive True Wireless are extremely capable, with good connectivity, decent battery life, and a secure design.",
    "The audio quality does leave a little to be desired, but for casual listening, soundtracking your commute, or working out, they\u2019ll do the trick \u2013 and it won\u2019t be as big a hit on the wallet if you lose or break them as would be the case with AirPods or other pricier alternatives.",
    "It\u2019s important to take the price of these earbuds into account when assessing the sound quality. It would be easy to assume that, at $69, they would sound terrible \u2013 but they really don\u2019t.",
    "Much like the Funcl A1 true wireless buds, which impressed us with their balanced soundstage, these earbuds punch well above their weight. They aren\u2019t audiophile-quality by any means, but they\u2019re absolutely worth considering if you\u2019re looking for a cheap pair of true wireless earbuds."
