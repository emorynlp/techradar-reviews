    "As far as secondary monitors go, you cannot go wrong with the Asus ZenScreen MB16A Portable Monitor. A stylish USB-powered monitor designed specifically as a secondary display for laptop users, this nifty laptop accessory won\u2019t just make your workflow seamless and save you time; it\u2019s also portable and stylish for on-the-go use.",
    "Having a secondary screen to extend your desktop is a great way to improve productivity, but for laptop owners, who might benefit the most from extra screen space, that aren\u2019t a lot of options. Portability of such displays \u2013 or the lack thereof \u2013 is always an issue. As is attractiveness \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want to sit at a cafe utilizing a secondary screen up in full display if it looks like it belongs in a 1950s nuclear testing command center.",
    "That\u2019s where the Asus MB168B+ comes in handy. With it, Asus has built an appealing device that\u2019s easy to carry, simple to use and blends in well, whether you\u2019re at a coffee shop or at your work desk.",
    "However, at \u00a3234.99 ($279, about AU$382), it\u2019s probably going to me the most expensive laptop accessory you\u2019ll ever own. But, with Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals starting to pop up, it\u2019s possible that Asus might just drop its price a tad to make it more affordable.",
    "Still, the question remains: is the Asus MB168B+ good enough to warrant that steep price tag?",
    "The \u2018Zen\u2019 part of the ZenScreen MB16A's name makes it clear that Asus sees this device as a companion to its stylish ZenBook range of premium laptops. ZenBooks are well known for their slim and attractive designs that utilize metallic silver, gray and black colors, and the ZenScreen MB16A clearly takes its design cues from those devices.",
    "The MB16A\u2019s dimensions are 14.16 x 8.91 x 0.31 inches (36 x 22.6 x 0.8cm), making it just a bit bigger than an iPad Pro. If this sounds a bit on the big side, remember that this is still far more portable than a standard monitor, and with a weight of 800g it's also much more comfortable to carry. And the slim bezels at the sides and top of the screen mean the majority of the body can be occupied by the 15.6-inch screen.",
    "The bottom bezel is wider, and contains three buttons \u2013 two for navigating the on-screen menu and adjusting the blue light level of the backlight, plus a power button. The design of these buttons continues the Zen design ethos, and again helps to make the ZenScreen look very nice indeed. On the left-hand side of the body is the ZenScreen MB16A\u2019s only input, a USB Type-C port.",
    "This single port helps to keep the design of the Asus ZenScreen MB16A clean and simple, and it\u2019s versatile enough to provide power to the monitor while also displaying 1080p images. A USB-C-to-standard USB adaptor is included if the machine you\u2019re plugging the MB16A into doesn\u2019t have a USB-C port, which is a nice touch.",
    "The ZenScreen MB16A comes with a magnetic screen protector that can also be folded into a stand, in a similar fashion to the iPad\u2019s Magic Cover. It\u2019s another nice touch, and combining screen protection and stand in one thin device helps to make this an easy accessory to carry around.",
    "However, the process of turning cover into stand is a bit fiddly, and it would have been nice to have some clearer instructions \u2013 although if you\u2019re accomplished at origami you shouldn\u2019t have too much of a problem.",
    "The back of the ZenScreen MB16A will look familiar to anyone who\u2019s used a ZenBook laptop \u2013 it has a smart metal design with the Asus logo etched in. Overall, this is a very nicely designed screen, and reminds us that Asus has a real flair for creating attractive devices.",
    "If you have a ZenBook laptop this screen will be a lovely compliment to it, although of course it's compatible with any other laptop or desktop, and will look equally good alongside those.",
    "As the Asus ZenScreen MB16A is a mobile monitor that derives both its power supply and video feed via USB, we\u2019re not expecting image quality that rivals expensive standard monitors \u2013 but at the high price Asus is asking for, we\u2019d still want to see very good image quality that makes the monitor comfortable to use.",
    "The good news is that, on the whole, the ZenScreen MB16A performs admirably, with the IPS panel rendering 1080p content well. However, we did need to make a few tweaks before we were happy with how the display looked.",
    "We first used it with a PC without a USB-C port, so we needed to use the adaptor, and download the necessary drivers from the Asus website. This wasn\u2019t a problem, although once Windows 10 had installed the drivers and we turned on the screen, Windows 10 set the scaling to 120%.",
    "This makes texts, icons and windows larger, which can make things easier to use, but in our view it looks a bit ugly. Setting the scaling to 100% (done easily through Windows 10\u2019s settings) made things look much nicer.",
    "We also found the brightness to be quite dark initially, so we upped it to 100%. We\u2019d usually never have to go anywhere near 100% on standard monitors \u2013 and doing so would blow out the colors, and quite possibly our eyes \u2013 but even at 100% the ZenScreen MB16A's screen was still quite dim.",
    "Of course, if you're running this second screen from a laptop that's powered by a battery, its lower brightness levels will help prolong the battery life of your machine; however we'd have liked the option to make it a little brighter.",
    "Using the on-screen menu is pretty simple thanks to the front-facing buttons on the bottom bezel. There a number of presets you can choose from (you can also save a configuration to easily revert to later on), as well as other features such as a blue light filter (for using at night), and an auto-rotate setting that can be easily enabled.",
    "Viewing angles on the Asus ZenScreen MB16A are good, which is handy for a relatively small screen size, although the glass screen does reflect light quite easily. It's also worth noting that while the ZenScreen MB16A looks like a tablet, it\u2019s not a touchscreen.",
    "On the whole, performance is good. We wouldn\u2019t recommend this screen for gaming or watching media on, but that isn\u2019t what it\u2019s designed for. As a second screen for displaying additional windows and applications it does a fine job, although you may find you need to tweak a few settings to get an picture quality that you\u2019re happy with.",
    "If you\u2019re regularly working on the road and need a second screen that's easy to carry and looks nice and stylish, the Asus ZenScreen MB16A Portable Monitor is an excellent accompaniment. Its light and slim design makes it easy to transport, and the screen protector that doubles as a stand is a great touch.",
    "If you use an Asus ZenBook then this is an even more compelling purchase, as it\u2019s a great companion device that utilizes the same design language.",
    "However, it is an expensive monitor, so if pure portability isn\u2019t your primary concern you\u2019d be better off looking at less costly monitors that will also offer better picture quality."
