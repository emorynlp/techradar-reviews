    "After a considerable hiatus, it\u2019s time to return to Pandora and rip, tear, shoot and loot your way to victory. But does the Borderlands formula hold up in 2019, or should this vault have been left sealed?",
    "For the uninitiated, the Borderlands franchise is built upon the pursuit of gear. Players earn loot at an almost obscene rate, constantly unlocking new weapons and abilities with which to battle through stylized environments. Borderlands 3 doubles down on everything that makes the franchise great, but also maintains some of the series\u2019 less enjoyable idiosyncrasies. I suppose you could say it\u2019s sticking to its seemingly endless number of guns.",
    "Returning to Pandora feels like a homecoming - if the home you\u2019re returning to is a Mad Max-inspired desert planet where the only thing more dangerous than the bandits wreaking havoc in its arid spaces is the local wildlife. Thankfully, in its jump to the current generation, Borderlands 3 offers more exciting locales too. While Pandora has its own charm, it\u2019s exciting to leave the wasteland behind in search of more exciting climates. Each of the new environments stand apart from each other, from Promethea\u2019s huge structures and urban streets to the swampy depths of Eden-6 that widen the franchise\u2019s color palette tenfold.",
    "Borderlands 3\u2019s commitment to its aesthetic is inspiring, and once again the cel-shaded design, complete with thick outlines combines with excellent use of color and the aforementioned new intergalactic beauty spots to form a kind of mayhem-laden comic-book fever dream.",
    "Fittingly for a franchise that continues to market itself with one of its many standard Psycho grunts, character designs are excellent - both in terms of players and enemies. All four Vault Hunters exude personality, from Zane\u2019s Irish accent to FL4K\u2019s deadpan utterances.",
    "Unfortunately, it\u2019s with Borderlands 3\u2019s dialogue that cracks begin to show. While humor is entirely subjective, so many of the game\u2019s \u2018funny moments\u2019 simply don\u2019t stick the landing. Perhaps its audience has matured over the last five years, but many of the references and memetic callbacks just feel like a chance to introduce tired pop-culture reference after reference.",
    "It\u2019s exhausting, but it isn\u2019t without its positives - enemy death cries are an easy highlight, and hearing a bandit yell \u201cmy chilli recipe dies with me\u201d still brings a smile to my face even dozens of hours in.",
    "Borderlands 3\u2019s campaign revels in its own absurdity, and for the most part that\u2019s fine. The Calypso Twins, primary antagonists and intergalactic internet superstars, have managed to unite the various Bandit factions in an effort to mobilise a force to unlock vaults hidden below Pandora\u2019s surface.",
    "It\u2019s standard MacGuffin fare, but the shame of it is that the Calypso Twins simply aren\u2019t as interesting as previous villain Handsome Jack. While they taunt via a radio system, they\u2019re just lacking any charisma and can feel like a podcast you\u2019ve tuned out of after a few conversations.",
    "Other bosses don\u2019t fare much better, despite some entirely unique designs. Many conform to the \u2018run around an arena killing small enemies and flanking the big bad\u2019 methodology, but occasionally cheap difficulty spikes keep things frustrating more than challenging. For example, one enemy can electrocute the arena\u2019s floor, offering absolutely no reprieve.",
    "Thankfully the reason you\u2019re probably here, the gunplay, feels just as good as it ever has. Weaponry is once again the star of the show, and guns in Borderlands 3 are impressively varied. The much-publicized \u2018guns on legs\u2019 are fun, as are guns that double as throwable explosives when reloading, guns that send enemies flying sky high, or guns that eat through currency when used.",
    "Despite the variety, each feels given its chance to shine. While you\u2019ll be constantly cycling out weapons again and again to test out new ones, the design of each feels lovingly handcrafted. One early submachine gun offered dual sights but no real other perks, but flicking between both optics was so satisfying that we kept using it long after its utility wore off. Many weapons now have alternate firing modes, so the most unassuming pistol can fire rockets or become a taser with a click of a button.",
    "Gunplay feels great, but movement is where Borderlands 3 has taken baby steps to offer a more modern experience. Your character can now vault and slide, and while these feel long overdue and seemingly minor at first, trying to return to (the admittedly excellent) Borderlands 2 without being able to hop over small pieces of level geometry or baseball slide with a shotgun blast shows just how big a difference these small tweaks can make.",
    "These weapons can be wielded by one of the franchise\u2019s trademark four classes, and each offers a surprisingly diverse play-style. Zane\u2019s ability to throw out a clone of himself that can deal damage is great, but being able to switch places with said clone (essentially teleporting) is a game-changer. Meanwhile, Moze\u2019s ability to summon a mech is a perfect last resort manoeuvre, and FL4K\u2019s various monster minions can quickly thin a horde. For our money, Amara offers the most badassery for your buck, able to summon phantom limbs from the ground to smash and slam enemies.",
    "When combining all four characters\u2019 active skills, attributes and varied weaponry in co-op, Borderlands 3 is the perfect way to spend an evening with friends. Loot can be instanced or fought over, while each class has four skill trees to pour experience into which can result in vastly different character builds. In fact, Borderlands 3 arguably offers better RPG systems than any shared-world shooter, despite that genre\u2019s focus on constructing a character that fits a playstyle.",
    "Unfortunately, both vehicular traversal and combat feel too imprecise to be anything more than a novelty that wears thin quickly, despite the ability to customize vehicles and summon them often. It\u2019s often more fun to use the game\u2019s litany of junkyard scrappers to cover large stretches before hopping out to deal damage on foot.",
    "Where Borderlands 3 packs its most welcome surprise is in its endgame content. While there are no raid-style encounters (at least yet), there\u2019s plenty more to see, do, shoot and loot once you roll credits on the main campaign. Circle of Slaughter is a basic horde mode, where players can earn exclusive loot by killing enemies and completing side objectives, while Mayhem Mode doubles loot quality but increases enemy health and adds some modifiers.",
    "You can even unlock a new rank system when the campaign is over that offers bonus statistics to tweak for each of your classes, while there\u2019s also a New Game Plus mode if you\u2019re ready to do it all over again for better loot. The new Proving Grounds offer wave-based enemies and bosses that will shower you and your team with loot - if you\u2019re efficient enough.",
    "Borderlands 3 feels like a time capsule of sorts. Despite the prevalence of on-going service games and shared world shooters like The Division or Destiny, Gearbox Software\u2019s first game in three years feels refreshingly comfortable - the videogame equivalent of your favorite movie being on TV on a rainy afternoon. It arguably doesn\u2019t offer a great deal that\u2019s new, but with each journey through it you\u2019ll come to appreciate it more."
