    "What is the Nubia Alpha? It\u2019s a question we\u2019ve been mulling over during our time reviewing this novel device. Nubia thinks it\u2019s a smartphone, with the company implying that the form factor is coincidental to its main calling as a phone, but in terms of appearance and function it\u2019s clearly a wearable.",
    "Certainly we\u2019ve been using the Nubia Alpha (or Nubia \u237a, as the company is styling it) as both a wearable and a phone, and it definitely straddles the two form factors, but it feels like the ZTE-owned manufacturer missed a trick by not focusing on some of the other novel aspects of the device.",
    "There\u2019s more to the Nubia Alpha watch than its identity issues \u2013 it\u2019s one of the first devices to have a flexible screen, which wraps around the wrist and sits at different angles depending on how tightly you wear the device, and it\u2019s the first wearable in a while to have its own camera \u2013 and a surprisingly good one, as well.",
    "So forget everything you know about smartphones, and about wearables, as we try to figure out what the Nubia Alpha is, and if it\u2019s worthwhile as your next tech purchase.",
    "The Nubia Alpha was released in the US and Europe on April 25, several months after it was made available in China, including an LTE version which is exclusive to the country.",
    "You can pick up the device for $449 (roughly \u00a3340, AU$640) \u2013 the price is in US dollars on Nubia\u2019s website wherever you are.",
    "Nubia also plans to release a special gold version of the device at some point, which will cost roughly $100 (about \u00a375, AU$140) more, but we\u2019re not sure yet what regions will get this model.",
    "Although the Nubia Alpha is technically a hybrid of smartwatch and phone, to look at it, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it\u2019s been inspired by those electronic ankle tags that get slapped on convicts.",
    "That is to say, the Nubia Alpha is a rather chunky device \u2013 it weighs 158g, or more than three times the Apple Watch 4\u2019s 48g, and together with dimensions of 51.33 x 47.1mm x 13.8mm for the dial, that makes it a big beast.",
    "Compared to other wearables, you can definitely feel it on your wrist; that\u2019s not necessarily a problem, as it\u2019s comfortable to wear, and we quickly got used to wearing it while exercising or sleeping without it being annoying, but some people will prefer devices that can easily be ignored \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to ignore the Nubia Alpha.",
    "Thanks in part, no doubt, to its bulk, the Nubia Alpha is a very sturdy device \u2013 over the course of our time with the wearable we bumped and scraped it on just about every surface imaginable without inflicting much more than a couple of nicks so if you need a rough-and-tumble wearable you could do a lot worse than with the Alpha.",
    "The Nubia Alpha\u2019s looks are quite divisive \u2013 while we initially thought it looked a little ungainly, its appearance quickly grew on us, and we\u2019d now call it a good-looking watch, although that\u2019s definitely a subjective opinion.",
    "The stainless steel band makes the Alpha look suave yet understated \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be totally surprised to see James Bond wearing one of these (and it would do wonders for Nubia\u2019s sales figures).",
    "Speaking of the band, you can easily remove links to shrink the size of the Alpha to fit your wrist \u2013 that\u2019s not something we can say about every similar premium watch, so we appreciate the opportunity here.",
    "There\u2019s no need to hold out for a Samsung Galaxy Fold to see how flexible screens work, as the Nubia Alpha\u2019s screen is bendable, takes up roughly a third of the device\u2019s total circumference. It\u2019s one of the Alpha\u2019s most novel features, and it lends a futuristic appearance to the device \u2013 but, more than that, it\u2019s actually pretty useful.",
    "The screen is four inches across diagonally \u2013 the Alpha\u2019s screen isn\u2019t very wide though, so there isn\u2019t as much screen real estate as on a device like the Pixel 3 with its 5.5-inch display.",
    "It\u2019s an OLED display \u2013 that\u2019d be a fine on a smartphone, but you\u2019re not exactly going to be watching Netflix or playing games on the Alpha, and in general the screen quality is fine.",
    "The Nubia Alpha\u2019s screen is plastic, so there\u2019s a little friction when you swipe along it, but you\u2019re not going to be doing any complex gestures, so again this won\u2019t be a huge problem.",
    "There were certain circumstances in which the Nubia Alpha\u2019s long screen was hugely useful \u2013 when viewing our daily calendar, for example, or a long chain of texts, it was great to be able to see our meetings or messages disappear into the distance.",
    "Most of the time, however, we didn\u2019t make that much use of the longer display, mainly because, depending on how tight you have the watch, much of the screen won\u2019t be visible as it disappears round your wrist.",
    "Most features of the phone are designed to fit in the \u2018main\u2019 section of the display, so there weren\u2019t many occasions when we needed to see the entire screen."
