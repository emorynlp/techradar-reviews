    "Looking for the best remote desktop software? GoToMyPC enables you to access multiple remote computers quickly and easily from anywhere. Better yet, you don\u2019t need to be an IT whiz to use this software. But despite its simplicity, GoToMyPC is a relatively expensive option for remote computer access.",
    "So, is this the right remote desktop software for your needs? Our GoToMyPC review will cover everything you need to know in order to decide.",
    "GoToMyPC offers 3 plan tiers: Personal, Pro, and Corporate. The Personal plan costs $35 per month for one user and one remote computer. You can add more remote computers, but they\u2019ll cost an extra $35 each.",
    "The Pro plan costs $66 per month and allows up to 50 users with an unlimited number of concurrent sessions. The catch is that only two remote computers are included, and every additional pair of remote computers costs another $66. Since this plan is designed for teams, it includes a handful of administration and reporting features.",
    "The Corporate plan is designed for medium- and large-sized businesses that need remote access to a large number of machines. Pricing starts at $140 per month for 10 user accounts, but you\u2019ll need to contact GoToMyPC to work out details for your company.",
    "GoToMyPC doesn\u2019t include many fancy features, but it makes simple tasks fairly easy. One of the best examples of this is that you can create desktop icons for remote computers. Just double-click and you\u2019re connected. That\u2019s a lot faster than the process you\u2019ll face with more complex remote desktop connection managers.",
    "The software also includes useful features like a shared clipboard and remote printing utility. You can drag and drop files between connected computers, or there\u2019s a bulk transfer tool for moving large numbers of files.",
    "That said, GoToMyPC is missing a few basic functions. You can\u2019t share audio to talk with someone at a remote computer, which complicates the process of using this software for helpdesk applications. There\u2019s also no easy way to record video of a remote session.",
    "GoToMyPC comes with mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Kindle devices. These are surprisingly functional for accessing a desktop computer, as you can access the remote\u2019s device keyboard and move the mouse using your fingertip.",
    "Setting up GoToMyPC is fairly quick. From the computer that you want to access remotely, access your GoToMyPC account online and download the remote controller software. Once it\u2019s installed, you\u2019ll need to log in and create a password to access this remote desktop.",
    "After that, you can connect to your remote computer from any device. Log into your account on the GoToMyPC website to see your available remote desktops. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll also need to download the viewer software, although this only takes a second.",
    "Unless you have a desktop shortcut to access your remote computer, you\u2019ll need to log in to your GoToMyPC web account to see your available connections. This interface is straightforward, if not all that pretty. Your devices are available in a list, and you can access account information like billing from a side menu.",
    "When you open up the viewer software, it\u2019ll launch the desktop on your remote computer. The interface is surrounded by a border, which you can customize to help distinguish between multiple remote desktops. There\u2019s also a small tray of icons in the upper corner, where you\u2019ll find options for text chat with the remote computer and a bulk file transfer tool. The whole thing felt just a little outdated to us, but it also doesn\u2019t distract from your work or overwhelm you with software features.",
    "As for performance, we tested a connection from one Windows 10 computer to another. Establishing the connection only took a second, and there was no apparent lag in moving the mouse or opening programs on the remote computer. Toggling the bandwidth setting in the preferences menu also didn\u2019t seem to impact the connection at all, although this might come in handy if you\u2019re accessing your desktop over a cellular network rather than WiFi.",
    "GoToMyPC has a reasonable number of security features to keep your remote desktops safe. First and foremost, your online account password and your access code for each remote computer must be unique. Passwords cannot be reused. You can also turn on two-factor authentication to add extra security to your GoToMyPC web account.",
    "Importantly, your access codes for each remote desktop are known only to you. GoToMyPC does not keep copies of your access code, which is a major plus for the security-minded. But, that also means that if you forget your code, you\u2019ll need to be physically present at the remote desktop in order to reset it.",
    "GoToMyPC includes 24/7 support with all accounts. However, we had a hard time finding a phone number to call on the company\u2019s website. At the very least, the customer support pages aren\u2019t well-organized. Your best shot is to use the chatbot option and ask questions until you get a live support tech on the other end.",
    "Despite that, the website does have a fair amount of documentation about the software. There are a number of product videos and PDF user manuals for those with more detailed questions. GoToMyPC even has a community forum, although it doesn\u2019t seem to get much traffic.",
    "GoToMyPC is a very easy-to-use remote desktop connection manager. The fact that you can connect to a Mac or PC from mobile devices is nice, and we appreciated the basic file transfer and remote printing features.",
    "But, it\u2019s hard to recommend GoToMyPC for most users because of how much it costs. A lot of competing platforms let you access one remote desktop for free, but this software requires a license for $35 per month. For small businesses, the pricing structure can quickly get out of hand.",
    "There are a number of remote computer access platforms that offer many of the same features as GoToMyPC at a cheaper price point. For individuals, the best is perhaps AnyDesk. It\u2019s free for personal use, or just $10.99 per month for one user and an unlimited number of endpoints.",
    "For business teams, RemoteUtilities for Windows charges a one-time fee of $99 per user and $29 per endpoint for up to 20 remote computers. Just beware that RemoteUtilities\u2014as the name suggests\u2014is limited to use on Windows computers.",
