  "summary": "Switch on, sync up and feel all right",
  "verdict": "The No Bounds is a great little Bluetooth speaker - sustainably designed, smart looking, tough and lightweight. You won't be holding conversations with it any time soon, but it delivers great sound and is very reasonably priced.",
  "pros": [
    "Stylish design",
    "Eco-friendly materials",
    "Good depth of sound",
    "Great battery life"

    "The No Bounds speaker has a recommended retail price of $59.99/\u00a359.99/AU$99.95, making it the second cheapest option in House of Marley\u2019s Bluetooth speaker lineup behind the diminutive Chant Mini.",
    "Like all of House of Marley\u2019s products, the No Bounds speaker is made from as many natural and sustainable materials as possible - but not at the expense of style. Its base is cork, which helps keep weight down and means it\u2019ll bob merrily if you happen to drop it in water (it has an IP rating of 67, meaning it can survive a dip into a meter of water for up to half an hour). A robust dust cover conceals aux and USB-C ports, so you can take it out and about without worrying about sand, dust and dirt getting inside either.",
    "The outer bumper is made from recycled silicone, which has an attractive speckled appearance, and the grille is House of Marley\u2019s proprietary Rewind fabric made from hemp, cotton and recycled plastic. The speaker comes supplied with an aluminum carabiner clip and charging cable wrapped in the same Rewind fabric.",
    "The No Bounds is available in black, white, red and blue - the latter two of which are tastefully muted shades rather than the somewhat gaudy hues of many Bluetooth speakers (we\u2019re looking at you, Ultimate Ears). It fits nicely in one hand at 108mm in diameter, and is 51mm high.",
    "Our only complaint is that the icons for the speaker\u2019s buttons are lightly embossed in the silicone rather than printed, which can make them tricky to see in low lighting. Still, ink isn\u2019t always particularly eco-friendly, so it\u2019s an understandable decision and helps keep the speaker looking smart and minimalist.",
    "Pairing a single speaker with your phone is simple - just turn the No Bounds on, then hold the Bluetooth button and look for it on your phone. It\u2019s also possible to pair two speakers at once, but this is a little more complicated and involves holding down a combination of buttons.",
    "This little speaker produces a surprisingly big sound. We compared it back-to-back with the larger UE Boom 3, and although the No Bounds doesn\u2019t deliver quite as much bass (bass and treble can be adjusted by double-pressing the volume controls), its sound is nevertheless well rounded and impressively loud. The speaker\u2019s impressive battery life means you\u2019ll enjoy that sound for up to 10 hours.",
    "The main drawback of the No Bounds is its lack of smarts - there\u2019s no support for Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri here, and there\u2019s no app for adjusting sound profiles as there is with the UE Boom 3. This speaker is, however, a fraction of the price of the Boom 3, so that\u2019s not unexpected.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a robust Bluetooth speaker for traveling, the House of Marley No Bounds could be precisely what you need. It\u2019s small and unfussy, with a tough design and great battery life.",
    "It lacks the smart features you\u2019ll find in top-end Bluetooth speakers, but for simply enjoying music on the road, it\u2019s seriously impressive."
