    "LG\u2019s gram 14 2-in-1 fits the mold of competing 2-in-1 laptops in that it looks and works just like a standard laptop, and with a quick rotation of the display, it converts into a tablet. Inside each box is a stylus, driving home the point that LG views the gram 14 2-in-1 as an ultraportable device that can bend and fold to the will of its users. And, that it does.",
    "The gram 14 2-in-1 weighs very little, has a respectable spec sheet, and is reasonably priced. But, as with any laptop, the big question is whether the promised experience of what\u2019s on paper translates into a proper experience in the real world.",
    "For the LG gram 14 2-in-1, that answer is a resounding yes.",
    "The gram 14 2-in-1 will set you back $1,499 (about \u00a31,207, AU$2,136) for the configuration we have here. That\u2019s right in line with what you should expect to pay for a similarly equipped Lenovo C930 or HP Spectre x360 15T.",
    "Currently, LG\u2019s site in the UK lists the standard gram 14 model as coming soon, but that model lacks the 2-in-1 features of the model we tested. Still, the default configuration matches what we have on our desk, save for 8GB of memory instead of 16GB. Australian users will need to look to Amazon sellers for the gram 14 2-in-1.",
    "The standard gram 14 starts at $1,149 (about \u00a31207, AU$2,136) for an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, with more expensive configurations pushing the total price up to $1,549 (about \u00a31,249, AU$2,209).",
    "The 2-in-1 model comes with a Wacom AES 2.0 Pen and will convert to a tablet when the screen is rotated nearly 360-degrees. For artists or those who want more than a regular ol\u2019 laptop, the 2-in-1 is where it\u2019s at.",
    "The outside of the gram 14 2-in-1 is somewhat boring. The dark silver housing is plain, outside of the silver gram logo on the back of the lid. After opening the lid, you\u2019ll find a 14-inch display, the keyboard with a power button that doubles as a fingerprint reader in the top-right corner, and bright highlights that note a key\u2019s additional functionality. The bezels around the display aren\u2019t the smallest we\u2019ve seen, but the slim design is noticeable.",
    "The hinges rotate the gram 14 2-in-1\u2019s display back almost a full 360-degrees, allowing for a dedicated tablet mode, stand mode (for binging on Netflix) and a tent mode (more binging, of course). The hinges are sturdy and don\u2019t move around without a light amount of force. That\u2019s good \u2013 there\u2019s little point in using something like stand mode only to have the laptop close itself.",
    "One of the first things we noticed was how light the gram 14 2-in-1 is, weighing 2.53 pounds (995g) and measuring 12.8 x 8.3 x 0.7 inches (323 x 212 x 16.6mm; W x D x H). It\u2019s MacBook Air-light and lends itself to portability more than the Spectre x360 15T\u2019s 4.81 pounds. It\u2019s even half a pound lighter than the Yoga C930\u2019s 3.04 pounds.",
    "In other words, you\u2019ll have no issues throwing this in a bag or backpack and toting it around campus or to meetings at work all day. In fact, you may find yourself questioning whether it\u2019s even in your bag.",
    "One compromise you often have to make when dealing with a laptop that\u2019s as slim as the gram 14 2-in-1 is in ports. Some device makers cut out nearly all useful ports, opting instead for a couple of USB-C ports and dongles. The gram 14 2-in-1 only has one USB-C port, and instead has two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card reader and an HDMI port.",
    "Oh, and of course there\u2019s a headphone jack. Thankfully, computer makers aren\u2019t feeling as brave as Apple\u2026 yet. The ports are evenly distributed, with a USB port on each side, and the left side also housing the HDMI and USB-C ports. On the right side is the headphone jack, the other USB port and the microSD card reader.",
    "A microSD card reader may be the single most underappreciated port on any computer. There are a lot of smart home devices and even some phones that use microSD cards, and the ease of not having to worry about keeping tabs of a microSD to SD card adapter is a freeing feeling.",
    "In addition to bright colors and crisp images, the gram 14 2-in-1\u2019s display is a touchscreen. We\u2019ve used all sorts of gestures, taps, long-presses and everything in between and the screen has kept up with our every demand. That shouldn't be all that surprising, given that it\u2019s designed to serve as a laptop and a tablet.",
    "The included Wacom AES 2.0 Pen has two buttons and 4,096 levels of pressure and purportedly lasts up to 18 months off of a single AAA battery. We\u2019re no artist, and our handwriting is far from exceptional, but writing and drawing on the gram 14 2-in-1\u2019s display was something we could see ourselves using if we owned the gram 14 2-in-1. Although let\u2019s be fair, the use cases for a stylus on a laptop are very limited, even if it is Wacom powered.",
    "The gram\u2019s keyboard is deceiving. The keys look rigid and loud, yet are the exact opposite. The keys have a soft feel to them, yet enough feedback to let you know when a stroke is registered with very little sound. We adjusted to the keyboard in minutes and enjoyed every letter typed.",
    "Most laptop keyboards are good, but not great. The gram 14 2-in1\u2019s keyboard is exceptional. Full stop.",
    "The trackpad is centered with the laptop\u2019s housing and is smooth when used for scrolling or gestures. Where we get caught up is when it comes time to press on the pad for a click. The resistance by the trackpad is uneven, with the top corners almost feeling stuck in place, but the bottom corners feeling like you\u2019re about to press through the bottom of the laptop.",
    "If you stay in the middle of the trackpad there\u2019s a consistent experience, however, that\u2019s not always possible as scrolling and gestures lead to clicking all over the trackpad.",
    "One of the biggest disappointments about the gram 14 2-in-1 overall is the sound quality of the speakers. Tinny and flat is what comes to mind, and they\u2019re both apt descriptions. There\u2019s just not a lot of oomph behind the sound, regardless of screen orientation.",
    "You\u2019ll want a good pair of headphones if you plan on using the gram 14 2-in-1 for a lot of music streaming and sound quality is important to you. For most, though, we suspect the speakers will get the job done."
