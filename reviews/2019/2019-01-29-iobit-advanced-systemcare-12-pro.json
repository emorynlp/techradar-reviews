    "Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro is the latest edition of IObit\u2019s premium PC optimization software. There\u2019s also a free version of the software, but the Pro edition adds features including scheduled cleaning, real-time system monitoring and internet optimization to name just a few.",
    "The new edition of Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro detects more types of junk files than previous versions, and features an improved startup manager intended to cut boot times. It also includes a new Privacy Shield designed to prevent unauthorized access to your data, and an Anti-Tracking feature to stop advertisers following you around the web. IObit has also improved its ad-blocker and popup-blocker, which now offer effective protection from cryptojackers.",
    "When you install IObit Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro, you\u2019ll be offered the opportunity to install the Opera web browser as well. Opera is a great browser, but if you don\u2019t fancy trying something new, you can easily decline (the option to skip it is selected by default).",
    "You\u2019ll also be offered the chance to sign up for IObit\u2019s newsletter to receive perks like a free ebook and opportunities to enter competitions, but again you can easily skip this if you prefer.",
    "IObit Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro\u2019s interface is clean and stylish, with a choice of light and dark designs, and more on the way soon. There\u2019s also a choice of three font sizes, and it\u2019s refreshing to see attention being paid to users who find smaller text tough to read on-screen. You can even set a photo as a background to personalize the program further.",
    "Our only complaint about the interface is that some elements can be tricky to see due to being a similar color to the background. For example, the small \u2018i\u2019, which you can hover over for more information about a feature, is very small and a similar dark blue to the surrounding window. It only appears if you hover over an item, and if you click it no text appears.",
    "When running, IObit Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro will put a small widget at the top right of your screen (which you can reposition or close) showing your system\u2019s current RAM and CPU usage. You might not need that information frequently, but the widget is very discreet and it\u2019s a great way to see the effect of certain programs on your PC\u2019s performance \u2013 and the difference made by running IObit Advanced SystemCare\u2019s Pro various optimization tools.",
    "You\u2019ll also notice a status notification on the program\u2019s desktop icon letting you know whether it\u2019s time to run a scan.",
    "At its most straightforward, IObit Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro offers a one-click optimization scan that will check for common issues including junk files, broken shortcuts, spyware and broken registry entries. It works brilliantly if you\u2019re pressed for time or don\u2019t feel confident dealing with more advanced options, but if you\u2019re feeling confident you can also choose to defrag the registry and perform various quick fixes including disk optimization and internet boost.",
    "You can choose to automatically fix any issues identified, but by default this option is deselected, meaning you can review everything first and deselect anything you\u2019d rather leave alone (like your browser download history, for example). It\u2019s also possible to shut down or restart your PC after issues have been fixed, or set it to sleep or hibernate (though the cleanup process is typically quite fast).",
    "IObit Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro does a good job of balancing transparency and clarity. You can access extra information about all the items found by selecting a category. Unfortunately, although you can choose to keep or remove specific tracking cookies and broken shortcuts, you can\u2019t choose to keep specific files identified as \u2018Privacy traces\u2019 and \u2018Junk files\u2019. That means you either remove your entire browsing history (including typed URLs and browsing sessions) for all your browsers, or keep everything.",
    "Thankfully, this issue can be solved by a quick dive into Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro\u2019s settings, where you can choose exactly what is picked up in a scan. For example, if Chrome is your regular browser, you can choose to keep cookies, typed URLs and history for convenience, while wiping them in Internet Explorer and Firefox. Alternatively, you can opt for an even deeper clean, erasing saved passwords and saved form information as well. The choice is yours \u2013 provided you know where to find it.",
    "In addition to its system cleanup utilities, IObit Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro also offers a range of tools to optimize your PC\u2019s performance. These include: Turbo Boost, which stops unnecessary apps and services, with dedicated options for work, gaming and \u2018economy\u2019; Hardware Accelerate, which checks for outdated drivers and App/Toolbar cleaner, which clears up potentially unwanted clutter from your browser. There\u2019s also \u2018Deep optimization\u2019 , which sounds a little vague but includes features like disabling autoplay for removable devices, preventing automatic creation of system error logs, and optimizing the appearance of Windows menus and lists to optimize system performance.",
    "These all have the potential to boost your PC\u2019s speed a little, but it\u2019s worth taking a look through before clicking \u2018Optimize\u2019. For example, if you regularly use your PC to play CDs and DVDs, then disabling autoplay might be more of an annoyance than a help, and if you\u2019re fond of Windows\u2019 translucent interface elements, you\u2019ll be disappointed to see them turned opaque.",
    "You\u2019ll occasionally see a prompt to install an additional IObit program (such as IObit Uninstaller and Driver Booster) that isn\u2019t part of Advanced SystemCare 12 Pro. It\u2019s worth noting that although there are free versions of these programs, unlocking the full Pro versions will cost a further license fee.",
    "The Toolbox section is particularly interesting, packed with an array of tools for cleaning up and securing your PC, including lots of options you won\u2019t find in other optimization software. Alongside essentials liks a secure file shredder and startup manager, you get various handy tools for finding empty folders, duplicate files, and unusually large files \u2013 all of which are very handy for finding data that can be safely deleted.",
    "The Action Center mainly serves to house discounted offers on software from IObit and its partners. These are well worth checking out ($4.99 for Uninstaller Pro is a great deal), but even if you\u2019re not in the market for any more premium apps, scroll down a little and you\u2019ll find a useful updater for programs including browsers and plugins that can present serious security risks if they go unpatched.",
    "After an initial scan and cleanup, it\u2019s well worth diving into IObit Advanced SystemCare\u2019s settings to schedule the process so it happens automatically in future. You can choose to have Advanced SystemCare do its thing while your PC is idle, or set it to start at a particular time every day, or on a specific day of the week.",
    "Having your browser history cleaned whenever your PC is idle might be inconvenient, but you can specify which objects should be checked automatically using a list of tickboxes. Simple, but effective.",
    "The previous version of IObit Advanced SystemCare Pro was excellent, and on the surface little seems to have changed, but if you spend a little time with SystemCare 12 Pro you\u2019ll find lots of updates (small and large) that bring it up to date for 2019, helping tackle modern security threats while improving the speed of your PC and cutting startup times.",
    "We would have liked a little more flexibility when it comes to choosing which elements should be cleaned up following a scan, but otherwise, this is a PC optimization tool that\u2019s hard to fault and it will have a noticeable effect on your computer\u2019s performance."
