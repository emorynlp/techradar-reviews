  "summary": "An astonishing OLED panel",
  "verdict": "LG\u2019s E9 OLED has incredible picture quality, helped by a new a9 Gen 2 processor and OLED-level contrast, with 4.2 channel speakers bringing real depth to its built-in speakers. The lack of HDR10+ and the patchy Bluetooth connection are minor let-downs compared to how much the E9 gets right.",

    "The LG E9 OLED walks a fine line between mid-range excellence and premium knockout. LG Display is investing hard in its OLED TV production, and while prices have yet to drop to broadly affordable levels \u2013 you can see the damage in the pricing section below \u2013 the sets offer some of the best picture quality on the market.",
    "This was all true last year as well. Those after the very best and latest OLEDs will rightly be looking to the 2019 LG TV range of which the E9 is one of the flagship models, although if you bought one of LG\u2019s OLEDs in 2018 you won\u2019t be looking at much in the way of technical improvements or design overhauls.",
    "That's not to talk down the E9 reviewed here: you get an amazing picture, and while it doesn\u2019t boast the 8K resolution of LG\u2019s Z9 OLED, or the wafer-thin panel of the LG Signature Series W8, its stylish looks and impressive display make it too good to be considered a second-tier OLED.",
    "The LG E9 OLED price starts at $3,299 / \u00a32,799 (about AU$4,600) for the 55-inch model reviewed here, going up to $4,299 / \u00a33,499 (about AU$6,050) for the 65-inch model. Both sizes are available in the UK at John Lewis, Currys, and elsewhere, while a US release is planned for June.",
    "The E9\u2019s main differentiator from the rest of LG's OLED range is its build \u2013 it has a sleek glass panel instead of a traditional boxed display. The rest of the internal hardware, and the weighty stand, sit behind this out of sight, giving you an unspoiled view of your TV screen \u2013 you won\u2019t even see an LG logo at the base of the screen, and the only sign that the TV is plugged in is a dim red glow along the edge of the glass, which switches off as the display powers up.",
    "The set measures 1226 x 753 x 50mm by itself, with that last figure changing to 220mm if you include the stand. The smart build of the E9 creates the impression of an untethered, floating screen: effectively the W9 \u2018wallpaper\u2019 model but sitting on a counter (or a shelf, as in the main image above) rather than hanging on a wall.",
    "This \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 design approach extends to the ports and inputs. There are two USB ports and one HDMI in the rear, although you can also remove a panel on one side of the TV to reveal two more USB ports and three more HDMIs. All the ports are the latest HDMI 2.1 standard \u2013 not a necessity with 4K TVs on the whole, but ideal for gamers wanting to get 120fps out of their 4K-ready games, or those wanting high-bandwidth ports to future-proof in readiness for more demanding content down the line.",
    "There\u2019s also a CI slot, Ethernet port, HDMI ARC (for sending TV audio to soundbars), and options for using wired or wireless headphones. Be warned though: we found the Bluetooth 5.0 connection with the E9 to be surprisingly patchy, so we wouldn\u2019t recommend this set if you like to watch movies with your Bose QuietComfort 35s instead of the TV\u2019s internal speakers.",
    "You get LG\u2019s Magic Remote with the set, and it's a sleek and ergonomic shape that should fit naturally into your hand. It comes with dedicated Netflix and Amazon Prime Video buttons, large + and \u2013 buttons for changing the volume, and a central scroller you can use to move through and select menus \u2013 though you can also point and click, and we found Magic Remote\u2019s sensor very accurate throughout our testing.",
    "TL;DR A gorgeous glass panel design make the E9 a treat for the eyes \u2013 even when it\u2019s off. Just a shame about the patchy Bluetooth connection.",
    "The E9 OLED sports the latest webOS 4.5 smart TV platform, which offers a few neat improvements on last year\u2019s software and is on all of LG\u2019s new OLED and NanoCell televisions.",
    "WebOS uses a sleek horizontal menu to show you all your apps and services on the dashboard, from YouTube and Rakuten TV to Netflix and Amazon Prime \u2013 but v4.5 also brings up a secondary menu above when you hover over an app. Pointing at Netflix or Hulu? It will bring up shows you\u2019ve been watching or might wish to start, making jumping into your chosen content that little bit quicker.",
    "There\u2019s also now a Home Dashboard for viewing all your connected smart home devices in one place. The LG E9 uses Google Assistant for voice control, and works in tandem with Google Home devices, Apple HomePod, and \u2013 new for this year \u2013 Amazon Alexa devices. We got the E9 set up with our Amazon Echo Plus, and were soon happily using Alexa to power the TV on and off and change the volume.",
    "Alexa isn\u2019t integrated throughout the set, however, so good luck trying to use it to open a specific app or search for a title without a Fire TV device plugged in.",
    "TL;DR A smooth interface for one of the best smart TV platforms out there.",
    "One of the recurring issues with watching HD content on 4K televisions is that you need decent picture processing to enlarge the image without it seeming too artificial. The E9\u2019s OLED panel, however, is fully at home with HD content, with the precise pixel control to bring out only the level of detail needed.",
    "Watching the opening episode of Stranger Things (SDR) on OLED was a revelation, with the picture drawing out the moody shadows of the Hawkins forest as clearly as the vibrant reds and yellows of kids\u2019 backpacks and T-shirts. The ability of OLED panels to 'turn off' individual pixels makes for incredibly deep blacks, and startling levels of color contrast, and the gains are obvious to the eye. This is a television made for atmosphere, and even regular SDR images enjoy a real boost to the colors on-screen.",
    "LG has also packed in a feature called HDR Pro (listed as HDR Effect in your settings), which tries to enhance SDR images to make use of the panel\u2019s expanded color gamut; the effect isn\u2019t particularly natural, however, especially compared to the other picture settings available.",
    "LG\u2019s ThinQ AI will actively adjust the set\u2019s processing algorithm depending on the kind of content you\u2019re watching \u2013 horror, sitcoms, news broadcasts, and the like \u2013 and generally does a wonderful job of tailoring the E9\u2019s output to what\u2019s being shown. (For the best results, do check out the picture settings: Standard will do just fine, but you\u2019ll want Cinema for proper movie nights, or Game for low input lag during gaming sessions.)",
    "For a high-end television that's so clearly designed for cinematic nights in, you might be forgiven for thinking it wouldn\u2019t also excel as a gaming TV. But the E9 plays demanding games effortlessly, with that extra level of depth and detail in the panel creating staggering visuals in 3D environments: loading up Breath of the Wild on Nintendo Switch was simply astonishing, even with the console\u2019s HD restriction, adding a real fullness and vibrance to the game\u2019s cel-shaded character models.",
    "TL;DR As ever, LG\u2019s OLED panels bring a sense of cinema to the small screen, with incredible black levels and rich, vibrant colors.",
    "If you\u2019re buying a 4K TV you\u2019re probably planning to watch some 4K content \u2013 and we can assure you that the E9 OLED does not disappoint here.",
    "We slipped in a disc for Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s The Shape of Water, and while a 55-inch TV doesn\u2019t quite match a cinema screen for scale, the effect isn\u2019t far off. The all-glass, frameless panel has an open and expansive air, while the HDR (high dynamic range) gives a gorgeous glint of emerald to the film\u2019s ongoing aquatic greens.",
    "Especially in bright environments \u2013 say, a well-lit living room in the afternoon \u2013 the extra details afforded by 4K can be harder to pick out. OLED panels have a dim output compared to LEDs or QLEDs (only 700-900 nits), and are most at home in a darkened room where they\u2019re not fighting against other light sources.",
    "So The Shape of Water\u2019s blacks could dominate the screen at times, but the richness of the color palette seems fully worth it \u2013 just turn off the lights and pull down the blinds to make the most of the experience.",
    "There\u2019s an increasingly wide selection of Ultra HD content available on streaming services like Netflix, as well as plenty of 4K Blu-rays to enable you to enjoy that quality picture without relying on an internet connection. The LG E9 packs in almost all of the premium video formats you could hope for: 12-bit Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) are all here.",
    "Sadly, though, 10-bit HDR10+ doesn\u2019t make the cut, despite being included in high-end sets from the likes of Samsung and Panasonic. But it\u2019s a small let-down compared to the dazzling visuals and wide format support the E9 provides.",
    "TL;DR Nothing matches OLED for a rich color palette, even if it doesn\u2019t have the brightness to truly illuminate the screen.",
    "If the glass design of the E9 hasn\u2019t won you over, you may be wondering why you wouldn\u2019t settle for the C9 OLED instead, which features essentially the same panel and internal processor. When it comes to audio, however, the E9 has the advantage.",
    "The E9 OLED features 4.2 channel speakers (60W) all built into the television, giving an astonishing level of audio separation for internal TV speakers. We watched Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Okja on Netflix, and hearing the chaos of Seoul\u2019s busy intersections drift from one side of the set to the other was nothing short of magical \u2013 and we felt a clear incentive to upgrade from the C9\u2019s 2.2 channel speakers (40W).",
    "The E9\u2019s speakers are all front-firing for maximum impact, and the set supports Dolby Atmos\u2019 surround sound format.",
    "The E9 is a fantastic television, but LG\u2019s other OLEDs all offer something slightly different. The C9 OLED is the next set down in the range, and starts at a slightly more affordable $2,499 / \u00a32,499 (about AU$3,500). The B9 is even cheaper, though you\u2019re getting last year\u2019s processor instead of the a9 Gen 2.",
    "At the other end of the spectrum is Samsung\u2019s QLED TV range, which offer much brighter displays than LG\u2019s OLEDs, even if they lag behind on color contrast and black levels. You can read our full OLED vs QLED guide to learn about the differences, but possibly the most important thing to note is that Samsung TVs will generally be cheaper.",
    "The LG E9 OLED offers a dazzling picture, with crisp detail and truly cinematic visuals. LG\u2019s organic LED displays lack the brightness of competing models, but those after a proper movie night in won\u2019t be disappointed.",
    "The E9 differs mostly from other LG OLEDs in its shape and its size options \u2013 both the more premium W9 and cheaper C9 offer a larger 77-inch model \u2013 but we\u2019d be surprised if the E9\u2019s all-glass panel design didn\u2019t impress you. With a unique look, and the multi-channel audio to elevate it above other OLED sets in the range, the E9 is a fantastic addition to any living room."
