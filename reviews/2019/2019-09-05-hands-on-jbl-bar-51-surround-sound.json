    "JBL has refreshed its range of soundbars, and the JBL Bar 5.1 Surround Sound is the biggest and boldest of the lot.",
    "Announced at IFA 2019, the JBL Bar 5.1 Surround Sound is the successor to last year\u2019s Bar Series 3.1 \u2013 and not, as you might think, the current JBL Bar 5.1, which is due its own new iteration at CES 2020 next year.",
    "But with an emphasis on bass (through a mini-fridge sized subwoofer), and Multi-Beam audio that hopes to mimic the effect of surround sound without needing a vast array of speakers around the room, the JBL Bar 5.1 Surround Sound seems a powerful companion to your movie nights in.",
    "Here\u2019s what we thought in our time with the \u00a3549 (around $680 / AU$990) soundbar so far.",
    "The JBL Bar 5.1 Surround Sound is very much in the same style as the rest of its new soundbars, with curved edges rounding off a sleek, low profile and gray / silver coloring.",
    "There\u2019s little flourish visually, meaning this isn\u2019t a soundbar that will try to distract from the action happening on screen, but it carries its shape well and focuses rightly on the sound coming out of the soundbar \u2013 and the sizeable 10-inch subwoofer you\u2019ll likely place beneath it.",
    "Along the top of the soundbar you get the usual buttons for power, volume control, and source input (i.e. Bluetooth, HDMI, or otherwise).",
    "Unlike the JBL Bar 5.1 (which, again, is a different soundbar entirely), the Surround Sound model doesn\u2019t have separate tweeters you can remove from the main body of the soundbar. Instead, there are two additional tweeters built into the sides of the soundbar, pointing out diagonally \u2013 using JBL\u2019s Multi-Beam technology to direct audio across the room, giving the impression of actual surround sound.",
    "So, how well does the Multi-Beam feature work? In our time listening so far, we found the output impressive, with a strong and powerful roar matching the sound of monsters traipsing across the screen (yes, we were watching Godzilla).",
    "The floor would rumble beneath us from the force of the subwoofer, making a strong argument for a bass driver you can leave on the floor itself. The tweeters, too, were able to throw voices across the room, though the sheer power of the bass and mids \u2013 which sadly can\u2019t be adjusted through any EQ settings \u2013 did seem to have a muffling effect on the vocals, and there\u2019s the impression of a soundbar with a roar bigger than its soundstage.",
    "The JBL Bar 5.1 Surround Sound is a capable soundbar with a strong 500W output and the beginnings of surround sound \u2013 though it\u2019s unlikely it can compete with an actual array of speakers placed around the room.",
    "There\u2019s a reason for the lower price point than the JBL Bar 5.1 model, then, with its separate tweeters, and higher retail price of \u00a3699.",
    "This will be a soundbar for those wanting high impact audio for their movies, music, or sports matches \u2013 and the sound of a crowd cheering over its five-channel drivers is sure to be a delight. But we\u2019ll be updating this review in the coming weeks to see how its strengths and compromises balance out."
