    "Update: after Google suspended Huawei's future access to Android Play Store and security updates, there are serious question marks over the future of Huawei and Honor phones.",
    "While Google, Huawei and Honor have promised to support phones currently on the market, it's not clear how long they'll receive Android updates or access to the Google Play Store, which would severely curtail their usefulness compared to the competition.",
    "Honor phones typically take tech from Huawei\u2019s latest handsets, water down the specs in a few non-critical areas, and sell for a lower price tag \u2013 but the Honor 20 Pro throws this precedent out the window with specs that appear to make it an even more appealing prospect than the high-end Huawei P30 Pro.",
    "Like the P30 Pro the Honor 20 Pro has no less than four rear cameras, as well as the latest Kirin 980 chipset \u2013 but it\u2019s also shaking things up with new features like a \u2018punch-hole\u2019 front-facing camera rather than a notch, and side-mounted fingerprint sensor built into the power button.",
    "Update: Honor has finally announced the launch date and price of the Honor 20 Pro in the UK, so if you've read this review and are impressed by the handset's relatively low price and great performance (and also are based in the UK), you can finally pick up the handset.",
    "The price in particular is something to bear in mind, as it's a lot lower than that of the Huawei P30 Pro, yet isn't completely dissimilar in terms of specs \u2013 in short, if the P30 Pro is too expensive but you need that camera power, this is the device for you.",
    "In many ways, then, the Honor 20 Pro doesn\u2019t feel like an affordable cousin to the Huawei P30 range, but rather a powerful and impressively specced smartphone beast in its own right \u2013 and with a price tag that sits below what you\u2019d expect.",
    "But Honor must have cut some corners to put out a phone with such cutting-edge features at a low price; the question is, which corners \u2013 and will you notice?",
    "In the UK, the Honor 20 Pro costs \u00a3549.99 (around $670, AU$970) for 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. For a smartphone with as impressive specs and camera capabilities as these, that's a rather low price, and we were expecting it to cost a little more.",
    "In part, we've given the phone such a high score because it's providing many features of high-end phones, like a powerful chipset or four-camera rear array, at a price that makes it accessible to the everyday buyer.",
    "Huawei smartphones (including Honor, a subsidiary of Huawei) are currently not available through US carriers or major retailers, though it's still possible to buy them. This usually means a higher cost or relying on an unverified online retailers, and software may not be optimized for US networks.",
    "Huawei's other products, including laptops and tablets, are readily available in the US, and the firm is working to obtain clearance to market its phones, so we could see this handset officially launch in America in the future.",
    "That price tag is comfortably below the Huawei P30\u2019s \u00a3699 / AU$1,099 (roughly $910) launch price, but a reasonable amount above the Honor 20 which costs \u00a3400 (roughly $490, AU$700).",
    "You can pick up the smartphone from August 1 in the UK, which was quite a while after Honor launched it, and even a few months after the Honor 20 released in May.",
    "On the surface, the Honor 20 Pro doesn\u2019t look particularly different from any standard Android phone \u2013 but looks can be deceiving, and there are some quirks to the Honor 20 Pro\u2019s design.",
    "The handset isn\u2019t quite plus-sized, but it\u2019s still large \u2013 with a body of roughly 154mm x 74mm x 9mm, some users may have trouble reaching the top of the screen, but it\u2019s not exactly a burden to carry about.",
    "The Honor 20 Pro display is something we\u2019ll get into later, but while the phone has an impressive 91.6% screen-to-body ratio, there\u2019s still just enough bezel to house a speaker and notification light right at the top.",
    "On the right side of the handset you\u2019ll find one of the Honor 20 Pro\u2019s most useful features: the power button and fingerprint sensor are one and the same, so by the time you\u2019ve picked up your phone and pressed the power button you\u2019re in.",
    "An indent makes this button easy to find without looking, and it\u2019s a snappy system, so we found ourselves unlocking and able to use the phone much more quickly with this side-mounted sensor than with the now-common in-screen scanner. The button\u2019s also at the perfect height to make it natural to use for most hands.",
    "The volume rocker sits above the power button, and there\u2019s a USB-C port on the bottom of the phone \u2013 sadly there\u2019s no headphone jack, which was something the Honor View 20 did have, and it seems like a curious omission given that this is an affordable phone aimed at a younger audience.",
    "On the back of the handset is its quad-camera setup \u2013 this makes for quite a prominent bulge, and the phone won\u2019t sit flat on a surface because of it, but that\u2019s arguably a small a price to pay for all the tech within.",
    "The Honor 20 Pro is available in two colors \u2013 a purple shade and a green, both of which use, in the words of Honor, \u2018Triple 3D Mesh\u2019 and curved glass to create a bright, reflective pattern on the back. It\u2019s certainly a more refined design than the Honor View 20, which was a little on the garish side, but the Honor 20 Pro is perhaps a little less eye-catching as a result.",
    "Still, it\u2019s a good-looking phone, with a nice balance between functionality and slick design.",
    "One compromise you\u2019re going to have to accept with this handset is the display, because the Honor 20 Pro screen is perhaps a little bit of a downgrade compared with competing devices.",
    "The 6.26-inch screen uses LCD Full HD+ tech, which isn\u2019t quite as good as the OLED of the Huawei P30 phones, so perhaps won\u2019t display colors quite as well, although it has a great brightness range, and holds up well when viewed in direct sunlight.",
    "Honor 20 Pro competitors like the Google Pixel 3a or OnePlus 6 do have better screens, with OLED and AMOLED displays respectively, so you\u2019re not getting top-end specs here, and the screen quality is one of the main trade-offs for the low price.",
    "There\u2019s no notch intruding on the Honor 20 Pro\u2019s screen; instead Honor has decided to go for a \u2018punch-hole\u2019 camera which means the lens is cut out of the display \u2013 the Honor View 20 and Samsung Galaxy S10 have similar arrangements.",
    "Honor claims this is the smallest punch-hole camera on the market, at only 4.5mm, but between the hole in the screen and the edge of the display is a fair amount of real estate that isn\u2019t used, so in effect the screen space lost is around the same amount as would be lost to a notch.",
    "This isn\u2019t a huge issue, and having the \u2018lost\u2019 space in the corner of the display keeps it out of sight, out of mind. In general the screen is fine for everyday use, and you\u2019ll only notice the lesser display when you directly compare it to a high-end phone.",
