    "Update: Apple has unveiled iPadOS 14, the newest version of its operating system designed for iPads, and explicitly confirmed the entry-level iPad Pro 9.7 models will get it. So if you choose to buy this tablet, know that you'll get to download this software when it's released later in 2020. To know everything that's coming, visit our iPadOS 14 page here.",
    "Innovating in the world of tablets is a difficult proposition, even for Apple. The iPad Pro brought about a new way of working, and a variety of accessories to complement your 12.9-inch or smaller slate \u2013 but what if you don\u2019t want those features?",
    "If that\u2019s you, this budget iPad is the device designed for you. It offers a premium spec, a great-looking design and top-of-the-range features, but at a lower price without all the productivity extras tacked on.",
    "It\u2019s much like the iPad Air 2 \u2013 the device it replaces in Apple's lineup, which earned a five-star review here at TechRadar, and like that device it sits between the iPad Pro and the iPad 4 mini \u2013 but there are a few key upgrades that make this an all-round better tablet.",
    "The new iPad is cheaper than the iPad Air 2 was when it was on sale through Apple\u2019s website. That's noteworthy, as affordable Apple products are hard to come by, especially when the iPhone only seems to rise in cost with each new generation.",
    "This new version of the iPad has an RRP of $329/\u00a3339/AU$469 for the 32GB Wi-Fi model, and goes all the way up to $559/\u00a3559/AU$799 if you want to get one with 128GB of storage and cellular connections \u2013 there\u2019s no 256GB or 512GB version of this latest iPad.",
    "We've seen the price of the 32GB version drop down to \u00a3279 / $300 during sales periods, but you may not be able to find it that low at all times of the year. The 128GB with cellular connectivity variant has kept its value a little more, but you may be able to find it a touch cheaper from some retailers.",
    "If you\u2019ve used an iPad Air 2, you\u2019ll be familiar with the design of the new iPad. This new version is a touch thicker than the Air 2, but that\u2019s barely noticeable considering it\u2019s still only 7.5mm thick, which makes it easy to hold in the hand.",
    "It\u2019s weighs just 469g, so if you plan to carry this device on your commute you should find it light enough to hold onto for extended periods. You may want to use two hands though, as at 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm it\u2019s not particularly easy to grip with only one hand.",
    "A lot of the headlines have focused on how this is a thicker iPad, but in real everyday usage we don\u2019t think that matters. The iPad Air 2 was so incredibly thin and light that you won\u2019t notice the slight padding here.",
    "The back of the iPad has a metal body that feels smooth to the touch but is still easy enough to grip. There\u2019s no denying the iPad is still the best-looking tablet you can buy, and the rounded corners makes this a gorgeous device to hold in the hand.",
    "We\u2019d recommend buying a case to ensure it won\u2019t get scratched when putting it in your bag though. The metal on the back can easily get marked, and you may also find that greasy fingers will start to detract from the gorgeousness if you don\u2019t rub it down often.",
    "The new iPad is available in gold, silver or space grey \u2013 sadly Apple hasn\u2019t seen fit to include a new red version of the iPad to match the new brightly colored iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.",
    "As on other recent iPads, just below the screen is a home button featuring Apple's Touch ID scanner that allows you to keep all of your data securely stored away behind a fingerprint lock. It\u2019s not particularly easy to reach with your thumb though unless it\u2019s lying down, so we\u2019d usually just use a passcode instead.",
    "The iPad has a 9.7-inch display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536. That gives you 264 pixels per inch, which is the same as either of the iPad Pro models.",
    "It\u2019s a Retina display, which is Apple\u2019s way of saying you won\u2019t be able to notice the pixel quality as it\u2019s so high. We\u2019d agree with Apple on that fact, and during our time using the tablet we found that everything we watched looked beautiful.",
    "The screen is particularly bright too \u2013 especially compared to, for example, the original iPad Air \u2013 and this gives it a great advantage over a lot of the tablet competition.",
    "The screen size is particularly notable on the new iPad too. The iPad Pro 12.9 is just too big for comfortable everyday use, and Apple has got the size just right here \u2013 large enough to view content easily, small enough to use comfortably."
