    "Smart security cameras are increasingly popular, with more of us taking an interest in what happens in our home when we\u2019re not around \u2013 as well as wanting to protect our loved ones and our expensive belongings.",
    "Nowadays, the best indoor security cameras come with tons of modern conveniences like cloud storage, facial recognition, and voice assistant-compatibility",
    "The Netatmo Smart Indoor Camera boasts all of these features, all housed within a chic, cylindrical frame \u2013 but can it compete with the likes of the Netgear Arlo Pro 2 or the Hive View?",
    "You can buy the Netatmo Smart Indoor Camera for $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 / AU$349, which is about half the price of the Arlo Pro 2 starter pack \u2013 although the latter comes with two camera and a hub.",
    "If you want to monitor more than one area of your home, you can buy kits in the US and UK with multiple cameras; two Smart Indoor Cameras will set you back $350 / \u00a3350, while a combination of the Smart Indoor Camera with the Netatmo Presence outdoor floodlight/camera costs $420 / \u00a3380.",
    "At first glance, the Netatmo Smart Indoor Camera doesn\u2019t look like a security camera \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.",
    "Its minimalist cylindrical build means that it blends into your home seamlessly, looking more like a cool ornament than a serious piece of smart security kit, with its anodized aluminum outer housing glistening any time the light catches it. In short, it looks really attractive.",
    "A black bar on the front of the camera contains the lens itself, while a small LED below lets you know whether the camera is on or off.",
    "On the back of the Smart Indoor Camera you\u2019ll find a slot for your 8GB microSD card (this comes included with the camera), an Ethernet port should you wish to hook it up to your home network directly, and a power port \u2013 you\u2019ll have to keep it plugged in at all times, which isn\u2019t ideal if you want something more portable with a built-in battery.",
    "With a 130-degree field of view, the actual camera won\u2019t capture as much of your home as competitors like the Hive View, which sports a 180-degree field of view. Saying that, it\u2019s enough to get a decent overview of the room you\u2019ve set the Smart Indoor Camera up in.",
    "It records in up to Full HD 1080p, which we found to be clear enough for our needs, although it\u2019s worth noting that some of the best security cameras go up to as much as 4K resolution. It can also record in night vision, which is an important feature to consider when buying your next security camera \u2013 indoor, or outdoor.",
    "We were really impressed with the night vision mode: it\u2019s clear, detailed, and though you don\u2019t get the nifty color night vision that the new Arlo Pro 3 boasts, black and white is perfectly adequate for getting a sense of what\u2019s going bump in the night.",
    "Recordings are automatically stored on the 8GB microSD card, and you can also choose to store them on your own Dropbox account, or FTP server \u2013 this is something that often costs extra as part of a subscription, so it\u2019s great that Netatmo does this free of charge.",
    "Perhaps the coolest thing about the Netatmo Smart Indoor Camera, is its ability to recognize different faces, learning the faces that come and go from your house in the weeks after you set it up \u2013 and automatically recording and notifying you anytime it detects a stranger.",
    "Any time the camera recognizes a new face, you can create a new profile within the app \u2013 this means that you can customize the way it interacts with different people in your household.",
    "For example, you can ask it to send you a notification when your kids get home from school, or ask it not to send you updates every time your partner walks past the camera \u2013 this is a fantastic feature that many security cameras don\u2019t have, leading to annoying notifications every time they detect movement.",
    "One thing missing, though, is a loudspeaker, which means there\u2019s no two-way audio and you can\u2019t talk to people in your home.",
    "The app is pretty easy to navigate, and thanks to IFTTT (If That Then This) you can create 'applets' that connect the Netatmo Security app to another; for example, you could set it up so that your Philips Hue lights come on any time your Smart Indoor Camera detects an unknown face.",
    "In terms of smart home integration, the Netatmo Indoor Security Camera works with Alexa, Apple Homekit, and Google Assistant. So, if you\u2019re a Google Assistant user for instance, you could ask your Google Home speaker to show the camera\u2019s livestream on your TV.",
    "Despite being cheaper than much of the competition, the Netatmo Indoor Security Camera is a great option for anyone who wants to keep an eye on their home \u2013 and their loved ones \u2013 when out and about.",
    "It\u2019s chic and elegant design sets it apart from competitors like Arlo, and while the lack of portability is a shame, the simple setup and easy-to-use app makes up for this.",
    "The quality of recording, while not the best, is absolutely good enough to monitor your home \u2013 with Full HD streaming, decent night vision, and facial recognition technology. We\u2019d like to have seen two-way audio, though, which does come with many security cameras these days.",
    "The fact that there are no hidden charges or subscription fees for storing recorded video is brilliant, and integration with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant means that the Smart Indoor Camera can be built into any smart home setup."
