  "summary": "Acer\u2019s latest machine is packed with power and designed for creative workers \u2013 can it challenge established rivals?",
  "verdict": "Acer\u2019s ConceptD 5 Pro has an incredible amount of power on the inside \u2013 enough to handle creative tasks \u2013 and a stunning screen alongside a solid price. However, battery life is poor, and both build quality and port selection could be far better.",
  "pros": [
    "Huge GPU power",
    "Fast Core i7 CPU",
    "Fantastic screen quality",
    "Decent keyboard and trackpad"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Inconsistent build quality",
    "Mediocre port selection",
    "Poor battery life"

    "Acer is usually known for its more affordable laptops, but the ConceptD 5 Pro is more ambitious.",
    "It\u2019s a machine designed for designers and creative workers \u2013 people who need lashings of power inside a case that looks suitably stylish.",
    "On the inside, it\u2019s packed with memory, a top-tier CPU and professional graphics, and it\u2019s got a stunning 4K screen. Is the ConceptD 5 good enough to help Acer gain a foothold in the professional market?",
    "The model we\u2019ve reviewed costs $3,400 (\u00a32,700, around AU$5,000), and is the most expensive ConceptD 5 laptop.",
    "There are two other ConceptD 5 Pro models. One has the same specification as this laptop, albeit with only 16GB of memory. That laptop costs around $3,200 (\u00a32,500, around AU$4,700). The cheaper ConceptD 5 Pro drops down to weaker Quadro T1000 graphics, with the price falling to $2,000 (\u00a32,150, around AU$4,000).",
    "The rest of Acer\u2019s ConceptD range is extensive. Cheaper laptops in the ConceptD 3 range are forthcoming, and ConceptD 7 machines with high-end consumer GPUs have prices that range between $2,300 (\u00a31,800, around AU$3,400) and $3,000 (\u00a32,300, around AU$4,400).",
    "The Acer ConceptD 5 Pro looks smart: it\u2019s made from thick, matte black magnesium alloy, it\u2019s got sleek, angled corners and Acer\u2019s logos are unobtrusive.",
    "It\u2019s no surprise Acer has spent plenty of time on aesthetics. The ConceptD 5 squares up against the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo UX581, which has an attractive metal design and eye-catching dual screens. And then there\u2019s Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro \u2013 perennially one of the world\u2019s best-looking laptops.",
    "However, closer examination reveals areas where Acer\u2019s design doesn\u2019t stack up.",
    "There are visible seams throughout \u2013 not a terminal issue, but disappointing given the price. Lots of the edges are sharp, and the outlandish exhausts come straight from Acer\u2019s gaming notebooks and look out of place.",
    "The base is strong, but the lid flexes back and forward and is easy to depress. These build quality issues mean both rivals are stronger, and we\u2019d recommend carrying the Acer in a sleeve.",
    "Acer\u2019s machine weighs 4.9lb (2.2kg), which means it\u2019s lighter than the dual-screen Asus \u2013 and its 0.9in (21mm) thickness barely differs from the ZenBook. However, Apple\u2019s MacBook Pros are much smaller, with 0.6in (16mm) designs that weigh just 3.9lb (1.8kg).",
    "Connectivity is also mediocre. Acer\u2019s machine has two full-size USB 3.1 ports and a slower USB 2 port alongside a Type-C connection and an HDMI output. However, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, a card reader and a fingerprint reader are all missing.",
    "Connectivity is better inside \u2013 there\u2019s super-fast Wi-Fi 6 alongside Gigabit Ethernet and Bluetooth 5.0.",
    "But what about the keyboard and trackpad? The Chiclet keyboard is good. It\u2019s got a numberpad, large cursor keys and no serious layout issues \u2013 so it\u2019s easy to get up to speed.",
    "The base is sufficiently robust, which means keys can be hammered down with consistency and force. The buttons have reasonable speed, and they\u2019re quiet and comfortable \u2013 so you can work without disturbing others. It\u2019s satisfyingly easy to use for long periods.",
    "Apple\u2019s keyboards have more speed and snap, but only real fanatics will be bothered.",
    "The backlight uses a gentle amber tone that Acer says is warm and calming, and it can be adjusted with four brightness levels.",
    "The trackpad is decent, too. The surface is smooth, precise and has full gesture support, and the in-built buttons are responsive.",
    "The 15.6in screen has a 4K resolution, which means a density level of 282ppi. That\u2019s vast, and it means this screen is crisp. For precise design and colour work, that\u2019s crucial.",
    "It\u2019s the same resolution and width as the main screen on the Asus, and it\u2019s better than the MacBook Pro.",
    "Quality levels are superb. The Delta E sits at 1.9, which is great \u2013 anything below 2 means human eyes can\u2019t detect colour deviations. The temperature of 6,329K is great, too \u2013 barely different from the 6,500K ideal. The Acer rendered 99.8% of the sRGB and 98.9% of the Adobe RGB gamuts \u2013 so it\u2019s comfortable working in both colour spaces.",
    "The brightness level of 385cd/m2 is huge \u2013 high enough to make it easy to use this machine under office lights and outdoors. That brightness figure is joined by a black point of 0.26cd/m2, which lends proper depth to dark areas.",
    "The contrast ratio of 1,480:1 is superb, and means the whole screen has exceptional punch and vibrancy \u2013 and that it does a great job of rendering subtly-changing shades.",
    "In terms of pure screen quality, the Asus is better \u2013 its OLED panel has vibrant colours and perfect black levels, and it has that second panel.",
    "However, the Acer\u2019s screen is one of the best on the market, with top-tier colours and contrast. It\u2019s better than the MacBook Pro, and it\u2019s easily good enough for photo and design work."
