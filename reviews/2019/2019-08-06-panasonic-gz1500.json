  "summary": "Panasonic\u2019s first 2019 OLED TV Is a stunner",
  "verdict": "The 55GZ1500 is a fantastic TV all-rounder. It delivers beautifully cinematic, subtle, involving and immaculate pictures that feel as if they\u2019re coming straight out of a Hollywood mastering suite. Its front-facing speaker system enables it to partner those awe-inspiring pictures with clean, direct sound, too. Best of all, it can get the best from every HDR format, thanks to compatibility with both HDR10+ and Dolby Vision.",
  "pros": [
    "Scintillating picture quality",
    "Very good audio",
    "Uniquely flexible HDR support",
    "Built-in Dolby Atmos decoding"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Slightly limited smart features",
    "Minor colour banding",
    "Minor motion stutter",
    "Some OLEDs push brighter"

    "Panasonic\u2019s OLED story is seriously compelling. The Japanese brand pioneered the plasma TV technology that OLED ended up succeeding \u2013 while the picture processing it\u2019s developed for the last few OLED generations has been tuned for accuracy by various Hollywood colorists.",
    "Panasonic has developed numerous picture features for its professional monitor division that have gradually filtered down to its consumer TVs.",
    "Most enticingly of all, professional film and TV grading studios have actually started using Panasonic\u2019s consumer OLED TVs as their pro mastering screens, meaning you can actually buy a screen at retail price, then watch a film or TV show that was mastered on that very model.",
    "The 55GZ1500 Panasonic stands out from last year\u2019s models through a new HCX Pro video processor, an improved smart TV interface, built-in Dolby Atmos audio, and most excitingly of all, the ability to play both the HDR10+ and Dolby Vision HDR formats.",
    "In the UK, the GZ1500 retails at \u00a32,299 for the 55-inch model, and \u00a32,999 for the 65-inch model. The GZ1500 is available in the UK, EU, Australia and Canada \u2013 though not the United States.",
    "Panasonic\u2019s mid-range OLED TV for 2019 chooses subtlety and elegance over flashiness and glamour. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",
    "The slim black frame around the screen sits low on a heavy duty \u2013 but not especially flashy \u2013 metal plate stand, while a built-in soundbar is so well integrated into the TV\u2019s bottom edge that it only adds an inch to the frame\u2019s height.",
    "The screen is barely a centimetre deep at its extremes too \u2013 even if the larger sections of the rear casing stick out more than most OLED rivals. It\u2019s a formidably heavy TV too, once its meaty stand has been attached.",
    "Connections are as you would expect of a premium 4K TV in 2019. All four HDMIs support 4K HDR \u2013 though unlike LG\u2019s OLED TVs, none of the 55GZ1500\u2019s HDMIs are made to the full bandwidth HDMI 2.1 specification. That means this TV won\u2019t support the 4K 120Hz games we might see from the next generation of PCs or PS5 and Xbox Scarlett games consoles.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s remote control is attractive, well-built and easy to use. It\u2019s a shame, though, that Panasonic doesn\u2019t partner such a premium TV with a second, streamlined \u2018smart\u2019 remote.",
    "Design TL;DR Panasonic has done an excellent job of squeezing the 55GZ1500\u2019s powerful picture and sound technologies into an attractively understated and minimalistic body.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s smart features are based around the latest version (4.0) of Panasonic\u2019s My Home Screen interface.",
    "At first glance this looks the same as it has before, with just a trio of large icons appearing on the home screen providing access to your app collection, connected devices, and TV tuner options. Also as before, you can easily select apps you\u2019ve downloaded to show up on the home screen, and rearrange the order in which the home screen apps appear.",
    "Look closer, though, and there is a new element to My Home Screen. Namely that you can now scroll vertically down from the starting row of icons to four other rows. Three of these are devoted to Netflix, Youtube and Freeview Play, and show direct links to recommended shows and videos on each platform.",
    "The final deck allows you to change the running order of the new vertical decks, and select the deck that comes up by default when you hit the home button.",
    "While this new multi-tier home screen streamlines navigation, the platform still feels a little basic compared with some of its rivals. Although it covers the most popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Rakuten and all of the UK\u2019s key terrestrial broadcaster catch up apps \u2013 under Freeview Play \u2013 it\u2019s still missing a few services you can get on other platforms, such as Now TV, BT Sport, and Apple TV.",
    "The 55GZ1500 also doesn\u2019t support any built-in voice recognition platforms, unlike pretty much all top-tier rivals. Though it can work with Alexa and Google Assistant if you link through to a compatible smart speaker or listening device.",
    "One notable advantage of the 55GZ1500, though, is that thanks to its dual dynamic HDR format support, it will play any HDR content on any platform. That means you get HDR10+ streams on Amazon Prime Video, as well as Dolby Vision streams on Netflix. If you always want to get the best picture quality from any 4K HDR source, support for both premium HDR formats is a big deal.",
    "Smart features TL;DR My Home Screen 4.0 is an attractive, easy to use and very customisable interface, but it\u2019s a little basic in some areas versus the leading systems, and is missing one or two noteworthy apps.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s pictures are all about subtlety, naturalism and balance \u2013 with a display that can eke out every last drop of quality and beauty from the standard dynamic range (SDR) images that still take up a good amount of our viewing time.",
    "For instance, the way Panasonic's TV can render the very finest shadow details and colour tone shifts is in some ways at its most effective within SDR\u2019s relatively confined dynamic range and colour palette. It leaves SDR pictures looking gorgeously refined and nuanced, with the screen\u2019s arguably peerless light management reproducing every last bit of impact and depth SDR has to offer.",
    "Skin tones look exquisitely detailed too, and even the darkest objects appear to have a startling three-dimensionality to them (rather than looking flat or hollow) due to the level of detail the screen can reproduce in dark areas.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s ability to deliver light and dark pixels right alongside each other with no compromise also helps it make SDR look impressively dynamic. Not HDR levels of dynamic, of course, but punchy enough to reveal just how much SDR can do \u2013 especially when reproduced on a screen that feels like an escapee from a professional mastering studio.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s HD to 4K upscaling is also the best Panasonic has ever delivered (which is saying something, actually). It achieves the dual benefit of looking crisper and more detailed than any previous Panasonic upscaling engine, while also doing a better job of suppressing noise and retaining grain without exaggerating it.",
    "The upscaling processing\u2019s work is brilliantly aided and abetted, of course, by the 55GZ1500\u2019s innate shadow detail and colour finesse.",
    "The only negative thing I found with HD/SDR sources was an occasional stutter/pause while watching 24p / 24fps sources \u2013 though I\u2019ll cover this in a little more detail in the next section.",
    "HD/SDR Performance TL;DR The 55GZ1500\u2019s SDR pictures are dangerously close to perfect.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s HDR pictures are, thankfully, just as spectacular, if not more so. There are so many exemplary things about them, in fact, that trying to list them individually proves a major challenge. But here goes.",
    "The set\u2019s contrast performance is mesmerising. Black levels are truly spectacular, delivering black colours as deep and pure as anything I\u2019ve seen on any TV. Crucially, though, they\u2019re also fantastically subtle when it comes to shadow detail and tonal shading in the darkest areas of any HDR source.",
    "OLED TVs are, of course, renowned for being great at delivering deep black colours, due to their self-emissive nature. However, they traditionally struggle with \u2018near black\u2019 image content, due to the difficulties associated with essentially switching OLED pixels off (for full black) and on (for any sort of light).",
    "You really wouldn\u2019t believe this was a problem at all from watching the 55GZ1500, though. There\u2019s no sense of \u2018black crush\u2019 (when dark grays simply turn black), and no vertical bar inconsistencies across the panel. Instead, there\u2019s plenty of subtlety and detail in even the deepest near-black parts of the picture \u2013 without any of the speckling or blocking noise that you see on most rival OLED TVs. The results of this shading finesse can\u2019t be overstated, ensuring that 4K/HDR sources look cinematic, dynamic and stunningly three-dimensional.",
    "Underlining the phenomenal black level performance is the stellar precision of the 55GZ1500\u2019s light control, especially when handling small light sources in otherwise dark scenes \u2013 such as distant city lights at night. There isn\u2019t so much as a hint of compromise in either the intensity of the small bright object or the rich blackness around it.",
    "Of course, it\u2019s not exactly surprising for OLED screens to be able to express extreme light differences, with levels of pixel-level precision beyond their LCD counterparts. But it feels like no screen before has done this quite so exquisitely well with HDR sources as the 55GZ1500: the results are irresistibly immersive and, often, truly beautiful.",
    "The 55GZ1500 is also engagingly bright for an OLED set. Brightness for a white HDR square, covering 10% of the screen, measures at 700-775 nits \u2013 depending on which picture preset you use. That certainly isn\u2019t the absolute brightest we\u2019ve tested, but the phenomenal light management on display here makes every single one of those nits count.",
    "Remarkably, Panasonic has managed to apply the same finesse and subtlety to the 55GZ1500\u2019s colour performance that it has to the set\u2019s contrast. Tones across the wide spectrum the screen can cover are delivered with stunning deftness \u2013 even when dealing with awkwardly-lit skin tones or extremely bright tones.",
    "The naturalism and neutrality of the 55GZ1500\u2019s colours impresses right out of the box, too. What\u2019s more, this sense of authenticity holds more or less true regardless of which picture preset you decide is best suited to your tastes, viewing conditions, or the particular content you\u2019re watching.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s ability to deliver even the slightest shading difference, with both colours and contrast also helps high-quality 4K images enjoy spectacular depth and three-dimensionality. Unusually for the TV world, this sense of depth holds equally good with dark as well as light scenes. The Revenant, with its many stunning landscapes and sun- or snow-backed woodlands, is a particular beneficiary of the 55GZ1500\u2019s talent for tonal subtlety and image depth. So good do The Revenant\u2019s pictures look at times on Panasonic\u2019s new OLED screen, in fact, that I felt like I was watching it for the first time \u2013 despite using it as a regular test disc for years.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s immense colour and shade precision enables it to deliver some of the most detailed looking 4K pictures I\u2019ve seen, too. Even though the screen I tested was only 55 inches in size, its precision never leaves you in any doubt whatsoever that you\u2019re watching a fantastically dense, textured, refined and HD-thrashing picture.",
    "While model is at its most comfortable with HDR content that\u2019s been mastered to 1000 nit peaks, it still does a great job of retaining its natural, immersive, balanced and detailed look with 4000-nit content (currently the brightest HDR video content gets). It\u2019s particularly good at retaining subtle shading and tone differences in the brightest colours and white areas with such content compared with other OLED screens.",
    "The 55GZ1500\u2019s already stellar performance is taken to new heights if you feed the set an HDR10+ or Dolby Vision 4K Blu-ray too. There\u2019s more dynamism and better balanced lighting \u2013 especially during dark scenes \u2013 than you get with standard HDR10 feeds.",
    "Panasonic\u2019s own processing is clever enough to do a great job of HDR10, of course. But the dynamic metadata of the HDR10+ and Dolby Vision formats still brings a little extra to the party \u2013 making it all the more gratifying that the TV supports both formats, given that the vast majority of 4K Blu-rays or HDR streams are only available in one format or the other.",
    "Gamers, meanwhile, will be delighted to learn that the 55GZ1500 only measured around 13ms of lag when running in its Game mode \u2013 about as low as it gets in the TV world.",
    "It\u2019s seriously hard to find problems with the 55GZ1500\u2019s pictures. But a couple of small issues did become apparent.",
    "First, there are traces of colour banding watching HDR \u2013 usually during shots of the sky \u2013 that can become a little ripply if they coincide with a fade to black.",
    "Second, there\u2019s occasionally a brief \u2018freeze\u2019 in the picture during camera movements \u2014 particularly zoom ins, or when image content comes right towards you. This was at its most noticeable, oddly, with Panasonic\u2019s Intelligent Frame Creation switched on \u2013 which is actively meant to prevent picture judder.",
    "Finally, the 55GZ1500\u2019s HDR pictures \u2013 at least when showing 4000-nit films \u2013 aren\u2019t quite as dynamic and punchy as those of the latest OLED Philips TVs and LG TVs. However, the (considerable) trade off for this, as noted earlier, is that the Panasonic\u2019s pictures retain more colour naturalism and balance, as well as subtler tonal detailing, in the most extreme HDR parts of the picture.",
    "4K/HDR Performance TL;DR The 55GZ1500\u2019s handling of 4K, HDR and wide colour technologies is more consistently intelligent, natural and immersive than it is on any other TV I\u2019ve tested.",
    "The combination of a built-in soundbar and Dolby Atmos processing pays more dividends than you might expect, given that the soundbar looks too small to do any real damage.",
    "There\u2019s a real sense of scale to the soundstage, which expands well beyond the confines of the TV\u2019s bodywork \u2013 while the key elements of the mix project with a directness and impact you just don\u2019t get with more common down-firing speaker arrangements.",
    "The soundbar locks vocals to their source screen too, somehow managing to deliver height, width and even depth effects with uncanny accuracy. The soundstage is clean and detailed, suffering hardly any sense of compression, distortions or muddiness.",
    "A bit more bass would have sealed the deal, but this feels more like something you only miss if you stop to think about it, rather than something that you\u2019re likely to notice mid-movie.",
    "Sound Quality TL;DR It might not look very big, but the 55GZ1500\u2019s built-in soundbar delivers an impressively detailed, powerful and clean sound, with a surprisingly effective sense of height and width through Dolby Atmos mixes.",
    "On the OLED front, the LG C9 or, perhaps more fairly, LG E9 models are the 55GZ1500\u2019s closest rivals. The images are slightly more aggressive on both of these LG models, with very bright HDR content, while the E9 delivers an even more powerful Dolby Atmos sound performance.",
    "The 55GZ1500 does, however, deliver more balanced, consistent and overall cinematic pictures, while its support for HDR10+ as well as Dolby Vision (LG TVs only support the latter) is very persuasive. Panasonic\u2019s TV is also \u00a3300 cheaper than the E9.",
    "Some LCD TVs can get substantially brighter with HDR than the 55GZ1500\u2019s OLED screen can. The Samsung Q90R series, in particular, reaches around 2000 nits, while still maintaining deep black levels at the other end of the scale.",
    "The Q90R does have to compromise its extreme peak brightness substantially with very contrast-rich content, though, and can suffer with backlight blooming during off-axis viewing \u2013 even if Samsung has largely solved its viewing angle problems in its 2019 range. Samsung also only supports HDR10+ with its TVs, without Dolby Vision.",
    "It\u2019s worth briefly adding here that Panasonic\u2019s own GZ2000 OLED will have a panel cooling technology to aid with brightness compared to existing OLEDs, though we\u2019ll have to see how it fares upon release later this year.",
    "While Panasonic\u2019s smart TV features may be a little off the pace set by LG and Samsung, Panasonic\u2019s Hollywood ties and unparalleled experience with self-emissive screen technologies have taken OLED picture quality to giddy new heights with the 55GZ1500. Oh, and it sounds pretty good, too.",
    "Panasonic is also the clear winner in today\u2019s format wars, offering both HDR10+ and Dolby Vision across its mid-range and premium sets, including the GZ1500 reviewed here. For viewers wanting to get top quality video from whatever streaming platform or 4K Blu-ray they come across, something like the GZ1500 is probably your best bet."
