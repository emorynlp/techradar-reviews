    "Known for its instantly-recognizable guitar amps, Marshall\u2019s foray into the world of headphones has been marked by cool, retro-looking cans with modern conveniences like Bluetooth connectivity \u2013 and now, built-in voice assistance.",
    "The Marshall Major III Voice headphones come with support for Google Assistant built-in, allowing you to summon the helpful voice assistant at the touch of a button, as well as double the battery life (and the price) of their wired predecessor.",
    "But how much of an improvement are they over the original Major IIIs? We put these vintage-style on-ear headphones to the test to see if that steep price hike is really justified.",
    "The new Marshall Major III Voice headphones are available to buy for $169 / \u00a3149, which works out at around AU$245; however, they aren\u2019t yet available to buy in Australia, despite being advertised on the Marshall website.",
    "That\u2019s a considerable price increase from the original wired Major IIIs, which are available to buy from the official Marshall Headphones store for $79 / \u00a369 / AU$149.99.",
    "That being said, the wireless version of these cans, the Major III Bluetooth headphones, cost $149.99 / \u00a3129.99 / $249.99, so you\u2019re only looking at a $20 increase if you\u2019ve already become accustomed to the wireless way of life.",
    "In terms of design, the Marshall Major III Voice headphones haven\u2019t changed dramatically since their wireless predecessor was released in 2018. They sport the same compact on-ear design, which is fully collapsible so you can easily stow them away in your bag when not in use.",
    "Based on Marshall\u2019s iconic amps, these wireless headphones make use of the brand\u2019s signature leather look (although this material is actually made of lookalike vinyl, vegans will be pleased to know), with gold accents, sturdy metallic hardware, and the Marshall script proudly displayed on the outer housings.",
    "The square-shaped cups found here feature 3D hinges that can rotate freely, so whether you\u2019re wearing them on your head or around your neck, they should adapt to your body for a secure fit. Both the hinges and sliders are made from metal, and as a result, the headphones feel robust and well-made.",
    "On the left housing you\u2019ll find a gold control knob, which allows you to play, pause, shuffle, and adjust the volume of your music, as well as turn the Major III Voice on and off. This multi-functional button can also be used to answer, reject, and end calls.",
    "The right housing features the all-new voice assistant button \u2013 press this to summon Google Assistant on your smartphone or tablet, which you can then command using your voice alone.",
    "With a straight band and heavily padded on-ear cushions, the Major III Voice headphones are designed to be comfortable for long periods of time; however, we found the opposite when we tested them.",
    "Listening to music for 30 minutes was enough to induce that clamping feeling that\u2019s all too common with on-ear headphones \u2013 an hour spent with the headphones on left our ears feeling quite sore. If you also experience this problem with on-ear headphones, we\u2019d recommend opting for over-ear headphones, which are usually more comfy, surrounding your ears rather than being placed on top of them \u2013 or, for ultimate ear-breathability, try some in-ear headphones.",
    "While these cans are wireless, they do come with a detachable coiled wire, which feels durable enough, coming with a one-button remote that can be used to control your music playback. Unlike their wired predecessor, there\u2019s only one 3.5mm jack to plug into, but that\u2019s not a huge issue unless you\u2019re looking for audiophile-quality fidelity \u2013 which is not what you get with these rock-inspired cans.",
    "New to this generation of the Marshall Major III headphones is support for Google Assistant \u2013 simply press a dedicated button on the outer right earcup to summon the voice assistant on your device.",
    "Once summoned, you can ask Google Assistant things like \u201cwhat\u2019s the weather like today?\u201d, or \u201cwhat\u2019s on my calendar this week?\u201d, as well as asking it to control your smart home gadgets like smart lights and security cameras.",
    "Google Assistant can also read out your notifications, saving you the trouble of getting your phone out every time you get a text or email. It\u2019s certainly a useful feature \u2013 provided you use Google Assistant as opposed to Siri or Alexa, of course.",
    "Battery life is exceptional, with 60 hours of wireless playtime on a single charge; that should be more than enough to get you through your weekly commute, and it leaves many of the best wireless headphones in the dust.",
    "Bluetooth connectivity is good; pairing the Major III Voice with our smartphone was totally seamless, and we didn\u2019t experience any dropouts, despite using them in a \u2018high-traffic\u2019 area with lots of other devices competing for connectivity.",
    "As with the original Marshall Major IIIs, these headphones come with 40mm dynamic drivers that are designed to displace lots of air for a powerful sound. Overall, the sound is relatively balanced, and will work fine if you\u2019re wanting to soundtrack your commute \u2013 however, these aren\u2019t audiophile headphones by any stretch.",
    "They\u2019re at their best when playing guitar music; the gently strummed guitar in Bon Iver\u2019s For Emma sounds warm and natural, while Justin Vernon\u2019s falsetto vocal has a rich, resonant quality. The same can\u2019t be said when the vocals dip into the mid-low ranges, where they feel lost amongst the other frequencies.",
    "Moving on to the more energetic 10 dEAThbREasT, it becomes clear that the Major III Voice don\u2019t possess the precision or agility to faithfully replicate the complex, distortion-heavy chopped and screwed beats in this track.",
    "They fare better with Wild Beasts\u2019 All The King\u2019s Men, in which baritone vocals sound rich and sonorous, while meandering bass lines underpin complicated drum fills and undulating guitar riffs.",
    "Simple guitar-based songs are where these on-ear cans shine; Bright Eyes\u2019 We Are Nowhere And It\u2019s Now sounds natural and clear, with good separation between the different frequencies.",
    "Overall, the audio quality is fine, if not a bit dull; there\u2019s no sparkle at the top end to give your music a sense of liveliness, while the warm presentation sometimes makes the bass feel weak in comparison to the other frequencies.",
    "That being said, that overall warm tone is very forgiving, and it does make for an enjoyable listening experience.",
    "The soundstage isn't particularly wide either, which is compounded when listening to complicated, highly textural tracks \u2013 although it does feel more \u2018open\u2019 with simpler songs.",
    "There\u2019s a lot to like about the Marshall Major III Voice \u2013 they sport a quirky retro design with a company heritage that any discerning rock fan is bound to appreciate.",
    "The vintage-style design won\u2019t appeal to everyone, but there\u2019s no denying that the combination of black leather-look vinyl and gold accents is really attractive \u2013 it\u2019s just a shame that they aren\u2019t as comfortable as the padded earcups and headband might suggest.",
    "They\u2019re incredibly convenient to use, with an exceptional battery life and support for Google Assistant built in; pairing is also seamless, while the option for wired listening is good to have in case you do run out of juice on the go. For a price increase of around $20 (\u00a315 / AU$20), the new battery life is a fantastic upgrade of the Major III Bluetooth headphones.",
    "Where the Major III Voice are let down is the audio quality; it\u2019s passable, and to an extent, what you\u2019d expect at this price, but don\u2019t expect to pick out hidden details in your favorite tracks or to be blown away by the bass.",
    "As expected from a rock-inspired pair of headphones, they fare better with guitar-based music \u2013 if that\u2019s your jam, these could be the cans for you."
