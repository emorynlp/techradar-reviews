    "In the race to create some of the cheapest true wireless earbuds on the planet, Kitsound\u2019s District True Wireless Earbuds are leading the race.",
    "At just $90 (\u00a369, AU$125), these are some of the cheapest true wireless earbuds we've yet to see. They're not as cheap as the Funcl AI True Wireless Headphones but they cost half of what Apple is charging for the Apple AirPods.",
    "That being said, in the past we\u2019ve found many cheaper true wireless in-ears to be riddled with connectivity problems and sub-standard battery life - better antennas and bigger batteries cost more money, after all.",
    "Can Kitsound's latest budget buds can shake off the negative associations many have with value in-ears? Here's what we found out.",
    "The District True Wireless Earbuds cost \u00a369.99, which works out at around $90 / AU$125. Right now, it looks like they are only available to buy in the UK, with no word on whether they will be released in other territories.",
    "At around $90, these true wireless in-ears are right at the lowest end of the price scale. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t a good pair of earbuds, though; one of our favorite pairs of true wireless earbuds, the Optoma NuForce BE Free5s cost just $100, showing just how accessible truly wireless headphones are today.",
    "In terms of design, the District True Wireless Earbuds aren\u2019t anything to write home about; they look and feel very functional, from the charging case to the earbuds themselves.",
    "With an IPX5 rating, these earbuds should be able to withstand sweaty workouts, although Kitsound doesn\u2019t recommend leaving them in wet conditions for long periods of time.",
    "The earbuds themselves feature an egg-shaped rubber housing that\u2019s designed to fit snugly into your ear and stay secure while you\u2019re on the move. On the outside of each housing you\u2019ll find the Kitsound logo in grey, and an LED indicator that flashes red or blue when the earbuds are in pairing mode, connected to your device, charging, or low on battery.",
    "Battery life is okay \u2013 four hours is generally the standard for true wireless earphones, but you\u2019re only getting 3.5 with the District True Wireless Earbuds. However, the charging case does provide you with up to 40 hours playtime when fully charged, which is pretty impressive.",
    "Although they do feel very secure and sturdy, the housing of the buds are quite big, and they pressed uncomfortably on our ears, which isn\u2019t ideal if you\u2019re planning on using them for long listening sessions.",
    "The all-black charging case is similarly kitted out with a rubber lid, which opens to reveal two magnetic charging ports; to charge the earbuds, you simply place them into the ports, and the LED indicator will flash red to let you know that they are charging successfully.",
    "If you want a quick visual indication of how much juice they have left, the case itself also features a row of four LEDs that indicate how much battery the charging case currently has.",
    "On the back of the case you\u2019ll find a micro-USB and a USB port for charging; both ports are hidden by a rubber cover, which means you don\u2019t have to worry about debris finding a way in there.",
    "Including a USB port in the charging case is a fantastic feature, as it allows you to give you phone a quick battery boost when you\u2019re running low on the move.",
    "Pairing the District True Wireless Earbuds to our smartphone was seamless, and they connected straight away. However, when listening to music we found the earbuds would disconnect from each other, causing us to lose all the sound in one earbud periodically throughout our testing.",
    "The good news is that, for their size, these earbuds put out a decent amount of sonic power, with a sensitivity of 108dB \u2013 headphones generally have an upper sensitivity of 110dB to avoid distortion at high volumes.",
    "That said, the overall sound is extremely warm, to the point that music almost sounds muffled. This is particularly noticeable in high frequency percussive elements like hi-hats and snares; when we listened to Wild Beasts\u2019 \u2018Bed Of Nails\u2019, we found ourselves craving a lot more attack and crispness in those higher frequencies.",
    "Vocals and other mid-frequency instruments like guitars and keys sound great, with a warm, smooth tone that feels pleasantly distinct from the other frequencies.",
    "If you\u2019re into your bass, you may be disappointed by the District True Wireless Earbuds. We found that the bass wasn\u2019t punchy enough to feel powerful, again suffering from that muffled effect that plagued the higher frequencies.",
    "To control your music or summon your device\u2019s voice assistant, you can simply press down on the housing of the earbuds. Doing this to change the volume, skip, pause, and play tracks, as well as summoning our device\u2019s voice assistant worked well, however you have to push down quite hard on the housing to get it to work. This means pushing the eartips further into your ear canal and can get pretty uncomfortable after awhile.",
    "The main selling point of the KS District True Wireless Earbuds is the price; at just around $90 they\u2019re a bit of a bargain for true wireless earphones. It\u2019s often the case with cheap true wireless headphones, that you\u2019ll experience connection dropouts; while the two earbuds sometimes struggled to stay connected with each other, connecting them to our device via Bluetooth was a breeze.",
    "Their IPX5 rating and secure fit means that they would make a great pair of in-ears for runners, but some may find the bulky housings slightly uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.",
    "The battery life of the earbuds themselves leaves something to be desired, but with the charging case you\u2019re looking at around 40 hours of playback, which not only only gives your buds a battery boost, but can also charge your phone if you\u2019re running low on juice.",
    "In terms of audio quality, the District True Wireless Earbuds aren\u2019t going to blow you away, but they do provide a good level of volume, with smooth mid frequencies. However, these earphones won\u2019t give you crystal clear highs or thumping bass, so audiophiles will likely want to look elsewhere \u2013 in everything from the design to the audio quality, these headphones are made to be functional (and not much more).",
    "These issues mean that we can\u2019t wholeheartedly recommend the District True Wireless Earbuds as the best true wireless headphones on the market. They're uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The earbuds periodically drop connection from one another. They sound extremely warm to the point sound is muffled. The only thing they have going for them is that they're cheap \u2013 and even then, there are even cheaper True Wireless Earbuds out there.",
    "So, if you're looking for the most basic true wireless headphones on the market and can put up with a lot of drawbacks, Kitsound's District True Wireless might make sense for you. Otherwise, we'd advise you to keep looking."
