    "The G-Technology G-Drive 4TB is one of the most popular external hard drives drives today, and it\u2019s not hard to understand why.",
    "Solid state drives (SSDs) aren\u2019t just all the rage these days. They have all but displaced spinning hard disk drives, as they\u2019re simply better in a lot of ways for most end-user devices. SSDs boast low power consumption, faster performance and shock resistance.",
    "There are ways in which HDDs still rule the roost. SSDs have come a long way as well in terms of cost per unit storage, but they haven\u2019t caught up to the affordability of HDDs. Hard drives are still much more affordable, especially for multi-terabyte capacities.",
    "The G-Technology G-Drive, for example, costs as little as \u00a3153 (around $215) for the 4TB model with the 6TB model available for only \u00a320 more. You will be hard pressed to find a 1TB external SSD for less than \u00a3300 (G-Tech\u2019s very own G-Drive being the exception at less than \u00a3200).",
    "Affordability aside, is the G-Technology G-Drive 4TB worth it? Well, it delivers some great read/write speeds with a minimalist design. In short, absolutely.",
    "And, with Black Friday and Cyber Monday just around the corner, it might just get cheaper than it\u2019s ever been.",
    "Designed to match the Apple product range, the G-Technology G-Drive external hard disk features an all-aluminum enclosure with an illuminated \u2018G\u2019 logo and air vents (to cool the drive) on the front. A large \u2018G\u2019 adorns the top of the device and there\u2019s a power switch, a USB Type-C connector (Gen 1 so only up to 5Gbps) and a power socket at the back.",
    "It is a relatively large piece of kit at 196 x 128.5 x 35.3mm with a weight of just over 1kg, and that\u2019s because of the 3.5-inch hard disk drive that\u2019s inside.",
    "In addition, a wieldy 19V, 3.42A (65W) power supply unit accompanies the device, which is at odds with the minimalist design of the drive. Four rubber feet plus the usual details (serial number, barcode) are located on the base of the device.",
    "The drive can even charge your MacBook or MacBook Pro (or indeed any recent laptops that support Power Delivery).",
    "The G-Drive external drive is plug-and-play on Apple Mac and can be easily reformatted for Windows. It is also Time Machine ready so you will be able to quickly backup all your files.",
    "Pry open this drive and you will find a Western Digital WD40EMRX-82UZ0N0, otherwise known as the WD Red. This is a 4TB hard disk drive spinning at 5400RPM with 64MB cache \u2013 a storage device that has been fine-tuned to deliver cooler temperatures in use and targets NAS users.",
    "There is a 10TB model \u2013 with a staggering 256MB cache \u2013 available directly from G-Technology in the US for $370 (around \u00a3260) but it is not yet available in the UK.",
    "WD says that its Red range has features such as NAS compatibility, increased reliability, error recovery controls as well as noise and vibration protection that make it a great choice for use cases that require better reliability than your run-of-the-mill hard disk drive.",
    "Not surprisingly, the drive comes with a three-year limited warranty, plus a pair of USB Type-C cables and extra plugs for mainland Europe territories.",
    "The drive achieved some great numbers on CrystalDiskMark hitting 180MBps and 152.6MBps on sequential read/write benchmarks respectively, while reaching 182MBps and 184MBps with sequential read/write speeds on the popular ATTO disk benchmark. That\u2019s not far from the \u2018up to\u2019 transfer rates of 195MBps claimed by the manufacturer.",
    "As expected the drive warmed up a bit during our testing, but this represented nothing alarming for a storage device that is expected to be powered on 24/7.",
    "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there both from Western Digital \u2013 the parent company of G-Technology \u2013 and from others, although few can match the level of reliability set by the G-Drive.",
    "There are, for example, plenty of 2.5-inch external hard disk drives that cost about \u00a3100 (around $140). However, leaving those to run 24/7 is not advisable because they were not designed from the ground up to work that way.",
    "Western Digital has a 4TB Elements drive for around \u00a3100 ($140) and a 4TB WD My Book desktop hard drive, while Seagate-owned LaCie sells a 4TB Porsche Design USB-C drive \u2013 that targets the same audience as the G-Drive \u2013 and a high performance drive called the D2 that is surprisingly inexpensive.",
    "The G-Drive external HDD shows that spinning hard drives still have their place in an increasingly SSD-centric marketplace. This product hits a good balance between being relatively affordable and suitably capacious.",
    "Although it was launched more than a year ago, the G-Drive is still very much competitive with rivals launched in 2017. It is fast, reasonably well built, compatible with Apple products and has a faster implementation of USB Type-C.",
    "It would be great if G-Technology decided to produce a mini version of this drive (or even simply shrink the current device for a new 2018 offering), and also introduced a 2TB version to compete with Samsung. Making it waterproof would be the icing on the cake but that\u2019s unlikely to happen, mainly because that would put it in direct competition with SanDisk products, another sub-brand of Western Digital."
