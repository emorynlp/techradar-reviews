    "With a design based on its iconic amps, the Marshall Major III are perfect for those who want to flaunt a bit of rock heritage on their commute. Sturdy hardware and a relatively balanced sound make these a great option for those wanting to upgrade their basic cans.",
    "Slimmer and a little more stylish than 2016's Marshall Major II, their light build makes them ideal for long journeys, although the pinching sensation typical of on-ear headphones is an issue.",
    "[Update: Check out our review of the new Marshall Major III Voice headphones that integrate Google Assistant into its popular Major III on-ear wireless cans. If you need a pair of wireless headphones that will last you all week long on a single charge, we think the Major III Voice are a great option. However, if you\u2019re obsessed with audio fidelity, you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere.]",
    "The Major IIIs are available to buy from the official Marshall Headphones store for $79 / \u00a369 (around AU$135), representing a price hike of around \u00a37 for UK buyers based on current conversion rates.",
    "However, if you're based in the UK it's possible to buy them from Marshall's Amazon store for \u00a365 with free delivery included.",
    "Compared to similar on-ear models, the price sits comfortably in the mid-range and they are one of the cheaper models on offer from Marshall.",
    "If you've become accustomed to a wireless way of life, you would need to fork out a hefty $149 (\u00a3129 / around AU$206) for the Bluetooth enabled version of the Marshall IIIs.",
    "Similar to the Marshall Major II headphones of 2016, the Major IIIs make use of Marshall\u2019s signature leather look \u2013 although vegans will be pleased to know they\u2019re actually made out of lookalike vinyl. Overall they\u2019re less clunky than the Major IIs, with slimmed-down hardware and a more subdued black and white color scheme, as opposed to the gold-accented predecessors.",
    "With a straight band and heavily padded on-ear cushions, the headphones are designed to be comfortable for long periods of time, although we did experience a little discomfort from the pressure on ears after a long listening session. If you also have this problem with on-ear headphones, we\u2019d recommend opting for over-ear headphones, which are usually more comfy, surrounding your ears rather than being placed on top of them.",
    "The detachable coiled wire seems durable, and has a one-button remote that can be used to control the headphones and your phone\u2019s functionality. A nice touch is the 3.5mm sockets on both sides of the headphones, which means friends can easily tune in to what you\u2019re listening to if they too have a 3.5mm cable of their own handy.",
    "Issues with flimsy plastic adjustment sliders on previous models have been addressed with metal hardware, meaning the headphones feel fairly sturdy. They\u2019re also fully foldable, which is fantastic for listening on the go and packing tidily and safely into a bag.",
    "Overall the sound quality from the Marshall Major III headphones is decent, with a relatively well-balanced range. However these are not headphones for audiophiles.",
    "The top range is clear and sparkly, with hi hats and cymbals coming across particularly well \u2013 although this clarity can translate into a slight harshness at times. A smooth mid range makes the Major IIIs especially suited to listening to guitar music \u2013 unsurprising considering Marshall\u2019s rock heritage.",
    "To test the Major III\u2019s rock credentials, we listened to White Stripes\u2019 \u2018Fell In Love With A Girl\u2019. The guitars were pleasantly fuzzy, with punchy drums and clear vocals. However that harshness did start to grate after a little while.",
    "Where these headphones fall down is in the bass department, with slightly rolled-off frequencies which bassheads probably won\u2019t appreciate. We tried out James Blake\u2019s \u2018If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead\u2019 to put the bass frequencies to the test, and found the usually-body-thumping bass drum was pretty underwhelming. However, for general use, the sound is warm and balanced enough to give you a great listening experience.",
    "Passive noise cancellation is never a strong point of on-ear headphones, but the Marshall Major IIIs are particularly disappointing in this regard. We tried them in the office and could still easily hear people\u2019s conversations, meaning you\u2019d have to really blast your music if you wanted to drown out the outside world. There\u2019s no active noise cancellation option offered here, which isn\u2019t surprising considering this is seen as more of an entry level pair from Marshall. For active noise cancellation, you\u2019re going to have to stump up the cash for the enjoyable and premium Marshall Mid ANCs.",
    "The Marshall III\u2019s seem to be much better at drowning out white noise, which we discovered when we took them on the train for the morning commute. Furthermore, the isolation is good for this design of headphones, so you can rest assured you won\u2019t be annoying the people around you with your music taste.",
    "The Marshall Major IIIs are a neat pair of headphones, with a quirky retro design and tons of cool rock heritage to boot. They feel extremely well made, and improvements to the design mean you\u2019d have to be pretty rough with them to break them.",
    "Slimmer than their predecessors, they have a really stylish look, and the ability to fold them down means they are great for travelling.",
    "At $79 / \u00a369 (around AU$135), they\u2019re among Marshall\u2019s cheaper headphones; however, for the wireless Bluetooth-enabled version, you\u2019re looking at nearly double the price.",
    "Audiophiles probably won\u2019t rate the quality of the bass frequencies, but if you listen to a lot of guitar music, these might be the headphones for you."
