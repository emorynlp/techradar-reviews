  "summary": "Close to being the very best",
  "verdict": "Sword and Shield bring the \"mainline\" Pok\u00e9mon games onto the Nintendo Switch with a dollop of charm and a real sense of fun, as well as some much-needed gameplay optimizations. But not everything is picture perfect and while this new generation is close to being the very best (like no game ever was) there are some areas where it just falls short.",
  "pros": [
    "Fantastic Pok\u00e9mon designs",
    "Immersive new region",
    "Considered and effective gameplay improvements"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Dynamaxing mechanic doesn't quite hit the mark",
    "Not as graphically accomplished as other Switch titles"

    "When it comes to charm, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield have it in spades. Whether you\u2019re cooking a curry for your Pok\u00e9mon around a campfire or being cheered outside Gyms by complete strangers who recognize you off the \u201ctelly\u201d, these games go out of their way to warm you up, welcome you into their world and make you want to stay there.",
    "Sword and Shield introduce players to the new Galar region. Inspired by the UK, this region is characterful and utterly full of personality. It has a cohesive identity that affectionately caricatures British pop culture and speech, while each town and city that make it up still manages to have its own utterly distinct look, resulting in a region that\u2019s a playful mix of modernity and mythology. We had a niggling feeling as we wandered around the suspiciously clean cities and green rolling hills that this is potentially what some have convinced themselves the pre-EU UK once looked like. Galar is idyllic bordering on fantastical.",
    "Drawing on British culture and folklore in a similarly successful manner are the new Pok\u00e9mon native to this region. These regional variants and completely new creations are some of the best Pok\u00e9mon designs we\u2019ve seen in a long time, not only because they\u2019re so creative and likeable but because they actually introduce some exciting new type combinations, adding a greater capacity for variety and balance when building your team.",
    "Game Freak was fairly tight-lipped when it came to revealing the new Pok\u00e9mon that would feature in Sword and Shield. It was the right decision\u2014 this was the first game in a few generations that we felt a real sense of discovery when venturing into the long grass from the very start because we couldn\u2019t predict exactly what we were going to see.",
    "We would be remiss in talking about the game's Pok\u00e9mon if we didn't mention the cut to the National Pok\u00e9dex. Some of the furore around the cut of the National Dex from Sword and Shield has been understandable. For those who haven\u2019t heard, where players could once catch the several hundred Pok\u00e9mon on a game\u2019s Regional Pok\u00e9dex and then import the hundreds of others from across the series to complete a National Pok\u00e9dex, this is no longer possible.",
    "For long-standing fans who have been committed to bringing their team from the earliest games forward through successive generations, this is upsetting. This isn\u2019t an unreasonable feeling\u2014none of us can pretend we haven\u2019t had an emotional attachment to a Pok\u00e9mon even without years of dedication and attention plugged into them.",
    "However, it\u2019s important to note that the majority of players aren't likely to feel the effects of this, so while the loss of the option rankles it doesn't outright ruin by any means\u2014the game is still chock full of great monsters to catch and you might even discover some new favorites.",
    "While Sword and Shield does have some of the best-looking towns we've seen in the Pok\u00e9mon series, sometimes they fall short in terms of depth. Most of the towns are built around their Gym, which is understandable as they're the focal point of the community in Galar. But centralizing Gyms to this degree does sometimes leave the rest of the town feeling like somewhere that looks good with little else of importance to offer\u2014something to admire but not dig too far into.",
    "There\u2019s one particular town (and we won\u2019t spoil where it is) which basically is the gym. Aside from its Pok\u00e9mon centre and its gym battle, there\u2019s really nothing much else to see or do here which feels like a waste of an original location that a distinctive and central character of the game proudly calls home.",
    "Not every town in Galar is exactly like this\u2014there are a couple of big cities to offset it with a bit more to see and do\u2014but it\u2019s symptomatic of a bigger issue in the games whereby some areas can leave you feeling like you\u2019re being funnelled through an exceptionally pretty tunnel without a great deal of consequential interactivity or exploration.",
    "In complete contrast to this, however, is the game\u2019s sprawling Wild Area which sits in the centre of the map. This is the closest Pok\u00e9mon has gotten to a truly Breath of the Wild-style open world, where you\u2019re able to explore with control over the camera. It feels like a take on the real-life Pok\u00e9mon Go events that have been popping up over the world, where you\u2019re able to wander around a park area dedicated to finding and catching Pok\u00e9mon as well as engaging in Raids and bumping into other players.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a seasoned player or relatively new to Pok\u00e9mon, the first sight of the Wild Area with its changing weather conditions and wandering Pok\u00e9mon is striking. Nothing really beats the excitement of walking over a bridge and seeing a Gyarados glide through the water beside you.",
    "Significantly, the Wild Area is home to Pok\u00e9mon of all levels. This can be impressive and frustrating in equal measure as, alongside the usual obedience level cap, gym badges now determine the level of the Pok\u00e9mon you can catch. So if you only have one gym badge and you bump into a level 30 Snorlax, you might as well throw your Pok\u00e9Balls at a wall.",
    "As annoying as this can be, it makes the world more dynamic and helps Gym battles feel like an integral part of your journey of improvement\u2014powerful Pok\u00e9mon don\u2019t exist in a vacuum until you\u2019re ready for them and just because you can\u2019t catch them doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t battle them for training.",
    "With its diverse biomes and weather cycles allowing for adaptive spawning as well as its online social aspects, the Wild Area marks an exciting milestone for the series. The initial thrill of the area is never quite as strong on successive visits, in part because while the long grass is always densely populated, you can walk for quite some time before coming across the impressive sight of a strong Pok\u00e9mon stomping around in the open. And even then it\u2019s likely to be alone. But its appeal still holds.",
    "The Wild Area is a significant and positive break from tradition which successfully marries the linear Pok\u00e9mon story with the increased desire for more open worlds and we hope to see it built on in future releases.",
    "The Wild Area is also the home of Dynamax Raids, where you can join a team of three other players at a glowing den to battle and catch powerful and massive Dynamaxed Pok\u00e9mon. These Raids can be played with up to three friends online (or with three AI \u2018friends\u2019 if you\u2019re not really interested in online), and they vary in difficulty and worth. It\u2019s not a bad idea to dip in and out of them for the chance of encountering a powerful Pok\u00e9mon. However, a lot of the time the spectacle is more enjoyable than the battle itself.",
    "Dynamaxing as a mechanic generally doesn\u2019t always hit the right notes. It behaves like an amalgamation of Mega Evolution and Sun and Moon\u2019s Z-Moves by changing your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s size and allowing it to use more powerful moves. Like previous iterations, it has limitations and can be used once per battle for three moves as long as those battles take place in the Wild Area or in a Gym. The first couple of times Dynamaxing is used is fun thanks to the novelty of the animation and seeing the Godzilla Vs King Kong scale battles, but it begins to grate.",
    "Aside from how it looks, Dynamaxing doesn\u2019t actually add much to battles and the fact that Gym Leaders use it so predictably makes it feel like a chore you have to get through before you can collect your badge.",
    "Gym battles being televised from cavernous stadia is a great change because it finally brings the excitement and fervor around competitive Pok\u00e9mon battling that was so palpable in the anime to the games. There isn\u2019t really any need to fill the space with huge hulking Pok\u00e9mon to make it any more exciting.",
    "There\u2019s also even less need to complicate it further by including Gigantamaxing. This additional mechanic is very similar to Dynamaxing but is more rare and only possible for certain Pok\u00e9mon, changing their size and form as well as giving them more powerful moves. It feels like a needless additional layer.",
    "As Dynamaxing is so closely tied to the game\u2019s story it\u2019s hard to dismiss it entirely but there is a sense of style over substance with this mechanic.",
    "Speaking of the gym battles, regardless of our feelings towards Dynamaxing, these are very fun in Sword and Shield.",
    "Building on the Trials from Sun and Moon, the Gym Challenges in Sword and Shield mix mini-game elements with battles before face the Gym Leader. Not all challenges are made equal but there are some standouts that do a very good job of breaking up the monotony of continuous Pok\u00e9mon battles and smack talk from lesser trainers.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield actually feature plenty of light touches like this\u2014both new and expanded from previous releases\u2014that add a greater sense of fun to the game.",
    "A minor indication of the series\u2019 attempts to move forward and go bigger is the game\u2019s character customization options. While the customization is not the most comprehensive in the world, for the mainline Pok\u00e9mon games, it offers a lot more scope.",
    "With each boutique carrying its own clothing styles, we spent quite a large sum of in-game money and time sifting through the range of hair, makeup and clothing options and changing them up. This is the Pok\u00e9mon game with the best hair and for some players that will be a more ringing endorsement than anything else.",
    "Customization is just one optional enhancement that you can take advantage of in Sword and Shield. Others include the ability to swap your team from boxes out on the road, rather than visit a Pok\u00e9mon centre to use the computer; autosaving (even though we always saved twice manually before shutting down anyway); and streamlined fast travelling, where you can open the map and select somewhere you've been before, without any annoying animations or interactions dragging the process out further.",
    "You can still stick to the traditional methods and ignore these changes but for most the pull of convenience will simply be too great.",
    "Other enhancements aren\u2019t optional and it depends on player preference whether this is a good or a bad thing. The most notable one is that XP Share\u2014which allows you to spread your XP earned in battle more evenly across your team and level them up together. This is now always on where before it\u2019s been an option.",
    "For those who have never liked cycling their team in battle to keep levels balanced and avoid missing the Pok\u00e9mon team equivalent of leg day, this is unlikely to be an issue. But for those who enjoy the challenge, the removal of choice may rub the wrong way. The Pok\u00e9mon winning the battle does always get more XP even with the share system, so to keep things on a completely even keel it\u2019s still worth putting all of your team up to bat at some point, but it\u2019s not completely essential. Given XP Share has been optional previously, it just seems curious and slightly unnecessary to change it now.",
    "There are small changes which are likely to be less contentious, though. For example, now when you open the menu there\u2019s a handy little pop-up that tells you where you ought to be going next. You can ignore this, of course, but when you\u2019re being frazzled by your real-life and can\u2019t play Pok\u00e9mon for a while, it\u2019s nice to know you can drop into the solace of your virtual world and quickly pick-up where you left off.",
    "As appealing and necessary as many of these advancements are, however, when it comes to graphics Sword and Shield don\u2019t feel like they've advanced quite as far as we\u2019d like, at least relative to other big Switch releases.",
    "Having spent more time with Sword, it\u2019s clear that it shows the Pok\u00e9mon series at its visual best, but compared to other Nintendo Switch titles like the bar-setting Breath of the Wild it's not quite up to par.",
    "There were moments where Sun and Moon felt like they were straining against the confines of the 3DS system which made us excited for what was to come on Switch. And while Let\u2019s Go certainly did step up from there, Sword and Shield don\u2019t really feel like they\u2019ve gone much further. Draw distance isn't always great and in set-piece-heavy areas like the biggest cities and the Wild Area, the frame rate can drop.",
    "Cut scenes look good but not great and a little more variety in expressions would be welcome on characters. It\u2019s somewhat odd to see a character express distress in a text box while their face shows nothing but a benign smile and a quizzical brow. In this vein, some voice acting wouldn\u2019t go amiss in the future either. Even if only added to the game\u2019s cutscenes, this could really elevate the atmosphere, particularly in Gyms where the moments before a match feel oddly anticlimactic as the huge crowd cheers around two mute trainers.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon is a hugely popular series with a passionate fanbase so what it\u2019s been doing for past two decades clearly works. But the old adage \"if it\u2019s not broke don\u2019t fix it\" doesn\u2019t leave a whole lot of room for innovation or creativity.",
    "Games are an inherently creative medium, in terms of both making them and playing them, so at a certain point doing the same thing just because it works and the predictability is enjoyable is a disservice to both sides. It\u2019s not easy to break new ground to welcome new players when you\u2019re having to maintain a painstakingly honed and fiercely guarded garden of nostalgia at the same time, but Pok\u00e9mon is clearly learning to strike a balance.",
    "As much as we will cling to releases gone by, it\u2019s been refreshing to see Game Freak continue to build on some of the key changes it made in Sun and Moon with Sword and Shield.",
    "That said, the risk hasn\u2019t always paid off and not everything lands. Some of the changes and additions would have been better off not being made and in some areas the game just doesn\u2019t feel quite as full or as polished as it could be.",
    "But it\u2019s also important to note the many smaller changes intended to make gameplay more fun and flowing have absolutely been successful and worth making. And that's not even mentioning the excellent new Pok\u00e9mon designs and the Wild Area which is an exciting addition showing genuine promise.",
    "Overall, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield are solid and memorable releases for the series\u2019 first mainline Switch release. They\u2019re not flawless but they\u2019re enormous fun for players new and old, establishing a solid base from which to build when it comes to future generations."
