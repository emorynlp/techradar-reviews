  "author": "cat-ellis",
  "summary": "Clean and secure",
  "verdict": "Iolo has given its PC performance and security suite a total overhaul, and the results are impressive. Each component is effective and simple to use, and they combine to create a package that's even more than the sum of its parts.",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent value",
    "Effective cleanup and security tools",
    "Well designed and easy to use"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not all tools have one-click fixes"
  ],

    "Update: A recent change to Iolo's checkout process means you will be automatically subscribed to a $19.99 (about \u00a315 / AU$25) per month support package when you purchase a product. This is a very large extra charge, so make sure to double-check before entering your payment details.",
    "Iolo System Mechanic Ultimate Defense is the new name for Iolo Phoenix 360 \u2013 the company\u2019s all-in-one PC cleanup and security suite \u2013 but it\u2019s received much more than just a new name since our 2018 review. It now has a new design that brings it in line with Iolo\u2019s other software, plus new tools to tackle modern online threats",
    "Whereas other versions of System Mechanic are chiefly focused on improving your PC\u2019s performance, Ultimate Defense is also a fully-fledged security suite for protecting you from online threats.",
    "In addition to Iolo\u2019s PC cleanup tools (which we\u2019ve rated highly in previous reviews), this software also includes antivirus, a secure password manager, a drive wiper, anti-tracking tools for your web browser, malware detection and removal, and a file recovery tool.",
    "If you\u2019ve used an Iolo System Mechanic product before, the interface will be immediately familiar, but packed with a lot more icons and options. System Mechanic\u2019s home screen still puts system optimization front and center, prompting you to scan your PC for unnecessary files, broken registry entries and more.",
    "The Quick Scan option checks for temporary files, and only takes a few seconds, while the Deep Scan also checks for unnecessary startup processes, registry issues and sub-optimal Windows settings.",
    "One of the things we like best about System Mechanic is the level of detail is provides about each scan result. You can drill right down to find information about each file, and why you should consider removing (or keeping) it. This even applies to startup programs, which are given a community rating to help you decide whether or not to allow them to run.",
    "If you\u2019re short of time or not too confident, System Mechanic can perform a cleanup automatically, only removing files and ending processes that won\u2019t interfere with your daily PC use, but for more experienced users, the level of fine control is a real boon.",
    "When we reviewed Iolo Phoenix 360, one of our few complaints was that it felt like the Privacy Guardian element should be part of System Mechanic \u2013 and now it is. The tool no longer needs to be installed separately, and is only ever a click away. This is a welcome change that makes the software suite feel much more cohesive.",
    "Privacy Guardian works by preventing fingerprinting. This is a technique that advertisers can use to track you around the web without access to any personal information like your email address. Instead, it uses your PC\u2019s unique system configuration (which essentially works like a unique signature) to follow your browsing activity.",
    "Some browsers (such as Firefox) now come with anti-fingerprinting built in, but it\u2019s still far from mainstream, so a tool like Privacy Guardian is a very welcome one.",
    "Privacy Guardian also identifies and deletes tracking cookies from your system, though you can choose to whitelist cookies from certain sites to avoid being logged out of your accounts.",
    "There\u2019s also a quick shortcut for private searches using DuckDuckGo, but you might find it more convenient to add this to the list of search engines in your browser, or even make it your default if you\u2019re trying to escape from Google.",
    "Iolo\u2019s password manager, ByePass, is available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. It must be installed separately for each browser, but that\u2019s not an issue.",
    "It performs all the functions you\u2019d expect from a premium password manager, storing your login details, generating strong passwords, allowing you to access your accounts from all your devices and \u2013 importantly \u2013 logging you out securely at the end of a browsing session.",
    "Malware Killer \u2013 which was a new addition when we reviewed Iolo Phoenix 360 last year \u2013 has received a major update, giving you more control over what happens to identified threats, set exclusions, and review the history of past scans. In our tests, it threw up some false \u2018infections\u2019 (including the homepage tied to our Firefox account), but didn\u2019t flag them as malicious or recommend that we take action to purge them.",
    "SystemShield \u2013 Iolo\u2019s antivirus app \u2013 is refreshingly simple to use, with manually-triggered or scheduled scans. Like all good antivirus software, it uses heuristic analysis to detect new threats before they\u2019ve been catalogued. A scan can take some time to complete, so it would be nice to have a checkbox to shut down the PC once it\u2019s completed, but that\u2019s a minor quibble.",
    "The file recovery and drive scrubber tools are equally straightforward, not overwhelming you with options like some standalone tools. They perform one task, and do it well \u2013 something that can be said for each of System Mechanic Ultimate Defense\u2019s components and makes the suite much greater than the sum of those parts.",
    "One thing that strikes us as a little strange is that, while each tool features a color-coded circle at the top of the dashboard to indicate how secure or well optimized your system is, not all have a one-click tool for resolving identified issues.",
    "When you use the System Mechanic Pro tool, the central \u2018Scan\u2019 button turns into a \u2018Repair\u2019 one, but for other tools you\u2019ll need to spend some time. However, to fix issues identified by Privacy Guardian, you\u2019ll need to select each issue and correct it manually, down to the level of cookies in a specific browser. Otherwise, it\u2019s hard to find fault with Iolo\u2019s fully revamped all-in-one suite."
