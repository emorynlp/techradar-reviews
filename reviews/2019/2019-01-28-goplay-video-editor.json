    "Don\u2019t let the name GoPlay Video Editor confuse you: this Windows-only app is not strictly speaking a traditional video editor. Yes, it can import footage and let you cut it, reorder it, etc, which in a sense is editing, but the strength of this piece of software is its ability to record your screen - a very useful tool if you\u2019re into making tutorials or recording your game sessions for instance.",
    "When you first launch the app, you\u2019re offered a very simple menu: \u2018Video Editor\u2019 or \u2018Recorder\u2019. Since we\u2019ll be needing footage, let\u2019s take a look at its recording capabilities first.",
    "Having Clicked on \u2018Recorder\u2019, you\u2019re then graced with a live preview of what is currently seen on your screen. All the controls you need are at the bottom of that window. By default, GoPlay will record the entire screen for you, but if you select \u2018Area\u2019 instead, you can focus the recording on a specific section. This is useful as there doesn\u2019t appear to be any ability to crop the recorded clip in the editing part of the app, so if you don\u2019t want to share parts of your screen with others, this is the way to go.",
    "There\u2019s an option to use a webcam connected to your PC to record yourself at the same time. This is a cool feature which works as advertised, but you must specify how big you want the recording of yourself to be, and where on the screen you want to place it prior to starting the recording; you cannot alter this during the editing process. The video of yourself is essentially burned onto the footage as it\u2019s being recorded.",
    "You also have the option of recording the audio that comes from your PC and/or the one from your PC\u2019s built-in microphone.",
    "Once all your preferences are set, hit the big red button, and GoPlay will immediately begin recording the screen. Stoping the recording is done either via a keyboard shortcut or by clicking on that red button again.",
    "The Editing part of GoPlay Video Editor looks and feels like a regular non-linear video editing app, although your options are very limited. On the plus side, when you select a new tab or feature for the first time, a quick animated overlay appears to explain to you how to use is.",
    "Any footage you\u2019ve recorded appears in the browser section. Double-click on any clip to see it in the preview section to the right. Not only are the screen recordings there, but you can also import any number of other video clips stored on your hard drives.",
    "Just as you\u2019d expect, you create your video in the Timeline section. GoPlay doesn\u2019t allow gaps in your video so as you drag more and more clips, they\u2019re automatically added to the end of the previous one. Even better, delete a clip within your edit and all footage to its right is automatically moved to the left. This is not how most video editors work, and it allows you to build an edit fast.",
    "One reason this works so well is that you can only have one video track - which really marks this app down as a truly basic editor. There is a sort of workaround thanks to the picture in picture track. As its name suggests you can add a video on top of another. As it\u2019s designed to be a picture in picture effect, by default, that second video will be smaller than the one underneath it. However, not only can you reposition it to where you want it to be, you can resize it too.",
    "So theoretically, this could allow you to work with a maximum of two layers of video, but you\u2019d have to resize every clip you add there, and if you delete a clip in the primary track it won\u2019t affect the picture in picture clips\u2019 position, so this is a solution that is very far from ideal.",
    "You have access to a few intro graphics which GoPlay calls \u2018Beautiful Intros\u2019. These intros come with customisable text. You do have some changeable parameters, such as font type, size, colour and justification.",
    "Overlay images are available as well, should you wish to place bats or cartoon eyes on your video, for instance.",
    "As you\u2019d expect, you also have access to a handful of transitions, filters and text options, each with their own customisable parameters.",
    "As far as editing tools are concerned, you can split a clip into two and, well, that\u2019s it. No slip, slide or roll tools, no JKL keyboard shortcuts. When we said it was basic, we meant it.",
    "If you\u2019re not keen to record a narration as you\u2019re grabbing the screen, you have the option of doing it as you\u2019re working on the edit via the Dub button. Click on it, and the audio recording starts at the playhead\u2019s location. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t mute the other layers as you do so, meaning that if you forget to mute the tracks yourself, it will make it impossible to reposition your voice-over to another position later on as you\u2019ll transfer a copy of the background audio too.",
    "A subtitling tool is included, which is also compatible with srt files (meaning you could work on the text and the time it comes on and off the screen in a separate program and import the file into GoPlay).",
    "Once you\u2019re happy with your video, it\u2019s time to share it. GoPlay offers you two options: YouTube or Twitter. We couldn\u2019t find an option to upload to another social media site, or even to just save the film as a self-contained file on your hard drive, so unless you\u2019re fan of YouTube or Twitter, you seem to be out of luck.",
    "GoPlay\u2019s selling point is its video screen grabbing capabilities, and this works pretty much as you\u2019d expect. The editing section of this app is dramatically basic, and so are its exporting options. With that in mind, it\u2019s best to try out the limited free version to make sure this meets your needs before paying out for the Pro version."
