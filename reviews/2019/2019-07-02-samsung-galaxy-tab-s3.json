  "verdict": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 is headlined by an HDR-ready screen, four powerful speakers and an upgraded S Pen that\u2019s included in the box, although you\u2019re going to have to pay for the keyboard. Just don\u2019t expect Android meet all of your 2-in-1 tablet needs next to a similarly priced laptop.",

    "Samsung\u2019s best tablet design yet",

    "Update: The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 has more competition than ever with the likes of the iPad Pro 11 and Samsung's own Tab S4 now on the market, but it's also now cheaper than it once was and remains a top Android slate.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 remains the best Android tablet you can buy, despite the launch of the newer Samsung Galaxy Tab S4.",
    "It can do just about anything the iPad Pro 11 can, yet it costs far less. In fact, watching the dystopian alternate-history Amazon TV series The Man in the High Castle on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3\u2019s HDR screen prompts an analogy: what if Apple\u2019s iPad Pro ran Android?",
    "That\u2019s pretty much what we have here. It\u2019s Android\u2019s first worthy competitor to the iPad Pro 9.7 (and the rest of the Pro range, though that one especially as it has the same screen size), with strong specs to match, and it pairs well with the elegant-looking Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 9 \u2013 also feature-packed and enveloped in glass.",
    "The Galaxy Tab S3 is easily the best Android tablet you can buy right now thanks to its all-glass design upgrade, future-proofed HDR-ready display and included S Pen.",
    "It's hardly a difficult call for us to make \u2013 other than the flawed Tab S4, the older Google Pixel C and the not-quite-as-premium Asus ZenPad 3S 10 are its only real challengers at a similar size.",
    "What is a challenge is determining who the Tab S3 is right for. It launched at $599 (\u00a3599, AU$780), and while it comes with the S Pen (Apple\u2019s tablet does not offer a stylus in the box), the keyboard is separate. When you add it all up, it borders on cheap laptop prices, and there\u2019s no cheaper 8-inch Tab S3 to give you an affordable entry-level option.",
    "However, this is slightly less of a problem now, as prices have dropped to a more palatable $470 / \u00a3400 / AU$600 in some stores.",
    "You are also getting the first (though no longer only) HDR-ready tablet with better brightness and contrast ratio with the Samsung Galaxy S3 Tab.",
    "The Galaxy Tab S3 is Samsung\u2019s best travel-friendly 2-in-1 tablet that can pull off productivity \u2013 if you\u2019re willing to pay for the separate keyboard. It\u2019s thinner and lighter than the equally tempting 2-in-1 Samsung Chromebook Pro laptop, which doesn\u2019t have a detachable keyboard and includes a smaller S Pen, and it finally gives the iPad Pro some meaningful competition.",
    "As mentioned, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 launched for $599 (\u00a3599, about AU$780), however it can now be found for around $470 / \u00a3400 / AU$600.",
    "That's more of a mid-range price than the high-end, iPad Pro-rivaling one it launched at, and is in line with the 128GB iPad 9.7 model, which costs $429 / \u00a3409 / AU$599 (though a cheaper 32GB version is also available).",
    "The real value over Apple\u2019s tablet comes from the S Pen, which is included with the Tab S3 \u2013 the Apple Pencil costs an extra $99 (\u00a399, AU$145). You also don\u2019t need to worry about recharging Samsung\u2019s S Pen.",
    "The Galaxy Tab S3 keyboard is a separate purchase, with Samsung charging $129 (\u00a3119), though as with the slate itself this can now be found for less if you shop around.",
    "As for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 release date, it became available in US stores on March 24 2017, while the UK wasn't too far behind with a March 31, 2017 launch date.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 touts a small but likable design upgrade over the Galaxy Tab S2, even if it\u2019s easy to mistake it for Samsung\u2019s year-and-a-half-old tablet from the front.",
    "The best changes happen round back, where the Tab S3 sports a new glass back panel in either black or silver. It looks and feels better than the rubberized plastic cover of the Tab S2, and the glass is more comfortable to hold; while you\u2019re trading instantly collected sweat marks on the older model for fingerprints and smudges on the Gorilla Glass back, you\u2019re ending up ahead.",
    "Samsung can technically still claim that the Tab S3 is thinner and lighter than an iPad Pro, with dimensions of 237.3 x 169 x 6mm and a weight of 429g (the iPad Pro is 6.1mm thick and weighs 437g). But don\u2019t be fooled; the variations are hardly noticeable. The Tab S2 is 5.6mm and 389g, and we felt barely any difference between the three slates.",
    "The Tab S3 looks and feels like a blown-up Samsung Galaxy S7 phone, with a useful physical fingerprint sensor home button, and 'back' and 'recent' capacitive buttons aligned at the bottom. Without the keyboard attachment, it excels at being an entertainment device first and foremost.",
    "The real difference is seen and heard in the HDR display, which pumps up the contrast ratio, and the four speakers, which pump out the volume better than a tablet with a mono speaker.",
    "We previously got a taste of HDR on a mobile device with the short-lived Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and it came back to Samsung phones with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, as well as subsequent S and Note handsets.",
    "Samsung tablets and phones already have the best screens going, with bright and pixel-dense Super AMOLED display panels. Now, by including HDR technology, Samsung is making them even better.",
    "High Dynamic Range (HDR) gives the same 2048 x 1536 Quad HD resolution higher contrast ratios and brighter highlights. This is especially important in darker movie scenes in which you tend to lose too much of the picture to shadow.",
    "The Tab S3\u2019s support of the new HDR10 standard is actually a bigger deal than if Samsung packed a 4K screen into a 9.7-inch tablet. The expanded brightness range does more than extra pixels would at this small size \u2013 more pixels matter when you\u2019re dealing with a larger 4K television.",
    "Here\u2019s the problem: there\u2019s not a lot of HDR video content available today. It\u2019s being rolled out with streaming video services like Amazon Video and Netflix already on board on Samsung, LG and Sony TVs, but we weren\u2019t able to find HDR video on these services at the tablet's launch.",
    "Instead, we had to rely on Samsung HDR demos and movie trailers to enjoy what\u2019s ultimately the future of video. It\u2019s definitely a jump up in quality, but as the content isn't here yet, you\u2019re paying in advance for a tablet that will deliver that improved quality soon, but not right now. That makes the Tab S3 an amazing technical feat, but a hard sell to average consumers at launch.",
    "What you can take advantage of right now are the quad speakers on the Tab S3. They reach a more powerful volume than what we've heard from the mono Tab S2 and so many other tablets. Better yet, they\u2019re calibrated to your movements, so as you rotate the tablet the stereo speaker orientation changes, so you\u2019re never holding it the wrong way for sound.",
    "As long as you\u2019re not expecting deep base, these AKG-tuned quad HD speakers go ear-to-ear with the those on the equally-rich-sounding iPad Pro 9.7. You can get some bass out of the Tab S3 with the right headphones, which you\u2019re probably going to use more often when roaming with this tablet in public.",
    "And good news: this tablet has both a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom of the frame, and supports Bluetooth 4.2. No one is getting rid of headphone jacks in tablets \u2013 yet.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 transforms in look and potential with the included S Pen and keyboard attachment. They\u2019re the must-have accessories to unlock the full potential of this 2-in-1 tablet.",
    "The S Pen is an upgrade from the thin stylus we\u2019ve been using on Note phones and the Samsung Chromebook Pro. At 9.4mm thick it\u2019s bigger and easier to hold, and makes the previous S Pen look like a toothpick by comparison. It still has a fine 0.7mm tip (this time made of rubber instead of plastic), and a clickable side button for bringing up the familiar Air Command tools.",
    "All the usual S Pen tools are here, including Notes, Smart Select (create cropped or lassoed screenshots and GIFs), and Screen Write (write directly on a screenshot). There are also three newer functions that can be added to the fanned-out shortcut list: Translate, Magnify (zoom in) and Glance (dock and quickly view an app).",
    "Handwriting and drawing are naturally better on a tablet using a thicker S Pen, too. It\u2019s around the same width as the Apple Pencil, but shorter and boasts four times as many pressure levels. It really captures every angle, which can be great for shading, depending on the app you\u2019re using. Samsung includes two apps \u2013 Notes and the coloring-book-like PEN.UP \u2013 and there are more in the Google Play Store.",
    "The S Pen doesn\u2019t slot inside the thin tablet, so you can\u2019t seamlessly hide the thicker stylus when it\u2019s not in use. Instead, Samsung has added an pen holder loop for the keyboard \u2013 if you buy the keyboard. The good news is that the S Pen doesn\u2019t need to be charged, and doesn\u2019t roll away constantly, as it has two flatter sides and a clip. The Apple Pencil likes to roll off tables because there\u2019s nowhere to put it and, if frequently used, is always at risk of being out of juice.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3's keyboard attachment is worth the extra money if you\u2019re looking to substitute this tablet for a laptop. Its cramped layout (a necessity) is still useable, with decent travel when you hit the plastic keys \u2013 and all the important keys are here.",
    "What\u2019s missing? There are no function keys along the top (we\u2019re okay with that), and it\u2019s sorely missing a home button, requiring you to reach for the fingerprint home sensor on the tablet and possibly knocking your coffee over in the process. We\u2019d also like to see the search key bring up Google Search instead of Google Now On Tap, requiring an extra screen press for the search bar.",
    "Everything folds up nicely, enveloping the tablet in a soft plastic cover on both sides. That\u2019s a big plus. Apple\u2019s iPad Pro keyboard cover only protects the front screen \u2013 and aluminum does dent, much like glass shatters. Samsung basically throws in a back cover for free.",
    "Best of all, there\u2019s no need for Bluetooth pairing or charging. The keyboard has six Pogo pins above the top row of keys, and these magnetically clip to the Tab S3\u2019s side frame. Samsung has its own version of the Smart Connector.",
    "We just wish its magnets were stronger. Picking the tablet up by the screen often detaches the bottom part of the keyboard (luckily the back, where there are more magnets, stays secured). The end of the screen cover should also be magnetic, and should turn off the screen when closed. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 instead, it can flap open if you\u2019re not careful."
