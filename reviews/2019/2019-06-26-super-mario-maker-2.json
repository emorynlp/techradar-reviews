    "At heart, Super Mario Maker 2 has a simple premise: let players design their own Mario levels. But even that single aim provides near-endless amounts of fun and creation with Nintendo\u2019s joyful and chaotic level editor.",
    "A follow-up from the original Super Mario Maker game on Wii U, and its eventual 3DS port, this sequel / reboot on the Nintendo Switch manages to avoid several pitfalls from the previous entry, making for a more widely accessible title that still retains the joy of giving you the keys to Mario\u2019s inner workings. Whether those keys are literally keys, or rather Chain-Chomps and flying Goombas, is completely up to you.",
    "We hunkered down with Super Mario Maker 2\u2019s creation tools, brand new Story Mode, and online features to bring you a full review, and we can say if this construction-minded Mario entry is worth your time.",
    "In our preview of the game, we mainly focused on how inept our first attempts at crafting a Mario level was \u2013 and while we\u2019re yet to match the expertise of any full-time Mario designers, or even many of the levels other reviewers seemed to be uploading before the game\u2019s release, we\u2019ve got to know more of the tools, and making our own platforming levels has quickly turned from roughly-made nonsense to something approaching basic level design (we think).",
    "Super Mario games are formulaic. But it\u2019s the unique ways those tools are deployed that make each level interesting. Playing Super Mario Maker with the number of tools available \u2013 thankfully all available from the get-go too \u2013 allows for a huge amount of customization, depending on what you want to make. A lava pit rising against the clock? A series of underground caverns connected by warp pipes? A giant Bowser cat, or five?",
    "The visual variety adds a huge amount too. You can play as a number of Mario characters (the man himself, Luigi, Toad, or Toadette) across a range of your own DIY stages \u2013 across green hills, on the ocean floor, the desert, and more \u2013 with the option to switch any level into a different visual style on the fly from Mario's adventures on the NES, SNES and Wii U.",
    "There's now even a Super Mario 3D World option, with its own flavor on how Mario moves and sorts of items he can collect \u2013 like the cat costume to let him climb on walls, or just his ability to crouch and waddle through low spaces. Sadly it's only 3D styled, rather than letting you make levels on three axes, but it adds more variety to the play at least.",
    "In the 2D worlds every enemy, item, or block has a corresponding representation in each style, with a few exceptions like the cat costume \u2013 but it's nothing short of magic to watch the world you've made transform so seamlessly into something else. The 3D World option has too many of its own rules and assets to do the same, sadly \u2013 though the label of \u2018Extra Game Styles\u2019 (styles, plural!) gives us hope of more being added in the future.",
    "There are a few points when Mario Maker 2 stumbles, mainly in the move from a two-screen setup with the Wii U and 3DS to the Switch\u2019s singular display. A lot of information and menus are now crammed into one place, and it\u2019s clear something\u2019s been lost in the transition.",
    "We found ourselves generally sticking with handheld for the game\u2019s creation tools: while still perfectly functional in the dock, the touchscreen still feels like the most natural way to play. While the Switch has a capacitive touchscreen (activated by the conductive touch of your finger) rather than a resistive one (activated by pressure, as with the 3DS) it\u2019s still a joy moving around blocks and enemies with your finger, and astonishingly simple to get started with making your own levels.",
    "There\u2019s the option to make a level in co-op, with two people each using a single Joy-Con, but the pared-down controls make it painfully slow to use. Your friends would just slow you down, anyway.",
    "What\u2019s new to Mario Maker 2 is its Story Mode, which gives a vague narrative premise for playing through a ton of in-house levels made by the Nintendo team. Basically, Peach\u2019s castle has accidentally been deleted \u2013 easily done, we can tell you \u2013 and it\u2019s your job to earn coins by completing these levels in order to pay for the reconstruction of the building.",
    "It\u2019s a gentle story hook, and one that\u2019s careful not to forget why you\u2019re here \u2013 to make things \u2013 though it seems like a missed opportunity not to let you design and build your own take on the castle, however terrible or structurally unsound. Even a simple mini-game, or tutorial level around this, would have made it feel a lot more personal.",
    "The example levels here vary in difficulty, and very openly use the creation tools you yourself have access too. This isn\u2019t a miniature Super Mario Bros. game, and there\u2019s a much larger stress on collecting certain numbers of items or completing levels in unique ways.",
    "One early level doesn\u2019t let you jump, and it felt like a very unique kind of torture \u2013 though one we were eventually thrilled at completing. And by offering standalone levels, each one feels a lot more unique than the themed worlds in the traditional games.",
    "But the best thing about the Story Mode is that you aren\u2019t punished for not being any good at it. You\u2019re here to craft, not to become an ace speedrunner, and Nintendo has the good sense to be a supportive teacher rather than a cruel one.",
    "One major addition is the Assist Luigi options, which give you a number of basic items (blocks, fire flowers, mushrooms, etc) to help you in sticky situations, or even skip the level entirely if you use up all your lives. You don\u2019t need to use his help \u2013 we were largely too proud \u2013 but it\u2019s definitely there if you need it, and prevents you banging your head against the wall over a particularly difficult jump.",
    "The final piece of the puzzle is the online portion in Course World. Here you can upload your own creations, and play through the work of others \u2013 or even download for offline play later on. There\u2019s even the option to do so in multiplayer, either with online strangers or your friends on the couch.",
    "As with the previous game, there are leaderboards for the users making and playing the most levels, with all of your efforts across different modes adding up to your \u2018Maker Points\u2019 score. And each level will list the number of people who\u2019ve played through, their reaction to it, and the sort of gameplay you can expect: \u2018short and sweet\u2019, \u2018autoscroll\u2019, \u2018puzzle-solving\u2019, and the like.",
    "Getting to try out other people\u2019s creations \u2013 some, naturally, more polished than others \u2013 is still a joy, for the simple fact of seeing how other people\u2019s brains work, how they\u2019ve leveraged the tools available, and what a cool Mario level looks like to them. Any level has to be successfully played through before being uploaded, of course, so you\u2019re not going to end up stuck in an underground cavern with no way to progress.",
    "For particularly sneaky level design, there is now a dislike button for voting down creations, and the option to leave comments in-game to help other players (which you can turn on or off in the menu settings).",
    "You will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to use any online features, but even without it there\u2019s plenty to make, do and get on with in offline play \u2013 including the Endless Challenge mode, which takes random courses uploaded by other players to see how many you can get through. Given they're all unconnected, and made with different play-styles in mind, it's a chaotic affair, but certainly throws you in the deep end, and adds an element of challenge to figuring out the way something's been put together.",
    "Being a level designer is hard, so it\u2019s just as well Nintendo gives you plenty of workarounds in Super Mario Maker 2.",
    "The addition of a Luigi Assist mode, and a willingness to give you all the tools you need from the outset, make this a vastly more accessible entry, and one that has something for any budding designer out there \u2013 or simply someone wanting to understand the workings of their favorite Mario games a little better.",
    "The single screen can feel limiting compared to the Wii U / 3DS game, especially when playing in docked mode without the touchscreen. The Story Mode, too, could have placed more emphasis on your own creation, rather than just offering examples of things you could do. But there\u2019s much more to enjoy than there is to complain about. Even if Super Mario Maker 2 isn\u2019t a must-have game, it\u2019ll be a real gem for those wanting to take on Nintendo\u2019s design tools for themselves."
