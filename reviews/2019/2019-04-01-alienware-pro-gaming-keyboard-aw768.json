    "Everyone knows about Alienware at this point. The Dell-owned company has made a name for itself throughout the years for making expensive, but gorgeous, gaming PCs like the Alienware Aurora R7. Of course, gaming PCs aren\u2019t everything \u2013 so Alienware has stepped into the peripheral game with products like the Alienware Pro Gaming Keyboard AW768.",
    "Just as you would expect from a keyboard made by Alienware, it has an angular, futuristic design and is packed to the brim with RGB lighting. But, what\u2019s more impressive is what\u2019s under the hood here: Cherry MX Brown switches, a 1 millisecond (ms) polling rate and dedicated macro keys.",
    "That all sounds great, right? Well, for the most part it is, and it matches all of these great features with an attractive price that might make it one of the best gaming keyboards on the market \u2013 as long as you can put up with some of the minor quality of life issues.",
    "What might sound surprising to any old, jaded PC gamer out there is that the Alienware Gaming Pro AW768 is a surprisingly affordable gaming keyboard. You can get this keyboard for just $99 (\u00a3111, AU$184). For a fully mechanical keyboard from a brand like Alienware \u2013 that\u2019ll likely blend in seamlessly with most gaming PCs \u2013 that\u2019s a great deal.",
    "The bonus to hitting this price point for Alienware is that it automatically puts it in the same league as the Corsair K68 RGB \u2013 which lacks some of the features that the Alienware AW768 includes, like dedicated macro keys and a volume dial. However, the Alienware keyboard is not water resistant.",
    "There is one serious bugbear we have regarding the value of this device: the palm rest isn\u2019t included in the package. If you prefer a palm rest for your keyboard, you\u2019re looking at an extra $25 (\u00a325, about AU$35). We think that\u2019s an obscene amount of money to charge for a palm rest, and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t included in the unit sent to us for review.",
    "When we first opened the Alienware Pro Gaming Keyboard\u2019s package, we could have sworn that it was wrapped in a smooth, aluminum body \u2013 it was definitely hefty enough. However, the entire thing is constructed from plastic. Don\u2019t go thinking this means it\u2019s flimsy, though \u2013 there is no give to this keyboard, and it\u2019s extremely sturdy. It just doesn\u2019t feel as nice to the touch as it looks.",
    "The RGB lighting here is similarly deceiving. Rather than being able to customize the lighting however you wish, on a per-key basis, you\u2019re instead given six zones, each representing a set of keys and/or ambient lights. This does prevent you from making your keyboard look god-awfully tacky, but we would have expected more customization from a company like Alienware. Sometimes, you just want to dive in and make something as absurd as possible, right?",
    "There is a collection of six macro keys on the left side of the keyboard, and while they\u2019re certainly useful, we ended up unbinding all of the macros we set while gaming. This is because, in the heat of the moment, it\u2019s extremely easy to reach over and hit the wrong key \u2013 setting off a macro when you really didn\u2019t want to. We\u2019re sure this is a problem that diminishes over time, just be prepared to pencil in some time to train your muscle memory.",
    "However, the media keys didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to us. On the top right hand corner of the keyboard, there is a volume wheel that\u2019s unnecessarily wide, with a mute key to the left of it. Now, we don\u2019t know about you, but when we\u2019re in the middle of a Civilization VI binge, we put on a playlist, and go to town. It would have been nice to have the media control buttons next to the volume wheel, instead of having to hit \u201cFn + F12\u201d every time we wanted to skip a track.",
    "The Alienware AW768 is an undoubtedly beautiful gaming keyboard, it\u2019s just that some of the design decisions don\u2019t make a ton of sense to us.",
    "Luckily, the Alienware AW768 is a very competent keyboard, and is sure to please anyone looking for a comfortable gaming experience.",
    "Because it\u2019s using Cherry MX Brown switches, the keyboard is great for pretty much everything you\u2019re trying to do. Gaming and productivity work feel great in equal measure, and the noise is under control enough to use it at night without keeping the entire neighborhood awake.",
    "The best keyboard switches ultimately boil down to personal preference, and Cherry MX Brown switches are the best for beginners who don\u2019t quite know what they\u2019re looking for yet \u2013 much like Alienware\u2019s gaming PCs.",
    "It\u2019s great on paper, too \u2013 with 45g of actuation force, 2mm actuation distance and a 4mm travel, the keyboard is responsive and tactile, even if it may edge on the shallow side for some users.",
    "We, however, do most productivity work on a 2018 MacBook Pro, so there was a significant learning curve. However, once we got into the groove of things, it took little time to get back to our normal typing speed. Given the vast difference between these keyboards, this only speaks to the benefit of the Alienware AW768.",
    "In games, though, these switches are a dream. We\u2019ve been in a bit of a nostalgic mood these past few weeks, and are replaying Deus Ex: Human Revolution. And, while it\u2019s not a competitive title like Overwatch, the game plays like a dream: the switches feel just right, and kept us alive during some frustratingly difficult boss battles.",
    "On top of it all, this keyboard should last you a long while: the keys are rated to last for up to 50 million keystrokes, which will take an unbelievably long time to reach. When it comes to raw performance per dollar, the Alienware AW768 is a compelling gaming keyboard.",
    "The Alienware Pro Gaming Keyboard AW768 is a fine keyboard for the money \u2013 for a hundred bucks, you\u2019re getting reliable performance and attractive aesthetics with only a few quality of life compromises.",
    "If you\u2019re an Alienware fan, and you\u2019ve already splurged on one of its gaming PCs, it\u2019s easy to recommend this gaming keyboard. And, even if you\u2019re not, you could do far worse for the money \u2013 there are plenty of \u2018mecha-mechanical\u2019 keyboards out there that are much worse value propositions. We\u2019re just surprised that Alienware put out a keyboard this good at this price point \u2013 it\u2019s a company known to put a premium on its brand name.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for one of the best gaming keyboards that somehow manages to combine aesthetics, performance and value, you\u2019re going to have a hard time finding a better gaming keyboard than the Alienware AW768. That alone should be enough to convince a good deal of users."
