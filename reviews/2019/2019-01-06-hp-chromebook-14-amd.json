    "AMD processors in Chromebooks are finally here at CES 2019, which could lead to lower prices and possibly stronger graphics than we\u2019ve seen in such laptops before, and the HP Chromebook 14 is among the first.",
    "All told, the new HP Chromebook 14 looks and feels like most other budget-oriented Chromebooks \u2013 the only major differences between it and HP\u2019s Intel-based Chromebook 14 are the insides. Unfortunately, the benefits of that are tough to grok from a brief hands-on.",
    "Regardless, here\u2019s what to expect from the HP Chromebook 14 when it launches later this month.",
    "All iterations of this HP Chromebook 14 come packing AMD\u2019s dual-core A4-9120 processor, 4GB of DDR3 memory and 32GB of eMMC flash storage.",
    "HP is asking for a completely tolerable $269 (about \u00a3211, AU$378) for the AMD-based Chromebook 14 to start, which comes rocking a 14-inch HD (1,366 x 768) display.",
    "From there, it\u2019ll cost you $299 (about \u00a3235, AU$420) to get this laptop with an FHD (1,920 x 1,080) display with in-plane switching tech for boosted viewing angles. To have the Chromebook 14 with a straight HD display with multitouch capacity, it\u2019ll be the same $299.",
    "The higher-end option of sharper screen resolution without multitouch or lower display resolution with touch control is a welcome choice we\u2019d like to see in future Chromebooks.",
    "HP\u2019s Chromebook 14 with AMD inside doesn\u2019t look all that much difference from its budget Chromebooks with Intel inside. The laptop is wrapped in textured plastic that\u2019s finished with your choice of \u201cChalkboard Gray\u201d or \u201cSnow White\u201d colors \u2013 or in \u201cInk Blue\u201d for the $299 options.",
    "The laptop looks downright utilitarian, with a single color all around a chassis that measures a just-fine 0.72 inches (18.2mm) a weighs a completely average 3.4 pounds (1.5kg). This basic design leaves enough room for not only two USB-C 3.1 ports but also two USB 2.0 ports and a headphone jack.",
    "That\u2019s plenty of expansion for such a cheap laptop, but the Chromebook 14\u2019s budget nature shines through in its keyboard and touchpad. These are not the premium inputs you\u2019d find on one of HP\u2019s Spectre laptops.",
    "Rather, this keyboard is rather squishy, meaning the feedback of the keys isn\u2019t strong enough for our taste, but the keys are at least well-spaced. Likewise, the touchpad isn\u2019t as smooth and is coated in plastic, not glass like the luxury laptops. That said, it\u2019s a perfectly serviceable touchpad for everyday use.",
    "As for the display, we find it to be just like all the other HD-only Chromebook screens, bright enough but overall all on the blue side of the color reproduction spectrum. It won\u2019t be the best display for watching movies on from bed or the couch \u2013 though, the Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers might make up for that \u2013 but the screen will do just fine for basic work.",
    "We won\u2019t make any hard judgements on the HP Chromebook 14 power profile, but we have a good idea of what to expect. The AMD A4-9120 inside is clocked at 2.2GHz and can boost up to 2.5GHz.",
    "The HP Chromebook 14 processor starts where most Intel based options are able to boost to, which should see it gain a slight edge over competitors in raw throughput and graphics rendering.",
    "As for longevity, the battery inside is rated for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes with mixed usage. This was never going to be the longest-lasting laptop in the world, but it should get you through a whole work day on a single charge. We\u2019ll be the final judge on both in a full review.",
    "One of the first Chromebooks packed with an AMD processor inside, the HP Chromebook 14 is an interesting surprise at CES 2019. However, it\u2019s tough to predict the impact an AMD processor will have on the Chromebook experience right now.",
    "That insight will only come through in a full review. Until then, you\u2019re looking at a just-fine, long-lasting Chromebook with a new kind of processor inside. Look out for the HP Chromebook 14 with AMD inside later this January.",
