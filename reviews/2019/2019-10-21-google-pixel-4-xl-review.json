  "summary": "Better cameras, forgettable extras",
  "verdict": "The Google Pixel 4 XL is a handsome phone in its simplicity that, by the same coin, feels less impressive than its Android flagship counterparts. It doesn\u2019t help that its new standout features are inessential, and erratically functional. But new interface improvements and a camera suite that\u2019s better in both the hardware and software departments ensure that this phone stands up to be counted, even if it doesn't stand out from the competition.",
  "pros": [
    "Top-of-the-line cameras",
    "Simple, no-nonsense design"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Face Unlock is finicky, no fingerprint sensor",
    "Low storage options",
    "Battery life is barely adequate"
  ],
  "article": [
    "The Google Pixel 4 XL is a curious step for Google that minimizes the physical design while striking out in new territory with experimental features. While the latter aren\u2019t widely implemented enough to be useful, the rest of the device lives up to its predecessors\u2019 legacy, and it\u2019s a supreme vehicle for the newly-improved camera.",
    "This isn\u2019t a surprise, and most of the improvements on the phone are in the cameras \u2013 both software and hardware. The added telephoto lens produces sharper zoomed images and truer portrait mode effects, while Night Sight has improved, too. There\u2019s even a pair of sliders added to the basic photo modes \u2013 Brightness and Shadow \u2013 that let you preview image tweaks before taking shots.",
    "Otherwise, the phone isn\u2019t too different from the Google Pixel handsets you know and love - but stripping out the fingerprint sensor in favor of Face Unlock\u2019s finicky facial-recognition seems like a generational tech shove that we normally see from Apple. Sure, it will probably get better with later updates, but it\u2019s less consistent than we\u2019d expect coming from the tech giant, especially since it features the promising debut of the long-awaited Soli radar technology.",
    "The other new feature made possible by Soli is Motion Sense, which enables you to control music and alarms by gesturing above the device. It\u2019s even more erratic than Face Unlock, though users will narrow down the action area and precise hand motions needed to control the device through trial and error.",
    "Given it\u2019s not used anywhere else on the phone, it\u2019s something of a stillborn addition, and while more apps could code in functionality, the onus is on Google to make this feature resonate enough for users to learn it.",
    "Those aren\u2019t quite landmark features, and the remaining highlights are such a grab bag of improvements that it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s better overall about the Pixel 4 XL. The battery disappoints, but rest assured, the phone continues to be a casual photographer\u2019s dream - and combined with Android 10, Google\u2019s larger handset is the simplest, cleanest non-iOS phone on the market.",
    "That\u2019s reflected in the physical design, too: gone is the Pixel 3\u2019s two-tone gloss-and-matte back, replaced with a frosted rear glass finish (except in the Just Black color) and, on the front, a full top bezel instead of a notch. Lining the side is a textured (not slick) aluminum frame that gives some grip, at least on two of the three available colors. Dual speakers poke out the bottom around a USB-C port, while the right side has a lock button and volume rocker.",
    "All together, the phone is more of a pragmatist\u2019s flagship, eschewing the shimmering gradients and waterfall-edged displays of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 or Huawei Mate 30 Pro in favor of bold-hued simplicity. It\u2019s not at the head of the pack for new, industry-leading features - but if you like shooting photos without much fuss, the Google Pixel 4 XL is for you.",
    "The Google Pixel 4 XL release date is Thursday, October 24 and the price starts at $899 / \u00a3829 / AU$1,279 for the measly 64GB of storage model. There's also a more reasonable 128GB model, but that will cost you $999 / \u00a3929 / AU$1,429.",
    "The Pixel 4 XL price echoes the Pixel 3 XL launch price, at least in the US. It\u2019s \u00a340 cheaper than the 3 XL was in the UK, and AU$70 cheaper in Australia. Ultimately, it\u2019s a slight discount over other plus-sized flagships, but the lack of parity in frilly features and hardware makes it hard to judge if this is an even exchange.",
    "At launch, the Pixel 4 XL doesn\u2019t come with the usual headphones in the box: instead, Google is giving new owners a $100 promo credit to the Google Store so they can pick up what accessories they want. It\u2019s unclear if this extends to buyers in other countries and currencies, nor if it will last beyond the release window.",
    "While other Android flagships have strived for ever-sleeker and glossier looks, the Google Pixel line has hewed toward simpler rounded geometry - the \u2018premium\u2019 has been in the hardware and software, not the design.",
    "The Google Pixel 4 is an evolution of this logic with an unblemished back and a more conservative - but clean - return to hiding the front-facing camera in a black top bar. Gone is the ugly notch we saw in Google\u2019s previous XL phone.",
    "The Pixel 4 XL is essentially the same dimensions as the Pixel 3 XL, with the same lock button on the right (in Oh So Orange color, in all but Just Black) and volume rocker below it. There\u2019s a SIM slot on the right that, sadly, doesn\u2019t support microSD. The rear glass is either matte (in Clearly White and Oh So Orange colors) or glossy (Just Black) finish.",
    "As befits a Google flagship phone, the Pixel 4 XL comes in a few cute hues: an accurately-named Just Black, the black-bordered Clearly White (known as the \u2018penguin color\u2019 by phone aficionados) and Oh So Orange - which is somewhere between salmon and orange sherbet.",
    "The bottom has the standard USB-C port flanked by speakers, which give better sound than we\u2019ve heard in any other 2019 flagship - a more balanced, bass-filled sound than the treble-favoring iPhone 11 and Samsung Galaxy S10.",
    "Instead of more physical buttons, you can summon Google Assistant by squeezing the sides below the volume rocker. This can be tweaked to take more or less force to activate (we set it to lower sensitivity as we kept accidentally activating it when picking the handset up).",
    "The Google Pixel 4 XL has nearly the same OLED 6.3-inch size and same QHD+ resolution as its predecessor, though it\u2019s slightly longer at a 19:9 ratio. Some of that is likely taken up by the reinstated top bezel, and we could nitpick here in pointing out the lost screen real estate with the dismissal of the notch, but those screen nibs were never that useful anyway.",
    "But the new display is superior to its predecessor in terms of refresh rate, which has been bumped up to 90Hz. It\u2019s noticeably smoother in zooming around both apps and games like PUBG, though we didn\u2019t see so much improvement that it\u2019s hard to go back to other phones with 60Hz screens for the average consumer.",
    "Otherwise, the OLED screen is gorgeous, as expected, with HDR support that shows streaming media and photos in vivid clarity. A new feature, Ambient EQ, taps the onboard sensors to automatically adjust the display\u2019s color temperature to mimic the surrounding environment. We didn\u2019t notice it was working until we switched it off to reveal a harsher, colder-temp default color setting - which is kind of the point.",
    "It\u2019s notable that the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s 1440 x 3040 resolution (537 pixels per inch) is greater and sharper than the standard Pixel 4\u2019s 1080 x 2280 display (with 444 pixels per inch), but at these sizes you aren\u2019t going to notice much of a difference, and Google isn\u2019t pushing its VR platform anymore, so it\u2019s not inches from your face.",
    "Several years ago, Google introduced its Soli radar technology on stage at Google IO - and now it\u2019s finally here, implanted in a pair of chips on either side of the Pixel 4 XL's front-facing camera. At launch time, it\u2019s used for exactly two features: Face Unlock and Motion Sense.",
    "Face Unlock does exactly what it says, and after Google stripped the rear fingerprint sensor from this generation of Pixel phones, it\u2019s the only biometric method of unlocking the phone or authenticating. Just a heads up: it\u2019s not exactly like Apple\u2019s Face ID.",
    "For one, it\u2019s a little finicky, unlocking most - but not all - of the time. Plus, it\u2019s not as secure as Apple\u2019s facial identification. By Google\u2019s own admission (via a disclaimer in the Face Unlock settings page), it can be unlocked while a user\u2019s eyes are closed, like while they\u2019re sleeping\u2026or dead.",
    "In response, the company notified journalists that an update is on the way for users to optionally require eyes to be open when face-unlocking; in the meantime, the Pixel team advises wary owners to use Lockdown mode (make it available in Settings > Display > Advanced > Lock screen display, then hold down the power button to access it), which requires a PIN/pattern/password for the next unlock.",
    "Further, Google Pixel 4 XL\u2019s Face Unlock isn\u2019t a biometric supported by bank apps just yet - heck, it doesn\u2019t even work with Google Pay - so kiss your quick authentication goodbye for now. Score another for Apple\u2019s Face ID.",
    "Motion Sense, on the other hand, is a feature in search of a purpose. And much better software.",
    "Conceivably, controlling your phone with aerial hand movements is novel and a great alternative to touch inputs, especially for disabled users eager for more accessible options.",
    "Despite its poor execution, the LG G8 had a good idea when it included aerial gestures with its Air Motion feature, and the Google Pixel 4 XL\u2019s Motion Sense does technically work better. But in practice, we found that we activated Motion Sense more on accident than on purpose, and its extremely limited use cases pretty much doom the feature to be forgotten if it doesn't become more widespread on the phone.",
    "At launch, Motion Sense can do essentially two things: skip or repeat songs by swiping over the phone, and quieting alarms or dismissing calls when you reach for the handset. You can also set it to dimly light the screen and show notifications when it detects motion, which might be the most useful application of the tech, but it\u2019s not much of a feature.",
    "The alarm-muting function works like a charm, but controlling music is worse than hit-or-miss: we often accidentally skipped songs while absently moving our hands around the phone. At launch, you can\u2019t turn Motion Sense off while the screen is locked, which seems like a big oversight.",
    "Of course, both Motion Sense and Face Unlock can be improved with future software updates, and we fully expect to revise this review when that happens. Both have a lot of promise - and a lot of room to grow before they become killer features of the Pixel 4 XL.",
    "The Google Pixel 4 XL\u2019s camera suite remains the standout perk of the phone. It still produces great photos in a variety of situations, although the lack of an ultra-wide lens means it\u2019s somewhat less versatile than pretty much every other Android flagship released in 2019.",
    "But the Google Pixel advantage has never been in lenses - it\u2019s in the software, which has worked wonders with even a single lens. The Pixel 4 XL\u2019s main shooter is still 12.2MP though the aperture has been improved slightly to f/1.7. It manages a 77-degree field of view (FOV), which is far from the 123-degree FOV in the Samsung Galaxy S10, for instance, but it gets the job done.",
    "The Google Pixel 4 XL\u2019s shots come out a bit warmer than other phones, but with fantastic background clarity and resistance to flare effects. It\u2019s easy to get depth effects from basic shots and the camera preserves the foreground with stunning clarity - we\u2019ve gotten some truly spectacular water shots.",
    "With the new Dual Exposure mode just a screen tap away in the main camera modes (which lets you fiddle with brightness and shadow), we found it plenty easy to tweak your image before you take it.",
    "The display\u2019s Live HDR+, a new feature, shows a more accurate preview of your images \u2013 ideally, what you see before you take the shot is what you get after. We pretty much found it to work as advertised.",
    "The new 16MP f/2.4 telephoto lens offers a 2x optical zoom, and hits a hybrid zoom of up to 8x. The camera app switches to the new lens at around 1.8x zoom with barely a hitch, which is a nice touch, though the telephoto shoots slightly less warm photos. But oh, what photos they are \u2013 combined with the Super Res Zoom introduced in the Pixel 3, zoomed-in photos are much crisper.",
    "Considering the stiff competition from the iPhone 11 line\u2019s improved night photo modes, it\u2019s no shock that the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s Night Shift has been upgraded. Low light shots mirror daylight, and outclass nearly every other phone\u2019s night-time shots.",
    "This is ramped up to an extreme degree with the introduction of Astrophotography: it recognizes the user is attempting to photograph the heavens and sets for a long exposure (nearly four minutes \u2013 so bring a tripod). The effect is incredible, clearly showing planets and stars while also illuminating the foreground, including people. You\u2019ll be able to capture cityscapes and the night sky in one image which - while not perfect - is the best nocturnal phone photography we\u2019ve seen yet.",
    "As for the front-facing camera suite, to make room for the Soli radar chips placed alongside the front-facing lenses, the two selfie shooters present in last year\u2019s model have been reduced to just one 8MP camera. It\u2019s pretty apparent when taking portrait mode shots, which have admirable but obviously software-generated depth effects added after the photo is taken.",
    "Given how much Google trumpeted the ultra-wide effect achieved by the Google Pixel 3 XL\u2019s dual-lens selfie, it\u2019s a shame the company quietly diminished it in the new model, though the drop to 90-degree FOV (down from 97 in its predecessor) isn\u2019t as bad as it could be.",
    "The Google Pixel 4 packs a Snapdragon 855 chipset, which isn\u2019t quite as advanced as the mid-year upgrade Snapdragon 855 Plus, but that\u2019s not a deal-breaker. The phone is plenty fast enough for all tasks, and with the Adreno 640 graphics chip, powers games like PUBG without a hitch.",
    "The Pixel 4 XL\u2019s 6GB of RAM definitely pales in comparison to other Android flagships, but we didn\u2019t see any performance dips or other signifiers of memory limitations. Heck, if Apple can get away with 4GB of RAM in its blazingly-fast iPhone 11 series, the Pixel 4 XL should be just fine.",
    "Where the Google Pixel 4 XL cuts corners is in storage, which starts at 64GB - an insultingly low amount in 2019. With the included package of Google and Android apps (plus a few others) and a week\u2019s worth of photos and video, we\u2019d already used up a third of that amount.",
    "The only bigger tier is 128GB, which is the baseline for just about every other Android flagship released this year, and far below the terabyte of storage at the top end of phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.",
    "On top of that, there is no microSD card slot to manually expand storage, which feels like the final guardrail funneling users toward Google\u2019s suggested solution: the company\u2019s Google One cloud storage, which carries a monthly subscription.",
    "There are a couple workarounds, thankfully, as Google still allows users to upload as many images as they want into the cloud via Google Photos at limited \u2018high quality\u2019 for free (capped at 16MP and 1080p video). Combine that with a Pixel 4 XL optional setting to delete backed-up photos when storage becomes limited (starting with the oldest) and users can mitigate the phone\u2019s low storage woes.",
    "Even though Google has made strides to speed up Android version adoption with its Android One program, it still takes months (if not the better part of a year) before many phones get the update. As such, the Google Pixel 4 XL has a big advantage in packing Android 10 out of the box, as well as getting first dibs on newer versions when they drop every year.",
    "The Pixel 4 XL introduces several new app perks and features which seem like great little additions that, let\u2019s face it, not everyone will use. They\u2019re cool to have, just disparate in their focus. And some of them are even coming to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a - not all, but enough of the big ones.",
    "Live Caption, first shown off at Google IO 2019, is one of these new perks heading to the previous generation: if you\u2019re playing any video or spoken audio (aside from phone and video calls, per Google), you can tap the screen to bring up the volume slider with a new keyboard button below - tap the latter to activate Live Caption, and voila, the content will have captions.",
    "Note that it works whether you\u2019re on or offline, as all the computation happens on the device, and Google claims it won\u2019t leave the device. The company shrunk the storage footprint of the neural language processing for this feature and Google Assistant, allowing much of the machine learning-assisted tasks to be done locally for faster help.",
    "Speaking of Google Assistant, it\u2019s more integrated on the Pixel 4 XL than in previous phones, both on the back-end and through the interface. Summon it by swiping from either bottom corner of the phone, squeezing the lower sides with Active Edge, tapping the Assistant icon, or simply saying \u201cHey Google\u201d or \u201cOkay Google.\u201d",
    "Basic tasks (like opening apps or turning on features) are faster, and Assistant should be smarter about what you\u2019re asking it to do while you\u2019ve got certain apps open - while in YouTube, for instance, asking \u201csearch for lo-fi chillhop\u201d will start a search within the video platform.",
    "The other new features are less broadly helpful, like the new live captioning in the Recorder app (also coming to Pixel 3): when you tap record, you can tab over to \u2018transcript\u2019 and see the phone translate audio into words.",
    "It isn\u2019t totally accurate - we had it listen to one of the greatest speeches of all time and the phone elided or misheard every tenth word or so - but it\u2019s free and useful in a pinch. Other than journalists, media employees and the hearing-impaired, we don\u2019t know if too many users will even try it out.",
    "New to, and only on, the Pixel 4 range, is Personal Safety, an app Google introduced as a car crash safety net. It uses the handset\u2019s sensors to detect if you\u2019ve been involved in a car accident and, if the user doesn\u2019t respond when the app checks in, will call 911. Users will have to set it up beforehand, and it\u2019s only available in the US at the moment.",
    "In what may be the biggest drawback of the phone, the Google Pixel 4 XL\u2019s battery life is, by today\u2019s standards, barely adequate. While Google claims that the phone should last through a day of use, especially with the enabled-by-default Adaptive Battery that limits infrequently-used apps\u2019 background activity, our limited experience saw the phone falling short.",
    "In one representative instance, we went from 100% to 50% in around 8 hours under typical conditions, which included shooting some photos, listening to audio, and streaming content, but mostly just texting and browsing the internet. That essentially guarantees you\u2019ll need to juice your phone back up at least once during the day, which is disappointing.",
    "And that\u2019s with the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s 3,700mAh battery, which isn\u2019t negligible - and is bigger than the shockingly low 2,800mAh capacity of the standard Pixel 4.",
    "There will probably be some consumers who rightly opt for the Pixel 4 XL over the smaller model simply to ensure their phone lasts as long as it can - which, at least now (and barring serious optimization down the line with a software update) is about or under a day.",
    "Thankfully, the Google Pixel 4 XL comes with an 18W fast charger in the box, though other Android phones are surging ahead with packed-in higher-rate chargers, like the 30W WarpCharge 30T in the OnePlus 7T series.",
    "You like pragmatic full-featured phones Those who want a no-frills Android flagship with a sensible design will love the Google Pixel 4 XL. It doesn\u2019t excel at anything but photography and clean UI, and that\u2019s okay.",
    "You want to take the best photos without stress Casual camera phone users who want to take photos at any time and don\u2019t need tricks from hardcore zoom or ultra-wide lenses should seriously consider the Google Pixel 4 XL, as most of the camera magic happens behind the screen.",
    "You want the latest updates as soon as they're available Coming straight from Google means the Pixel 4 XL will be in the first wave of Android upgrades immediately after they go public. Other phones, even flagships from Samsung, often have to wait months (if not the better part of a year).",
    "You want the highest-performing phone with the newest features Anyone who wants the absolute top phone would do better with other Android flagships. The Google Pixel line is about doing the basics best for a little less coin, but it\u2019s still a top-tier phone.",
    "You want a more affordable flagship The Pixel 4 XL also comes at a top-tier price, so anyone yearning for the golden days of the earlier - and more affordable - Pixel phones should look elsewhere.",
    "You want a premium-looking phone Glossy, sleek, chromed, gradient - these are not words to describe the Google Pixel 4 XL. If you want a phone that screams elite with slick looks, try the even pricier Samsung or Huawei flagships.",
    "The iPhone 11 Pro Max has a bigger (6.5-inch) screen with a notch and, funnily enough, a similar matte glass back. But silly tri-lens block aside, it looks more like a premium device than the Pixel 4 XL, and comes with more on-device storage space at the top tier.",
    "Apple\u2019s big phone also has a more versatile suite of lenses and all the benefits of iOS, if that matters (it will for Apple Watch owners, say).",
    "Yet the iPhone 11 Pro Max is also more expensive at a baseline, and given the Pixel 4 XL will get Android updates as soon as they\u2019re released by Google, the OS update lead Apple\u2019s phones have over other models doesn\u2019t apply.",
    "Read our full iPhone 11 Pro Max review",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus is a bigger, slicker phone than the Pixel 4 XL by all metrics: shinier, more lenses, and with the line\u2019s signature stylus. It also packs Samsung\u2019s UI overlay and all the fun shortcuts that come with the S Pen stylus, like taking notes and using it as a photo remote.",
    "Yet the Note 10 comes with Android 9 Pie out of the box, and given how long it takes Samsung phones to get big updates, it might not get Android 10 until 2020.",
    "Read our full Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus review",
    "The Huawei P30 Pro is still the king of our camera phones list, but that\u2019s also dependent on capability: the phone\u2019s photo software is good, but not as good as the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s. What it does have is more lenses, and a very generous 5x optical zoom lens. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing, once again, whether Huawei\u2019s optics can overcome Google\u2019s software.",
    "Unfortunately, due to the current trade tiff between the US and China (and Huawei in the sanction spotlight), it\u2019s unclear if the phone\u2019s Android pipeline will be shut down in the future, making it harder to recommend the P30 Pro, which could lose out on all-important security updates as well as the big annual feature versions.",
    "Read our full Huawei P30 Pro review",
    "It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that, with such a focus on software over hardware, the Pixel line\u2019s mid-range entry is a solid value pick with nearly all its pricier siblings\u2019 features at little over half the cost of the Pixel 4 XL.",
    "The Pixel 3a XL only has one rear lens, a slower chipset, and less RAM, but it\u2019s also getting some of the neat features coming to the Pixel 4 XL. This might be the most crucial comparison, and a welcome one if Google\u2019s new big flagship\u2019s price tag is tough to stomach.",
