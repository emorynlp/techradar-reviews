  "verdict": "With a bit of tweaking you can turn the TCL 5-Series into a solid, mid-level LED TV. It doesn\u2019t have the highest peak brightness at its price point, and suffers from the existence of the much-superior 6-Series that costs just $100-$200 more.",
  "pros": [
    "4K, HDR with Dolby Vision",
    "Roku TV built-in",
    "Solid sound performance",
    "Value pricing"

  "cons": [
    "Low peak luminance",
    "Smart system slowdowns",
    "Mediocre upscaling",

    "How much are you willing to spend on a 4K 55-inch TV? If you\u2019re being optimistic, your answer is somewhere in the ballpark of $500, if not a bit less. While most TVs in that price range utterly disappoint, there\u2019s one manufacturer who\u2019s continued to impress - that\u2019s TCL.",
    "A great example of an affordable-yet-fantastic screen is TCL\u2019s S405 4K HDR TV, colloquially referred to as the 4-Series. It was the best-selling TV for most of 2018 and, at $379, one of the best deals around. If you needed more evidence of TCL\u2019s excellent low-cost screens, you could also look at the TCL 6-Series TVs, which are available on Amazon in a 55-inch screen size for around $600, and the entry-level 3-Series that starts at around $150.",
    "In between all these TVs sit the new TCL 5-Series, which we\u2019re reviewing here. At just $449 for a 55-inch TV, it\u2019s a solid contender that lives up to TCL\u2019s mantra by looking good and costing less than you\u2019d expect.",
    "So, what\u2019s the problem? While the 5-Series packs in a number of great features like Roku TV and Dolby Vision HDR, it\u2019s the 5-Series\u2019 compromises in performance and low overall brightness that ultimately make the middle child of TCL\u2019s lineup one of the least appealing.",
    "The TCL 5-Series is definitely in that budget range: the model we were sent for review, the 55-inch TCL 55S517, has a regular retail price of $499, but can often be found for $449.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for something smaller, the S517 5-Series comes in 43- and 49-inch variations that will only set you back around $429 and $449, respectively, and it comes in a larger 65-inch version that supposed to cost $899, though, often goes on sale for $749.",
    "If you can live without the Bluetooth-enabled voice search remote, the 5-Series also has a lower cost alternative called the S515 that\u2019s available exclusively at Best Buy. There\u2019s no difference between the S517 and S515 other than the smart remote (the S515\u2019s remote uses an IR blaster and doesn\u2019t do voice search), and you can usually save around $50 by buying an equivalent S515 model when there\u2019s not a sale going on.",
    "One of the reasons TCL screens cost less than the competition is that the design is simple, understated and basic - you won\u2019t find a wallpaper mode here, or flush wall mount included in every box. Instead, TCL\u2019s screens are aimed at the everyday viewer.",
    "What that means is that the 5-Series is relatively a plain jane, so to speak. The bezel is delightfully trim around the sides and top of the screen, and the legs are inoffensive. The average depth of the TV at its thickest point is around an inch, and at its thinnest point roughly half of that. It doesn\u2019t have the same thinness as LG\u2019s W8 Wallpaper OLED, but that\u2019s absolutely fine for a TV in this price range.",
    "What\u2019s less fine is that there really is no cable management in the back of the TV: Wires come in from all angles and, without any sort of covering or grooves to hide them, they splay every which way and make an entertainment center look cluttered.",
    "While it\u2019s not as big of a deal, there are only three HDMI ports on all the TCL S517 screens. That\u2019s enough room for you to plug in a cable box, a soundbar and a game console, but leaves no room for a Blu-ray player or second console. Thankfully, you won\u2019t need a slot for a streaming video player, TCL built one straight into the TV.",
    "The inclusion of Roku TV should be a very easy win for the 5-Series. It\u2019s one of the best TV platforms on the market, and rarely crashes or stutters. (Rarely, being the operative word here.) But, unfortunately on the 5-Series, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag with some good experiences and some not so good experiences.",
    "At several points throughout our testing, Netflix crashed or stalled, ultimately requiring us to power down the TV and restart. Other apps, Amazon Prime Instant Video and PlayStation Vue, were at times sluggish to respond to the remote.",
    "These are minor inconveniences and, on the other hand, having access to Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, PlayStation Vue, HBO Go, Google Play Movies & TV, YouTube and dozens of other services all on the same platform was great.",
    "Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to know who to blame when things go awry. It seems like it could be the TV, as Roku TV often excels on other sets, and yet, in the same breath, it could be said that the other streaming services besides Netflix worked relatively well. They weren\u2019t lightning-quick loading content, but the 5-Series performed just as well with them as most lower-end streaming boxes like the Roku Premiere or Amazon Fire TV.",
    "In better news, a few of these services even provide 4K HDR streams - the Roku TV Netflix app even offers some content in Dolby Vision as long as you subscribe to the highest tier plan. Throw in Roku TV\u2019s Featured Free program that offers close to a dozen free movies and TV shows that change every week or two, and you have a library of content to choose from without ever subscribing to cable.",
    "Last but not least, if you buy the S517 version of the TV, TCL includes the Roku TV smart remote. It has a built-in microphone that can process voice requests and uses Bluetooth instead of an IR signal for commands like volume up and volume down. There\u2019s no headphone jack on it, however, so private listening needs to be done through the Roku app.",
    "HD/SDR is where this TV really shines\u2026 well, maybe \u2018excels\u2019 is the better word. While the TCL 5-Series isn\u2019t necessarily that bright, HD/SDR is a format doesn\u2019t require an exceptionally bright TV to capture all the details and color - and that\u2019s why most HD/SDR content we watched looked really good on the 5-Series.",
    "So how un-bright are we talking? Even when we were watching the brightest 4K HDR content we could find it was way less than 1,000 nits peak brightness. And while that made a big difference when it came to 4K/HDR content, that lower level of peak brightness actually didn\u2019t matter that much when we were watching something on cable or streaming on a non-HDR service like Hulu, Sling TV or PlayStation Vue.",
    "Brightness, obviously, is important. It\u2019s the thing that helps you pick out details in darker scenes and makes colors more rich and vibrant. Again, this becomes a big problem when watching 4K HDR content which has lower black levels and higher peak brightness, but here in the land of HD SDR it wasn\u2019t something we even noticed.",
    "Similarly, upscaling worked just fine on the 5-Series. Some content looked better than others when taken from an HD resolution to 4K, but at no point did we see anything absolutely appalling happening. TCL is still a ways behind market leaders like Sony, Samsung and LG in terms of visual processing, but has certainly closed the gap in the last year.",
    "If you\u2019ve yet to see a truly bright HDR television (like Samsung\u2019s QLED series) it\u2019s hard to know what you\u2019re missing out on - beautiful, bright images that fill the room with light and make every detail visible to the naked eye. Unfortunately, without a bright LED panel, that\u2019s really not possible - and the TCL 5-Series falls into that trap.",
    "4K HDR images, therefore, have the clarity necessary to get the job done - it is a 4K UHD screen after all - but the lackluster colors and low brightness keep it from achieving cinema-quality greatness.",
    "In practice, what that means is that movies like Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, that were mastered in 4K/HDR, don\u2019t really live up to their greatest potential. Jungle scenes that should drip lush greens and bright sky blues look a bit dull. There are some nice scenes throughout the film, but they\u2019re nowhere near as good as they could be on another screen.",
    "There\u2019s also the problem with how the TV handles motion, which is to say, not very well. While things are a bit better when you head into the settings and turn motion smoothing off and opt instead for the natural cinema mode, artifacting is hard to ignore in most action sequences and games.",
    "Dolby Vision support is certainly welcome here and everywhere, but with a low peak luminance, you\u2019re not really getting the full experience.",
    "To end things on a bit of a high note, sound performance is strong on the TCL 5-Series. In our time with the TV, we were able to keep the TV set at a reasonable volume level of around 30, and rarely had to use closed captions to catch missing words.",
    "Of course, all living rooms aren\u2019t made equal and while the 5-Series certainly excelled in our modest San Francisco apartment, there\u2019s no guarantee the results would carryover into something a bit more spacious.",
    "Also, while it's not the best screen we've come across for music listening (not even in the top 10, really) it's fine to play a tune or two and especially easy to do thanks to the built-in Chromecast that accepts streams from YouTube and others.",
    "If you\u2019re looking to buy a new living room screen that will wow your friends and family when they come over for movie night, the TCL 5-Series probably isn\u2019t the ticket - it\u2019s too dim to show off any HDR or 4K films you might have access to, and the smart platform hiccups are more likely to be embarrassing than they are to shock and awe.",
    "While the 5-Series\u2019 lack of brightness and connectivity issues are detrimental to its overall performance, what\u2019s more damaging is the fact that TCL makes another TV called the 6-Series that\u2019s significantly better and costs just a bit more. It makes for a much better viewing experience to an increased brightness and we didn\u2019t have any problems with Roku TV, despite testing the 6-Series for a longer period of time.",
    "All that said, the 5-Series is absolutely fine as a second screen, either for a bedroom or a dorm room where something cheaper and dimmer would be ideal. It\u2019s the kind of TV that won\u2019t woo any cinephiles in your life, but it doesn\u2019t break the bank, either."
