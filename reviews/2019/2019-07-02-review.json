  "author": "jacob-grana",
  "summary": "More work than play in this all-rounder, but a great value",
  "verdict": "Acer\u2019s Aspire E 15 is a budget laptop that offers more than its asking price suggests. This chunky device features a huge variety of ports, a top notch processor and a super comfortable keyboard. It even games a little, though the enterprise user or student is really this laptop\u2019s target market.",
  "pros": [
    "Lighter than it looks",
    "Work (and finger) friendly keyboard",
    "Lots of new and old ports and inputs",
    "Huge touchpad"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Flimsy construction",
    "Bland display"

    "Describing Acer\u2019s 15.6-inch Aspire E 15 laptop couldn\u2019t be easier. It has all the things you want, all the things you don\u2019t want, and all the things you thought were buried with the ET Atari 2600 carts in that New Mexico landfill.",
    "That may be a little vague, so here are some clearer details: the E 15 has a numpad keyboard, VGA port and optical drive. Compared to today\u2019s high-end computers, we wouldn\u2019t blame you for looking for the VHS slot (betamax versions are releasing soon \u2013 we kid).",
    "In all seriousness, the E15 is a fine laptop. Better than fine, actually. This laptop plays games, it multitasks, it connects with everything and, yes, it really does feature an optical drive. It\u2019s a budget laptop that will get you through all of your daily duties \u2013 just don\u2019t expect to play the Witcher 3 on its highest settings.",
    "It\u2019s quite a large laptop, though \u2013 which it needs to be to fit all of those features in. For some, a five pound device doesn\u2019t warrant a second look, but if you\u2019re on a budget, you really should consider the Acer Aspire E15.",
    "Plus, with Amazon Prime Day coming on 15th July 2019, we may see further price cuts to the Acer Aspire E 15. This will make it an even more compelling buy if the price drops further.",
    "The Aspire E 15 is no looker, but at least its price isn\u2019t an eyesore. At $599 (\u00a3424, about AU$779), Acer\u2019s jack-of-all-trades device leaves your piggy bank intact.",
    "Key competitors, like the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 ($999, \u00a31,399, AU$1,499) and the HP Pavilion 15t ($849, \u00a3458, AU$1,545) are no wallet-busters either, but they\u2019re still not as cheap as the E 15.",
    "Of the bunch, Dell\u2019s Inspiron is the only device marketed as a true gaming laptop, and its optional GTX 1060 graphics chip backs up that claim. For the Aspire E 15 and the Pavilion 15t however, gaming is merely a side-quest: they\u2019re sporting an MX150 and 940MX, respectively.",
    "The Aspire E 15 is also highly customizable: models with processors from AMD to the Core i7 can be had, depending on your budget. To no one\u2019s surprise though, Acer is pushing the E 15 configuration that showcases Intel\u2019s 8th generation Core i5.",
    "This processor is the stand-out piece of hardware on an otherwise pedestrian spec sheet, and it helped our review Aspire E 15 more than hold its own on our benchmark tests. (The Inspiron 15 7000 and Pavilion benchmark well too, but they\u2019re top-tier configurations have Intel\u2018s older, 7th gen processors.)",
    "When you think \u201815-inch laptop,\u2019 \u2018fit\u2019 isn\u2019t the typical descriptor that comes to mind. Too often, 15-inchers are bulky, chunky and wonky \u2013 not the E 15. Because it\u2019s weight is evenly distributed across the device, the E 15 avoids the paperweight feel that plagues a lot of big laptops. For a big-bodied device, it\u2019s light on its feet.",
    "Unfortunately, a consequence of this \u2018light-foot\u2019 design philosophy is flimsiness. The E 15\u2019s panels have a hollow quality \u2013 none more so than it\u2019s display. It\u2019s unnervingly flexible. Lift the E 15 by its screen at your peril.",
    "Wide-screen, full HD, decent viewing angles: the E 15 has nearly all the trappings of a great screen. Its one major flaw \u2013 and the one that may ultimately keep it out of movie and game night \u2013 is its poor color contrast.",
    "Grainy, gray-tinged and rather dark, the E15\u2019s display turns any movie into something out of the French New Wave. Not bad if you\u2019re a cinema buff, but most users will find the experience underwhelming. As much as anything, the E 15\u2019s display makes it a work-first laptop.",
    "The shine isn\u2019t on the E 15\u2019s screen, but rather on its backlit keyboard. Its keys are robust and well-spaced despite having to share with a numpad; and their deep, springy travel is perfect for the professional typer. There\u2019s a lot of real estate available on the E 15, and its keyboard uses it well.",
    "We can gladly say the same for the E 15\u2019s extra-large touchpad. It\u2019s big, but not gratuitous, and leaves plenty of room for resting palms. It supports multi-touch gestures and has great palm rejection as well as smooth scrolling. Its click is also solid if a little uneven \u2013 near the top of the touchpad, the action gets stiff.",
    "Further cementing the E 15\u2019s work-first reputation is its excellent selection of both new and legacy ports. USB ports from 2.0 to Type-C, as expected, adorn the left and right sides of its base, along with an HDMI and Ethernet port.",
    "What is perhaps unexpected \u2013 and sets the E 15 apart from the Inspiron and Pavilion \u2013 is its inclusion of a VGA port and optical drive. While their presence may hurt the E 15\u2019s profile, they certainly add to its appeal, especially for enterprise users and students. Acer\u2019s laptop is one of the few that can accommodate so-called legacy tech, like wired projectors, which many businesses and schools still use."
