    "Portable speakers come in all shapes and sizes these days, and no brand proves that better than heritage rock audio company Marshall.",
    "Since releasing the Marshall Kilburn II last year, the company has expanded its portable speaker lineup with the handbag-sized Stockwell II and the largest of the three speakers, the Marshall Tufton.",
    "Like its smaller sibling, the Kilburn II, the guitar amp-style Tufton promises to combine rugged roadworthiness with multidirectional sound \u2013 but can it deliver?",
    "The Marshall Tufton is costs $399 / \u00a3350 / AU$700, which is fairly expensive for a portable Bluetooth speaker and it\u2019s the most expensive of Marshall\u2019s portable speaker range \u2013 it\u2019s not quite up there with the Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Wireless, which costs $699 / \u00a3499 / AU$999, but it\u2019s still a lot, especially when you consider our current favorite, the UE Boom 3 costs just $129.99 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$199.95 in comparison.",
    "Like Marshall\u2019s other speakers, the Tufton is designed to resemble a guitar amp, albeit one that\u2019s been turned on its side.",
    "With a microphone-inspired grille featuring the iconic Marshall logo in white script, rugged corner caps, and a leather-effect cabinet, the Tufton certainly plays up to the rock aesthetic,, as do the Kilburn II and Stockwell II.",
    "For portability, the Tufton comes with a faux-leather guitar strap-inspired handle, with a plush red velvet underside and luxurious gold screws holding it in place. It\u2019s not the lightest portable speaker we\u2019ve tested, weighing in at just over 4.5kg / 10lbs, but it\u2019s not so heavy that you\u2019d struggle to get it from your car to a picnic spot \u2013 just don\u2019t expect to comfortably carry the Tufton around all day at a festival.",
    "Continuing the guitar amp theme are the dials on top of the speaker, which control the volume, bass, and treble levels of your music; as well as being aesthetically pleasing, the inclusion of physical dials gives music playback a tactile quality that\u2019s really enjoyable.",
    "The top of the speaker also features a small Bluetooth pairing button and an LED battery indicator, which we found really useful for checking how much charge we had left at a glance.",
    "On the back of the speaker you\u2019ll find a small circular grille that contributes to the Tufton\u2019s multidirectional sound, and a mains power port covered by a rubber seal for protection when you\u2019re on the move.",
    "The speaker has an IPX2 rating, which means it can withstand dripping water; so it\u2019s not exactly waterproof, but a spot of drizzle shouldn\u2019t ruin your fun if you take it outside.",
    "Marshall calls the Tufton \u201cthe king of the road\u201d, and with the speaker offering over 20 hours portable playtime on a single charge, we think it\u2019s a fair title.",
    "It also boasts a \u2018quick charge\u2019 feature, which means a 20-minute burst will provide you with four hours of playback, which is handy if you need to head out with the Tufton at short notice.",
    "Sound-wise, the Marshall Tufton is big, brash, and in your face, and can easily fill a room with sound with the volume turned up to halfway \u2013 all in all, it\u2019s totally rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.",
    "Thanks to the inclusion of three separate drivers in the front of the speaker, and one on the rear, the Tufton gives the impression of multi-directional sound, which is great if you want to stick it in the middle of a room for a party.",
    "Another useful feature for party listening is multi-host functionality, which means you can switch between two Bluetooth devices and take turns playing songs with a friend.",
    "We found the Bluetooth pairing process was generally straightforward \u2013 you simply need to turn the volume dial to switch the Tufton on, and then press the Bluetooth button to put it into pairing mode.",
    "Once paired, we tested the speaker with Gorillaz\u2019 Dirty Harry; the pounding bass sounded full but not muddy, while the rap vocals sounded punchy and clear, with just enough grain to give them an edge.",
    "The highest-frequency percussion occasionally sounded a bit harsh, but that\u2019s almost to be expected from a rock-inspired speaker; it\u2019s definitely not for the faint-hearted, and if you often suffer from listening fatigue after prolonged music sessions, you may want to look elsewhere as harsh high frequencies can exacerbate this.",
    "While we were impressed by the liveliness of the Tufton\u2019s presentation, the mid frequencies were sometimes lost amongst the treble and bass; we\u2019d ideally like to hear more of the sweeping strings that underpin the attacking rap vocals in the above track.",
    "As a rock-inspired speaker, we were expecting the Tufton to excel in its presentation of guitar music \u2013 and it delivered in spades. Overdriven guitar riffs sounded full, assertive, and ostentatious in Fat White Family\u2019s Touch the Leather, while the drawled vocals commanded the room.",
    "Again, the highest frequencies occasionally sounded harsh to our ears, but we enjoyed the fierce sound of the drums. The mid frequencies also sounded recessed, and we felt some of the vocal harmonies in the chorus of this track were overly subdued.",
    "The Marshall Tufton handles acoustic sound just as well as it handles raucous rock and thunderous hip hop. The soft harp tones of Joanna Newsom\u2019s Sprout and the Bean sounded impressively delicate, while her voice was strong, clear, and resonant.",
    "As mentioned, using the treble and bass dials to manipulate the sound adds an authentic rock n roll feel to the listening experience, and they\u2019re useful if you find the bass a little heavy for your liking \u2013 even so, we found the audio quality was at its best when both dials were set to the middle.",
    "Despite its relatively high price, the Tufton doesn\u2019t come with voice assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa built in, so you won\u2019t be able to use it as the control hub for your smart home.",
    "As the largest device in Marshall\u2019s portable speaker range, the Tufton certainly packs a sonic punch, with rich bass and crystal clear trebles \u2013 although we found mid frequency sound sometimes became lost in that lively mix.",
    "Its bass isn\u2019t as muddy as the output of its smaller sibling, the Kilburn II, but the Tufton isn\u2019t as easily portable due to its larger size \u2013 if you\u2019re looking for something you can lug around all day, you\u2019re better off sticking to the more compact model.",
    "The retro guitar amp-inspired design may not appeal to everyone, but rock fans will probably love the use of tactile control dials instead of buttons, and the guitar strap-style carrying handle.",
    "It\u2019s undeniably expensive at nearly $400, and it doesn\u2019t come with modern conveniences like voice control \u2013 but if you have some money to burn and you love that rocking aesthetic and soundstage, the Tufton could be a fantastic investment for listening at home and on the road."
