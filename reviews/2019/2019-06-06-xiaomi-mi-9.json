    "Update: Xiaomi has announced that it plans to release not one but two spin-offs for the Xiaomi Mi 9 \u2013 the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE and Xiaomi Mi 9T.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is a 'compact' version of the base Mi 9, with pared-down specs and a price tag that's significantly lower than the already-cheap Mi 9. It's already available in certain regions, including the UK, so you can pick it up already.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 9T is a different device entirely, with an all-body screen and 'pop-up' selfie camera, as well as advanced specs. We don't know for sure when it'll be available yet, but we're expecting it to cost a little more than the Mi 9.",
    "Xiaomi is still fairly new to the mobile market outside of China \u2013 the Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro was the first phone launched in the UK for example, in 2018 \u2013 but it\u2019s posing some serious competition to establish brands with the Xiaomi Mi 9, its newest flagship device.",
    "The Mi 9 looks like a fantastic jack-of-all-trades device; it has a powerful processor, impressive camera setup, and supports up to 20W fast charging \u2013 and on top of that it\u2019s a whole load cheaper than phones with a similar spec.",
    "It\u2019s not without drawbacks \u2013 Xiaomi has clearly had to cut some corners to get a fantastic chipset and camera array into the handset at such a low price, and its attempt at designing its own UI for the Mi 9 likely won\u2019t please everyone.",
    "Since release competitors to the Xiaomi Mi 9 have come out, most notably the Huawei P30, a three-camera photography powerhouse with a sleek design and impressive chipset, and it sits at a price-point only slightly higher than the Mi 9.",
    "But generally the Mi 9 is an impressive mid-range device, with internals that are surprisingly good for its relatively low price \u2013 so are this phone, and the Xiaomi brand in general, a serious threat to established mid-range Android players like Huawei and OnePlus?.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 9 is available now in China, Spain and Italy, and from April 30 in the UK.",
    "However Xiaomi has told TechRadar that, for the time being, there are no plans to release the Xiaomi Mi 9 in the US, so if you're based there you might want to check out the 'Competition' section of this review for suggestions of other similar handsets instead of the Mi 9.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 9 price varies quite a bit between regions \u2013 the 64GB memory version of the handset costs \u20ac449 / \u00a3499 (roughly \u20b935,000, AED$1,849), and the larger 128GB storage phone costs more at \u20ac499 / \u00a3549 (about \u20b938,800, AED2,000).",
    "While in the UK you're still paying a reasonable mid-range price for the Xiaomi Mi 9, it's around \u00a3100 more expensive for each model than if you directly converted the prices from Euros.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 9 has a slightly curved glass back, giving it a distinct look and a comfortable feel. Xiaomi says this creates an appealing holographic effect; we didn\u2019t notice this with the Piano Black handset we tested, but it\u2019s possible the Ocean Blue or Lavender Violet colors create this effect a little better.",
    "The Mi 9 has a 6.39-inch AMOLED display, with a 2340 x 1080 Full HD+ resolution, which delivers vibrant colors with a great brightness range \u2013 it was a treat to watch movies on and complemented the fantastic camera array. This screen is broken by a small top bezel housing the front-facing camera, but other than that is unbroken, with no top bezel to speak of and minimal chin.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi 9 measures 157.5 x 74.67 x 7.61mm, so it\u2019s a medium-sized device, but at 173g it does feel a touch on the heavy side \u2013 it\u2019s no Moto G7 Power for sure, but we did start to notice its weight after long gaming sessions or photo shoots.",
    "On the bottom of the device you\u2019ll find a USB-C port \u2013 though no 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 while the volume rocker and power button are on the right side, and there\u2019s a Google assistant button to the left.",
    "These buttons are pretty pronounced \u2013 we often accidentally pressed the Google assistant button when we put the phone down on its side or picked it up, which became annoying after a while.",
    "On the rear of the phone the tri-lens camera array, which we\u2019ll look at in detail later, also juts out a fair way \u2013 we often found ourselves scraping our finger on it when moving the device in our hand",
    "Generally, however, it\u2019s a nice device to hold \u2013 the side buttons and in-screen fingerprint sensor are low enough to be easy to reach, the curved glass back feels comfortable in the hand for long periods, and the Google assistant button is out the way most of the time \u2013 although the large display does mean the top of the device can be hard to reach.",
    "Included in the box is a plastic case which fits the handset snugly, and conveniently hides how hot the phone can get \u2013 more on that later. While this feels useful for protecting the device it does add some extra bulk, so it may not be for everyone."
