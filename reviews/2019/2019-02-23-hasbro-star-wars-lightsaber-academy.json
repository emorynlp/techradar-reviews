    "Kids have been whacking each other with toy lightsaber replicas for decades, reenacting their favorite Jedi vs Sith duels. Now, parents will be thrilled with Hasbro for making lightsabers that virtually duel with one another\u2014though, let's be honest, kids will hit each other with them anyway.",
    "At Toy Fair 2019 in New York City, Hasbro showed off Star Wars Lightsaber Academy, a motion-controlled, Bluetooth lightsaber replica bundled with a companion app that teaches your young Padawans how to wield their sabers like Yoda or Vader.",
    "We tried out our dueling skills on the show floor and have the lowdown on everything you need to know to decide whether this is the best toy for teaching your children the ways of the Force.",
    "Star Wars Lightsaber Academy will go on sale sometime toward the end of the year\u2014however, there\u2019s no official release date yet.",
    "We do know that it will sell for $50 (around \u00a338, AU$69), that it comes with one Smart-Hilt lightsaber and complimentary access to the Lightsaber Academy app in iOS or Android, and that you\u2019ll find it for sale with most major retailers. The AA batteries that power the saber aren\u2019t included.",
    "The saber\u2019s Smart-Hilt contains an accelerometer (measures location), a gyro (rotation) and a barometer (height and pressure); all that data then transmits to the app via Bluetooth connectivity tech.",
    "Again, you\u2019re getting just one saber for virtual training. For true head-to-head combat, Hasbro will also sell Extendable and Electronic Lightsabers for $7 and $20, respectively. The extendable ones have no smart tech, while the electronic ones have special light and sound effects but no Bluetooth or location tracking.",
    "So to truly set up a multiplayer battle in the app, you'll need two copies of Lightsaber Academy and its \"Master Lightsaber\", Hasbro confirmed.",
    "Once you've downloaded the app, your kid will create a new Padawan profile, then complete lessons and skill challenges in their quest to become a Jedi Master.",
    "At the start, your kids will choose to learn from one of five Jedi and Sith masters: Yoda, Rey, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, or Kylo Ren. The app then trains you on how to pose and attack, in a way that matches the masters\u2019 \u201cofficial\u201d movie fighting styles\u2014or so Hasbro claims.",
    "For one challenge, the app had us point the saber at a specific point, then sweep the sword downward in a semicircle; the sensors tracked the saber\u2019s movement and determined we had been 97% accurate to the original trajectory. For a skill challenge, we had to learn a combination sword and hand movement meant to finish off our opponent at the end of a duel.",
    "Compared to the old motion-control days, when a wiimote could only track horizontal, vertical or thrusting attacks, Hasbro's sensors felt impressively accurate. You could tell that the app knew exactly where your lightsaber was in the air at all times. Moreover, we never had a problem with latency: the virtual lightsaber moved almost immediately after the real saber moved.",
    "With such specific tracking, it\u2019s not outlandish to think that the app can distinguish between, say, Vader\u2019s violent full-body attacks and Yoda\u2019s smaller, more compact style. Still, we\u2019ll need to conduct a full review of the app to see just how different these five styles are in practice. Since this toy is geared towards children, it's likely that these lessons and techniques will not be too difficult or combo-based.",
    "Your missions are focused solely around following the instructions of your Jedi Master. I asked the Hasbro rep if you could fight any iconic enemies from the Star Wars universe, but he said that wasn't a game option at this time. Since Lightsaber Academy is aimed towards younger kids, combat against bounty hunters and stormtroopers would probably be a bit too scary.",
    "You can see above some of the available lightsaber hilts and colors you\u2019ll get to choose from this fall. As with most toy lightsabers, they're collapsable and made of durable plastic.",
    "In person, the lightsabers felt light enough to hold and swing around comfortably, though smaller hands might have trouble. Hasbro\u2019s official age recommendation is 6+.",
    "The hilt that comes with the Lightsaber Academy pack has its own unique appearance from any of the iconic movie hilts, but arguably looks a bit generic. If your kid really wants a saber that matches the movie version, the $20 electronic lightsabers do have either Luke Skywalker\u2019s or Darth Vader\u2019s movie-accurate hilts\u2014they just don\u2019t have motion tracking.",
    "Our favorite element of the Smart-Hilt is the kyber crystal. Hidden underneath the plastic casing, the crystal shines different colors representing the different masters (red for Vader, blue for Rey, etc.). And you can press down on the crystal to cycle between colors (and masters) until you find a lesson or challenge that sounds interesting.",
    "Lots of tech companies have tried to recreate the feeling of wielding a lightsaber\u2014Google\u2019s Lightsaber Escape, Lenovo\u2019s AR Jedi Challenges, ILMxLab\u2019s Trials on Tatooine VR\u2014without the tactile feedback of actually striking anything. With Hasbro\u2019s Lightsaber Academy, you can physically strike at your opponent, but it\u2019s recommended that you don\u2019t.",
    "Instead, kids are meant to dual one another slightly far apart from one another, in what the Hasbro rep called a \"rock-paper-scissors type battle\".",
    "During the duel, you can either swing your sword at your opponent, hold it up horizontally in a blocking motion, or hold it vertically straight up to focus your Force energy. Attacking beats focus, focus beats defense, and defense beats attack.",
    "Successful hits eat away at your opponents\u2019 health, which appears in the connected app; knock them down to zero, and you\u2019ll have the chance to finish them off with a special move. Do so, and the winner will earn XP towards ranking up to a Jedi Master.",
    "In theory, this should make for a more mentally challenging experience than just clobbering one another, while also being a fun test of your reflexes. In practice, children will likely just swing wildly until the app names a winner.",
    "When we tried it out, we had an enjoyable time trying to outsmart the Hasbro rep and strategically block and focus. But his relentless attacks easily won out over our tactics.",
    "We came out of the experience having had a lot of fun, but with two key concerns: One, it\u2019s difficult to both duel your opponent and look at the screen to check on your and your opponents\u2019 health, so you don\u2019t really know how well you\u2019re doing during the actual duel.",
    "Two, the simplified rock-paper-scissors format means that all of the special techniques and attacks the kids learn can all be blocked by the same blocking motion, and that speed is more important than technique. In other words, there doesn't seem to be enough cohesion between the single player and multiplayer experiences.",
    "Despite these drawbacks, the experience will provide a lot of fun for kids, and enough gameified tutorial content to provide plenty of replay value.",
    "And, if your kids ever grow tired of the app, they can just use the lightsabers as regular toy swords."
