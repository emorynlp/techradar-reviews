    "The Groov-E SoundBuds, like so many earbuds chasing the trend these days, are a pair of true wireless earphones offering untethered audio on the cheap.",
    "True wireless goes that step further from wireless earbuds, meaning even the earbuds themselves are disconnected from each other. This can cause more connectivity problems on the budget end of headphones, but it can also offer convenient audio without any pesky cables getting in the way. So how do the Groov-E SoundBuds fair, and do they manage to stand out from the competition?",
    "The Groov-E SoundBuds retail at $74.99 / \u00a364.99 (around AU$105). They're already available to buy in the UK and Europe through the Groov-E website (www.groov-e.co.uk), though UK buyers can also get them from Amazon \u2013 or Tesco, who are selling at a reduced \u00a350 price in-store. The SoundBuds will be available from Amazon US from August.",
    "Those after the market leaders will want the Apple AirPods (2019), which come in at $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249.",
    "If you don\u2019t want to follow the trends \u2013 or fork out that much for such a small piece of hardware \u2013 the Funcl W1 earbuds are fantastic true wireless earbuds at a bottom-dollar price. It\u2019s worth noting that Funcl\u2019s offering is also cheaper than the Groov-E SoundBuds reviewed here, with generally more pleasing audio too.",
    "The design of the earbuds themselves is straightforward, with a matte black casing small LED ring that flashes every few seconds when in use. It\u2019s simple, but with an edge of sci-fi, and it\u2019s to Groov-E\u2019s benefit that it hasn\u2019t tried to do anything more complicated.",
    "The SoundBuds feel cheap, yet streamlined \u2013 and it\u2019s a shame that the charging case feels even cheaper for what it is. The case carries an additional 10 hours of charge with the SoundBuds\u2019 four-hour battery life \u2013 totalling at a paltry 14 hours.",
    "There's also a needless \u2018charging\u2019 button you have to press to get the process going \u2013 instead of simply charging automatically when you put the earbuds inside. The case does however show you how many charges you have left, slowly reducing a percentage counter down from 100% full charge.",
    "That said, the earbuds and case are light and compact, and for transporting in a bag or pocket everyday they\u2019re perfectly sufficient. They aren\u2019t fitted with wing tips or seem that ergonomic, but they also shouldn\u2019t fall out unless you\u2019re attempting rigorous exercise \u2013 in which case you may want some running headphones like the Under Armor True Wireless Flash instead.",
    "As is the norm with earbuds like these, you'll get three sizes of ear tips, as well as a micro USB charging cable (we wouldn't expect the fancier USB-C standard at this budget price).",
    "The action button is the same on both earbuds, meaning it doesn\u2019t make a difference whether you prod the left or right earbud to use the SoundBuds\u2019 various functions \u2013 for the most part.",
    "A single press will play/pause the music, or answer/drop a call, while a quick hold (one second) will conjure either the Siri or Google Assistant voice AI \u2013 if your phone or laptop supports one of them. A long hold (four seconds) will also turn each earbud on or off. Double-clicking on the left earbud will jump to the previous track, while double-clicking the right earbud will skip to the next one. Triple-clicking acts in a similar way with the volume, decreasing with the left earbud and increasing with the right.",
    "As a relatively cheap pair of true wireless earbuds, the SoundBuds connect to your source device through the right earbud, with the left and right earbuds then connecting to each other.",
    "The connection therefore isn\u2019t as strong as we would like \u2013 and it\u2019s obvious when listening that this isn\u2019t the latest Bluetooth standard, so you will get music cutting in and out on occasion.",
    "When the music is playing, however, the Groov-E SoundBuds generally have a balanced and clear sound. They can struggle especially with higher notes, though: listening to something like the heart-wrenching solo in Burn (Hamilton Soundtrack) will grate on the ears, with a scratchy sound that can\u2019t quite keep the higher notes together \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of sibilance wringing out the s\u2019s for all they\u2019re worth.",
    "The SoundBuds are more comfortable with mid-range frequencies that don\u2019t push their drivers particularly hard.",
    "You can certainly hear podcasts or radio stations relatively clearly, and for general pop and rock you\u2019ll be able to follow the tune and make out lyrics perfectly well \u2013 even if it\u2019s not of the highest quality. But these are budget true wireless earbuds, and there\u2019s only so much you should expect for the price.",
    "The Groove-E SoundBuds are middle-of-the-road earbuds, that can only really justify the asking price for its true wireless technology. If untethered audio is your priority, it may be worth it, but keep in mind you\u2019re not getting the audio quality you would for wired earphones for the same cost.",
    "It's hard to recommend these especially given the Funcl W1 earbuds we reviewed earlier in the year \u2013 which come in at a slightly cheaper \u00a350 and have a generally more pleasing design and sound (somehow). But the Groov-E SoundBuds are still certainly a decent package for the price."
