  "verdict": "The Kids version of the entry-level Kindle is more expensive than the standard one, but it gives you an ad-free, kid-friendly experience with a year\u2019s free subscription to Fire for Kids Unlimited, two years of insurance and a good quality case.",

    "The Kindle makes a great device for children: it\u2019s incredibly portable, it lasts for ages between charges and it\u2019s easy to share books between devices.",
    "As we\u2019ve upgraded our own Kindles we\u2019ve passed our existing ones down to the kids and taken advantage of Amazon\u2019s useful parental controls, but Amazon thinks we\u2019d be better getting a brand new Kids Edition instead.",
    "The hardware isn\u2019t anything to get excited about but that\u2019s not really what Amazon\u2019s pushing here. It\u2019s all about the bundled experience.",
    "The Kindle Kids Edition is \u00a399 / $109.99 (about AU$185) and it\u2019s on sale now in the US and UK. An Australian launch date hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, and we don't have an exact price for those there.",
    "As with all Amazon devices you can expect discounting around big sales events such as Black Friday, Prime Day or days ending in \u201cy\u201d. If you\u2019re thinking \u201chang on! Isn\u2019t that \u00a330 / $20 more expensive than the ad-supported Kindle?\u201d you\u2019d be right.",
    "That extra money gets you a good quality case, two years of no-quibble gadget insurance that includes accidental damage, and in the UK a year of ad-free, multi-device access to Fire for Kids Unlimited with its collection of over 1,000 children\u2019s books. That\u2019s usually \u00a33.99 / $4.99 per month for a single child; here it\u2019s included for up to four children.",
    "The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the Kindle Kids Edition is its case, which in the UK is either blue or pink. US customers can choose from another two designs, outer space or colorful birds.",
    "That pink-for-the-girls approach didn\u2019t go down very well with our resident twelve-year-old, who wanted to know why the standard cases couldn\u2019t include neutral colors.",
    "The device itself is a tenth-generation 2019 Kindle in black plastic. It charges via micro-USB and the only physical control is the wake button: everything else is done via the touchscreen.",
    "The device isn\u2019t waterproof, so you might be glad of the included two-year accidental damage cover. Storage space is a very respectable 8GB, which for ebooks if more than enough room.",
    "The Kindle for Kids has a six-inch e-ink display delivering 167ppi with 16 shades of grey. It has a built-in, adjustable backlight that\u2019ll inevitably be used for reading in bed. The display is clear and it\u2019s easy to adjust the font settings, but it\u2019s very slow to refresh and the lag when using the on-screen keyboard is \u201cannoying\u201d, according to our tweenage reviewer.",
    "Like the standard Kindle, the Kids Edition promises up to four weeks between charges based on around half an hour of reading per day; double the daily reading time and you\u2019ll get about two weeks.",
    "We\u2019ve found that in real-life use the battery claims are accurate, although if you spend a lot of time browsing the store (or disable the Kids Edition software and use the web browser) the battery life will be significantly less.",
    "From flat, the battery charges to full in about 4 hours with a standard 5W charger. Annoyingly, that's not supplied and instead the package just includes the USB cable.",
    "There\u2019s no point in having access to a thousand titles if they don\u2019t include the ones your child wants to read. A kid who wants to devour the Artemis Fowl series, which isn\u2019t here for UK users, won\u2019t appreciate the Circus Train and The Clowns ebook, which is.",
    "The UK edition\u2019s selection is considerably smaller than the US one, so for example while Harry Potter is present and correct many big names aren\u2019t. Our tester found that Percy Jackson, Lemony Snicket and Artemis Fowl were all absent, as were popular series such as How To Train Your Dragon.",
    "Other series are incomplete, so there\u2019s just one of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, four of the nine Demon Dinner Ladies titles and only one of the core Captain Underpants books. The missing titles are available as paid-for titles in the main Kindle store, which of course adds extra expense.",
    "The software is a lightly tweaked version of the usual Kindle user interface. It disables the web browser and adds achievement badges, Word Wise (which automatically shows the meaning of more difficult words so you don\u2019t have to look them up in the dictionary) and a search function that\u2019s more forgiving of spelling mistakes.",
    "The standard Kindle software is still there, and you can access it by entering your parental control PIN \u2013 so you can use it for your own reading when the kids are out or in bed.",
    "The parental control features can be accessed on the device or via the parents portal on Amazon, where you can change the age filter, set daily reading goals or add content you\u2019ve purchased on your other Kindle devices or apps.",
    "The only serious competitor here is Amazon\u2019s own entry-level Kindle, which is \u00a330 / $20 cheaper with ads or \u00a320 / $10 without.",
    "To add an official fabric case to the standard Kindle is \u00a324.99 / $29.99, and if you don\u2019t already have a Fire for Kids Unlimited subscription that\u2019s another \u00a31.99 / $2.99 to \u00a33.99 / $4.99 per month for one child or \u00a34.99 / $6.99 to \u00a37.99 / $9.99 per month for a family plan. The cheaper prices are what you'll spend if you're already a Prime member.",
    "On that basis, the Kids Edition is a better deal; factor in two years of no-quibble replacement that includes accidental damage and it\u2019s an even better one. Just remember that your subscription is only free for the first year."
