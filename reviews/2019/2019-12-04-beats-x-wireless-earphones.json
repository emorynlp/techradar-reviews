    "The BeatsX may be a little long in the tooth now, but they're still a great pair of wireless earbuds for anyone who wants to eschew the popular Apple AirPods.",
    "Most of the best Beats headphones come in traditional over-ear or on-ear headphone or true wireless form factors these days, but the BeatsX are a different breed.",
    "That's because rather than sticking to bass-heavy running earbuds or wildly expensive over-ears, the company has dreamed up a new pair of musically inclined neckbuds for anyone sick of losing their brand-new true wireless earbuds.",
    "Although they're a bit different, the BeatsX borrows a lot from previous Beats headphones. For example, the headphones have a flat, no-tangle cable and stellar compatibility with iOS devices. But they also carve out their own niche as one of the first balanced pair of headphones from the low-end loving company.",
    "Upon their release in 2017, the BeatsX has a few tricks up its sleeve that not many headsets from Apple or Beats by Dre could claim: Quick Charge.",
    "This is a feature that allows your new \u2018buds to last up to two hours from a single five-minute charge, and Apple\u2019s W1 wireless chip (this chip has now been usurped by the H1 chip, as seen in the new AirPods Pro). We\u2019ll talk about what the W1 does in explicit detail later on in the review, but we\u2019ll preface that conversation by saying that it vastly improves the BeatsX\u2019s battery life and performance over Bluetooth.",
    "One carry-over from previous generations, however, is its pricing \u2013 the BeatsX are not what we\u2019d consider an affordable pair of in-ear headphones.",
    "At launch, they cost $149 / \u00a3129 / AU$199, which is a far bit more expensive than similar sounding wireless in-ear earbuds \u2013 including our favorite pair of gym buddies, the Sennheiser CX Sport \u2013 but less expensive than other wireless headphones made by Beats, like the Powerbeats Pro.",
    "Now that they've been out for a couple of years, you can usually find the BeatsX for substantially less however, often dipping below $100 \u2013 and with Black Friday and Cyber Monday on the horizon, that price is set to drop even lower.",
    "As of late, in-ear headphones have taken one of three designs. They\u2019re either fully wired in-ears that connect the drivers to a 3.5mm jack; two fully wireless earbuds that connect to one another through Bluetooth; or two earbuds connected via a cable that wraps behind your neck. The BeatsX fall into the last category.",
    "Having the two earbuds connected via a cable might not sound like the ideal solution to some \u2013 after all, a cable has the tendency to weigh the earbuds down \u2013 but it\u2019s not without its advantages. First and foremost of those is the fact that they\u2019re harder to lose than fully wireless earbuds. The second is that the wire between the two buds can provide a home to in-line controls and a battery, allowing the headphones to last longer between charges and allow you to communicate with Siri.",
    "The in-line controls here are just the way we like them: basic but effective. You can use them the raise and lower the volume, pause the music, skip tracks and rewind. There\u2019s also a built-in microphone that you can use to make calls \u2013 something we\u2019ll touch on later in the review.",
    "If you\u2019re afraid the cable might feel uncomfortable, let us allay your fears \u2013 the BeatsX is absolutely one of the most comfortable pair of wireless in-ears we\u2019ve ever worn. It conforms naturally to the neck thanks to the flat cable, and don\u2019t really get in the way.",
    "The solution here is to carry most of the weight in the thickest part of the cable that sits around your neck, leaving two smaller cables with earbuds attached to run up to your ears. This technique helps the BeatsX sit snugly in the ear without giving you the feeling that they\u2019re about to fall out. As for the in-ear fit, Apple ships each package with four different eartips and two sets of wings that help hold the headphones in place while you\u2019re working out.",
    "Speaking of workouts, the BeatsX is water-resistant, but not fully waterproof. In practice that means you can take the BeatsX with you on a sweaty trip to the gym without fearing for their safety ... as long as you avoid taking them into the pool. When they\u2019re outside of your ear and loosely hanging on your chest, the earbuds will snap together thanks to built-in magnets that help keep the wires from getting tangled \u2013 a neat, novel feature if we\u2019ve ever seen one.",
    "If you want to match your BeatsX to your gym bag, the headphones come in four colors: Black, White, Grey and Blue. While a pair of black headphones might make the most sense given the amount of sweat, dust and dirt they\u2019re likely to attract in your bag, we can\u2019t help but feel particularly attracted to the Grey and Blue variants \u2013 the black sheep of the group.",
    "Design-wise the BeatsX have three advantages over the AirPods. First off, they\u2019re much harder to lose. Second they have a longer battery life \u2013 about eight hours on the BeatsX compared to the AirPods\u2019 six. And, finally, the four sets of eartips give you a greater chance of finding the right fit compared to the AirPods\u2019 one-size-fits-all approach.",
    "Call us whatever name you like \u2013 cheap, frugal, thrifty \u2013 but we expect a lot in terms of sound quality from a $149 pair of headphones. And while the BeatsX hits a few of the right notes \u2013 especially in terms of achieving tonal balance \u2013 it\u2019s not quite pitch-perfect for the price.",
    "But before we hammer home where BeatsX goes off-key, let\u2019s focus on the high notes. The sound quality is actually relatively clear for a pair of in-ear drivers. You won\u2019t find shimmering highs and sparkling mid-ranges here, but the sound is far from flat or hissy. What was more surprising was the overall balance Apple achieved here \u2013 mids, highs and lows are on the same keel. Highs and lows could\u2019ve been even more pronounced than they are \u2013 but we never thought we\u2019d live to see a Beats pair of headphones taking the middle ground.",
    "Where the \u2018phones falter is when it comes time to seal sound out. Even with a seemingly airtight seal, we could still hear most of the conversation going on around us. We weren\u2019t expecting a Bose QC 30-level of noise-cancellation, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s not too much to ask for some passive noise-cancellation.",
    "That being said, at least the BeatsX doesn\u2019t leak sound. Despite playing music at an ear-damagingly high level, no one in the car was any wiser which guilty pleasure music we were listening to at the time. (In case any of you are reading, it was the soundtrack to the movie Whiplash.)",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a ton of bass, though, and we can\u2019t believe we\u2019re saying this, you won\u2019t find it on this pair of Beats \u2013 Levels by Avicii was relatively tame, while Little Black Submarine by The Black Keys lacked that punch and panache we\u2019ve heard while using other pairs of cans. To most audiophiles out there, this news won\u2019t upset you. But for the people used to a pair of Beats sounding like the inside of a woofer, you might be a tad disappointed.",
    "What we really would\u2019ve liked though was more clarity. Nothing sounded dull or drab, but there was a definite lack of energy here. In terms of quality we\u2019d put them right alongside the Klipsch Reference X6i \u2013 a solid, middle-of-the-road pair of in-ear headphones from 2016.",
    "As we mentioned in the beginning of the review, the BeatsX can also be used to field calls and pull up Siri. Using the BeatsX as a Bluetooth headset is a surprisingly easy affair with one click on the in-line remote to answer calls and two clicks to hang up. In terms of call clarity, everyone we spoke to said we sounded clearer while using the BeatsX headphones than we did using the iPhone SE microphone, if slightly quieter.",
    "While we\u2019re not major fans of Apple\u2019s propagation of strange, new, proprietary technology (cough, Lightning Cables, cough), we do have a fondness for the new W1 Chip. It is, undoubtedly, the brains behind the wireless operation inside the BeatsX. It helps the the headset sync up seamlessly to iOS devices and helps preserve battery life.",
    "Strange, yes, but it is supremely easy to use. Holding an unpaired BeatsX next to iPhone brings up a prompt asking you if you\u2019d like to pair the headphones. Click yes and it will pull your name from your phone \u2013 in our case, renaming itself \u201cNick\u2019s BeatsX\u201d.",
    "As far as we can tell, this works with any number of iOS devices including Apple Watch and iPads \u2013 though it didn\u2019t pull up a prompt on our slightly older Macbook Pro.",
    "For Android users accustomed to using NFC to pair their devices, this might not be a ground-breaking feature (few things that come from Apple are). But for iOS users used to struggling to pair headphones, we appreciate the usability improvements the W1 Chip brings.",
    "In terms of battery life, the W1 also adds a je ne sais quoi that helps squeeze extra performance from built-in batteries. The Apple AirPods, which also use the W1 Chip, last for about six hours between charges, while the the BeatsX goes on for about eight hours before it needs to refuel. Our testing showed that it can last slightly longer than the eight hours it\u2019s rated for, but that number may drop down after a certain number of Quick Charge sessions.",
    "Speaking of Quick Charge, the feature worked exactly as expected, providing roughly a 25% charge in five minutes or less. Now, you\u2019re forced to use a Lightning Cable to charge the headphones instead of something a bit more universal like USB-C, but as long as you don\u2019t mind keeping a new cable with you your headphones can stay charged at all times.",
    "While we still wouldn\u2019t use the word stylish to ever describe in-ear headphones, the BeatsX makes a pretty compelling case to get us to start. That said, whatever you make of the design\u2019s aesthetics, it\u2019s still incredibly comfortable to wear for long periods at a time. The 8-hour battery life is conducive to longer listening sessions plus, when you run out of juice, it just takes a few minutes to boost the headset back to 25%.",
    "While sound quality is decent and well balanced for a Beats branded headphone, it\u2019s still not where we\u2019d want it for the price tag. There are simply better-sounding options out there that cost less. While the headset does a decent job of stopping the music you\u2019re listening to from escaping, it doesn\u2019t do a great job of keeping exterior noise out. Finally, while we didn\u2019t mind carrying around a Lightning Cable to charge the headphones for the duration of the review, Android and Windows phone users might not be as receptive to adding another cord to their bags.",
    "The BeatsX caters to two different but sometimes very much the same camps.",
    "First, it will almost certainly resonate with the workout crowd who are looking for a solid-fitting pair of in-ears that sound decent and won\u2019t weigh them down.",
    "But second, and more surprisingly, the headphones will also appeal to your standard music listener \u2013 the kind of person just looking for a pair of in-ears for a long commute. There are some obvious issues with sealing out noise here, but those aren\u2019t unforgivable considering a decent trade-off in terms of battery life and excellent iOS integration.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a no-fuss pair of earbuds and don\u2019t mind dropping some cash on them, the BeatsX are for you. If you\u2019re a cheap, frugal or thrifty audiophile like we are, however, there are higher quality options out there for less."
