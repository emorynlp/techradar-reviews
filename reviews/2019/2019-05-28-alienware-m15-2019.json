    "Dell has taken the stage of Computex 2019 to debut its sharp and exciting \u2018Legend\u2019 design first seen on the Area-51m to its thin-and-light flagship gaming laptop: the Alienware m15 for 2019. From the clever and evocative rear exhaust vents to the iconographic logo elements, this is a striking device through and through.",
    "It\u2019s also host to a bevy of configuration options that should please the picky buyer, though we\u2019d like to see a little more included in the laptop\u2019s starting price compared to key rivals.",
    "At any rate, you\u2019re looking at the bright and substantive future of Dell\u2019s gaming brand, now heralded by some impressive-looking and feeling gaming laptops. Here\u2019s what we think after some brief time with the laptop during a New York City press event held prior to Computex in Taiwan.",
    "Dell wants a rather surprising price for its new thin-and-light gaming laptop: $1,499 (about \u00a31,200, AU$2,170) when it lands on June 11. That price doesn\u2019t seem surprising on its face, but consider the hardware on offer at that level.",
    "For that price, you\u2019re getting either a 15.6-inch or 17.3-inch, Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) display at a 60Hz refresh rate powered by a 9th-generation, quad-core Intel Core i5 processor (CPU) and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 (4GB GDDR5) graphics chip (GPU). That\u2019s paired with 8GB of memory (RAM) at 2,666MHz and a 256GB PCIe M.2 solid-state drive (SSD).",
    "That seems like quite a lot of cash to start for a laptop with a completely standard display and graphics power not far beyond that of last year\u2019s GTX 1050 chip. Last year, you could get a 15-inch laptop with a 60Hz display and GTX 1050 graphics for below $1,000. Granted, it wouldn\u2019t come with the bells and whistles we\u2019ll get into shortly, but penny-for-pixel performance (if you will) matters quite a bit in gaming laptops \u2013 more so than in general use machines.",
    "At any rate, while Dell isn\u2019t talking expanded pricing options just yet, you can top out the Alienware m15 with either a 240Hz FHD display paired with Tobii eye-tracking technology built into the webcam array or an OLED Ultra HD (3,840 x 2,160) with Tobii tech as well as HDR 400 color reproduction. Dell doesn\u2019t even offer OLED 4K or FHD 240Hz displays on the 17-inch model.",
    "As for inside, you can max out either size laptop with up to an Intel Core i9-9980HK CPU and 16GB of RAM. For storage, single-drive options top out at 2TB SSDs while multi-drive configurations stop at two 2TB SSDs in RAID0 orientation. Naturally, graphics cap out at an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q with 8GB of GDDR6 video memory.",
    "Who knows how much such a laptop will cost you \u2013 far upwards of $3,000, that\u2019s more than likely.",
    "Dell has clearly taken its brilliant mothership-like \u2018Legend\u2019 design identity and adapted it to its thin-and-light gaming laptop chassis to incredible effect. This is one of the raddest-looking gaming laptops we\u2019ve ever seen, and we\u2019re elated to see the design within a chassis that\u2019s actually remotely portable.",
    "Available in Dell\u2019s \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d and \u201cLunar Light\u201d color options, the soft-touch paint feels somehow more premium than some aluminum clad gaming laptops and miles away from the standard plastic frames we so often see. The logo work on the lid makes the laptop seem as if it's one of a fleet ready for take-off into the next orbital conflict.",
    "We appreciate the display from a technical perspective, but were not able to test its 240Hz or 4K OLED capabilities during our brief testing. For the competitive set, we\u2019re sure that 240Hz refresh rate is bound to impress, likewise for the more immersion-driven gamers and that 4K OLED panel. However, you\u2019re likely to need the most powerful GPU on offer to drive the latter effectively, which will get pricey quick.",
    "On a related note, while we weren\u2019t able to test the laptop\u2019s Tobii eye tracking tech during our time with it, we\u2019re told that this plays directly into Dell\u2019s Alienware Academy program. With it, in-house tutors can use players\u2019 eye tracking data to train them to become more effective in focusing on the right elements of a game at the right moments when in the action. That alone might be worth the scratch for the right type of aspiring professional gamer.",
    "The honeycomb grill you see just beneath the display is actually not covering the laptop\u2019s speakers, but rather intake for the Cyro-Tech 3.0 cooling system inside that\u2019s now equipped with 10 more fans overall for a 10% increase in airflow and a 20% in airflow impedance. Hot air shoots out of the new rear exhaust ports \u2013 both a practical and thematic design.",
    "We are rather impressed by just how much travel Dell has achieved in the Alienware m15\u2019s keyboard, now at 1.7mm in a chassis that\u2019s just 0.77-inches (19.5mm) thick \u2013 Dell\u2019s thinnest gaming laptop yet. The keyboard takes on the Legend design\u2019s per-key RGB lighting using Dell\u2019s AlienFX software and firmware, and we find it to be quite forceful and accurate in typing.",
    "However, while Dell chalks it up to larger keycaps than before, we are a little put off by the lack of a number pad on the keyboard in the 15-inch model. This is a strange explanation for it, too, considering the unused space on either side of the keyboard that should otherwise feature top-firing speakers \u2013 instead, those bounce sound off of whatever surface the laptop is resting on. If that happens to be your laptop, expect muffled audio without headphones.",
    "That said, we quite enjoy the glass-coated Microsoft Precision trackpad that\u2019s center aligned. As for ports, this laptop has it all for a thin-and-light device: one Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port, two USB 3.1 ports, one USB 3.1 port with PowerShare, one HDMI 2.0b port, one mini DisplayPort 1.4, one RJ-45 Ethernet port and an Alienware Graphics Amplifier port.",
    "The new thin-and-light design for Alienware laptops is all told an incredible adaptation of what we assumed was to be exclusive to its largest model \u2013 which we now know will eventually spread to all products under the Alienware brand.",
    "It\u2019s tough to glean too much regarding a laptop\u2019s performance from a few brief minutes with the thing. However, we do know exactly what this device will house inside. At the entry level, we\u2019re not terribly optimistic for what experience it will provide at the price listed.",
    "Also, it\u2019s interesting that Dell hasn\u2019t opened up the RAM expansion options to 32GB as it has on products like the 2019 XPS 15 and XPS 13 2-in-1, of all things. Surely, gamers that like to broadcast gaming from their laptops to Twitch would appreciate the extra memory to handle such an endeavor?",
    "At the highest end, there\u2019s little doubt that this laptop will deliver on expectations and then some, but at what cost? If such entry-level performance will end up costing so much, we\u2019re not left confident that more impressive performance will be accessible to most folks.",
    "As for battery life, Dell isn\u2019t even providing a figure yet.",
    "We\u2019re left well impressed by the new design applied to Dell\u2019s thin-and-light flagship gaming laptop. This is one of the sharpest-looking and feeling gaming laptops to date, with impressive niceties such as a clever cooling solution and deep key travel in spite of its thin frame.",
    "However, we\u2019re left a little wanting from the pricing. While we fully expect pricing at around $2,000 for RTX graphics, $1,499 to start for GTX 1650 graphics seems a little steep considering what else is on offer for the price: just 8GB of RAM and a Core i5 processor with 256GB of storage. A Razer Blade 15 with GTX 1060 graphics, 16GB of RAM and gobs more storage \u2013 not to mention a 6-core Intel Core i7 CPU with a 144Hz display and top-firing speakers \u2013 seems like a smarter way to spend the same amount of cash.",
    "At any rate, we\u2019re excited to see Dell\u2019s impressive new Alienware design translated to its thinner and lighter form factor. This is a clever application of cooling technology that will allow the laptop to operate at max capacity for longer than many competitors. We just wish you\u2019d get a little more for that already-steep entry-level price.",
