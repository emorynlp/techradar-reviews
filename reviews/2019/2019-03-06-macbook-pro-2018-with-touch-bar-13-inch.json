    "We\u2019re just going to come out and say it: if you weren\u2019t a fan of the new MacBook Pro\u2019s ultra-thin redesign, and its use of Thunderbolt 3 as the exclusive means of connecting things, you won\u2019t change your mind for the MacBook Pro 2018.",
    "However, if having a thin and light laptop with a shallow keyboard doesn\u2019t bother you, and you like macOS, this is a solid but not all-out inspiring improvement.",
    "However, besides the 15-inch MacBook Pro, only the Touch-Bar equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro gets an upgrade, so if you\u2019re looking to save some cash on a non-Touch Bar model, you\u2019ll have to make do with a dual core processor.",
    "Especially now that the MacBook Air 2018 is here, the lower-spec versions aren\u2019t worth your time unless you can find a good deal \u2013 they\u2019re still based on 7th-gen Intel Core processors. So, the real starting point for the new MacBook Pro is $1,799 (\u00a31,749, AU$2,699). That price will get you a slightly tight 256GB SSD, and for $1,999 (\u00a31,949, AU$2,999) that SSD goes up to 512GB.",
    "As well as CPU and GPU upgrades that you\u2019ll expect (which we\u2019ll come to later), there\u2019s a small but welcome change to the Thunderbolt 3 ports. Each of the Touch Bar models has four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and in previous versions the two on the right were subject to throttling. That\u2019s no longer the case.",
    "So, if you\u2019ll use an external graphics card (eGPU), you won\u2019t have to think about where you connect it, unlike on 2016 and 2017 models.",
    "On the outside, the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2018 appears almost identical to last year's model, even down to the similar size and weight. As with 2017\u2019s MacBook Pro, there\u2019s no change to the Retina display\u2019s resolution. The 13.3-inch panel continues to pack 2560x1600 pixels. Some rivals exceeded that even before last year\u2019s models came along, so the 13-inch MacBook Pro loses out on sharpness, but the P3 wide color gamut of Apple\u2019s panel is an attractive proposition for photographic and design work.",
    "There\u2019s one new feature to the display: True Tone, previously available on iPhone X and most iPad Pros, this feature is akin to an enhanced version of the Night Shift setting.",
    "Whereas the latter warms the color temperature late at night through to early morning, True Tone works all day long and goes further; rather than shifting the temperature to a fixed setting, it uses a sensor to read ambient lighting and adjusts the colors on the screen accordingly for your comfort.",
    "Apple provides just one way to toggle True Tone. You have to go into the Displays preferences pane. Though there\u2019s a key combo (Option and the Touch Bar\u2019s screen brightness key) takes you there, we would\u2019ve liked a single key press to toggle the effect at any time.",
    "With over a year\u2019s experience of True Tone on iPad Pro, and slightly less on iPhone X, we\u2019re sold on True Tone\u2019s benefits for non-creative tasks. It\u2019s only when you turn it off in the middle of writing emails, working on a report, or even simply reading web pages that you realise how effective it is \u2013 and you\u2019ll want to turn it on again quick sharp.",
    "True Tone\u2019s suitability depends on the kind of pro user you are. If you work in any sort of visual art, you\u2019re almost certain to turn it off. Its presence on the 13-inch MacBook Pro ought to be welcomed by students, writers and other mobile workers.",
    "Meanwhile, if you're hoping for a full-on keyboard redesign, then you're out of luck. Keys with low travel remain the order of the day across Apple\u2019s pro-focused laptops. Even after a couple of years with this layout, we trip up when feeling for the arrow keys (full-size left and right ones with half-height up and down sandwiched between). Apple\u2019s marketing mentions just one benefit of the new keyboard: it says it\u2019s quieter.",
    "iFixit\u2019s initial teardown revealed that there\u2019s a silicone membrane between the key caps and the butterfly mechanisms beneath. Anecdotally, typing fast sounds less click-clacky. Whether hammering away at a lengthy document or a quick email, it\u2019s a lot less distracting \u2013 or, rather, less distracting for others nearby if you\u2019re working somewhere quiet.",
    "Further testing by the teardown specialist suggests the membrane also brings some success at keeping foreign particles away from the mechanism beneath; that\u2019s said to be a contributor to Apple\u2019s recently introduced repair program for earlier butterfly keyboard designs.",
    "Note, though, that Apple doesn\u2019t make any public claims about durability as a benefit of the third generation. It\u2019ll take the keyboard getting under many more hands to see if reliability complaints persist and to what degree.",
    "Meanwhile, the Touch Bar remains contentious for many people. Though you can switch it to show function keys or the media, volume and brightness controls, the problem you might run into is more how easy it is, without the tactile response of a key edge, to overreach the actual keys and brush the virtual ones by accident. It takes just light contact to trigger a function by mistake, and we\u2019ve found this most often when trying to delete a character and unexpectedly hearing Siri chime in.",
    "The bar\u2019s value to your workflow depends on whether your apps make good use of it. In Apple\u2019s Pages word processor, for example, you can quickly apply visual changes to selected text without lifting your hands off the keyboard to move the pointer. As the bar is context sensitive, it takes the time of checking what it\u2019s showing at a given time to know where it can save you time.",
    "Using the Touch ID fingerprint reader to quickly resume work is a bonus if you\u2019re tired of typing even your login password. Wearing your Apple Watch (assuming you have one) offers the path of least resistance though \u2013 by the time the lid is fully open, you\u2019re in. Disappointed that there\u2019s no Face ID \u00e0 la iPhone X? That would require a depth-sensing camera upgrade. However, you could argue that the MacBook Pro\u2019s camera could do with a much simpler upgrade from 720p.",
    "Behind the scenes, the Touch Bar as well as Apple\u2019s Secure Boot technology are driven by an upgraded ARM-based processor, the T2, which debuted in the iMac Pro at the end of 2017. You can read about the security benefits of the T2 at Apple\u2019s site.",
    "Where there are obvious improvements that Apple might make to the Touch Bar in the future, it has plenty of leeway when it comes to trackpads. For about a decade, it\u2019s been the clear leader in this area.",
    "We could argue the pros and cons of touchscreen Macs till the cows come home, but the roomy multitouch area in front of the MacBook Pro\u2019s keyboard is comfortable and productive, once you learn a few gestures. We can even forgive the Force Touch feature, partly because it\u2019s so forgettable \u2013 just like 3D Touch on recent iPhones \u2013 and under-utilised, though using it to preview files and folders or call up dictionary definitions is nice, if you remember it exists \u2013 which we tend to when applying extra pressure by accident.",
    "A major criticism from high-end pro users has been the MacBook Pro\u2019s 16GB memory limit. Sadly, the 13-inch models haven\u2019t received the boost to DDR4 memory, as their 15-inch siblings have.",
    "Memory on all 13-inch models goes no higher than 16GB, and it\u2019s the same 2,133MHz LPDDR3 type as last year\u2019s models. 8GB remains the starting point across the 13-inch line-up, and fitting more has to be done at the time you buy.",
    "If 8GB seems stingy, when you take the base model as a starting point and match its CPU speed, RAM and SSD capacities to a Surface Book, the MacBook Pro works out around $500/\u00a3400/AU$700 more expensive.",
    "But, things aren\u2019t like for like. For starters, the Mac has: double the amount of eDRAM (128MB), a slightly better GPU (an Iris Plus 655 rather than a 640); and the benefit of four ultra-fast and adaptable Thunderbolt 3 ports.",
    "Even so, your opinions on having to buy adapters or a dock to plug in USB-A and other devices might make you unappreciative that Apple doesn\u2019t include an adapter in the box, even though its latest phones recognise that bundling a 3.5mm adapter for headphones, rather than making you pay for one separately, is a decent concession that not everyone will have the latest and greatest accessories to connect.",
    "If only Apple would apply that here. Wirelessly transferring files with other Apple devices over AirDrop, or going via the internet, is easy enough, but something it\u2019s still easier to use a USB thumb drive.",
    "A contributor to the MacBook Pro\u2019s cost is its use of superfast NVMe-based storage. Alongside the slimline MacBook Pro design\u2019s introduction in 2016, storage was at that time upgraded to give outrageously fast rates for reading data, exceeding 3GB/sec. That\u2019s true of writing data too.",
    "Our review unit was equipped with a 2TB SSD, so it wasn\u2019t an off-the-shelf configuration, which would be 256GB or 512GB. 2TB is the maximum capacity for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it costs $1,400/\u00a31,400/AU$2,100 or $1,200/\u00a31,200/AU$1,800 depending on which respective model you pick as your starting point.",
    "With neither of the standard capacities provided, we have no test results to verify whether their performance also matches Apple\u2019s marketing quote of \u201cup to 3.2GB/sec\u201d read speeds.",
    "Our tests showed a peak read speed of 3,104MB/s (3.1GB/s), so just a little behind Apple\u2019s claim of \u201cup to 3.2GB/sec\u201d for that task. Peak performance when writing was actually more impressive, reaching 3,201.1MB/s (3.2GB/sec). As usual with drives, mean average transfer rates are lower whether reading or writing, managing 2,289.5MB/s and 2,217.3MB/s respectively.",
    "If you\u2019re not sure you need that kind of performance, on the whole you probably don\u2019t. However, it\u2019s a bonus for visual creatives \u2013 photographers or videographers who need to get hundreds of gigabytes or even over of a terabyte to a Mac in minimal time, so they can get down to work without waiting for slower storage.",
    "However, there\u2019s another reason that often goes unmentioned that also reduces delays, albeit on a less frequent basis. Whenever you need to restart your Mac (or switch user account), all the apps and windows you had open previously are brought back in quick time. The difference here over even a SATA-connected SSD doesn\u2019t quite rival instant resuming on a tablet, but it\u2019s impressive for eliminating sluggishness."
