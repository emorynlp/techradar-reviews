  "summary": "A mid-range graphics card that demands to be overclocked",
  "verdict": "The Asus ROG Strix GTX 1660 Ti OC screams performance with the biggest cooler and highest clocks we\u2019ve seen on Nvidia\u2019s new mid-range GPU, but you\u2019ll need to overclock this puppy to get the most value out of it.",
  "pros": [
    "Readily overclockable",
    "Runs incredibly cool",
    "Silky smooth QHD gaming"

  "cons": [
    "Nearly as expensive as the Nvidia RTX 2060"

    "Nvidia has struggled to make its expensive Turing RTX graphics cards look appealing to the masses, and now, after all the cries for cheaper GPUs without ray tracing cores, the company has finally responded with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti.",
    "While the card was introduced as a mid-range option with a fairly reasonable $279 / \u00a3259 / AU$469) starting price, that hasn\u2019t stopped component makers from maxing out their GPUs with models like the Asus ROG Strix GTX 1660 Ti OC.",
    "This variant comes equipped with some serious cooling hardware and the fastest factory overclock we\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s the most powerful GeForce GTX 1660 Ti you can buy thus far \u2013 just know that this part demands a premium that\u2019s so high you might be better off getting the Nvidia RTX 2060 instead.",
    "The Asus ROG Strix GTX 1660 Ti OC rings up for an expensive $329 / \u00a3339 / AU$569 price. That\u2019s well above the cost of the cheapest 1660 Ti cards that will hit the market for only $279 / \u00a3259 / AU$469.",
    "This card is so expensive that it even veers into being as pricey as the $349 / \u00a3329 / AU$599 Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060. With both of these GPUs costing nearly the same, we\u2019ll have to take a close look at the specifications to see why the Asus ROG Strix GTX 1660 Ti OC is apparently worth its weight in gold.",
    "We weren\u2019t joking when we said the Asus ROG Strix GTX 1660 Ti OC was a maxed-out version of Nvidia\u2019s latest mid-range GPU. This card comes with a 1,890MHz factory overclock that\u2019s well above the 1660 Ti\u2019s traditional 1,770MHz boost clock.",
    "The GTX 1660 Ti OC is also more than double the size of the PNY GTX 1660 XLR8 Gaming OC and most other versions of the GPU, thanks to its excessively large heat sink and triple Axial-tech fans. Asus claims its card can deliver 140% more airflow than other models equipped with traditional wing-blade fans.",
    "All of this ultimately leads to a graphics card that can push for higher clock speeds and then some while staying nice and cool.",
    "Next to the Nvidia RTX 2060, the GTX 1660 Ti can appear to be the lame duck of the Turing series. This GPU features higher base and boost frequencies, but fewer CUDA cores. You\u2019ll find GDDR6 memory onboard, but it\u2019s only rated for 12Gbps speeds compared to the same VRAM found on RTX cards, which operates at 14Gbps. And, of course, there\u2019s the lack of RTX and Tensor cores, which means this graphics card won\u2019t ever support ray tracing or DLSS.",
    "While the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is the most affordable addition to the Turing lineup, Nvidia has purposely removed and reduced some notable features to avoid cannibalizing the sales of its more expensive RTX 2060. Thankfully though, this GPU doesn\u2019t seem all that hobbled when put to the test.",
    "This graphics card sets out to be the ultimate version of the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti, and technically it accomplishes that mission. It pulls slightly ahead of the PNY GTX 1660 Ti XLR8 OC in synthetic benchmarks while running games exactly one frame per second faster. Overall, it\u2019s not the massively boosted performance we expected from the card, but we\u2019re only benchmarking it with its out-of-the-box settings.",
    "More impressively, the Asus GTX 1660 Ti OC runs a full 10C degrees cooler than its PNY rival, thanks to having two more fans and a much larger heatsink. This card doesn\u2019t break a sweat when operating normally, and it has plenty of thermal overhead to run at even faster speeds.",
    "Unfortunately, the value of this card will come down to how well you can overclock it, as it just can\u2019t keep up with the Nvidia RTX 2060 at stock settings. If you\u2019re willing to part with an extra $20 or AU$30 \u2013 you\u2019ll actually save \u00a310 in the UK \u2013 you\u2019ll end up with a much more powerful GPU that\u2019s even capable of rendering ray-traced graphics.",
    "Outside of our comparative benchmarks, the Asus GTX 1660 Ti OC is capable of rendering Hitman 2 at 4K and Ultra quality settings at 30 to 40 fps. Dropping the resolution down to 1440p results in a silkier 60-70 fps frame rate. Lastly, you\u2019ll be able to experience high-refresh rate Full HD gaming with frame rates hovering between 80 and 90 fps.",
    "The Asus ROG Strix GTX 1660 Ti OC is an impressive graphics card that will only give you more performance the more you push it. Thanks to its large cooling system, this is a mid-range GPU that can take the heat from extreme overclocking.",
    "That said, this is a very expensive version of the GTX 1660 Ti that we wouldn\u2019t recommend to most users, especially if they\u2019re just looking for a new graphics card to pull out of the box and plug into their PC. There are much cheaper versions of this GPU that will get the same job done, as this high-end Asus card isn\u2019t that much faster out of the box.",
    "With a price that\u2019s nearly on the same level as the Nvidia RTX 2060, you may just be better off getting Nvidia\u2019s other mid-range Turing card instead. It delivers better performance across the board, plus it features all of the latest RTX and Tensor core-powered features you won\u2019t find on any of Nvidia\u2019s new GTX cards.",
