    "The Asus ZenBook UX310UA doesn\u2019t initially look like much, but it\u2019s definitely worth digging into. Not only does this Ultrabook have a stunning aesthetic and plenty of horsepower, but it\u2019s so finely tuned that the Asus ZenBook UX310UA may be the best laptop for anyone on the market for a versatile machine.",
    "This device stands on the shoulders of the original MacBook Air, which was itself once considered the zenith of slim, sophisticated design housing powerful hardware. This, in itself, is enough to make the Asus ZenBook UX310UA worth your time.",
    "This just goes to show that the Taiwan-based firm is determined to keep refining its Asus laptops \u2013 and the new Asus ZenBook S13 proves that even more \u2013 so much so that we consider this laptop the de facto heir to the MacBook Air\u2019s throne.",
    "It\u2019s almost as if Asus stepped up and said, \u201cWell, if Apple won\u2019t do it, we will.\u201d Talk about courage\u2026",
    "You can get the Asus ZenBook UX310UA we tested here for around \u00a3899 (about $1,040, AU$1,400). In comparison, you can buy the slightly more powerful Dell XPS 13 2017 for \u00a3999 ($799, AU$1,400) \u2013 with configurations going for even more. Dell\u2019s laptop is speedier, but at that price it should be.",
    "The Lenovo IdeaPad 710S is available for a similar price, but it\u2019s afflicted by an uncomfortable keyboard layout, and it\u2019s sadly packed to the brim with bloatware. Asus tested the waters with the ZenBook UX310UA, as many similar laptops go for a touchscreen or the 2-in-1 route. The Asus ZenBook UX310UA doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a traditional laptop done right.",
    "To start, the Asus Zenbook UX310UA is beautiful, possibly better looking than the old MacBook Air, in case it\u2019s not apparent from the spun metal glare on its all-metal finish.",
    "Those concentric circles flowing outward from the Asus logo? They\u2019re just as stunning in real life as they are in our photos. And, the smooth lines around the edge are even more apparent. The icing on the cake, though, is that you\u2019re saving money by going with a ZenBook. The MacBook Air is pricier while containing older hardware.",
    "Before you\u2019ve even booted it up, the packaging is elegant. Unlike a lot of laptops, this one is worthy of an unboxing video.",
    "Upon lifting the lid of the laptop, the message \u2018In Search of Incredible\u2019 appears, engraved on the inner lid, which is a nice touch. There\u2019s a noticeable absence of plastic and cable ties, too. Of course, the MacBook Air 2017 still comes in first when it comes to the charger, as it\u2019s one of the few machines still using the fantastic MagSafe charger \u2013 though the new MacBook Air doesn\u2019t. The Asus ZenBook UX310UA, however, settles for an L-shaped plug, but it does the job.",
    "In regards to ports, the Asus ZenBook UX310UA has more than enough. Along the left side of the computer, you\u2019ll see that round charging socket, a USB 3.0, HDMI, USB-C and a headphone jack with an integrated microphone socket.",
    "The right side has two USB 2.0 ports, an SD card reader and a couple of lights, one for the hard drive and the other to indicate that it\u2019s actually on, or if the battery is charging.",
    "It\u2019s unfortunate that the two USB inputs on the right aren\u2019t 3.0 like the one on the left, but it\u2019s appreciated that a USB-C port was included.",
    "Also, the USB 3.0 port on the left-hand side of the device supports USB Charger + technology, letting you quick charge external devices even when it\u2019s off or hibernating. The Asus ZenBook UX310UA features software that can control the laptops\u2019 battery when using this functionality.",
    "Comparing it to the competition, the Asus ZenBook UX310UA is mostly in the same league. It\u2019s not quite as slim as the 2017 Macbook Air which is 1.7cm, while the laptop we reviewed here is 1.84cm and undeniably is without the tapered end.",
    "Lenovo\u2019s Ideapad 710S has similar specs and is slimmer but has a poorer screen. HP\u2019s Spectre x360 is also thinner but its starting price starts at \u00a31,199 ($1,049, AU$2,299).",
    "In order to keep the price down, Asus did increase the thickness, but kept the build quality high. A fair bargain in our eyes.",
    "The Asus ZenBook UX310UA isn\u2019t just good-looking, it also has a beautiful screen. We were given the QHD 3,200 x 1,800 configuration to test, but it\u2019s also available with a full-HD 1,920 x 1,080 panel.",
    "This QHD panel is a splendor to behold, too. With wide-viewing angles, and Anti-Glare that functions as publicized, it\u2019s hard to find much to complain about.",
    "You won\u2019t see much in the way of edge burn when the screen is blacked out, and the colors are well-defined, deep and look brilliant. This screen could work for photographers on the move, thanks to its color accuracy.",
    "And, if we were to put it up against the Macbook Air, at the same price point you most definitely wouldn't be getting a Retina screen. If we have one criticism, the bezel is a little larger than we would prefer, but it\u2019s not too obtrusive.",
    "At first, we thought the keyboard didn\u2019t quite make the cut, as typing causes a slightly disorientating bend in the center. However, the bend doesn\u2019t affect the usability, as once we adjusted to it, it\u2019s a perfectly functioning mechanism with low noise and reliable keys. But you may need to give it time to adjust if you're used to rock-solid keyboards.",
    "Likewise with the trackpad, it took a bit of setup and getting used to. The pinch zoom sadly doesn\u2019t work well, as it would often get set off while using two-finger scrolling.",
    "In the end we had to turn off the zoom and just turn to keyboard shortcuts. Not an ideal solution, but we prefer to be able to use the two-finger scroll and can live without pinch zoom. The pad itself feels a little slippery compared with others. But again, this is not a deal breaker and these annoyances are fixable.",
