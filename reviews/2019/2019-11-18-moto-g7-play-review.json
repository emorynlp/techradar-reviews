  "verdict": "Pocketable, affordable, zippy in day-to-day use - the Moto G7 Play may be a budget phone - and it isn\u2019t built for gaming, despite its name - but it bears all the hallmarks of a four-star device. It delivers great battery life, gives you access to tons of apps, and it offers value for money that can argue away most of its shortcomings.",
  "pros": [
    "Great battery life",
    "Runs Android 9",
    "Front speaker"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No case in the box",
    "Occasional gaming lag",
    "No NFC"

    "Motorola\u2019s G-series has been a poster child for budget done right over the years, and 2019 is no exception.",
    "The Moto G7 Play, announced alongside the G7 Power, G7 and G7 Plus, is the most affordable of the four, packing most of their specs and design advantages at the lowest price.",
    "The budget phone's main competition comes from the Nokia 3.1 Plus, a very comparably specced phone, and the slightly cheaper Nokia 3.1 and Honor 8A.",
    "Where the G7 Play stands out is power - it\u2019s the only phone in its price-range to feature the new Qualcomm 632 processor, as found in the rest of the G7 line. It also sports 32GB storage and microSD card support up to 512GB.",
    "So, while it\u2019s definitely a budget smartphone, given the heritage of the Moto G line and the specs on offer, we\u2019ve got high hopes for this Moto.",
    "The Moto G7 Play is the cheapest device in a range that's not exactly expensive already - it'll only set you back $200 (\u00a3149, AU$270).",
    "That means it's actually launching at a cheaper price point than the G6 Play did, which started at $199.99 (\u00a3179.99, AU$329).",
    "It has been available since March 1, 2019 from a range of carriers and stores, with the phone being made available on-contract, SIM Free or with a Pay As You Go SIM card.",
    "With its 5.7-inch screen, the Moto G7 Play is the smallest of the G7 family, but still manages to deliver enough size to provide a comfortable viewing, typing, and swiping experience.",
    "When looking at the specs of the G7 Play, its 2GB RAM does set off alarm bells, which could be reflected in mediocre or even poor gaming and multi-tasking performance. Most of the competition runs with 3GB RAM, but in the same breath, most of the competition also packs less fresh internals.",
    "The brand new Snapdragon 632 chipset should be able to deliver respectable performance, and it supports expandable storage by up to 512GB, supplementing the 32GB onboard storage space.",
    "Running Android 9, the user interface is as up to date as we could hope for too, and the combination of a stock Android UI, matched with a few, fun Moto actions - karate chop to launch the torch, for example - is welcome.",
    "The G7 Play is slender at 8.1mm thin, fits great in the hand and the HD+ screen has an aspect ratio of 19:9, so it\u2019s longer than your average phone. As for its battery, with 3,000mAh inside, it\u2019s all looking promising.",
    "Fire up its 13MP camera and before you can even critique the photo quality, you have to tip your hat to Motorola for getting so many shooting modes on a budget phone. Ranging from full manual mode to spot color picker, the G7 Play is set up for victory.",
    "The Moto G7 Play looks and feels good, is well weighted and slim - but its design definitely won\u2019t delight or inspire you.",
    "Unlike the rest of the G7 range, there\u2019s no soft plastic protective case in the box, and we\u2019re okay with this. The textured plastic back sports a concentric circle pattern and is resilient to scratches - much more so than the high-gloss finish of the likes of the G7 Power and Huawei P Smart 2019 for example.",
    "At 8.1mm thick and 168g, the G7 Play is relatively light, slender and comfortable to hold - but its clumsy bezels and utilitarian feel prevent it from ever feeling sleek per se.",
    "The phone\u2019s solid plastic frame is still comfortably curved, as too is the back plastic panel. Easy to grip, difficult to slip, it\u2019s definitely a practically constructed smartphone. We mentioned the textured finish on the back - that's only interrupted by the easy to reach fingerprint scanner and a large, round camera surround that protrudes slightly.",
    "As for the front, the Moto G7 Play\u2019s 5.7-inch screen has a hefty border and an even chunkier chin that\u2019s loaded up with a Motorola logo. Up top, you can find what could be the most substantial notch we\u2019ve seen to date, which houses the loudspeaker, front LED light, and the selfie camera.",
    "This is the first \u2018Play\u2019 series Moto G to pack a USB-C port, which can be found on the phone\u2019s bottom side - an excellent step in the right direction when it comes to future-proofing.",
    "The dual-SIM tray slot is on the left, and the phone can take two nano SIM cards and a microSD card simultaneously. Meanwhile, the volume and power buttons are to the right. As for the headphone jack, it\u2019s up on the topside.",
    "The Moto G7 Play is available in three color options: Black, Blue and Gold, all with the same textured plastic finish. Ultimately, while the design doesn\u2019t inspire or delight, it does the job and does it well.",
    "The G7 Play\u2019s HD display measures 5.7 inches and shines brightly. It\u2019s a long screen thanks to the fact it sports a 19:9 aspect ratio, and it sports an iPhone-esque notch but unlike other widescreen smartphones like the light on bezels Honor 10 Lite, the Play isn\u2019t as edge-to-edge, an experience.",
    "With a resolution of 720 x 1512 pixels, its screen is exactly what we\u2019d expect at the price, going toe to toe with the likes of the Nokia 3.1 Plus and the Honor 8A, and looking as sharp as you'll likely need it to be.",
    "The phone\u2019s screen is bright for a budget phone too, off-angle viewing is good, and it\u2019s easy to see the screen in all but the sunniest conditions.",
    "Onto the notch, and, well, we don\u2019t really get it. That isn\u2019t to say we don\u2019t get notches in general - but we specifically don\u2019t get this one.",
    "It\u2019s super-wide, likely because it houses a flash, front-speaker and camera, so either side, there\u2019s only room for a couple of bits of information. As you can see from the image below - any notifications other than Gmail alerts appear as an all encompassing dot.",
    "There\u2019s a fix - jump into the settings, activate Developer Mode, then select \u2018Hide\u2019 from the sub menu titled \u2018Cutout\u2019. This completely hides the notch and creates an artificial border, but is a total hack. Part of us wishes Moto just went G6 Play and Pixel 3 style and kept the Play notch free.",
    "Get past the that though, and it\u2019s all good for the price. The LCD tech reproduces colors nicely, there are a bunch of calibration settings so you can change saturation levels and color profiles, and you can activate a blue light filter to keep your sleep patterns protected from all that screen staring."
