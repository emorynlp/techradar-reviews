    "When you hear the word \u2018television\u2019, your mind probably conjures a black rectangle hanging from a wall or sat on a stand, only springing to life once it's switched on.",
    "The Bang & Olufsen Beovision Harmony, comprising a 77-inch OLED and integrated sound system, does things a little differently. Actually, a lot differently. Following in the footsteps of LG and Samsung with their efforts to make a TV live more seamlessly within its surroundings, the Beovision Harmony offers an opulent, transforming sound system as part of its package. It is impressive both mechanically and visually \u2013 but it comes at an audacious price, with some of its components available more affordably elsewhere.",
    "Launching in October 2019, the Beovision Harmony TV and speaker system will retail together for \u20ac18,500, which at the time of writing roughly converts to $20,780 / \u00a315,945 / AU$29,245 / AED 76,500.",
    "If you\u2019re familiar with the Bang & Olufsen brand, you\u2019ll know that eye-catching design ideas are central to its premium-price-tag-pushing ethos. Take its curvy Beosound Edge speaker, for instance, or its wall mounted Beosound Shape speakers. So what makes the Beovision Harmony stand out from the crowd?",
    "That\u2019d be the way its screen integrates with its built-in sound system. It\u2019s not unusual these days for a TV to offset the sonic limitations of a flatscreen design by including a built in soundbar \u2013 the Philips 8804, for instance, uses a Bowers and Wilkins sound system, while the upcoming Panasonic GZ2000 features upfiring Dolby Atmos speakers in its casing.",
    "Bang & Olufsen\u2019s approach is far more theatrical. Its sound system comes in two 'wings' \u2013 front-firing speaker panels that sit on a mechanical component that allows them to move as the TV boots up and switches off. When powered down, they sit vertically, coming together as a square, hiding the majority of the screen away and letting them be used solely for audio. Turn the TV on and they rotate away from each other, sitting parallel to the bottom edge of the TV screen, which rises to meet a comfortable eye level when placed on the floor.",
    "It\u2019s a wonderfully choreographed motion, taking 15 or so seconds to complete, and has an effect similar to watching the curtains peel away at a theater. It\u2019s also achieved silently \u2013 there\u2019s no whirr or cranking as the pieces swivel into position, with the mechanism good for \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of operations, according to a Bang & Olufsen representative. It\u2019s best seen in motion \u2013 take a look at the video embedded in the tweet below for a better idea of how it looks in action:",
    "The Beovision Harmony will be available in either an oak wood and aluminium style, or a 'Grey Melange' fabric and aluminium look. Both can work with either a floor stand or wall bracket.",
    "Whether the look suits your taste will be entirely subjective, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s an ambitious design. Bang & Olusfen has aimed to blur the line between interior decorating piece and consumer tech product, and to our eyes it has done that well. But it also comes at a staggering price that will put it well out of reach of most consumers, despite the fact that its central display is based off an LG OLED TV design that, in the context of the Beovision Harmony, is relatively affordable by comparison.",
    "Which brings us nicely onto that display. It\u2019s gorgeous \u2013 but that\u2019s as you\u2019d expect, as it\u2019s essentially the LG C9 OLED screen, the company\u2019s 2019 flagship (barring the bells and whistles of its rollable OLED or 'Wallpaper' sets).",
    "You get then the deep, dark blacks, rich contrast levels, vibrant colors and HDR dazzle of a top-flight OLED, along with some of the latest advancements from LG\u2019s Alpha 9 processing engine. This includes an 'AI' picture mode that automatically optimises the image based on a growing database of scenes it\u2019s aware of, an ambient light sensor that also adjusts the tone mapping curve to ensure you don\u2019t get a washed-out image when in brighter lighting conditions, and a color banding softener that makes for a less noisy image as it steps through gradients of tones, to name just a few tools working under the hood. It\u2019s impressive as a result.",
    "But for some context, the LG C9 when sold separately is set to retail at a more affordable $6,999 / \u00a37,499 (around AU$9,800). If you\u2019re sold on the picture quality alone, and aren\u2019t on the market for a sound system, that may be a more frugal option to consider.",
    "Having said that, much of the appeal here lies with that transforming sound system, and it\u2019s also where Bang & Olufsen\u2019s engineers have most made their mark on the performance of LG\u2019s set. Even beyond the striking moving pieces, there\u2019s a booming power to the Beovision Harmony\u2019s audio output that you won\u2019t find on a standard C9.",
    "Taking what the company has learnt from the Beovision Eclipse, and finding space for the improved midrange drivers that sit inside its Beolab 50 standing speakers, Bang & Olufsen\u2019s screen\u2019s sound system pumps out 450 watts across a three-channel array, each with their own amp.",
    "As a result, there\u2019s a depth and musicality to the Beovision Harmony that you won\u2019t find present in screens that don\u2019t feature a discrete sound system. Bang & Olufsen\u2019s DSP also features a bass management system and a built-in surround sound decoder, designed to work with Bang & Olufsen\u2019s wireless speaker gear such as the Beolab 18, Beolab 50 and Beolab 90. You can hook up as many as eight of these wireless speakers with the set, with the Beovision Harmony capable of decoding 7.1 surround sound.",
    "All connected audio devices can be controlled by the aluminium Beoremote One remote that comes with the TV, and it\u2019s worth remembering that, when the screen is in \u2018standby\u2019 and the speakers are folded, the Harmony can be used as a standalone audio system. AirPlay 2, Chromecast and Bluetooth connectivity are all included, and a portion of the dormant screen\u2019s display will be dedicated to track metadata \u2013 unique to the Bang & Olufsen build of LG\u2019s panel.",
    "As for interface, the screen shares LG\u2019s improved webOS 4.5 UI, which puts cards of apps in a row along the bottom edge of the screen, offering up contextual content as you hover over an application. LG\u2019s screen also supports Alexa and Google Assistant voice control \u2013 but we\u2019ll have to confirm if this remains the case with the Beovision Harmony. We\u2019ll update the piece as soon as we find out.",
    "If your interior decor is as important to your movie viewing habits as the quality of the screen itself, and if you\u2019ve the space for a Scandi-styled 77-inch monster, the Bang & Olufsen Beovision Harmony will look very attractive to you.",
    "It\u2019s TV-as-talking point, a piece of ostentatious industrial design that you can\u2019t help but gawp at, that thankfully delivers on the visual and audio fronts too.",
    "However, it comes at an incredible cost, and if you\u2019re to shop around for the separate LG C9 screen and a fully fledged home cinema system, you\u2019ll likely be able to get a similar viewing experience (minus the Optimus Prime transforming routine, of course) at a much more affordable price.",
