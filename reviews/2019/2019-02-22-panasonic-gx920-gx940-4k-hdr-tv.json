  "verdict": "The GX920 is thrilling in a lot of ways, with its wide HDR format support, wide 75-inch screen, and brand-new HCX Pro chip making a case for Panasonic\u2019s LCD flagship, but none of these features really help it stand out either.",
  "pros": [
    "HDR10+ and Dolby Vision",

    "The Panasonic GX920 occupies a strange place in the company\u2019s 2019 TV range. Panasonic has made no secret of its aim to move high-end consumers (or \u2018prosumers\u2019 as they\u2019re known) towards OLED displays rather than LCD, and the four OLED TVs announced for this year show a general move away from their cheaper (and less visually impressive) alternatives.",
    "Labelled the GX920 in the UK, and GX940 across the EU and Canada, this 4K HDR television is the highest-spec LCD from Panasonic this year, and will only be available in a massive 75 inches \u2013 for the TV enthusiasts wanting something big, something capable, but which won\u2019t cost the same several thousand pounds as the average OLED television. (Price is still unconfirmed though.)",
    "Ahead of its launch around June, we\u2019ve run through our first impressions of the GX920 smart TV after getting our eyes on the 4K HDR set for the first time.",
    "What makes the GX920 slightly simpler is that it only ships in one size. This 75-inch TV will take up space, for sure \u2013 full dimensions come in at 1,680 x 1,046 x 413 mm \u2013 but you\u2019re also getting a massive, impactful display that\u2019s bound to impress in any living room that has room for it.",
    "The body of the GX920 is supported by a four-pronged stand that may take up more space than some, but is likely needed to balance such a large-scale screen. Otherwise the silhouette is near-identical to Panasonic\u2019s OLED sets, albeit with a slightly thicker panel.",
    "So far we\u2019ve only seen it in a slightly uninspiring silver-gray, with a metal bezel hugged by a dark plastic casing at the rear.",
    "In terms of audio, you\u2019re getting a pretty standard 20W (2x10W) speaker built into the rear. The drivers are compatible with Dolby Atmos, though you\u2019ll need some additional surround sound speakers if you really want to get a real home cinema experience. (For comparison, Panasonic\u2019s OLED range ship with 50W speakers as standard.)",
    "As Panasonic\u2019s flagship LCD, it\u2019s interesting to see how the GX920 fares against the higher-end OLED televisions.",
    "In terms of color contrast or black levels, the comparison doesn\u2019t seem fair \u2013 those are OLED's strong points, after all. But the inclusion of the same HCX Pro Intelligent Processor as the 2019 OLEDs should mean similar frame rates, motion handling and color processing, even if the quality of the panel itself varies between the sets.",
    "This is still a 4K UHD television \u2013 with a UHD Premium stamp of approval \u2013 and you can expect a high level of visual detail, with the HDR capability to make those extra pixels really pop with color. You\u2019d expect a high-end LCD television to feature a full-array backlight, too \u2013 for maximum precision control over the levels of brightness across the screen \u2013 but Panasonic has opted for a cheaper edge-lit panel here instead.",
    "There may be an element of not wanting the LCD panel to compete too well with the OLED sets on offer, but it means that the TV\u2019s brightness isn\u2019t as consistent across the display. While the GX920\u2019s specs claim to feature \u2018local dimming\u2019, it\u2019s going to be a good deal less precise on an edge-lit panel, where light is shot out of the bottom of the set instead of evenly across the back of the panel.",
    "Panasonic was one of the collaborators behind HDR10+, a premium HDR standard that uses \u2018dynamic metadata\u2019 to vary levels of contrast and brightness scene by scene during videos. As a direct competitor to the more widely used Dolby Vision, last year\u2019s Panasonic TVs attempted to get by with just its own product, and it wasn\u2019t exactly convenient for those wanting to watch all the high-quality video currently on the market.",
    "Thankfully Panasonic has relaxed slightly, and even a couple of LCD sets (the GX920 and GX800) will feature both Dolby Vision and HDR10+. That alongside Hybrid Log Gamma broadcasting (for dual SDR/HDR signals) and HLG Photo (for HDR photography) means that viewers have access to every commercially-available HDR standard on the market.",
    "The GX920 is thrilling in a lot of ways: its wide HDR format support, wide 75-inch screen, and brand-new HCX Pro chip making a case for Panasonic\u2019s LCD flagship.",
    "But none of these features really help it stand out either \u2013 especially in comparison to the far more fleshed-out OLED offerings like the GZ1000 or GZ1500, while the edge-lit panel might hold back what would otherwise be a set with a lot of potential. As ever, the price difference will be what makes or breaks the GX920 \u2013 and we\u2019ll keep this review updated as and when more information trickles in."
