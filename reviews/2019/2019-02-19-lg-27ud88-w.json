    "The way we look at it, the best monitors are the ones that manage to strike a golden balance between price and performance. The 27-inch, Ultra HD (UHD) LG 27UD88-W perfectly hits that goal \u2013 and flies past it.",
    "This is an incredibly color-accurate monitor that will be a huge hit for anyone that has to do any creative or photo work on a budget. It lacks some modern amenities, like a high refresh rate for gamers and HDR for entertainment all around, but what we get in return is a beautiful 4K Ultra HD monitor that anyone can afford.",
    "As time passes, the case to upgrade to a 4K (3,840 x 2,160) panel gets stronger and stronger. Not only do video providers, like Netflix and YouTube, offer a wealth of 4K content today, but modern graphics cards are evolving to play all the best PC games at this resolution with high frame rates and details.",
    "So, whether you\u2019re a gamer that\u2019s ready to test the water with 4K, or if you\u2019re a content creator looking to edit footage on a color-accurate display at native resolution, you\u2019re going to find a lot to love about the LG 27UD88-W.",
    "Normally, if you\u2019re looking to get a 4K panel with FreeSync and a high sRGB color gamut coverage, you\u2019d be looking at a moderately expensive monitor. However, that\u2019s not necessarily the case here.",
    "At $649 (about \u00a3490, AU$900), the LG 27UD88-W is, quite frankly, a bargain. When we first saw the price of this monitor, we had to do a double take to make sure we noted the model number right. While many monitors in this price range, like the Acer XB281HK feature higher refresh rates and lower response times, it\u2019s hard to find a panel with this level of color accuracy for a better price. And, given that it\u2019s not primarily a gaming monitor, that\u2019s a sacrifice worth making.",
    "If you\u2019re a graphic designer or creative professional, and you\u2019re looking for an affordable monitor that won\u2019t hold you back, you can\u2019t do much better at a lower price.",
    "Considering the manufacturer, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that the LG 27UD88 is an attractive display. With a white chassis and black bezels, the classy build belies the low cost of the device. It\u2019s not an unbelievably huge display, like the Dell UltraSharp UP3218K or an ultra-wide like the AOC Agon AG352UCG. But, with its 27-inch display and narrow bezels, it\u2019ll effortlessly blend in to any office environment.",
    "The screen attaches to the base effortlessly and toolessly and is easily detached via a convenient button so you can effortlessly switch mounting solutions; which you may, considering the Vesa compatibility. Once it is attached, you can tilt, raise, lower and rotate the monitor 90 degrees for portrait mode. However, for whatever reason you can\u2019t swivel the display along the Y\u2019 axis. Considering that it can move effortlessly in other directions, this restriction doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Instead, if you want to turn the display, you\u2019ll have to turn the entire unit, base included. It\u2019s an inelegant problem in an otherwise high-quality build.",
    "The LG 27UD88 keeps a low profile, thanks to its slim bezels, but the lack of buttons helps contribute to its low input. On the bottom of the monitor, you\u2019ll find just one little nub that\u2019s used to control the on-screen menu, and that\u2019s it \u2013 both volume and inputs are also controlled with this control stick. Around the back, you\u2019ll find an alcove that contains all the ports on offer: three USB ports, one DisplayPort, an audio output, HDMI and a USB-C port.",
    "We feel like this is an acceptable array of inputs, but we would have liked to see a more accessible headphone jack, if for nothing other than convenience.",
    "For the money you\u2019re spending here, the LG 27UD88 looks better than it needs to, and should be the perfect addition to your setup, whether you\u2019re a creative or even if you\u2019re an everyday user with a clean aesthetic.",
    "The LG 27UD88 has a gorgeous IPS panel at 3,840 x 2,160 and covers a whopping 99% of the sRGB color space. That would be enough to carve out a win in our book, but in reality it\u2019s even sweeter.",
    "The panel is factory calibrated, so we don\u2019t have to screw around in the menus to get the perfect image. Instead, we are able to just plug it in and get to work.",
    "And, as we\u2019ve already hinted at a few times before, this monitor is at its best in creative workloads. We found ourselves hunting across the internet for RAW photos to mess around with in Photoshop. Even other productivity tasks, like word processing or web browsing, take advantage of this bright, colorful display that makes content pop.",
    "But, the LG 27UD88 supports AMD\u2019s FreeSync technology, so it should be able to game, right? Well, once you swear to yourself to ignore the game modes -- color accuracy and black levels take a hit. This probably gives an advantage in competitive games, but the hit to image quality just isn\u2019t worth it. However, even with the out-of-the-box screen settings you\u2019d be surprised at how beautiful games look on the LG 27UD88.",
    "Rather than playing something like Overwatch, which is better suited to lower resolution displays with high refresh rates, we decided to dive into The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to see what this monitor could do. And, running this game at max settings on a display that\u2019s this color accurate is a dream come true. Everything just comes alive.",
    "Yeah, the monitor could have a higher refresh rate, but at 4K, 60Hz is all you need \u2014 our RTX 2080 Ti was breaking a sweat hitting 60 frames per second with everything (including those fancy hair physics) maxed out.",
    "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have an AMD GPU on hand to test the monitor\u2019s FreeSync compatibility, but previous implementations indicate the feature only serves to boost the value of this display even further \u2014 assuming you have the hardware to run games at 4K resolution",
    "The LG 27UD88-W is flat-out one of the best monitors on the market, from a pure price to performance perspective. Are there better-looking monitors out there? Absolutely. Are there more affordable 4K displays? Most definitely. However, you\u2019re not going to find a 4K panel with this degree of color accuracy at a lower price \u2013 especially not one that\u2019s factory calibrated.",
    "Whether you\u2019re a creative looking to save a buck, or a gamer looking for an affordable segue into 4K, there\u2019s a lot to love about the LG 27UD88, and very little to complain about. With that, it\u2019s extremely easy to recommend the LG 27UD88 because pretty much any enthusiast or professional could fall in love with it.",
