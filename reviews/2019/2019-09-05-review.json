    "The Acer Swift 7 2019 is a flagship Ultrabook that is so thin and light it makes other slimline laptops feel incredibly clunky. Last year\u2019s iteration was already the thinnest laptop in the world, and it\u2019s no surprise that the latest model continues that winning streak.",
    "Seriously \u2013 it\u2019s rather rare that when we unbox a new laptop for review, we promptly pass it around the office for people to feel, but the Acer Swift 7 2019 is so sleek and light that you really need to get your hands on it to actually appreciate what Acer has accomplished here.",
    "However, while fashioning an unbelievably thin and feathery laptop is undoubtedly impressive, last year\u2019s model proves that laptops require more than just a svelte design to win over customers. In our review of the previous model, we valued the size and weight, but it just came with too many downsides.",
    "This year\u2019s model, on the other hand, seems like it could fix a lot of the issues we had with last year\u2019s edition. If it does \u2013 then Acer will truly have a hit on its hands.",
    "As a flagship Ultrabook that\u2019s furnished with some of the latest mobile tech in an extremely thin body, you should be ready to spend a chunk of change \u2013 and it\u2019s a doozy at $1,699.99 (about \u00a31,300, AU$2,400).",
    "For that price, the Swift 7 is fitted with 8GB of DDR3 memory and a 256GB PCIe SSD, as well as an 8th-generation Intel Core i7-8500Y processor and a 14-inch, Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) touchscreen.",
    "Now, that is quite a price tag, which is significantly higher than its competitors like the Dell XPS 13, Asus ZenBook 3 and even the 13-inch MacBook Pro. These are some of the best laptops in the world, so Acer will need to put it all on the line for the Swift 7 (2019) to compete.",
    "While it definitely comes with a premium price, it is at least no more expensive than the Swift 7 of 2018, which means you get updated components and a refreshed design without shelling out more cash. Still, as we mentioned in our review of the 2018 model, the high price tag isn\u2019t entirely justified. Sure, it\u2019s the thinnest laptop on the market, but how much are you really willing to spend to trim off a few milliliters and grams?",
    "Far and away the chief selling point of the Acer Swift 7 is the astoundingly slim and light design. Now, you may think your current laptop is thin and light, but we can guarantee it won\u2019t be as svelte as the latest Acer Swift 7. This device is exceptionally lean, and you really need to see (and feel) this laptop to truly appreciate it.",
    "At just 12.51 inches (317.9mm) wide and 7.53 inches (191.5mm) deep, Acer has somehow managed to cut the depth by almost 20%. While it is slightly thicker than last year\u2019s model at 0.39 inches (9.95mm) \u2013 but that\u2019s still extraordinarily thin.",
    "Acer has somehow decreased the overall size of this year\u2019s Swift 7 by making the screen bezels as thin as possible, which brings the laptop\u2019s screen-to-body ratio to an impressive 92%.",
    "This means Acer has removed the webcam from the top of the screen. It doesn\u2019t mean the webcam has been totally removed, however, only moved to the lower half of the device.",
    "On the top-left corner of the bottom of the Swift 7, just above the keyboard, is a small rectangle. Push it down and the webcam pops up. It\u2019s a pretty good way to slim down the size of the Swift 7 without completely losing the webcam.",
    "The webcam itself is a 720p offering with super high dynamic range (SHDR) imaging. So, it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s been much sacrificing with the repositioning of the camera when it comes to hardware \u2013 and it looks decent enough when used to video call. However, its positioning does mean it records at a rather unflattering angle, looking up rather than straight at you.",
    "This isn\u2019t an angle many people will enjoy \u2013 we\u2019re not fans. In fact, there was enough of an outcry when Dell moved the webcam of the XPS 13 to a similar position that the company eventually reverted it back.",
    "So, you\u2019ll have to think about how essential the angle of the webcam is to you. If you do a lot of video calls and you\u2019re not a fan of people looking up at your nose, then this might be a reason to avoid the new Swift 7. However, for many other people, this may be a reasonable trade-off to get such a compact laptop.",
    "One thing we noted is that if you push the camera down during a video call, the webcam doesn\u2019t turn off. Instead, it just shows a blackened screen while the camera still records. So, while it does offer you some privacy, we\u2019d rather the camera turn off completely.",
    "Because of the svelte design, there\u2019s not much room for ports, so the Acer Swift 7 only comes with two USB-C ports on the right-hand side, and an audio jack port on the left. It\u2019s reasonable that ports are going to be left behind to keep the size of the laptop down, and USB-C is at least pretty versatile as ports go \u2013 and they can double up as a charging port as well.",
    "It\u2019s a nice touch that Acer has added a USB-C adapter as well, and it includes a standard USB port, USB-C and HDMI port. Its small enough to carry around with you, and we like the fact that it\u2019s included for free, where many of the Swift 7\u2019s competitors don\u2019t follow suit.",
    "One hitch we found is that by placing both USB-C ports on the right-hand side of the laptop, you don\u2019t have a choice of where to plug in the charger. This can make it a bit awkward if the power adapter needs to be plugged in to a socket on the other side.",
    "In regards to the screen, it\u2019s touch-enabled with Corning Gorilla Glass 6 to protect it. The full HD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution is a bit on the low-end these days, especially when considering the price. However, you could argue that you don\u2019t need much higher resolution on a compact 14-inch screen.",
    "It also meets 100% of the sRGB color gamut, which means colors are both rich and accurate. The screen is also pretty bright at 400 nits, and the touchscreen is great and responsive.",
    "Because of the size of the Acer Swift 7, the keyboard isn\u2019t the biggest. However, to be fair, most of the keys are a decent size so they don\u2019t feel too difficult to press, even if you\u2019re a fast typer. There are a few keys \u2013 like Esc and Caps Lock \u2013 that were shrunk to fit in the Swift 7\u2019s small form factor, so keep in mind that these can be a little more difficult to use.",
    "The thinness of the Swift 7 also means that key travel \u2013 which is the amount of distance the keys sink when pressed \u2013 is very shallow. This means they don\u2019t feel as tactile as other keyboards, and it might take some adjusting to \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re coming from a desktop PC. But, like the lack of ports and repositioned webcam, these are all compromises made to get such a remarkably thin laptop.",
    "The trackpad has also been upgraded over last year\u2019s model. One of our biggest issues about the 2018 Swift 7 model was the clickless trackpad, which essentially meant you could only tap on the trackpad, not press it down to mirror a mouse click.",
    "While this allowed Acer to trim off even more thickness from the Swift 7 2018, it also meant that the trackpad lacked any kind of physical response when clicking and selecting items in Windows 10. It also made selecting something, then scrolling with the trackpad \u2013 just as you would when dragging and dropping files \u2013 much harder.",
    "So, we\u2019re happy that the trackpad on the Swift 7 2019 brings that click back. It makes it that much more comfortable \u2013 not to mention, much easier \u2013 to use. And, while it means this year\u2019s model is slightly thicker than last year\u2019s, we think this is unquestionably the right move by Acer.",
