  "summary": "A basic multicooker for small portions",
  "verdict": "It may not compete with the larger models on the market, but Lakeland\u2019s Mini MultiCooker is worth considering if you\u2019re short on space but still want the benefits of a multicooker.",
  "pros": [
    "Compact",
    "Ideal for making 1-2 portions",
    "Bakes cakes and proves bread"

    "Looking for one of the best Instant Pot alternatives that won\u2019t take up all of your kitchen surface? While it might feel like the world of multi-cookers, which combine pressure cooking and slow cooking in one device, only caters for families the size of the Waltons, we decided to take Lakeland\u2019s Mini Multicooker for a spin, and see if slow cooking for one can be a viable option.",
    "After all, why pay out for a blimp-sized machine when you don\u2019t need to batch cook or perhaps don\u2019t have a freezer? Lakeland\u2019s Mini machine strips it back to the bare essentials in a small, compact model. Does it still deliver on convenience? Let\u2019s find out.",
    "The Lakeland Mini Multi Cooker is available to buy for \u00a349.99 from the Lakeland website, as well as Amazon; it's currently only available in the UK, but that price works out at around $65 / AU$95 based on current conversion rates.",
    "That's relatively cheap compared to the likes of the Crock-Pot CSC024 5.6L Digital Slow and Multi Cooker, which will set you back \u00a3119.99 / $155 / AU$225 \u2013 it is a lot bigger than the 1.8L Lakeland Mini though.",
    "The mini multicooker has eight programs, but it\u2019s not possible to saut\u00e9 or sear with this pot, so you would need to start items like soups in a separate pan before bringing the ingredients together. It might not look like the slickest, but we like the white model and easy-to-read LED display.",
    "We were excited by the promise of making cake in a multicooker, but Lakeland\u2019s instructions recommend only using pre-mixed ingredients, and as the capacity is so small at 1.8L, only half a packet of cake mix at a time. Again, that needn\u2019t be a bad thing if living alone, but it\u2019s worth considering before purchase.",
    "Whether you opt for the Lakeland Mini Multi Cooker 1.8L depends on the kind of food you\u2019re making on a regular basis, and if a rice cooker is top on your list, this cooker achieves that, plus yoghurt, grains, casseroles and cake.",
    "Be extra cautious with the capacity \u2013 it\u2019s intended to hold the volume of food when cooked. The 1.8 liter (1.9 quarts) inner pot cooks up to 4 cups of food, and gets full quick.",
    "This isn\u2019t a slow cooker for a big family. We filled it beneath the maximum capacity level for cooking rice, and the vent overflowed, causing rice water to pour out onto the kitchen surface. It was admittedly worrying seeing steam and liquid escape from the model through overfilling it, but if you\u2019re careful not to do that, it seems like a very safe model to use.",
    "This cooker is efficient at cooking rice, porridge and quinoa quickly, and at the other end of the timing spectrum, it\u2019s possible to set the \u2018slow cook\u2019 program to up to eight hours. We liked the fact the cooking times can be adjusted \u2013 this isn\u2019t an option with many other cheaper models.",
    "Despite the capacity concerns, this multicooker is incredibly easy to use and will fit into most kitchens (or kitchen cupboards when not in use). If you\u2019re living alone or without a freezer, this would be a great machine for casseroles and stews without any waste.",
    "Unlike cheaper slow cookers, this model has a \u2018keep warm\u2019 mode, which it switches into after the majority of its cooking programs (apart from the \u2018yoghurt\u2019 setting), meaning you could set a dish to slow cook and it would have it ready and warm for you after a day at work.",
    "A non-stick cooking pot and inner lid are removable and can go straight in the washing up, making it easier to clean that the larger models we reviewed.",
    "For the relatively low number of programmable options, the price quite high. However, considering the \u2018keep warm\u2019 and \u2018slow cook\u2019 modes can be adjusted, there\u2019s more to play with here than models \u00a310 to \u00a320 cheaper.",
    "The Lakeland Mini Multi Cooker 1.8L is a great multicooker for people living alone, and if you\u2019re short on space. It can be easily packed away and stored and brought out when needed.",
    "You won\u2019t be able to batch cook with this model, but if rice, grains, yoghurt and porridge make up a big part of your diet, you\u2019d get enough use out of it to justify the price.",
    "There aren't that many programmable options when you consider the price, but it's cheaper than much of the competition; and with helpful 'keep warm' and 'slow cook' modes, it could be well worth choosing this multicooker over less expensive models."
