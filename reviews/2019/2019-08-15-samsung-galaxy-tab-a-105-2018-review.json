  "summary": "Samsung\u2019s newest budget tablet",
  "verdict": "While the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.5 (2018) offers an Android alternative to an iPad, it\u2019s a much weaker tablet you\u2019re getting \u2013 it\u2019s slower to use, less ergonomic, and can\u2019t run operations very well.",
  "pros": [
    "Low price point",
    "Headphone jack",
    "Long battery life"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Slow to use",
    "Bulky design",
    "Android still isn\u2019t great on tablets"

    "While Samsung is one of the smartphone market leaders thanks to its innovative and high-tech handsets, it\u2019s one of the most popular tablet manufacturers simply because there isn\u2019t much competition; Samsung competes with Apple simply by offering cheaper but less polished slates, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab A series is emblematic of these devices.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Tab A series are what you consider when you want a cheap tablet and won\u2019t consider Apple\u2019s pricier budget iPads, like the iPad Mini (2019), but don\u2019t want to stoop so low as to consider Amazon\u2019s cheap but cheerful slates, like the Amazon Fire HD 10.",
    "The most recent tablet in the range, the Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2018), is one of Samsung\u2019s biggest and priciest Tab A slates \u2013 not that \u2018priciest\u2019 is saying much \u2013 so does that mean you\u2019re getting a higher-end tablet at a still-affordable price, or does it defeat the whole object of Samsung\u2019s strategy?",
    "You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2018) in most countries right now \u2013 except Australia. Sorry, Australians, but we\u2019ll keep you updated if that changes. Other Galaxy A tabs are available there, including the 8-inch and 10.1-inch variants.",
    "There are two versions of the Galaxy Tab A 10.5: one that only connects via Wi-Fi, which will cost you $329 / \u00a3249 (about AU$470), and another that adds LTE connectivity, which will set you back $419 / \u00a3299 (about AU$600).",
    "For comparison, you can pick up the iPad 9.7 (2018) for $329 / \u00a3319 / AU$469 for a Wi-Fi model and $459 / \u00a3449 / AU$669 for LTE, so in terms of budget that\u2019s one of the Galaxy Tab A 10.5\u2019s closest competitors, as it\u2019s the most affordable iPad.",
    "You can also pick up the Amazon Fire HD 10 for $150 / \u00a3150 (around AU$195), which has a similar screen size, but is a very different prospect in other ways \u2013 check out the \u2018Competition\u2019 section of this review to find out how.",
    "There\u2019s a reason that tablets are also called \u2018slates\u2019, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2018) embodies it more so than most similar devices, with Apple and Amazon finding ways to make their devices look distinct.",
    "We\u2019ll get into the display in more detail in the Display section, but it takes up just over 75% of the front of the tablet; the rest is chunky bezels on all sides of the screen, which house the front-facing camera at the top (when the tablet is held in portrait orientation).",
    "On the back of the tablet is its rear camera, including a flash. This back is made of plastic, giving the tablet a slightly \u2018cheap\u2019 feel, but you\u2019ll likely be using the tablet in a protective case or stand that will lend the device some needed protection.",
    "One annoyance design-wise is this rear camera \u2013 it\u2019s housed in a slight bump, so if you lay the Galaxy Tab A 10.5 on a surface it won\u2019t lie perfectly flat, and if you type the tablet will rock from side to side.",
    "Around the sides of the tablet you\u2019ll find the usual array of ports and buttons \u2013 a volume rocker and power button, USB-C port, and 3.5mm headphone jack.",
    "The Galaxy Tab A 10.5\u2019s dimensions of 260 x 161.1 x 8mm make it feel a little on the large side, and the 529g weight also feels a little much, but we found it fairly easy to get used to the big slate.",
    "This screen measures 10.5 inches diagonally (hence the \u201810.5\u2019 in the tablet\u2019s name), with LCD tech and a 1200 x 1920 resolution. That\u2019s not a particularly high resolution, so images on the display don\u2019t look very sharp. Colors also look a little pale and washed out, especially blacks \u2013 in short, it pales \u2013 literally\u2013 in comparison to most other tablet screens.",
    "There is one upside to LCD displays, in that there\u2019s a high level of brightness, so if you tend to use your tablet outside a lot then the Galaxy Tab A 10.5 might be a reasonable proposition \u2013 but generally the screen seems unimpressive, as you\u2019d expect from a budget slate.",
    "That said, if you\u2019re looking for a tablet to do work that requires very accurate colors, you\u2019re probably not looking this far down the tablet price range, and it\u2019s easy to forget the pale colors if you\u2019re engrossed in a good movie or online game.",
    "However, games and many apps often look a lot better with a nice vibrant color palette, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5 just doesn\u2019t provide this."
