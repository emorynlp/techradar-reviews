    "We have to hand it to Sony. We love when console manufacturers pack at least a very basic headset with each and every console they ship out. Microsoft did it for the Xbox 360 and then totally failed to follow through for the Xbox One, packing one only into specific models.",
    "That said, while we love the pack-in PS4 mono headset that serves as a gateway into the world to voice chat and audio playback, for most gamers it just doesn\u2019t cut it. But that\u2019s why Sony is introducing the sequel to 2014\u2019s PlayStation Gold Headset, the PlayStation Platinum Wireless Headset.",
    "So what\u2019s the difference between the two? Besides a slight style change, Sony\u2019s Platinum pair of cans are the first to offer 3D surround sound \u2013 it\u2019s like 7.1 virtual surround sound on steroids. It's not supported by every game, but when you find one that does, you'll appreciate its inclusion here.",
    "How do they compare to what's out there? Audio from games, movies and music comes through crystal clear \u2013 which was almost a given considering the Platinum\u2019s $159/\u00a3129/AU$259 price tag \u2013 but we were shocked just how well it worked compared to the third-party peripherals we were used to using.",
    "It's true that the Sony PlayStation Platinum Wireless Headset is getting a bit long in the tooth at this point (it was released back in 2017), but it remains one of the best headsets compatible with the PlayStation 4.",
    "When it first came out, this headset was expensive ($159/\u00a3129/AU$259) but has since dropped to a much more reasonable $117 in the US and \u00a3114 in the UK. Unfortunately Australia didn't catch a price break in the last few years, but could receive one during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
    "The Platinum Wireless is an interesting mix of plastic, metal and rubber. The top band consists of two metal bars that offer a lot of rigidity and hold the headset firmly in place. Beneath the top band is a rubber strap that cradles the top of the noggin, and then all the rest is plastic. The headphones fold up neatly, perfect if you need to take them with you, and are a medium weight \u2013 not too heavy, but not so light that they feel breakable, either. If you\u2019re looking for an exact number, the Platinum Headset weighs 318.2g.",
    "Finally, the earpads themselves are made from a comfortable pleather material that gets a bit warm after some use, but doesn\u2019t have a terrible amount of clamping force either. We found that we could wear the headphones for about two-hour increments before we had to take them off for a breather.",
    "On the debit side though, these are far from the most stylish-looking headphones we\u2019ve ever worn. The oversized earcups and double band bridge give it a sort of monstrous quality, like they were designed for a giant\u2019s head rather than regular people. That said, while the headphones work on mobile devices, they probably wouldn\u2019t be the pair of cans you\u2019d take to the gym or elsewhere and thus maybe the design won\u2019t bother you as much as it did us.",
    "The metal, plastic and pleather coalesce into a comfortable \u2013 if a bit obtuse \u2013 pair of cans.",
    "Sony\u2019s Platinum Headset is a surprisingly balanced piece of kit. The low-end comes on strong, but never overbearing, and it really shines with mids and highs. Listening to movies and music may not be the headset\u2019s intended purpose, but it\u2019s certainly no slouch in either of those areas. These actually make for a pretty good pair of replacement headphones if you want something to wear while just sitting on the couch watching the TV.",
    "In fact, dollar-for-dollar or pound-for-pound, it\u2019s tough to think of a headset that offers better value for your money. Generally speaking this is probably one of the best-sounding gaming headsets on the market today.",
    "Of course, that being said, there are headsets out there that offer more pronounced surround sound \u2013 one area that we felt the Platinum\u2019s could\u2019ve improved upon. Footsteps and gunfire imparted a general sense of directionality, but they didn\u2019t have the same precision on Sony\u2019s PlayStation Platinum as we\u2019ve heard on other headsets.",
    "That point changes slightly when you\u2019re playing a game that uses 3D surround sound instead of simulated 7.1 \u2013 again, Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End is the only one that offers it at the moment \u2013 and sound effects do have a better presence thanks to 3D Audio\u2019s ability to create \u201c100 virtual speakers\u201d.",
    "Playing through Drake\u2019s latest adventure with the Platinum headphones on gave the cinematic video experience a matching aural one similar what you\u2019d find at a movie theater. Obviously it wasn\u2019t as immersive as using a traditional 7.1 speaker setup, but the Platinum Headset did help us realize the level of detail the development team at Naughty Dog put into the game.",
    "Should you decide you want to go back to stereo sound, however, all you need to do is flip a switch on the right earcup and you\u2019ll drop back down to two-channel sound.",
    "In terms of microphone quality, friends that we spoke to all said that the sound quality was \u201cabove average\u201d \u2013 in part, we think, due to the noise-cancellation software Sony packed into the Platinum. It\u2019s unable to completely cancel out background noise (it can\u2019t cut out the noise of a dog barking, for example) but it does help reduce the ambient noise that some other headsets are known to pick up.",
    "Should you need to mute the headset at any time, or raise or lower the volume, you can find a row of skinny buttons along the outside rim of the left cup.",
    "Sony doesn\u2019t quote a target number for the headset\u2019s battery life, but if we had to do an estimate based on the time we\u2019ve used it, it\u2019s probably around the 12- to 14-hour mark. We were able to play on and off for an eight-hour period, and we barely dove past the two-thirds mark according to the PS4.",
    "Now, of course that might be different if you\u2019re using different audio levels (if, say, you like to listen to extremely loud audio) and are constantly chatting to friends, but for the average user it\u2019s fair to expect around a dozen hours before it\u2019s time to plug back in.",
    "Obviously one of the the headset\u2019s major selling points is its ability to go wireless but, should you decide to run it into a mobile device or your PlayStation VR, Sony includes a standard 3.5mm-to-3.5mm audio cable inside every box.",
    "Inside you\u2019ll also find a micro-USB cable, the wireless dongle and a soft cloth carrying pouch. The basic audio cable should allow you to plug it into any 3.5mm jack and draw out audio, and act as a headset for most mobile phones.",
    "There\u2019s plenty nice to say about Sony\u2019s Platinum Wireless Headphones: They have exceptional \u2013 and balanced \u2013 audio performance and the mic sounds \u201cabove average\u201d according to the people we spoke to. There\u2019s also 3D Audio support that creates 100 virtual speakers, though honestly the headset doesn\u2019t have the same panache in this area that you\u2019d find on the competition\u2019s pair of cans.",
    "Speaking of, a lot could be done in the design department to make them look a lot less massive sitting on top of your head, and despite two metal alloy bars floating across the top, the headset\u2019s plastic sections feel fragile.",
    "All said, though, it\u2019s hard to find a better value headset that\u2019s this easy to use and sounds this good overall. Those qualities definitely exist at a higher price, but if you\u2019re looking for something you can set up without a fuss, Platinum is a gamer\u2019s best friend."
