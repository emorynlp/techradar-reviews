  "summary": "Better-looking photos with a click (or two)",
  "verdict": "Ashampoo Photo Optimizer 2019's one-click photo editing works well for landscapes, and its slider-based system for manual adjustments is thoughfully designed. The automatic results won't suit all subjects, but as a free tool for making quick adjustments to a batch of pictures, this does the job admirably.",

    "Ashampoo Photo Optimizer 2019 is a quick and convenient way to improve the look of your pictures \u2013 individually or in batches. Although Windows\u2019 built-in Photos app includes many of the same features (including cropping, rotating and color correction), it only allows you to edit one photo at a time, which can eat up a lot of time when you have more than a handful to process.",
    "Ashampoo Photo Optimizer 2019 also has a host of other handy functions that you won\u2019t find in most free photo editors, and although full instructions are provided, its streamlined interface is self-explanatory.",
    "Unusually for free-to-use software, it\u2019s also devoid of distracting ads, leaving you free to focus on the important task of optimizing your pictures.",
    "Ashampoo Photo Optimizer 2019 is free to use, but to get started you\u2019ll first need to request a license key by submitting an email address. Ashampoo won\u2019t share it with any third parties, though you will receive updates on the company\u2019s own products (which you can unsubscribe from if you\u2019re not interested).",
    "The software comes with a set of images for you to experiment with, but if you prefer, you can remove these and start working with your own pictures immediately.",
    "Click \u2018File\u2019, then select either \u2018Add folder\u2019 or \u2018Add file\u2019 to select the photos you want to optimize. Once that\u2019s done and they\u2019ve appeared in the pool, select one or more by checking their boxes and you\u2019re ready to get to work. To remove a photo from the pool, hover over it and click the cross icon that appears. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 this won\u2019t delete the picture from your PC.",
    "One of the main attractions of Ashampoo Photo Optimizer 2019 is the \u2018Auto Optimize\u2019 button, which analyzes a single picture (unlike some of the software\u2019s other tools, it can\u2019t be used for batch editing) and applies one or more changes to improve its sharpness, color and brightness. It\u2019s an interesting idea and works particularly well for landscapes, but we found that it sometimes raised the brightness a little too far for other subjects, resulting in images looking washed out.",
    "If that happens, you can make adjustments manually instead by selecting \u2018Color correction\u2019 from the right-hand menu. Again, you can only use this tool to make changes to one picture at a time. This is accomplished via a series of sliders, enabling you to fine-tine brightness, contrast, lightness, saturation, hue and gamma. The sliders are quite sensitive, but you can also adjust the number to the right of each slider for very fine adjustments (a welcome touch rarely seen in photo optimization software.",
    "You can also crop or resize individual photos, or rotate or mirror several at once by checking multiple images in the pool, then clicking the appropriate button.",
    "We\u2019d like to be able to apply the same set of color adjustments to multiple images at once, which would be a real timesaver for pictures taken in the same lighting conditions, but Ashampoo Photo Optimizer 2019 is still an excellent tool for any amateur photographer, and it\u2019s impossible to argue with the price."
