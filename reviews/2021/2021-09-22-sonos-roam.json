    "Voted Best Bluetooth Speaker at the TechRadar Choice Awards 2021",
    "The Sonos Roam is the latest wireless speaker from the multi-room audio company, and the brand\u2019s CEO Patrick Spence calls it \u201cthe smartest speaker we have ever built.\u201d",
    "Following in the footsteps of the Sonos Move, the Roam comes with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, which means it can work as a portable speaker as well as part of your wider multi-room Sonos system \u2013 and with Google Assistant and Alexa onboard, it doubles up a smart speaker too.",
    "At $169 / \u00a3159 / AU$279, it\u2019s the cheapest and smallest Sonos speaker to date, and therefore the most affordable entry point into the brand's multi-room audio ecosystem.",
    "In spite of its (relatively) low price you\u2019re getting a lot for your money here. Its slick design means the Sonos Roam won\u2019t look out of place in your home, while a rugged, waterproof and dustproof build and a decent battery life make it ideal for listening to music outdoors.",
    "To make that transition from indoors to outdoors as seamless as possible, the Sonos Roam comes with a host of cool features. The first of these new features is Sound Swap \u2013 simply hold down the play button and the Sonos Roam will \u2018throw\u2019 your audio to the nearest other Sonos speaker available.",
    "Another, Automatic Switching between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, means you can simply walk into your home and the Sonos Roam, having previously been paired with your Bluetooth device, will connect to your Wi-Fi, without the need to set it up and reconnect manually.",
    "Finally, the Auto TruePlay feature first introduced with the Sonos Move has been upgraded here, so the Roam will automatically tune its soundstage to your environment, whether you\u2019re on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.",
    "Of course, all these flashy features would be pointless if the Sonos Roam didn\u2019t sound great \u2013 but we\u2019re happy to report that, despite its small stature, the Roam delivers a powerful sonic performance, with remarkably prominent bass, even if it does lack the rhythmic accuracy you'd expect from an audiophile speaker. If you do count yourself among the audiophiles of the world, you may find the bass to be slightly overpowering \u2013 though those forceful low frequencies work well outdoors, where there are no walls for the sound to bounce off.",
    "The Sonos Roam's combination of class-leading connectivity features, powerful sound, and excellent design means it's our pick for the best portable speaker of 2021, though it doesn't beat the best wireless speaker, the Sonos One, in terms of audio quality.",
    "In any case we think Sonos has achieved its aims of creating the smartest Sonos speaker to date, and for that reason, we'd absolutely recommend buying it if you're looking for a portable speaker that can slot into your existing home audio system as easily as it can provide tunes around a campfire or at the beach.",
    "[Update: The Sonos Roam just got even better thanks to an upgrade that brings improvements to connectivity and battery life.",
    "You can download the update via the Sonos S2 app, and according to the company, it will improve the Roam\u2019s power management to help extend the Roam\u2019s battery life when it\u2019s not actively being used. ]",
    "The Sonos Roam is available to buy for $179 / \u00a3179 / AU$299; that's $20 / \u00a320 / AU$20 more than its original launch price in April 2021, after Sonos announced a nearly product-wide price hike.",
    "That price tag makes it the cheapest Sonos speaker to date in the US and UK, undercutting the Sonos One SL, which costs $179 / \u00a3179 (in Australia the One SL costs AU$269). It's also cheaper than Sonos' first portable smart speaker, the Sonos Move, which costs $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649 \u2013 a price that puts that speaker firmly at the top end of the Bluetooth speaker market, although it earns that price tag thanks to its array of Sonos smarts and powerful audio.",
    "It\u2019s still not cheap by any means though; one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers, the UE Boom 3, costs $129.99 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$199.95, although it doesn\u2019t come with the smart assistant compatibility of Sonos\u2019 latest device.",
    "While the Sonos Roam retains the minimalist aesthetic of the brand\u2019s previous devices, its design is still quite the departure for the audio company, with a focus on ruggedness and portability.",
    "It\u2019s longer and thinner than the comparatively squat Sonos Move, and is similar in size to a water bottle. It\u2019s far lighter than the Move too, weighing in at 0.95lbs / 0.43kg, and you can easily hold it in your hand or sling it in a bag when on the move.",
    "That light build, combined with an IP67 water-and-dust-resistance rating, makes it more easily portable than its predecessor, and rugged enough to withstand the elements. In fact, Sonos says it can survive being three feet underwater for 30 minutes.",
    "On the front of the speaker is an embossed Sonos logo in white; above this, is an LED that indicates the speaker\u2019s connection status, while an LED on the opposite end indicates battery life.",
    "The control buttons are on the left end of the speaker when it\u2019s placed horizontally \u2013 you can also orient the speaker vertically, with the buttons on the top. There are volume up and down buttons, a play/pause button, and a button for turning the microphone on and off. The play/pause button can be double-pressed to skip to the next track, or triple-pressed to go back to the previous track.",
    "To pair the Roam with other Sonos products, you need to press and hold the play/pause button; keeping the button pressed for longer will activate the aforementioned \u2018throw\u2019 feature, switching your audio to the nearest other Sonos speaker. Slightly embossed, the buttons feel more tactile and easier to use compared to the touch-sensitive buttons on top of the Sonos Move \u2013 and they\u2019re more accessible for those with visual impairments.",
    "On the back of the speaker is the power button \u2013 you need to press and hold this until you hear the pairing tone to connect the Sonos Roam to a Bluetooth device. Beneath the button is a USB-C port for charging \u2013 you get a USB-A to USB-C connector in the box, but you\u2019ll have to use your own adapter.",
    "The ends of the speaker are slightly concave, which Sonos says increases its drop-resistance, and helps to prevent accidental button presses, so you don\u2019t jack the volume up to 11 every time you brush past it.",
    "The buttons themselves are described by Sonos as \u201ctactile and slightly embossed\u201d, with the raised design making it easy to hit play or change the volume. They\u2019re very responsive, and we didn\u2019t experience any lag in between hitting the button and the resulting action; the Sonos Move\u2019s buttons are touch-sensitive, so the ability to feel the buttons will likely be a welcome feature for anyone with visual impairments.",
    "Coming in 'Shadow' black and 'Lunar' white, the Sonos Roam boasts a \u201cprecision-engineered\u201d honeycomb grille \u2013 it\u2019s not a wraparound grille though, so don\u2019t expect true 360-degree sound.",
    "You have some flexibility when it comes to placing the speaker \u2013 the Roam can be positioned horizontally for stability on uneven ground, or vertically for a smaller footprint, with its triangular shape funneling sound upwards. If you do place the Roam horizontally on a flat surface like a table, small feet on what is, in this orientation, the bottom of the speaker help to keep it stable.",
    "If you wish, you can buy a $49 / \u00a344 / AU$79 wireless charging stand for the Roam. Simply place the speaker on the stand and it\u2019ll snap into place with magnets, giving the Roam a permanent home inside yours.",
    "Overall, we think the design of the Sonos Roam is really attractive. While many portable waterproof speakers are finished with garish colors and functional materials, the Roam retains the slick aesthetic of the brand\u2019s home speakers, and its light and compact build makes it ideal for listening to music on the go.",
    "If Sonos\u2019 goal was to make a speaker that works just as well indoors as it does outdoors, it has succeeded.",
    "In spite of its small size, the Sonos Roam delivers a powerful sonic performance with remarkably prominent bass. Inside the speaker are two class-H amplifiers, with a high-efficiency motor that Sonos says increases the power and range of the audio output, as well as a custom racetrack mid-woofer, and a tweeter.",
    "While the sound isn\u2019t as room-filling as that provided by the larger Sonos Move, the Roam comes pretty close, thanks to some clever design choices when it comes to the transducer.",
    "The transducer transforms the electric signal into wave-shaped changes in air pressure \u2013 the sound you hear \u2013 and for that it needs space to move, as well as space within the speaker to pack in as much air as possible.",
    "As Sara Morris, Principal Product Manager at Sonos explains, the team managed to keep the size down by making the transducer part of the housing itself, allowing the Sonos Roam to be \u201csmaller, lighter, and still have a really good sound.\u201d",
    "Sonos has certainly succeeded in that regard. Listening to Childish Gambino\u2019s Feels Like Summer, thumping bass lines drive the smooth synths, while the clear and rich falsetto vocals soar above the mix.",
    "If we\u2019re nit-picking, we\u2019d like to hear a little more from the mids and lower trebles, as some of the detail is lost amid that powerful bass; in fact, if you\u2019re using the Roam inside, you may want to adjust the EQ settings to increase the treble frequencies. Those powerful low frequencies work very well outside, where there are no walls for the sound to bounce off, but inside, it can be slightly overpowering.",
    "Listening to Gorillaz' Glitter Freeze, and the whining synths sound clear without being overly harsh, while the driving bass lines are powerful. The Sonos Roam lacks the kind of rhythmic accuracy and dexterity of audiophile speakers, but for a speaker of this size, we weren't disappointed by the overall presentation of our music.",
    "As for support for music services, there\u2019s support for AirPlay 2 on Apple devices with iOS 11.4 and later, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Tidal, YouTube Music, 7Digital, Sonos Radio, and more via the Sonos S2 app.",
    "Sound Swap is one of the best features on the Sonos Roam, allowing you to \u2018throw\u2019 the music from your Sonos Roam to the nearest Sonos speaker available, and vice versa.",
    "All you need to do is hold down the play/pause button until you hear the third tone (one more than if you were pairing two speakers), while holding the Sonos Roam close to the other speaker. Your music should then begin playing from the second speaker \u2013 or if you\u2019re casting to a Sonos system, the full speaker setup.",
    "We tried Sound Swap with our home cinema system, comprising a Sonos Arc, two Sonos One SL rear speakers, and the Sonos Sub, and it worked seamlessly. Being able to bring the Sonos Roam in from the kitchen to our living room and continue listening to our music on a surround sound system without messing around with our phone was wonderful. As mentioned this feature also works in reverse, so holding down the play/pause button will cause the Roam to pick up audio that\u2019s playing on another speaker or setup \u2013 handy when you\u2019re taking the Roam out into the garden for example.",
    "In spite of its focus on portability, the Roam is very much part of the Sonos ecosystem, which means you can use it as part of a wider multi-room audio setup, or pair two speakers for stereo sound. Pairing the Sonos Roam with other Sonos speakers can be done by simply holding down the play/pause button.",
    "Unfortunately, though, you can\u2019t use two Sonos Roams as a pair of rear channels for your home cinema system. We expected this to be the case, as the same is true for the Sonos Move \u2013 the company puts this down to sync issues, and the potential for a directional soundtrack to lose its focus if a speaker isn't optimally positioned in a room.",
    "The Roam works with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5, so you can use it in the home or on the move, and the new Automatic Switching feature makes this transition more seamless than ever, with the speaker automatically connecting to your Wi-Fi network when in range, and re-pairing with your phone when you\u2019re out and about.",
    "To start using the Sonos Roam you\u2019ll need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network via the Sonos S2 app \u2013 this isn\u2019t super-clear from the instruction leaflet included in the box, but you won\u2019t be able to pair via Bluetooth without doing this first.",
    "Setting up the Sonos Roam took us just a few minutes. To get started, you\u2019ll need to download the Sonos app if you don\u2019t have it already, and then tap Settings > System > Add Product.",
    "When you begin connecting the Sonos Roam to your network, you\u2019ll be prompted to enter an 8-digit code that you\u2019ll find on the bottom of the speaker \u2013 this can either be entered manually, or automatically using NFC.",
    "Once you\u2019ve done this, you\u2019ll hear a chime to let you know that the code has been entered successfully, and the speaker will begin connecting to your Wi-Fi network. You may also have to wait for the Roam to update, if an update is available.",
    "Once connected, you can turn on Auto Trueplay, add your voice assistant of choice (Google Assistant or Alexa) and toggle other settings. There\u2019s also a \u2018product tour\u2019 within the app, to help you get to know the Sonos Roam\u2019s controls and features \u2013 it\u2019s a neat touch that makes the setup process feel really easy.",
    "Both Google Assistant and Alexa are onboard, and you can use your voice assistant of choice to control the speaker hands-free, control your other smart home devices, check your calendar, ask questions, and more \u2013 you will need to be connected to Wi-Fi to take advantage of these features.",
    "Setting up the Sonos Roam with Google Assistant is super easy, with the Sonos app directing you to the Google Home app to configure your settings. We found the microphones were able to pick up our voice pretty clearly, even with music playing at a medium volume.",
    "It's a shame that you can't call on the voice assistant while using Bluetooth, but it's certainly not a dealbreaker \u2013 and we daresay the experience of using Google Assistant over Bluetooth would be more frustrating than helpful.",
    "The claimed battery life of the Sonos Roam is 10 hours, though we found that this came in at around nine hours while playing at a medium volume, and the company says the speaker can last for up to 10 days in sleep mode \u2013 it\u2019ll automatically go into sleep mode when you stop playing music.",
    "That battery life almost matches the Sonos Move\u2019s 11 hours, and that of most decent portable speakers on the market.",
    "You can charge the Sonos Roam with any Qi-certified charging device, but if you want to keep it in the family, Sonos sells a dedicated wireless charging stand for $49 / \u00a344 / AU$79, which features magnets to hold the speaker in place. You also get a USB-A to USB-C connector in the box, so you can use your own adapter."
