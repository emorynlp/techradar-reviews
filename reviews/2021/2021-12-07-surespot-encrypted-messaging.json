    "Surespot is a secure messaging app with end-to-end encryption for all images, text, and voice messages sent in a two-person conversation. Not even Surespot can see what you send because its servers aren\u2019t able to access your private key to decrypt your messages.",
    "Surespot is completely open source, with all of its code on display for you to review \u2014 and even add to if you\u2019d like. For non-coders, the fact that Surespot is open source should at least offer some peace of mind because it\u2019s so transparent (and there\u2019s an easy-to-understand explainer of how it works on the website).",
    "Surespot does what you\u2019d expect a messenger app to do. Invite other users to chat with you via their username or an invite link, then assign them an avatar. Send emoji, text, and images, and you choose to lock images so they can\u2019t be saved to the recipient\u2019s gallery. Record a voice message and then either send or cancel it. When receiving voice messages, they\u2019ll auto-play if the chat tab is open \u2014 so either have your headphones in or navigate away from the tab if you don\u2019t want others to hear.",
    "Friend and message options can be accessed by long-pressing. There isn\u2019t much, though. For your contacts, you can do things like close the tab, assign an alias, and delete them from your contacts. There are even fewer message options, which we\u2019ll talk about in the User Experience section.",
    "If you head to Settings > Identity Options, there are a handful of changes you can make, like setting a background image, toggling confirmation notices on and off, and generally choosing how your communications function.",
    "Surespot isn\u2019t associated with your email address or phone number \u2014 you can\u2019t even reset your password, so make sure to save it somewhere off-device.",
    "You can create multiple identities for use on a single device if you want to keep communications separate. Your identity is also portable, and it can be securely transferred to other devices.",
    "Because of Surespot\u2019s encryption and high-level privacy, there are guidelines for what can and cannot be accessed should you lose your phone, uninstall the app or restore an old backup. When you get started, you\u2019ll be asked to back up your identity to your documents or Google Drive.",
    "There\u2019s a 1,000-message history, and once that threshold is reached, your oldest messages will start getting deleted. You can also manually delete messages and block users you don\u2019t want to communicate with any longer.",
    "Message options on Surespot are very limited \u2014 you can only copy or delete a message, even the ones you send. There\u2019s no option for editing a message once you send it. What\u2019s nice, though, is that if you delete a message you sent, it\u2019ll be deleted from the receiver\u2019s history, too.",
    "When sending media, you can search for a GIF, upload an image from your device or take a picture in-app. The in-app camera is as basic as they come \u2014 you can turn the flash on and off, change the orientation to take a selfie, and snap \u2014 that\u2019s it.",
    "All in all, Surespot works as it says it does, even if it doesn\u2019t feel as smooth or intuitive as other apps. There also isn\u2019t any way to see that the other person is typing a response, which some users may like or dislike based on their preferences.",
    "Surespot is available in the Apple App Store and on the Google Play Store for iOS and Android devices.",
    "Surespot is completely free, but you can support it with contributions. You don\u2019t have to make a decision about contributing to sign up, but it\u2019s available on the website if you\u2019re interested. There\u2019s not even advertising on the app \u2014 other than taking donations in cryptocurrency, Surespot isn\u2019t monetized and it doesn\u2019t track you around the internet.",
    "Surespot\u2019s main competition are other messaging apps like Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Voxer, though they don\u2019t all offer the same high level of encryption, security, and transparency that Surespot does. Also, it\u2019s hard to find any app that doesn\u2019t have advertising to bombard you every few minutes.",
    "Surespot can be used whether you want a simpler, safer way to chat with friends or to hold discussions that require a high level of anonymity or security. Push notifications can be turned on or off, letting you keep your convos as visible or hidden as you want. And being able to delete your own messages from the other person\u2019s history is a huge benefit, especially for an app that doesn\u2019t offer disappearing messages as an option. Unfortunately, a major drawback of Surespot is the lack of a group text option \u2014 you\u2019re relegated to just one-on-one conversations.",
    "The app can be a little finicky. I had a hard time getting it set up on one of my devices, but the other one went smoothly. Typing and adding images can be a bit laggy or non-intuitive at times. And clicking around the app, while there\u2019s not much to explore, isn\u2019t as responsive as you\u2019d want. The design and color scheme also make it somewhat tricky to move around the app at times.",
    "It\u2019s also both a blessing and a curse that it\u2019s incredibly hard, if not impossible, to recover your password and Surespot identity. This is what makes it so secure, but from a user-friendly perspective, it is a pain if you misplace your info. It\u2019s necessary to write down your password somewhere you can always access it like a password manager because when you log out of Surespot, it clears stored passwords.",
