  "summary": "The Sony HT-X8500 soundbar may be the best value you can buy",
  "verdict": "This compact Sony soundbar belies its mid-range price with a blockbuster audio performance. The soundstage is wide, with lovely wraparound sound processing courtesy of Sony\u2019s clever Vertical S, and that internal subwoofer is a proper beast.",
  "pros": [
    "Dolby Atmos and DTS:X compatible",
    "Compact all-in-one form factor",
    "Integrated subwoofer",
    "Easy to set-up and use",
    "Brilliant value"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No upfiring drivers",
    "Not High-Res Audio capable",
    "Stripped back feature set"

    "If you find the very idea of a simplified 3D soundbar preposterous, you\u2019re not alone. We all know that Dolby Atmos relies on height information to create a truly immersive soundstage, but like its more expensive HT-ZF9 predecessor, the new Sony HT-X8500 uses advanced DSP audio processing to compensate for the lack of dedicated up firing drivers.",
    "Sure, it comes with some caveats, but the $299 (\u00a3350, AU$599) HT-X8500 was among the best soundbars on the planet in 2019 \u2013 and it still deserves a place there in 2021. In fact, now that it's a little older, you should be able to find it discounted, making it an even better option to consider.",
    "The HT-X8500 is a self-contained audio system. There\u2019s no separate wireless subwoofer, nor extraneous wireless surround speakers. It\u2019s a smart, singular soundbar designed to fit just about anywhere.",
    "The subwoofer may be built-in, but the bar remains pleasingly slim. A modest 89cm wide, it\u2019s suitable for TVs measuring between 49-55-inches.",
    "The cosmetic finish has a sense of style. The front-facing array is protected by a smart rolled grille, while a gun metal grey trim adds interest. Up top are touch-sensitive buttons, for power, input selection, volume and Bluetooth pairing.",
    "Connectivity is relatively sparse, limited to just two HDMIs, one an input, the other an output with eARC. There\u2019s also an optical digital audio input, for when ARC isn\u2019t available. The 4K HDMI board is compatible with Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG.",
    "Overall, the HT-X8500\u2019s compact design is easy to live with, with no separate subwoofer to claim floor space. Instead we get twin forward facing woofers. Perhaps, surprisingly for a Dolby Atmos soundbar, there are no up firing drivers and HDMI connectivity is limited.",
    "Sony has opted for a stripped back feature set here to keep costs down. There's no smart Wi-Fi connectivity, or on-screen menu. Instead the soundbar communicates via LED lights, which signpost Dolby Atmos and DTS-X sources, as well chosen inputs.",
    "The bar is driven by a thin finger-style remote control, which despite its dimensions is not shy of buttons. All the various sound presets are given prominence, alongside processing modes.",
    "Such simplicity makes this an easy system to live with. As it doesn\u2019t depend on reflected sound to create its virtual surround effects, you can simply sit it in front of the telly, or wall mount. There\u2019s no calibration required.",
    "Any reservations we had about the performance of this mid-ranger were blown away when powered up - this soundbar is convincingly cinematic.",
    "The key to the HT-X8500\u2019s gutsy performance is Sony\u2019s proprietary Vertical Sound Engine. Working with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X content, it creates a convincing illusion of wraparound sound that allow Dolby Atmos movies to play with a clear sense of expanded height and width.",
    "Even better, Vertical S doesn\u2019t just work with immersive codecs, either - it can be used as an up-mixer for two channel and conventional 5.1 sound sources too, to similar good effect.",
    "Perhaps the biggest surprise is the internal subwoofer. It may be modest, but this all-in-one thumps like an ogre\u2019s headache. With a bass response down to 50Hz, the rumbles aren\u2019t seismic, but they\u2019re persistent. Some may even find the balance of those twin forward-facing woofers a little overbearing at times, but their sheer enthusiasm is hard to fault.",
    "But this bar isn't perfect. Sony claims the HT-X8500 approximates a soundfield comparable to an Atmos 7.1.2 system, which is something of a stretch.",
    "The HT-X8500 doesn\u2019t produce compelling overhead audio in the same vein as a 7.1.4 system, but does create a soundstage as high as it is wide. Parked in the sweet spot (there is one, so make sure you\u2019re sitting in it), we were definitely left with the impression that sounds were whipping out either side of our listening position. Everest (Blu-ray, in Dolby Atmos) proves suitably chilling. When the big storm hits, the HT-X8500 unleashes projectiles of ice left and right. It\u2019s enough to make you shiver and shudder.",
    "In truth, there\u2019s not a great deal of difference between a genuine 3D movie mix and advanced channel codecs like Dolby True HD and DTS-HD MA once they\u2019ve been through Sony\u2019s Vertical Sound processor - and that speaks volumes about the DSP technology Sony has developed with this bar.",
    "If you can live without Dolby Atmos, the Sonos Beam is a viable alternative to the HT-X8500. It\u2019s a similarly compact, high performance offering, albeit one designed for those with (or planning to buy) a Sonos multiroom wireless system. It combines musicality with a lively performance, and can work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.",
    "For comparable filmic thrills, there\u2019s the Panasonic SC-HTB900 (available outside the US), a Technics-tuned 3.1 system. Like this Sony, it can decode Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and relies on sonic processing to compensate for a lack of upfiring drivers. It comes with a separate subwoofer, and sounds wonderful with most sources, but you\u2019ll pay considerably more for it.",
    "Given that rival Dolby Atmos compatible soundbars typically sell for twice the price, Sony\u2019s HT-X8500 warrants an easy recommendation. Cost-cutting can be attributed to connectivity and features but what\u2019s genuinely confounding is just how great the HT-X8500 sounds. If you want a home theatre sound system that won\u2019t dent your budget, it\u2019s probably the best option to come around this year."
