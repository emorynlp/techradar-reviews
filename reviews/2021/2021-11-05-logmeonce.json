    "LogMeOnce is, without a doubt, one of the best password managers we\u2019ve seen. Most password management programs offer some sort of secure password generation and autofill features, but the advanced tools included here are extremely impressive. It is trusted by such notable business users that include BMW, the Mayo Clinic and the United States Secret Service.",
    "In this LogMeOnce password manager review, we\u2019ve analyzed everything you need to know about this program. It\u2019s affordable, backed by powerful security features, and offers solutions for everyone from business managers to personal users. On top of this, it has great cross-platform desktop and mobile compatibility.",
    "LogMeOnce claims to have \u201c57 unrivaled top features, and counting\u201d. For example, the Photo Login tool allows passwordless access to both mobile and desktop devices. Simply take a quick photo with your computer\u2019s webcam and follow the prompts to send it to another device, such as your smartphone. Then when you are on your PC and need your password credentials for a site, your previously taken image is sent to the smartphone, and you hit the \u201cYes, it\u2019s me\u201d button to log in on all selected devices.",
    "PasswordLess login also offers additional options to login with a password. This includes Face ID via biometrics, a PIN code, a fingerprint, or even good ol\u2019 fashioned passwords for those that prefer the classic option.",
    "A strong password generator is also included (you can get an idea for how it works here with the free online tool), which supports the creation of random passwords for as many accounts as you want. On top of this, passwords can be shared with coworkers, family members, or anyone else by using the secure sharing tool.",
    "Even better, LogMeOnce goes beyond simple password management to support form auto filling, credit card storage, and secure note taking. You can even create a backup of personal details, ID documents, and any other important information that you wish to keep safe.",
    "Setting up your LogMeOnce account is extremely straightforward and shouldn\u2019t take more than a minute or two. Simply select the plan you want and follow the prompts to install the relevant browser extension. All major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, are supported.",
    "Login details and other information can then be added manually or imported from an existing password manager. A detailed quick-start guide is available to guide you through the entire process.",
    "To use LogMeOnce on a mobile device, such as a smartphone, is quite easy, as you simply download the app and follow the prompts to link it to your desktop account.",
    "The LogMeOnce interface is extremely well designed and quite intuitive. A web-based dashboard can be accessed via the program\u2019s website, and it includes everything from your basic password manager to leaked password monitoring and activity reports.",
    "On top of this, the browser extension is very impressive. It includes quick links to all your saved websites, and logging in is as simple as clicking on the icon for the site you want to access. The mobile apps are equally powerful, and they performed very well on every device we tested them on. From the user reviews, we would conclude that the iOS app is preferred at 4.4 out of 5 stars, while the Android version is rated lower at 3.7 out of 5 stars on the Google Play Store.",
    "Like all good password managers, LogMeOnce is backed by a selection of powerful security features. This includes AES-256 bit encryption compliant with NIST guidelines, and communication to the LogMeOnce server via SSL/TSL encrypted tunnel communication. In fact, it goes one step further than most of its competitors, with a range of patented and copyrighted tools to further protect your sensitive information.",
    "Along with basic encryption and master-password access, LogMeOnce also comes with PasswordLess login, powerful two-factor authentication (2FA), and anti-theft tools. Custom security solutions are also available for business users with highly sensitive data.",
    "LogMeOnce has a range of customer support and self-help options to draw on if you run into trouble. For starters, the main website features a neat chatbot that will guide you to informational articles or help you submit a support ticket. Tickets can also be lodged directly from your management dashboard or the online portal. However, we did not find a direct phone or fax number for those that prefer those options.",
    "On top of this, LogMeOnce comes with an impressive selection of video tutorials and a comprehensive FAQ page, along with numerous how-to articles for example \u201cHow to change the master password,\u201d and software documentation. There\u2019s even a beginner-friendly tutorial to help you get started.",
    "There are three LogMeOnce business plans on offer, with prices ranging from $3.00/user/month to $7.00/user/month. All plans come with a 14-day free trial (and we appreciate no credit card is required to access) and are available Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android devices.",
    "The cheapest Team & Business plan costs $3.00/user/month and includes a range of advanced features such as a dedicated vault for each user, a centralized admin panel, unlimited device access, and secure sharing tools.",
    "Upgrading to the Enterprise plan costs $4.00/user/month and includes everything in the Team & Business plan, as well as 1GB of encrypted storage, priority technical support, and a real-time administrative dashboard.",
    "Finally, the $7.00/user/month Identity and Password Manager plan adds a selection of tools, including MFA authentication, IP address restriction, device whitelisting, dark web monitoring, and leaked password monitoring.",
    "There are also four personal/family plans that start at the free tier, and end at the Family plan that is still an affordable $4.99/month for a family of up to six.",
    "Although LogMeOnce is one of the best password management programs we\u2019ve used, there are a couple of powerful alternatives worth considering. For example, LastPass has long been a leading password management program backed by very advanced features. It includes secure multi-factor authentication, has over 1200 pre-integrated apps, and comes with a selection of advanced administration controls for IT managers and other tech professionals. Pricing is similar starting at a comparable $3/user/month.",
    "Overall, LogMeOnce is up there with the absolute best password management programs we\u2019ve used. It\u2019s extremely affordable, comes with advanced tools designed for business users, and is backed by a range of powerful features.",
    "On top of this, it\u2019s easy to set up, has a very tidy user interface, and is compatible with a wide range of web browsers, devices, and operating systems. Also, security tools and customer support resources are comprehensive with an extensive library of articles and even videos. Ultimately, we\u2019d recommend LogMeOnce for anyone who\u2019s looking for a powerful, versatile password management solution backed by advanced features.",
