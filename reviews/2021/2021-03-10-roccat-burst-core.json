    "The Roccat Burst Core proves that while there\u2019s a case to be made for expensive gaming mice, you don\u2019t always have to pay more to get more. Roccat\u2019s budget version of its much-lauded Burst Pro, may not have all the bells and whistles that the best gaming mice do, but it\u2019s an excellent value.",
    "However, it does come with its own special features, even if that list is shorter. It\u2019s extremely lightweight, for one \u2013 lighter than the super lightweight Corsair Katar Pro XT, which may be its biggest rival. It is also outfitted with Roccat\u2019s Titan Switch Optical, the same optical switch that the more expensive Burst Pro has that\u2019s rated at 100 million clicks.",
    "More importantly, the Roccat Burst Core delivers where it matters most, from its performance right down to its look and feel, which is even more impressive considering its price. At $29 (\u00a324, AU$69), it\u2019s $30/\u00a325/AU$30 cheaper than the Roccat Burst Pro and a fraction of the price of many of the best gaming mice out there.",
    "That surprisingly affordable price tag also puts it in direct competition with the Corsair Katar Pro XT, which costs the same in the US and Australia but is \u00a310 more in the UK. It\u2019s readily available for purchase in both the UK and US Roccat sites as well as the usual major retailers. However, those in Australia can purchase it from online retailers only.",
    "The Roccat Burst Core\u2019s biggest selling point is that it\u2019s extremely lightweight. At 68g, it\u2019s one of the lightest mice right now. What Roccat has done here is utilize a light honeycomb shell that\u2019s been gaining popularity lately, without committing all the way, so users won\u2019t have to worry about dust and debris inside their mice.",
    "How does that look exactly? It\u2019s very much like the Burst Pro where holes are carved on the underside of the top panel but the outermost shell is kept solid. Except now you get a translucent outer shell that showcases RGB lighting in a unique and funky way. Think of it as a stripped-down, less flashy version, which makes sense considering the price.",
    "It has, however, kept its symmetrical ergonomic shape that feels extremely comfortable to use. Palm grip gamers will appreciate the support it offers, though gamers with bigger hands could have used a little more pronounced hump on the palm rest. In any case, it\u2019s nice and comfortable to use, especially because of the lightweight design.",
    "The Roccat Burst Core feels pleasant (and premium) to the touch, the side panels being textured to give you a nice solid grip and the top panel, including the right and left buttons, offers a soft, velvety feel thanks to its matte finish. Of course, there is a downside \u2013 the top panel tracks fingerprints way too easily.",
    "We recommend using a quality mouse pad with this mouse. While Roccat calls its PTFE mouse feet \u201ca top-tier feature that offers exceptional glide,\u201d they won\u2019t really offer much resistance without one, making the mouse itself harder to control. That\u2019s on top of the fact that it doesn\u2019t really feel luxurious sliding it around your bare desk.",
    "The cable also feels stiff. We sometimes have to stop mid-game to re-adjust the cable as it was getting in our way. It\u2019s also a rubber cable, which means that it has a higher chance of fraying. Then again, for a mouse this cheap, some compromises had to be made.",
    "Luckily, the Roccat Burst Core is uncompromising in its performance. Whatever features the gaming mouse is lacking are certainly made up for thanks to the Titan Switch Optical switches that not only gives it a long life-cycle of 100 million clicks, but also fast and accurate actuation and nice, satisfying tactile feedback.",
    "It also comes with on-board memory which allows users to keep their preferred profiles regardless of the PC they\u2019re using. It only has a maximum of 8,500 DPI, but really, at that point, no human will ever notice the difference between that and 20,000 DPI. So, this is hardly a big deal.",
    "Testing it on games like Doom: Eternal, Subnautica, Firewatch, and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is an immersive experience. Its sensor is incredibly responsive and accurate while its buttons are fast and have no noticeable latency. Even macros and button assignments are executed quickly without lag, making your game seamless.",
    "The lightweight design makes it easy to quickly react to enemies without exerting a lot of force on our wrists. Understandably, a lot of gamers prefer mice with more heft for more controlled movements. However, we find the Roccat Burst Core\u2019s light weight better as it puts less strain on our wrist and shoulders. It\u2019s all a matter of preference, but if you\u2019re suffering from chronic shoulder and wrist pain, this might actually work in your favor.",
    "As this mouse is fully customizable via the Roccat Swarm app, we recommend taking full advantage. There\u2019s not a lot here in the way of RGB lighting, mainly because its RGB lighting zones are limited to its scroll wheel, but there are some animations as well as adjustments to speed and brightness.",
    "Mostly though, you\u2019d want to take advantage of adjusting the settings, creating profiles, and creating macros so you can fully personalize the mouse. There\u2019s a lot you can do on the app, from setting vertical scroll and horizontal tilt speeds to saving up to 5 DPI settings for the DPI button to cycle through and assigning game-specific macros. These customizations will not only make the Roccat Burst Core truly yours, but also give you a gaming edge."
