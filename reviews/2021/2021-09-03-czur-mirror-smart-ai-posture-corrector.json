  "summary": "A clever blend of AI, lasers and yelling that gets your head up to save your spine",
  "verdict": "This HD camera-equipped device uses AI to analyse your posture and tells (or flashes lasers at) you to keep your head up to improve your posture and put less pressure on your spine. Despite some custom modes it\u2019s a one-trick gadget, but if you\u2019re one of the WFH generation that\u2019s been using a laptop and is now now suffering from a sore back the CZUR Mirror might help.",
  "pros": [
    "Easy to set up",
    "Works off-center",
    "Voice or laser light alerts",
    "Particularly helpful for laptop users"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Limited features",
    "No built-in battery",
    "Ugly robotic voice",
    "Uses an angled USB-C cable"

    "You sit at your desk, probably at home, and use a laptop. A lot. Way too much. Your posture is terrible. You\u2019re getting aches and pains. Your back, your neck, your shoulders \u2013 everything. Sure, your phone or Fitbit nags you to move every hour, but you don\u2019t. It\u2019s too easy to ignore. So you slump further into your rubbish chair and curse that blasted virus again.",
    "Don\u2019t panic. Firstly, you need one of the best office chairs, best office desks and, if you\u2019re using a laptop, one of the best laptop stands. Secondly, say hello to CZUR Mirror, a \u2018true smart AI\u2019 posture corrector that attempts to get your spine healthy not by nagging you, but yelling (if you want it to). Oh, and it uses lasers.",
    "The problem with bad posture is, of course, that it puts pressure on your cervical spine, so the CZUR Mirror is all about keeping your spine correctly aligned, but in practice it appears to mainly concentrate on the position of your head. Lean forward and you get scolded, either by a robotic-sounding woman and/or a bunch of flashing laser light dots all over your desk that are hard to ignore.",
    "It\u2019s easy to set-up and, on the laser light mode, fairly unobtrusive, but despite some custom modes for, say, reading or drawing, it\u2019s a fairly basic device. The app\u2019s \u2018posture reports\u2019 and endless data can\u2019t hide the fact that the CZUR Mirror does only one thing \u2013 it reminds you to keep your head in one place. If you\u2019re one of the WFH generation that\u2019s now suffering from a sore back that could be all you need to do to stay on top of your health.",
    "The Shenzhen, China-based CZUR is a \u2018smart office\u2019 company that also sells smart book scanners. Released in September 2021, the CZUR Mirror sells for $69/ \u00a350 / AU$94. At present it\u2019s only available on Indiegogo.",
    "There are loads of posture correctors out there, mostly \u2018wearables\u2019 that are actually belts and braces that look uncomfortable. The key characteristic of the CZUR Mirror is, of course, that it\u2019s a no-touch, hands-free device. In that regard it\u2019s unique, with the closest competitor being the pricey Upright GO 2 wearable posture corrector that slips under clothes, or dangles from a necklace, and vibrates when you slouch.",
    "The CZUR Mirror is a different beast in that it sits on your desk and examines your posture from afar. It measures 133 x 42 x 42mm, weighs 189g, and comes with a USB-C cable.",
    "The front of the device has a small 2MP camera and the top to detect your posture and, just below, a laser light that acts as a visual alert to you that your posture needs correcting. If you\u2019d rather be yelled at there\u2019s a small speaker lower down. You can toggle between the two using a hard button on the CZUR Mirror\u2019s base.",
    "To set it up, all you have to do is attach it to power, though it does need to be placed correctly. It\u2019s fairly versatile, able to work if you put anywhere between 50-80cm in front of you, most likely beside your monitor/laptop. It works fine if it\u2019s off-centre.",
    "In terms of usability, its USB-C terminator is angled 45 degrees to fit into the undercarriage of the product, so you won\u2019t just be able to use any old cable if you lose the one in the box. So although it\u2019s easy enough to slip into a handbag or work bag, it\u2019s not exactly the easiest thing to travel with and is probably left set up in one place.",
    "The underlying concept behind CZUR Mirror\u2019s \u2018smart\u2019 mode is that it monitors and analyses your sitting postures, learns you habits and slowly gets you to sit up straight, raise your head, retract your chin and look straight ahead. That\u2019s its mission statement, though there\u2019s also a \u2018custom\u2019 mode that lets you create a sitting posture that allows you to lower your head a bit \u2013 perhaps for reading or drawing.",
    "You just need to press the top of the CZUR Mirror for two seconds to put it into custom mode, after which it asks you to take your position \u2013 say, reading \u2013 and hold it for five seconds. You even get a spoken countdown. It then takes a photo of your position, which you can immediately see in the app.",
    "The CZUR Mirror claims to help form a good sitting habit in just seven days. So we put it to the test.",
    "Hmmm, \u2018without noticing\u2019 isn\u2019t strictly true. In fact after seven days we were pretty fed-up with listening to the dead-sounding robotic voice inside the CZUR Mirror telling us what to do\u2026 constantly.",
    "Switch on the device and it automatically goes into \u2018smart\u2019 mode (indicated by a blue light on the top of the CZUR Mirror), alerting you when your posture is bad, either through a combination of a doorbell sound, a spoken \u201cdo not lower your head\u201d warning and red laser dots that flash across the desk in front of you three times, or just the latter.",
    "Given that back health tends to be better in corporate offices than in home offices, but also that it\u2019s easy to have bad posture even if you have properly set-up office equipment, we tested the CZUR Mirror in two locations. The first was in a calibrated home office environment where a Humanscale Freedom office chair (one of the best office chairs) was at the correct height for the desk. The other was a more casual scenario where a basic wooden chair without lumbar support or armrests was paired with a small desk and a laptop where heights were more casually aligned.",
    "In both scenarios we were conscious that the CZUR Mirror seems mostly obsessed with the position of the user\u2019s head. Lower it and after about three seconds it starts nagging and flashing. However, we found that while it was sensitive to very slight lowering, it didn\u2019t always alert us when we performed exaggerated movements or some faked slouching. However, the app did appear to pick up on this in its daily reports.",
    "What the CZUR Mirror does well is make you realise just how much you lower your head \u2013 particularly when using a laptop \u2013 which is obviously the easiest way to put undue pressure on your cervical spine. It also reminded us of the importance of touch-typing when using a monitor; if you\u2019re looking at your keyboard a lot then the CZUR Mirror is going to be on frequent alert. There\u2019s also a hidden \u2018experience mode\u2019, in which you can test out the AI chip\u2019s sensitivity, during which we received a \u201cyour posture is good\u201d utterance even though it definitely wasn\u2019t.",
    "Responding to the CZUR Mirror and getting into the positions where it stops nagging you can feel a little awkward, but that\u2019s to be expected. After all, it\u2019s likely that your body has become moulded to sitting in the \u2018wrong\u2019 position.",
    "You don\u2019t need an app to use the CZUR Mirror. It works on its own, automatically going into \u2018smart\u2019 mode, though you can toggle voice reminders on or off.",
    "If you do download the CZUR app you have to go through a slightly unnecessary registration process in which an authentication code is sent to your email address and you only have one minute to fetch it. It\u2019s then an eight-second press of the CZUR Mirror to initiate Bluetooth pairing.",
    "The app displays a percentage that\u2019s supposed to show how good your posture is alongside the duration you\u2019ve used it for and an unexplained \u2018happy index\u2019 percentage. The main posture percentage can be expanded to reveal on another page exactly how much of your posture was good/slight/medium and severe. You can even produce a report that details all this for a day, or examine monthly trends.",
    "Within the app you can also add sedentary reminders of any duration you want, tweak the CZUR Mirror\u2019s sensitivity, change the volume of the speaker and the brightness of the laser, and download firmware.",
