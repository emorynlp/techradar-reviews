    "FreshBooks is a one-stop, cloud-based accounting software that for a relatively small outlay can provide you with an easy-to-use package that ticks most boxes, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Within its browser-based design you\u2019ll find a whole host of options that cover any and all aspects of running a business. It doesn't matter if you're a lone freelancer or someone who\u2019s growing a business and employing staff.",
    "FreshBooks is a doddle to use, has the capacity to expand with your business needs and, thankfully, keeps those stress levels low as you build up your accounting profile. New features for this year include advanced search, the ability to download your own statements, Dropbox connectivity, new keyboard shortcuts and much more.",
    "In the UK, Freshbooks has teamed up with Barclays to offer joint bookkeeping solutions for customers, offering new ways to help with invoicing and wider business management tasks. It's now possible to integrate Barclaycard Payments into FreshBooks, providing extra convenience for business customers. Competitors in this software area include QuickBooks, Xero, Sage Business Cloud Accounting, Kashoo, Zoho Books and Kashflow.",
    "FreshBooks comes with a selection of package and payment options that should provide a solution for most. For the self-employed there\u2019s a no-messing $15 per month Lite package (currently available for $7.50) that allows for 5 billable clients.",
    "Next up, the Plus edition is $25.00 (currently available for $12.50 per month), which is aimed at small businesses and has the capacity for 50 billable clients.",
    "Premium, meanwhile, has potential for business that are expanding and costs $50.00 per month (currently available for $25.00 per month) with a 500 billable client capacity.",
    "Any requirements over and above this selection and you\u2019re best advised to contact FreshBooks for a custom deal. FreshBooks also gets a thumbs up for its try-free option, which lets you explore the package and cancel within 30 days if it\u2019s not right for your needs.",
    "FreshBooks comes with an impressive array of features no matter which of the package options you adopt. Even the Lite edition sparkles with the capacity for unlimited and customizable invoices, unlimited expense entries, the ability to accept credit card payments online and ACH bank transfers too.",
    "Naturally, the beefier the package the more features you get, so Plus adds to the Lite feature set with unlimited proposals, automated recurring invoices, double entry accounting reports and more besides. Similarly, Premium gets all the Lite and Plus features along with up to 500 client capacity and the ability to add team members (at $10 per person).",
    "Anyone with a custom-priced deal can also enjoy a personal account manager, personal FreshBooks training for you and your team along with other value-added features.",
    "FreshBooks has had plenty of time to perfect its operation and this cloud-based system is one that works with little to worry about. The service delivers a neat experience depending on what kind of business you run, and if you\u2019re a one-man-band then there\u2019s very little to go wrong it seems.",
    "Even if you\u2019re operating a large or expanding business FreshBooks seems nicely engineered and rolls with the punches if you\u2019re dealing with large chunks of customer data.",
    "Freshbooks is also available for iOS or Android and the app edition is a clever supplement to the desktop arrangement. Not everyone wants to do everything on their app, especially if that involves large reams of numbers, but this is a great option if you\u2019re keeping track of things on the go.",
    "Accounting software can be a long and arduous journey if you\u2019re not au fait with its different sensibilities, let alone the work involved in mastering a new system. However, FreshBooks has been honed and fine-tuned over the years and is now an inviting option, especially if you\u2019re starting out in business.",
    "In fact, FreshBooks is refreshing in its set-by-step setup, with initial manoeuvres involving little more than picking a package and following the email address and password route so common with cloud-based operations.",
    "Ease-of-use is enhanced as the system can be adapted to suit what type of user you are. Larger concerns, for example, allows team members to be added. Freelancers and self-employed sole trader-types have it even easier.",
    "FreshBooks has a dependable and well-established support system that goes back as long as it has been operating. To start, there\u2019s an excellent online area of the FreshBooks site that offers up a delicious selection of quick fix answers. There are top categories too, such as dashboard and settings, invoicing and payments or handling online payments, which cover the majority of newbie enquiries.",
    "However, for the more unusual requests you may have, or indeed if you prefer a human to advise you, then there\u2019s an easy-to-find phone number in the same section of the site. Live support is available from Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm EDT (Excluding Holidays) in the US. Alternatively, FreshBooks has a support email address to beef up the contact and support options.",
    "We\u2019re really pleased with the way the latest incarnation of FreshBooks looks and performs. It\u2019s been around for a while now and that is obviously a strength as the FreshBooks folks have refined the essence of the accounts package, while making it a wonderfully straightforward user experience.",
    "It\u2019s easy to setup and configure, the menu systems and sections are plain and simple, plus there\u2019s plenty of power behind it to ensure things keep on ticking even if you\u2019re asking a lot of it. All told, FreshBooks seems like a mighty fine way to do your accounting and, depending on your requirements, is actually pretty cost-effective."
