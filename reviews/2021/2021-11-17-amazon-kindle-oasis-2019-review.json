    "If you\u2019re looking for a premium ereader, you\u2019re almost certainly looking at Amazon\u2019s Kindle Oasis (or the Kobo Forma, but that doesn\u2019t have the name recognition of Amazon\u2019s Kindle range, which is synonymous with ereaders).",
    "The Kindle Oasis devices are Amazon's top-of-the-line ereaders, and the most recent one is this 2019 model. As the newest device in its family, it's likely going to be one we see loads of Black Friday Kindle deals on over the course of November, if you wait until Black Friday to buy your tech.",
    "In Amazon's hierarchy, the base Amazon Kindle sits as the most affordable device, with its basic screen, limited storage space and few features, and the Kindle Paperwhite bumps up the screen resolution and storage space and adding a few tricks like waterproofing. This Oasis is technically the top Kindle, though the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition has lots of its features and is two years newer.",
    "With display features including adaptable brightness, impressive backlighting, and in this latest model a warmth setting to reduce eye strain, the Kindle Oasis line is for people who want the most luxurious reading experience, at a price point to match. But is that price tag really justified for a device that\u2019s a relatively minor step above the Kindle Paperwhite?",
    "Given the status of the Amazon Kindle Oasis (2019) as Amazon\u2019s most premium ereader, you should be prepared to wince at its $249.99 / \u00a3229.99 / AU$399 / AED 999 price tag. That\u2019s for 8GB onboard memory; if you want 32GB storage the price goes up to $279.99 / \u00a3259.99 / AU$449 / AED 1,099.",
    "There\u2019s also a version with 32GB memory and free 4G for downloading books on the go in limited markets, which will set you back $349.99 / \u00a3319.99 / AU$559.",
    "In comparison, the base Kindle costs $89.99 / \u00a369.99 / AU$139 / AED359 for 4GB storage, and the Kindle Paperwhite will set you back $129.99 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$199 / AED649 for 8GB memory, so even the cheapest Oasis is still a big step up from the Paperwhite.",
    "The Amazon Kindle Oasis (2019) doesn\u2019t follow the mini-tablet design of most ereaders \u2013 one half of the device is noticeable thicker than the other, which gives you a ridge down the back so that it\u2019s easier to hold (in theory).",
    "In practice, we found the ridge wasn\u2019t quite thick enough to offer a comfortable hold \u2013 at 8.4mm thick, it\u2019s only 5mm thicker than the 3.4mm of the main body, which doesn\u2019t provide a deep enough ridge to really get your fingers into. We found the Kindle Oasis a little hard to hold when only using this ridge, so we wouldn\u2019t recommend it depending on what position you like to sit in to read.",
    "The Kindle Oasis (2019)\u2019s other dimensions are 159 x 141mm, so it wouldn\u2019t be big compared to a tablet, but its display is bigger than those of the other Kindles \u2013 more on the display later.",
    "One of the more \u2018premium\u2019 features of the device is the metal build, which you won\u2019t find in other Kindles. This makes it feel more hardy, which offsets the fact the 3.4mm part of the device, and its relatively lightweight of 188g, can make it feel a little delicate \u2013 the overall effect is a device the looks and feels sleek.",
    "The device is also water resistant, with its IPX8 rating meaning that in theory it can survive being immersed in two metres of water for a whole hour. We can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019d want to take it underwater for that long, but it\u2019ll certainly be fine if you accidentally drop it in the bath while reading, or get it splashed here and there.",
    "Something a little less premium is the micro USB charging port, as most tablets and smartphones have done away with it in favor of USB-C, which is faster for charging. You\u2019re not going to be using that much power with an ereader, so it\u2019s not a huge issue, but we could do without the inconvenience of swapping out the charging cables we use for the rest of our devices.",
    "There\u2019s no 3.5mm headphone jack either, nor loudspeakers, so if you want to listen to audiobooks you\u2019re going to need to use Bluetooth headphones or speakers.",
    "There are two buttons on the right of the Kindle Oasis, used for skipping forward or backwards through pages. It felt a lot more snappy using these to turn pages than touching the screen, due both to the fact they\u2019re in positions that fall naturally under the fingers, and also because pages turned quicker when we pressed the buttons than when we touched the screen.",
    "There were occasions, however, when the buttons didn\u2019t register our touch, and other times they did but the device stuttered before the next page loaded, prompting us to press again then accidentally skip pages. This often happened when reading books that were complicated in terms of their layout and design, like comic books and our own PDFs, and we didn\u2019t notice it as much for text-based books.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that for the most part, the design is exactly the same as the previous generation of Kindle Oasis, and that ereader costs quite a bit less now.",
    "The display is where you\u2019re seeing the main improvements on the Amazon Kindle Oasis (2019), as there are quite a few additions and changes that improve its quality, and the reading experience.",
    "The display is 7 inches diagonally, which is bigger than the 6-inch screens in the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite, so you can fit more words or comic book frames on the screen at once, and it\u2019s also higher quality, with 300 pixels per inch, so content looks good too.",
    "This screen is backlit by 25 LEDs, a big jump over the 12 LEDs in the 2017 Kindle Oasis, and you can see the different \u2013 max brightness is really high, so you can read in a variety of situations, and there\u2019s better contrast between light and dark, which makes comic books in particular more vivid.",
    "The brightness can be changed through the easily-accessible settings menu, but there\u2019s also the option to have it automatically change depending on your environment, as on many smartphones.",
    "It\u2019s in the settings menu that you\u2019ll find another of the Kindle Oasis\u2019 big new features, in the form of the \u2018warmness\u2019 light setting. This gives the display an orange hue, which makes it more comfortable to look at during night-time reading, and protects your eyes over long reading binges.",
    "The feature is primarily designed to make it more comfortable to read at night, but we also found that when we used it on a low setting we could read more easily in daylight. There\u2019s not a huge range when you change the warmth, but it\u2019s an appreciated upgrade anyway.",
    "The refresh rate of the screen is appropriate \u2013 being an ereader display, you\u2019re not seeing as snappy a refresh as on a smartphone screen, but it was far from slow. When zooming into parts of a document we could see the zoom increments, and this made it easier to zoom to the right part of the file."
