A stylish design and comprehensive feature-set make for an impressive 4K TV that\u2019s sure to please.",

    "The QN85A Neo QLED is slim enough to look very good hanging on a wall. It\u2019s adept enough with both black and white tones to allow contrasts to pop from the screen. It can output brilliant colors, draw edges with absolute confidence and it has nice wide viewing angles. It\u2019s blessed with one of the very best smart TV interfaces around. And it\u2019s able to support all the clever features of your next-gen games console (as long as you only own one of them).",
    "And it does all of this without asking silly money in exchange. Oh, we know \u00a31499 for a 55in screen isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of a bargain, but equally we know you tend to get what you pay for where products like this are concerned \u2013 and the Samsung QN85A is proper value for money.",
    "The QN85A isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 its sound is nothing to write home about, it can\u2019t upscale properly low-resolution content with much conviction and it will occasionally have \u2018a moment\u2019 when the on-screen motion gets particularly testing. But taken as a package, and with the price/screen-size ratio uppermost in your mind, the QN85A emerges from this test with a lot more in the \u2018positive\u2019 column than in the \u2018negative\u2019.",
    "The 55-inch Samsung QN85A reviewed here \u2013 along with the 65-inch, 75-inch and 85-inch models that are also available \u2013 is on sale now.",
    "Customers in the United States should expect to pay $,1599 \u2013 the company\u2019s American website is currently promising a $200 discount, but that offer is due to expire any moment now. In the UK it launched at \u00a31,799 but is now routinely available for \u00a31499. Australian customers aren\u2019t as yet able to enjoy any price-cutting or temporary discounts, and as such should brace themselves to spend around AU$2,999.",
    "Are you expecting some kind of flight of fancy where the design of the Samsung is concerned, a tearing up of the rulebook? Hopefully not, because if you are you\u2019re going to be disappointed. The Samsung QE55QN85A, in design terms at least, is absolutely by the book. It\u2019s a big screen, surrounded by a small bezel, standing on a single (and quite hefty) foot that leaves plenty of room beneath the bottom of the screen for a soundbar. Line it up alongside any number of other new TVs and you\u2019d be hard pressed to pick it out.",
    "That\u2019s not a bad thing, though \u2013 the design of a television isn\u2019t supposed to draw attention to itself. The 55-inch QN85A is a tidy 706 x 1227 x 27mm (hwd), with only a brief silver bezel containing that great big expanse of screen. And look at that last number again \u2013 the QN85A measures a consistent 27mm deep, which makes it a much more wall-hangable proposition than the majority of new televisions. LG\u2019s Gallery G1 OLED TV, at 23mm, is possibly the only premium screen that\u2019s slimmer than this Samsung alternative \u2013 and at \u00a31999 for a 55-inch model, it\u2019s a fair bit more expensive.",
    "The rear panel is home to four HDMI inputs. One of them covers every next-gen console-friendly HDMI 2.1 standard, including FreeSync Premium Pro, ALLM, VRR, 4K/120Hz and all the rest, while another is eARC-enabled. Alternative inputs include a couple of USB sockets, an Ethernet input, and aerial binding posts for the pair of integrated TV tuners. A digital optical output completes the line-up of physical ins and outs. Wireless connectivity runs to Bluetooth 5.2 and dual-band wi-fi.",
    "The QE55QN85A is a Mini LED screen \u2013 or, as Samsung\u2019s marketing department insists, \u2018Neo QLED\u2019. It\u2019s worth noting that, while the QN85A has the same number of dimming zones as the 55-inch version of the range-topping QN95A (a touch over 500), its peak brightness is a \u2018mere\u2019 1,500 nits where the QN95A can summon close to 2,000. Still, in this context \u20181,500\u2019 is a pretty big number, one that any number of OLED TV owners would sacrifice a kidney for.",
    "As far as HDR compatibility goes, it\u2019s Samsung business as usual \u2013 meaning HLG and HDR10+, but no Dolby Vision. Samsung can go on at length about all the reasons its TVs don\u2019t require Dolby Vision, but the simple fact is that consumers \u2013 especially consumers spending a considerable amount of money on a new television \u2013 usually expect every major specification box to be ticked. The lack of Dolby Vision will no doubt irk some, then, especially given its the favored HDR format of both Netflix and Apple TV.",
    "It\u2019s a testament to just how impressive the Tizen smart TV interface is that Samsung only needs to fiddle about with the minutiae of its performance to maintain its position as one of the very best around. Other brands (they know who they are) have had to make giant strides to deliver anything as logical, straightforward and user-friendly as the interface fitted to the QN85A. It\u2019s a paradigm of good sense.",
    "There\u2019s a wide selection of content available, including every UK broadcaster\u2019s catch-up service, and streaming opportunities from the likes of Apple TV, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. The absence of Freeview Play is a minor niggle, but in any event you\u2019ll never be short of stuff to watch.",
    "Set-up is straightforward, thanks to similarly logical and concise menus, and while there\u2019s a degree of fiddling needed to get motion-handling just right the rest of the process doesn\u2019t take long at all. Getting a workable picture takes moments, and getting a picture that\u2019s satisfying on every level doesn\u2019t take all that much longer.",
    "As is common with many new Samsung TVs these days, the QN85A is supplied with a pair of remote controls. One is a cheap-feeling controller with too many buttons, many of which are too small, while the other is an altogether nicer, more elegant and more stripped-back affair that just covers major control inputs.",
    "Voice-assistance is available too, as long as you don\u2019t want to use Siri. Amazon Alexa is on board, as is Google Assistant \u2013 and Samsung\u2019s own Bixby assistant is available too, for those happy to take a punt on it.",
    "Samsung\u2019s half-decent Smart Things app is also compatible with the QN85A. It\u2019s a nice-looking, clean and stable interface, but it makes you jump through quite a few hoops before it\u2019s prepared to let you adjust the volume on your own TV.",
    "It\u2019s always surprising how quickly remarkable new technologies are assimilated. Just take Mini LED TVs, for instance, which was only introduced to Samsung, LG and Philips TV ranges in 2021 \u2013 but already we\u2019ve gone from marvelling at how LCD-based screen technology can deliver such deep and detailed black tones, and such stunningly well-controlled backlighting, to simply expecting it. In summary, the QN85A doesn\u2019t disappoint.",
    "Displaying a 4K HDR stream of Black Panther via Amazon Prime Video, the Samsung impresses across the board. When assessing the screen\u2019s black levels, the QN85A is almost startlingly adept. The screen\u2019s ability to deliver deep, detailed and wide-ranging black tones makes for an absorbing viewing experience \u2013 and the Samsung\u2019s numerous compact and tightly controlled dimming zones means backlighting is precise. So when a small item of jewelry glints in an otherwise-dark scene, there\u2019s no haloing around it or blooming of the brighter area \u2013 just a convincing light in the darkness.",
    "And though the QN85A can\u2019t muster the peak brightness of its more expensive QN95A sibling, it\u2019s plenty bright enough. And the white tones it generates are every bit as nuanced, detailed and clean as the black equivalent \u2013and, as a consequence, contrasts are extensive.",
    "The same film showcases the QN85A\u2019s wide and convincing color palette. Of course, it\u2019s possible to spend any amount of time finessing the QN85A\u2019s color response \u2013 but everyone else can switch to the \u2018adaptive picture\u2019 intelligent picture mode and enjoy the vibrancy and seemingly limitless variation of the color performance that results. There\u2019s ample opportunity for the screen\u2019s processor to examine skin-tone and skin-texture here, too, and it\u2019s never less than poised and expressive.",
    "Edge definition is stable and assured, while depth of field is never less than persuasive. Sometimes the CGI elements of a film like this can take on a rather artificial cast in the hands of less capable screens, but the QN85A is adaptable enough to make these transitions all-but seamless. The movie\u2019s relentless, rapid motion causes few alarms, either \u2013 in fact, on the very rare occasions that the screen can be seen to be working hard to stay in control of on-screen movement, it only serves to emphasise how authoritative the Samsung otherwise is.",
    "The Samsung\u2019s IPS panel offers decently wide viewing angles (good) and a little more reflectivity than is absolutely ideal (not quite so good). Take a bit of care with positioning, though \u2013 both of the screen and your position relative to it \u2013 and picture performance is admirable.",
    "Step down to some Full HD content and the QN85A proves a competent upscaler, even of thoroughly testing content like the BBC One HD coverage of Wimbledon. Detail levels stay high, contrasts stay wide \u2013 and while the Samsung\u2019s travails with motion become more readily apparent, it\u2019s still one of the better performers this sort of money can buy. Yes, there\u2019s a softening of the overall image, and some of the nuance and variation previously available from the color palette goes astray, but the QN85A is never less than watchable.",
    "\u2018Watchable\u2019 is a relative term when it comes to upscaled content of a lesser standard, though. No one\u2019s expecting miracles when watching a standard-definition 4:3 re-run of Only Fools and Horses but the Samsung\u2019s Neo Quantum Processor 4K does throw in the towel somewhat \u2013 the images it comes up with are noisy, ill-defined and rough. It\u2019s like an approximation of a television broadcast.",
    "Steer clear of the antique stuff, though, and the QE55QN85A is at the very least an enjoyable watch and at best pretty absorbing.",
    "Samsung talks a good game with the audio systems it\u2019s fitted to its 2021 range of TVs, but these are the real headlines: the sound the QN85A makes relates to the pictures it delivers in the same way a rowing boat relates to a speedboat.",
    "Two full-range drivers at the top of the frame, and another two at the bottom, powered by 60 watts of amplification and designed to offer a degree of synchronicity between on-screen movement and audio placement, looks admirable when written down. In practice, though, the Samsung is a rather boneless listen \u2013 it\u2019s not actively unpleasant, and it doesn\u2019t get too shouty at volume, but there\u2019s a bluntness about the sound it makes that\u2019s quite strongly at odds with its images.",
    "So, not for the first time and certainly not for the last, we\u2019d quite firmly point you in the direction of our list of the best soundbars around. You should pay particularly close attention to Samsung\u2019s current range, because the \u2018Q Symphony\u2019 arrangement here means the screen\u2019s audio system can join in with, rather than be entirely replaced by, a Q Symphony soundbar."
