  "summary": "The best option if you want a job at a fast-moving startup",
  "verdict": "If you're interesting in working for a startup or tech company, AngelList provides a wealth of additional information including funding and equity options that you just won't find on other job sites. However, if you're looking for a new position in another industry, you'll likely be better off looking elsewhere.",
  "pros": [
    "Impressive startup listings",
    "Transparent and full of data",
    "Helpful quizzes and profile options"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Relatively small jobs database",
    "Not ideal if you don't want a startup position",
    "Some missing features"

    "AngelList has only been around since 2010, so it\u2019s one of the newer names on the scene when it comes to the big job sites. It\u2019s also one of the most interesting job-hunting projects around, because it\u2019s one of the few job sites that\u2019s dedicated to the startup scene.",
    "It makes perfect sense for a job site to focus on startups. There have never been so many nimble, successful and fast-growing tech firms, and there have never been more people who want to work at them \u2013 and all of those people will be perfectly versed at finding jobs online.",
    "AngelList\u2019s mission is to make startup hiring fairer and more equitable. That\u2019s refreshing, because too often the startup scene relies on nepotism and networking rather than talent and experience.",
    "At the time of writing there are more than 130,000 jobs on the site, and those positions are obviously found in startup companies and tech firms \u2013 and the firm\u2019s database includes big companies like Revolut, Mozilla and Squarespace.",
    "That\u2019s no surprise considering AngelList\u2019s focus on these markets, and it does mean that AngelList has a great database of relevant jobs at top-notch companies. Negatively, though, this site doesn\u2019t have the millions of job openings listed by some rivals, like LinkedIn Jobs or Monster, and it\u2019s not much good if you don\u2019t want to work in a tech company or at a startup.",
    "There are other areas where AngelList makes up for its lack of a huge jobs database. The site places a big emphasis on transparency, which means that job listings have salaries and equity options displayed up-front. That\u2019s not the only helpful information you\u2019ll see on job listings, either: AngelList displays how much investment a company has raised, information about the company culture, the size of the company and the markets where it operates. Work from home options are shown if applicable, and the site lists if companies are willing to sponsor visas.",
    "Job listings have tags that show if companies are hiring, if they\u2019ve been recently funded and if they share any investors with other big-name startups. Other tags illustrate if a company is highly rated by the site\u2019s users, or if it has good scores for leadership and work/life balance. The transparency continues elsewhere \u2013 you can see profiles of staff members and see who\u2019ll read your application if you apply.",
    "It\u2019s possible to use your AngelList profile as your resume, and there are sections to add your relevant history, skills and education. You can also list your website and social profiles. You can list what roles you\u2019re interested in, add a small biography and indicate if you\u2019re currently open to job offers.",
    "Elsewhere, many of the profile options are unsurprisingly startup-focused. There are questions about VISA sponsorship and the size of companies you\u2019d like to consider, and you can link your GitHub profile. The Culture section of your profile allows users to set out their ideal workplace, which is handy for finding an environment where you\u2019re more likely to be happy.",
    "AngelList also has other handy features and innovative additions on the rest of its site. You can specify if you\u2019re looking for full-time work, contract positions, or an internship, and there\u2019s an extensive quiz where you can match your preferred work environment and career goals to suitable workplaces. There are also skills assessments, like on most other job sites.",
    "There\u2019s a lot to like about AngelList, but in other areas the site is potentially divisive. It has a straightforward interface that presents job openings like search results, but those results are a bit busy and filled with potentially unhelpful information like news articles.",
    "It doesn\u2019t have as many features as LinkedIn Jobs and Glassdoor \u2013 you won\u2019t find learning resources, interview prep modules or proper social networking here. And, of course, AngelList\u2019s focus on startups means that it doesn\u2019t have the breadth of opportunities you\u2019ll find on mainstream sites.",
    "AngelList has thought of everything when it comes to startup recruitment. That makes it the best tool available if you want to work in the startup scene, and especially if you want a position at a tech company. If that sounds like you, then this should be your first port of call.",
    "It\u2019s undoubtedly excellent for startups, and it\u2019s got some good features \u2013 but if you want a broader look at the job market, you\u2019d be better off looking elsewhere."
