  "summary": "The new always-on display impresses, but not much else",
  "verdict": "The Apple Watch 5 is a premium smartwatch, but one that doesn't offer a huge upgrade over the Watch 4, apart from the very welcome always-on display. It hasn't risen in price, and there's more storage on offer \u2013 but many will find the cheaper Apple Watch 3 a more attractive device.",
  "pros": [
    "Always-on display",
    "More storage",
    "WatchOS 6 brings decent upgrades"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Too similar to Apple Watch 4",
    "Battery life poorer",
    "Always-on display too bright at night"
  ],
  "article": [
    "The Apple Watch 5 is no longer the latest Apple Watch, that honor goes to the Apple Watch 6 (and the cheaper Apple Watch SE). So if you're looking for Apple's top-end smartwatch, this isn't it anymore - to see how it compares to the new model, check out our Apple Watch 6 vs Apple Watch 5 article.",
    "Not only is this no longer the newest Apple Watch, but on paper the Apple Watch 5 was one of the most underwhelming upgrades Apple had ever unveiled. It\u2019s essentially the Watch 4 \u2013 one of our best smartwatches, admittedly \u2013 with a compass, more cellular bands to call emergency services worldwide (a noble achievement, if not something people will rip it off the shelves for) and not much more.",
    "Oh \u2013 except the screen now never switches off, dimming to an ambient, always-on display when you\u2019re not raising it to look straight at it. Apple has fixed one of the biggest bugbears about its smartwatch, and that\u2019s by far the biggest feature of this newer device.",
    "The always-on display is really useful, and we quickly got used to glancing at the Watch to see the time. It\u2019s actually a little too bright, as in dark conditions it glows rather alarmingly \u2013 so we found ourselves turning off the always-on feature regularly.",
    "Update: watchOS 8 was announced at WWDC 2021, bringing more software and features when it fully launches later this year. Eager fans can get the developer preview now if they're part of the developer program, or join the public beta in July.",
    "The Watch 5 design is exactly the same as the previous year\u2019s model, which isn\u2019t unexpected given that 2018 saw a big overhaul. Ceramic and titanium options now join the 40mm and 44mm Watch range (for different wrist sizes) and they look pretty sweet, although they do command a premium price.",
    "The fitness capabilities of the Watch 5 haven\u2019t been improved, but it\u2019s still a terrific health tracker: the heart rate monitor is accurate, an ECG feature offers further heart health monitoring, and the onboard GPS is pretty accurate (although not quite as high-performing as on dedicated running watches).",
    "You can swim, do high-intensity interval training, cycle and even practice yoga with the Watch 5 to fill up those all-important rings that monitor your daily active performance. However, this is all true of the slightly-smaller Watch 3, which is cheaper and still being sold by Apple.",
    "The music and podcast playback of the Watch 5 is strong, and with 32GB of space on board (an upgrade from 16GB last year) you can load up more Apple Music tunes or download more podcasts \u2013 although getting content onto the Watch can still be a struggle.",
    "WatchOS 7 brings some cool new features, with a noise meter and cycle tracking for women among our favorites: you can protect your hearing and get better period and fertility predictions right from the wrist, with both features feeling slick, and useful in a smartwatch.",
    "We\u2019re not huge fans of the new App Store on the Watch though, as it seems like the screen is still too small to access the portal properly.",
    "Battery life is the biggest issue we encountered on the Watch 5, with the always-on display pulling more life out of the smartwatch. The Watch 4 could easily make it past 24 hours, but the Watch 5 struggles to match that, and we were definitely reaching for the charger more regularly here.",
    "Given that the Watch 4 is off-sale, the Watch 5 is simply an upgrade, with more storage, a compass and an always-on display\u2026 turn that off and it\u2019s just a slightly-updated smartwatch for 2019.",
    "We found that it still excelled in some areas, and it's another hugely competent device for your wrist, but the Apple Watch 5 still feels like an underwhelming upgrade, and we\u2019d point you towards the now reasonably-priced Watch 3 as a great alternative.",
    "The Apple Watch 5 was introduced alongside the iPhone 11 range on September 10, 2020 and it's on sale now around the world. It costs $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649 for the GPS-only model in the smaller 40mm size. The 44mm size costs a bit more, at $429 / \u00a3429 / AU$699.",
    "The 40mm cellular model starts at $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$799, and goes up to $529 / \u00a3529 / AU$849 for the 44mm size. Most people won't need the LTE version if they're always carrying their iPhone with them, but the larger 44mm size usually nets you better battery life, and offers larger touch points on the slightly bigger screen.",
    "The Apple Watch 5 starting price is for the aluminum case, which comes in three familiar finishes: Gold, Space Black, and Silver. One new perk is that this year's case is made of 100% recycled aluminum.",
    "You can also pick it up in stainless steel for a higher price \u2013 $699 with a sport loop or sport band, $749 with a Milanese loop, or $799 with a leather loop. The all-new titanium Apple Watch 5, in light and dark finishes, starts at $799 with a sport loop and goes up to $899 with a leather loop.",
    "The Watch will once again come in a white Ceramic finish, starting at $1,299 with a sport loop and going up to $1,399 with a leather loop.",
    "All that said, with the launch of the Apple Watch 6, the company has discontinued the Watch 5 - that said, you can still get it from third-party retailers, theoretically for the prices above, though we'd expect to see it getting discounted soon.",
    "Let\u2019s get something out of the way right now: the always-on display rocks. It\u2019s a brilliant upgrade from Apple, and it\u2019s been well thought-out in a number of ways.",
    "It\u2019ll take owners of previous-gen Watches about five minutes to go from automatically raising / flicking their wrist to activate the screen to expecting to see the time when their eyes just wander down to their Apple Watch 5.",
    "This ease of transition is because that\u2019s how we all know a watch is supposed to be used: you look at it, you see the time. That\u2019s what the Watch now offers, and it means that rather than you having to rely on muscle memory it works like a regular watch when you want to, you know, see the time.",
    "Apple should have taken this a little further though \u2013 the display dims when not in use, but not enough. If you\u2019re in a darker environment the Watch 5 still shines like a beacon on your wrist \u2013 and if you want to wear it at night then it\u2019s highly distracting.",
    "We found ourselves activating Cinema Mode in darker conditions \u2013 Apple should have added an ultra-low brightness mode, something akin to the luminescent watch hands on some regular watches \u2013 easily visible to others, but not distracting. This would have saved power, too.",
    "Apple talked up the new low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) technology used in the Apple Watch 5 as the reason it could make the device run for longer \u2013 when actually it\u2019s the same tech used in last year\u2019s OLED display from the Apple Watch 4.",
    "While the Apple Watch 5 has new display drivers and an improved light sensor to allow the screen to dim more efficiently and preserve battery, we can\u2019t help but feel that this could have been done on the Watch 4. Was Apple holding off from unveiling this tech until 2019 so it could provide an upgrade to its smartwatch range, or did it need the extra 12 months to develop the necessary components to make it work?",
    "Either way, the use of LTPO means one thing: the Apple Watch 5 can go from a fast, 60Hz refresh rate (where the refreshes at 60 frames per second) down to just 1Hz, where it will only change every second.",
    "The tricky thing for smartwatch manufacturers is to make a display that can alter this dynamically, switching refresh rate seamlessly depending on the situation \u2013 and Apple\u2019s managed that well. Going from \u2018dim\u2018 to \u2018full\u2019 mode is instantaneous, and the raise-to-wake functionality is as fluid as ever.",
    "However, there is one issue: this always-on functionality isn\u2019t available with every app. Every watch face will brighten and dim accordingly, and during a workout using Apple\u2019s dedicated app the Watch 5 won\u2019t turn off \u2013 which is brilliant when you\u2019re running fast or trying to do a plank or press-up.",
    "But, beyond the home screen or workout app, the always-on display will just blur out what\u2019s underneath and place a boring digital clock on the screen.",
    "This even includes Apple\u2019s own apps, like timers. We\u2019d have liked to see Apple improve all the relevant apps on the Watch to work with the ambient mode \u2013 and enable developers to integrate this functionality into their apps too.",
    "That last point is particularly infuriating in the case of apps like Strava, which many people use to get more functionality out of their Watch, and it means the always-on display isn\u2019t as fully implemented as some might have hoped.",
    "We\u2019d have understood if the apps hadn\u2019t been adapted yet, but to learn that no such updates are on the horizon is pretty disappointing. Apple says the situation will be reviewed as time goes on, and we can see Apple announcing new \u2018ambient\u2019 modes for its own apps in new updates, but it\u2019s going to be a while before third-party developers are able to get on board \u2013 if they ever can.",
    "It\u2019s hard to say anything new at all about the design of the Apple Watch 5 because it\u2019s so similar to how the range has looked since its inception (the larger screen launched last year notwithstanding).",
    "You\u2019re getting the same curved aluminum frame (in the base Watch model) around the outside, a square display, and the Digital Crown \u2013 a button you can twiddle or press to scroll through menus or access other functions \u2013 on the side.",
    "Below that a lozenge-shaped button allows you to see your most recent apps, as well as activate Apple Pay so you can buy things without needing to whip out your wallet or purse (or phone).",
    "The design has quickly become iconic, fusing the bright and colorful OLED display with the shiny frame \u2013 and this year, ceramic and titanium options will be added to the mix if you fancy paying a little more for a premium finish.",
    "While it\u2019s coming to most of the Apple Watch range, WatchOS 6 shines brightest on the latest model, and the Apple Watch 5 uses its new features well That said, these features will be landing on the older Watches as well, meaning that if you\u2019re simply buying a Watch for fitness use \u2013 and if you can take or leave the new always-on display \u2013 you\u2019d be well served by the Watch 4, or even the Watch 3, which remains on sale from Apple.",
    "There are a few new features that the OS brings, beyond little design tweaks (the Now Playing screen that controls your phone\u2019s music is clearer and more feature-rich, and the Walkie-Talkie mode now tells you to press and hold the yellow circle to talk, as clearly that was confusing some people), and they do add more to the Watch\u2019s functionality.",
    "One of the new features, Activity Trends, requires you to use the watch for at least 90 days before it can track what you're up to \u2013 it did pull in some historical data, but it was scattered and inaccurate. When it\u2019s working, though, these trends will tell you whether you\u2019re getting faster, fitter, doing more stair climbing\u2026 essentially the trends of your activity.",
    "Noise meter",
    "Something we do like \u2013 a lot \u2013 is the noise meter that\u2019s now built into the watch. Wearing this all the time means you\u2019re constantly tracking the ambient noise around you \u2013 a protection system for your hearing.",
    "You can set up notifications to let you know if you\u2019re in an environment that\u2019s too noisy, although we rarely noticed these when they came through.",
    "What\u2019s of more use is seeing in the app how your day-to-day environment is affecting your hearing, whether you\u2019re in noise environments too much. We\u2019re already being told we\u2019re in places that are too noisy regularly, but it\u2019s hard to work out where \u2013 so perhaps monitoring the watch a little more would make sense.",
    "Cycle tracking",
    "This new feature added to the Watch comes directly from the health app, where women can set up notifications on when their period is likely to start, or monitor fertility windows.",
    "It\u2019s one of those apps that\u2019s perfect for the smartwatch, as you can easily enter when your period begins, whether you\u2019ve noticed spotting, any symptoms you\u2019ve experienced \u2013 all being used to build a predicted picture of when your period is likely to start.",
    "The interface is simple on the Watch 5, with the stylish icon allowing you to tap when your period begins, and each day it continues, with options to monitor whether it\u2019s light, medium or heavy. A simple tap is all it takes, which is far more convenient than having to drag your phone out each time.",
    "You can even log sexual activity to help you monitor possible fertility \u2013 while the main benefit is the information displayed in a larger way on the iPhone health app, it\u2019s a nice addition to the watch to help make sure you can log the key information easily.",
    "App store",
    "Being able to download apps right to the Watch is neat; for the most effective searches you\u2019ll want to use your voice, rather than drawing the letters one by one using the Scribble input option.",
    "Downloads happen fairly quickly, although you\u2019ll need to have your iPhone handy to log in to your Apple ID, unless, again, you want to draw every letter with your finger. (Doing this actually caused our Apple Watch 5 to crash momentarily, although it was back up and running in a few seconds).",
    "Scrolling through the available apps is fun for a moment, but you'll soon decide that this is something you\u2019d rather do on the phone. Except\u2026 you can\u2019t. The App Store is now locked to the Watch, and can't be accessed on your phone\u2019s larger screen.",
    "On top of that, some apps will need the main app installed on the phone anyway in order to function, so having the App Store on the small Watch screen doesn\u2019t currently seem all that useful.",
    "The Apple Watch 5 has received precisely zero upgrades to its fitness capabilities in terms of hardware, so the GPS, heart rate monitor and accelerometer (to track your steps) inside are exactly the same as in the Apple Watch 4.",
    "There is one small hardware upgrade here \u2013 there\u2019s now a compass inside the Watch, which allows you to see which way you\u2019re going, and which uses GPS to work out your elevation, or height above sea level.",
    "While this will be a good feature for hikers \u2013 we did notice that the compass was slick, and seemed effective at finding true north \u2013 it\u2019s not something we used very often, and trying it with apps like Night Sky, which uses the compass to navigate around, didn\u2019t feel like much more than a novelty.",
    "What would be great is if this feature were added into a \u2018home beacon\u2019 option on the Apple Watch, so that if you get lost it tells you which direction to follow back to where you started (which would be useful if you don\u2019t have your phone on you, or don't have a data connection).",
    "However, while there aren\u2019t any strong fitness upgrades with the Watch 5 (well, none at all, actually) it\u2019s still a great watch for those who are into exercising.",
    "We tested a few different activities over the course of our review, and generally we found everything to work as advertised. Taking the watch on four runs, we saw that the GPS was pretty accurate (around 0.03 miles out from our calibrated Garmin watch) and the heart rate monitor was strong enough to pick up our heart rate with relative accuracy, including during sprint sessions.",
    "During swimming, things were equally useful \u2013 counting the lengths and distance we\u2019d covered was pretty accurate, although annoyingly the Watch told us that we were always doing breast-stroke when it was clearly front crawl.",
    "The one thing that\u2019s missing from the mix is sleep tracking. Apple says this isn't an issue, as there are a bunch of third-party apps that can perform this function, but come on... having an integrated app would be far better.",
    "If Apple could extend the battery life beyond the 18 hours it\u2019s advertising to something approaching 2-3 days, that could easily allow for sleep tracking and help to provide a more holistic view of your health.",
    "Knowing how many zzz\u2019s you caught would give better context to your heart rhythm info, and allow for better fitness motivation at the right times \u2013 Apple is clearly hell-bent on making the best health and fitness watch out there, but it\u2019s still got a way to go before it\u2019s got all the necessary elements in place.",
    "Battery life is one of the key things we\u2019re interested in on the new Apple Watch, simply because is has to be worse, right? The display is always on, so that must mean the battery takes a hammering?",
    "We know we sound like we\u2019re setting this up to say \"No, it was actually better!\" but in fact the battery life on the Watch 5 isn\u2019t as good as we found on the previous iterations.",
    "Where before we could make it to the evening, around 9-10pm, with 50% left, here we\u2019d more often have around 5% less than that, with 40-45% in the tank.",
    "While that is worse, it\u2019s not dramatically so \u2013 Apple has only ever claimed 18 hours of use from a full charge, and while it\u2019s progressively extended the battery life with each new model, the latest Apple Watch will still crest 18 hours, even when you're running the battery down by exercising and using GPS.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re impressed with the battery life at all \u2013 a day\u2019s use is par for the course for most rivals, and given that a lot of those rivals are compatible with the iPhone, Apple really needs to step up and find a way to get 2-3-day battery life out of its smartwatch.",
    "The Apple Watch 5 certainly hasn\u2019t got the stamina of the Watch 4, which is clearly down to the always-on display. We estimate that this draws about 2% power per hour, which means you\u2019ve lost close to 50% over a 24-hour period before you\u2019ve even started using the Watch.",
    "That said, going for a run while listening to music and using the GPS tracking on your Apple Watch is one of the most battery-draining things you can do \u2013 and yet here we found the Apple Watch 5 was slightly more efficient.",
    "Pounding the parks for an hour while listening to some mesmerizing tunes downloaded to the Watch 5 drew 20% power, with the display on the whole time, yet last year the Apple Watch 4 dropped 22% \u2013 even taking into account some slight fluctuations in the numbers, we expected a far worse performance from the new Watch.",
    "This suggests that Apple has optimized the Watch 5 better for exercise and GPS use \u2013 and being able to glance at a workout on the go was certainly handy.",
    "We mentioned music just now, and that\u2019s another key area where the Watch 5 has been improved \u2013 you can download tunes and podcasts to your device and listen to them without a phone.",
    "To really make use of this feature, though, you need to activate the LTE data capabilities inside the phone (if you buy the more expensive Watch 5 variant), and this will cost more per month.",
    "However, if you can afford it, we suggest you do so, as it means you can listen to all manner of music through Apple Music or the included Radio app; without data on the Watch you can only listen to downloaded content, which is rather limiting.",
    "It\u2019s also hard to sync things to your Watch \u2013 you need to have it on charge and have your phone nearby, and even then there feels like an element of hoping about the situation.",
    "Too often we\u2019d go out on a run without our phone, listening to a new podcast, and we'd find that it started playing just fine, but when we got out of range of our phone we'd realize we hadn't downloaded it \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to check what's actually saved on the Watch. It\u2019s just not a simple system, and it really should be improved.",
