  "summary": "The rebooted iPhone we'd been waiting for",
  "verdict": "The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, yet one that really paid off six months into our testing. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",
  "pros": [
    "Great screen",
    "Premium, strong design",
    "TrueDepth camera is powerful"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "The most expensive flagship phone around",
    "Metal rim can scuff without case"

    "The iPhone X is the huge leap forward that Apple's handsets needed after ten years, and it's even better in 2021 thanks to its iOS 14 upgrade and continually-added new features. Aside from the original iPhone in 2007, the iPhone X had the biggest impact on Apple\u2019s smartphone direction ever \u2013 and even its newest successors haven't changed much of its design innovations.",
    "Apple itself is calling it the future of the smartphone, the embodiment of what it\u2019s been trying to achieve for a decade. But while the iPhone X is all about premium parts and an all-new experience, it was a huge gamble for the Cupertino brand too \u2013 which paid off, as every new iPhone since then has largely kept the design, up to the latest iPhone 12 Pro.",
    "Losing known, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone \u2013 and charging a lot more for the privilege \u2013 seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack.",
    "But the iPhone X is the handset we\u2019d been demanding from Apple for years \u2013 a world away from the increasingly-tired designs leading up to the iPhone 8 that have continued to live in the nearly identical-looking iPhone SE 2020.",
    "Watch our review of the iPhone X's design below.",
    "The fervor around this phone tells that story \u2013 everyone wants to know if the iPhone X is worth having, partly because it actually represents a new iPhone, and that fervor is such that they don\u2019t seem to care about the cost. Thankfully, that cost has come down over the years, and it's still a powerful phone.",
    "So\u2026 is the iPhone X worth having? Did it change the direction of an industry where many of the specs Apple has put in \u2013 fast charging, wireless charging, bezel-less displays and face recognition \u2013 are already on the market?",
    "We've had the iPhone X in our grasp for years now, and it's easily one of the best smartphones around \u2013 even in the face of the newest yet similar-looking iPhone 12 line including this phone's successor, the iPhone 12 Pro \u2013 but there are still a few things that might throw even long-time Apple fans.",
    "If you're loving your iPhones X, or considering buying one, the package is about to get a lot more tempting now that iOS 14 is out. Apple's latest operating system brings many new features like widgets, Dark Mode and a range of app speed increases, so you can make the most of your iPhone experience.",
    "Update: iOS 15 has been announced and it's coming to the iPhone X when it launches, likely in September. Features of iOS 15 include all sorts of FaceTime improvements (along with the ability for Android users to join calls), plus a redesigned weather app, additional details on Apple Maps, statuses in the Messages app, and more.",
    "It\u2019s almost pointless to discuss the iPhone X price \u2013 it launched as the most expensive flagship phone on the market and it's still pricey now, but iPhone users are more willing than most to look past cost.",
    "But, while the focus here is going to be on the technology, we still need to at least mention the price and release date. It's out now, having launched worldwide on November 3 2017. The price is harder to swallow.",
    "At launch, the iPhone X cost $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,579 for the basic, 64GB model. If you wanted the larger 256GB model it cost $1,149 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,829.",
    "Since then of course the iPhone XS has launched and as a result Apple has stopped selling the iPhone X. You can still buy it elsewhere though, and are looking at much more significant price drops in the years since it launched.",
    "Although it's expensive for sure, you can use our iPhone X deals page (UK only) to ensure you get the best value contract available.",
    "The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the new iPhone is hard to miss: the new screen blazes into your eyes the second you pick up the handset.",
    "The 5.8-inch OLED display is, quite simply, the best thing Apple has ever crammed into an iPhone, or it was, until the iPhone XS arrived. It\u2019s leaps ahead of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus for so many reasons: the sharpness, the quality, the fact that it fills the whole front of the phone, and the color reproduction.",
    "It\u2019s also using a new, longer, screen, but while it looks larger than the iPhone 8 Plus\u2019 5.5-inch display on paper, it\u2019s only marginally bigger in terms of actual screen real estate \u2013 it\u2019s just stretched upwards, so it's taller, not wider.",
    "OLED technology means you\u2019re getting deeper blacks and more blinding whites, so everything from websites to the photos you take in will look a little better.",
    "Some will point to the fact that Samsung has been using OLED screens on its phones since the first Galaxy, but Apple counters that by saying it\u2019s only now that the technology is good enough for its phones.",
    "On the face of it that sounds defensive, but when you use the iPhone X you can see it\u2019s a screen that\u2019s incredibly, well, Apple.",
    "It\u2019s not the sharpest or most colorful screen on a smartphone, but it\u2019s clean, crisp and doesn\u2019t suffer from terrible color shifts when you move it around. It\u2019s a great display to look at from all angles, and that\u2019s what you want on a mobile device.",
    "It's also been dubbed the best in the world, by the esteemed DisplayMate testing, showing that it's the brightest and more color-accurate OLED on the market and good off-centre brightness shifts - showing Apple can tune the tech from Samsung really well.",
    "The term \u2018bezel-less\u2019 has been bandied about for the iPhone X, but that doesn\u2019t really tell the right story. Yes, there are slight bands around the edges of the screen as this isn't a curved screen iPhone, but they don\u2019t mar the experience \u2013 they give the fingers something to land on, preventing accidental touches of the screen.",
    "Apple could reduce these further in the future and offer a more visually-appealing iPhone, but on the X the experience is still striking.",
    "Talking of visual appeal, the notch at the top of the iPhone X is something that\u2019s been divisive, and that\u2019s fair. Apple has taken this little chunk out of the top of the screen to house the new TrueDepth camera, and it encroaches on the display. A lot newer Android phones, including the OnePlus 6, copy this style, though even newer phones such as the OnePlus 6T are offering much smaller notches.",
    "In portrait mode it\u2019s hard to notice it\u2019s there, and the way the notifications bar spills around it is nice.",
    "However, place the phone in landscape mode and it\u2019s far more noticeable; it\u2019s an irritant when you\u2019re watching movies, as when we wanted to expand them to fill the screen (one of the real beauties of having a longer display) elements of the action were cut out by the notch.",
    "The longer screen is also thinner though - this means there's less real estate for typing. We didn't notice this at the start, but when flipping between the X and an older iPhone, you'll really see there's less space for your digits to tap onto.",
    "While we\u2019re talking about that longer screen, the 18:9 format is something we\u2019ve seen on a number of other phones this year, and in the Android world the apps are largely encoded to fill the display just fine.",
    "On the iPhone X, however, that\u2019s not the case, with many apps we used packing massive black bars above and below the display. That's quickly started to improve though, and each day more apps update for the longer screen.",
    "The issue with apps using the black bars is that it makes the iPhone X look like any other handset from Apple - even an iPhone 3GS \u2013 and given the screen is the main visual differentiator on this phone, and you want every app to fill the display nicely. There are now very few apps left that have these bars above and below, with most expanding the screen to fill the whole front of the phone and curve around the notch.",
    "The new display on the iPhone X also showcases a new feature for Apple: HDR playback. The phone can show movies encoded in the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats, and combined with the OLED display the images offer so much more depth and realistic color reproduction.",
    "If you\u2019re watching a scene with explosions in it, the effect is incredible on the iPhone X \u2013 much like with all OLED screens.",
    "However, it\u2019s inherently harder to make out detail in darker scenes in HDR movies \u2013 that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to adjust to.",
    "Compared to the LCD screen of the iPhone 8 Plus, there are times when you can see less of the action, but compare them side by side and you\u2019ll see that the overall richness, depth and quality for watching movies is just higher on the iPhone X.",
    "Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the X uses a True Tone display, which mimics the lighting conditions around it and will adjust the white balance accordingly. It\u2019s not a reason to buy the phone on its own, but it\u2019s a really premium little extra that you\u2019ll grow to like."
