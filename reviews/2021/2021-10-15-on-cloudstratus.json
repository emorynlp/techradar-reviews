  "summary": "On\u2019s max cushioned shoe offers a firm, yet stable ride for long, easy runs",
  "verdict": "The OnCloudStratus is the ideal shoe for runners who want a high level of cushioning, with the kind of protective upper that\u2019s built for short and long training runs at easy to moderate paces. The firmness in the ride won\u2019t be for everyone, but it still provides a stable, smooth feel underfoot to help make it a solid daily trainer option.",
  "pros": [
    "Protective and breathable upper",
    "Good fit for long training runs",
    "Typically great On look"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Might be a bit too firm for some",
    "That outsole can still trap debris",
    "Not the lightest"

    "The On CloudStratus isn\u2019t going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the improvements made on the first shoe make it a far nicer shoe to go the distance in for easy to moderately paced training runs. They\u2019re also a good option if you want something you can throw on for runs but also keep on when you\u2019re not.",
    "The wide fitting upper makes it more accommodating for a bigger range of feet sizes and with recycled materials in use, On is showing that it\u2019s thinking more on the sustainability front here too.",
    "Doubling up on its CloudTec cushioning technology and matching it up with the slightly firm feeling Helion midsole foam means you get a nicely responsive ride and something that\u2019s well equipped to eat up a lot of running time.",
    "The On Cloudstratus was released in August 2021, priced at $169.99 / \u00a3150 / AU$259.95. You can buy it direct from On, or from third-party retailers.",
    "If there\u2019s one thing On usually gets right, it\u2019s making an attractive running shoe, and that doesn\u2019t change with the second generation CloudStratus. There are two colourways each for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s shoe, and the white and black look we had to lace up embraces the look of its speedy CloudBoom Echo. It\u2019s a look that gets a thumbs up from us.",
    "It's a little lighter than the original CloudStratus at 305g for the mens\u2019s shoe and 248g for the women\u2019s version, but offers the same 8mm heel to toe drop, sitting at 36mm at the heel and 28mm at the forefoot. The mesh upper now uses 75% of polyester made from recycled materials, and there\u2019s ventilated areas at the side and forefoot to make sure it\u2019s a shoe that\u2019s nice and breathable to run in.",
    "Padding on the tongue and the heel collar offers a snug, secure fit, while the star lacing system delivers a nice locked-down feel. The heel counter has been reduced to cut down on overall weight, but still offers good support back there to make sure it\u2019s fit for running long and getting the most from the cushioning system.",
    "Slipping your feet in, it\u2019s definitely a roomy, wide-fitting upper, particularly in the toe box, which gives your toes a little more space to breathe, making it ideal when you need that extra room as you up the distance.",
    "Below that upper is the upgraded midsole, which is now made up of two layers of On\u2019s CloudTec cushioning technology, and runs from the heel all the way to the forefoot of the shoe to help provide a smooth and consistent feeling underfoot. That\u2019s matched up with On\u2019s Helion foam and Speedboard to offer smooth transitions and help generate good energy return too.",
    "On the outsole, On has focused on placing extra rubber in areas that\u2019s likely to take the most regular pounding, whether you\u2019re a heel or a forefoot striker. There\u2019s less of that rubber here too, likely in a bid to make this a lighter shoe compared to the last CloudStratus while still keeping things stable.",
    "On says this is a shoe that\u2019s built for anything from 5k to marathon distance, and while that might be true, you\u2019re probably not going to ring out your quickest times in them. They do feel like a good training shoe for short runs and cranking up the mileage but sticking to easy to moderate paces in them.",
    "Like a lot of On\u2019s shoes, you\u2019re not getting the softest feeling underfoot thanks to the make-up of its favored CloudTec cushioning. Doubling up on that cushioning though, and matching up with its Helion midsole foam along with its Speedboard (just like its predecessor) means it\u2019s something that\u2019s a little on the firm side, but still offers a nicely responsive ride. It\u2019s one you can feel confident running far in and it\u2019ll feel consistent and a stable shoe to run in.",
    "That upper offers plenty in the way of protection, and while the heel counter has been pared back compared to the first CloudStratus, it still offers plenty of stability back there.",
    "Another real plus here is the rubber outsole that offered solid grip on dry and wet roads, and it even held up OK on some off-road time (though doing the latter does put you at risk of collecting unwanted debris in the sizable gap in the outsole).",
    "The less great news is that, while it\u2019s lighter than the last CloudStratus, it\u2019s still a heavy shoe compared to other max cushioned shoes out there. It doesn\u2019t feel like a clunky shoe to run in, but shoes like the Brooks Ghost 14 and the New Balance FreshFoam 1080v11 in comparison do feel lighter to run in.",
    "Ultimately, the improvements that On has made here have paid off on the whole. It still feels like a shoe to put on when you want something that\u2019s reliable, offers good protection, and gives a reasonably enjoyable ride. There are plusher maximum cushioned shoes out there, but if you want a mix of cushioning and a protective upper, the new CloudStratus does a really good job."
