  "verdict": "The Beats Flex bring the brand-name wireless headphones to the masses at a lower price, but it\u2019s not without making some big sacrifices in sound quality and design. We don\u2019t love them as much as the top-tier AirPods Pro or even the Powerbeats Pro, but if you just bought a new iPhone and want a pair of affordable Beats earbuds to go with it, the Flex could fit the bill.",

    "Nearly a year on from the launch of the Beats Flex and we still feel the same way about them: they're affordable, but still premium, earbuds from Beats. They have traditional Beats sound with a traditional Beats design and many of the same features of other Beats headphones, but at a quintessentially non-Beats price.",
    "Some of those included features are the Apple W1 Wireless Chip; a built-in sensor for auto-play/pause; a 12-hour battery life with Fast Fuel and, our personal favorite, a laser cut micro-venting chamber to reduce in-ear pressure.",
    "On paper, the Beats Flex are a great deal \u2013 but, spend some time with them, and you\u2019ll understand why the price is what it is.",
    "[Update: There's a new pair of Beats earbuds on the scene: the Beats Studio Buds are cheaper than the AirPods Pro, but still come with active noise cancellation, excellent audio quality, and a cool design.]",
    "The Beats Flex were announced on September 13 2020, the same day as Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 event, and launched in two colors \u2013 Beats Black and Yuzu Yellow \u2013 on Apple\u2019s website October 21, before hitting all retailers on November 20.",
    "On January 20 2021, Beats added two more color options to the lineup, Smoke Gray and Flame Blue, that also look pretty slick.",
    "The price for the Beats Flex is set at $49.99 (\u00a350, around AU$70) which makes them the cheapest wireless earbuds the company's ever launched, costing even less than the wired urBeats3. There are still some decent alternatives out there in that price range (see: Optoma Nuforce BE4 or OnePlus Bullets 2) but they\u2019re pretty affordable for the usually premium brand.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that, with Apple removing the pack-in headphones from the latest iPhones, the Beats Flex are the obvious choice for folks who need a pair of earbuds \u2013 and if you\u2019re only buying them for that reason, well, the Flex are a decent alternative to Apple's usually lackluster pack-in earbuds.",
    "Although Beats hasn\u2019t said it to us directly, the Beats Flex seems to be a direct sequel to the older BeatsX Headphones that it released in 2016. Both are wireless (but not truly wireless like the Powerbeats Pro or Apple AirPods) and look identical.",
    "The earbuds themselves are actually fairly light (18.6g), but the cord that runs between them is about 32 inches and wraps around the back of your neck. It\u2019s a bit cumbersome having such a long cord wrap around your neck and, admittedly, having the two earbuds connected via a cable isn\u2019t exactly what we\u2019d consider the ideal solution in 2020.",
    "That said, the cable isn\u2019t without its advantages: first and foremost is the fact that they\u2019re harder to lose than fully wireless earbuds. The second is that the wire between the two buds can provide a home to in-line volume controls, a multi-feature button and a bigger battery, allowing the headphones to last longer between charges.",
    "What about a play/pause button? Well, you can use the multi-feature button, but the Beats Flex are also equipped with a sensor that will automatically pause the music when you take them off, and resume the music when you put them back on. Not only is that handy, but it can save you a ton of battery life, too.",
    "Speaking of, charging is done through a USB-C port on the left side of the earbuds near the volume controls. According to Beats, the headphones have a 12-hour battery life and fast charging that can provide an hour-and-a-half of playback off a 10-minute charge.",
    "The difference between the Beats Flex and more expensive Apple wireless earbuds like the AirPods Pro is that the latter uses the newer H1 Wireless Chip that enables hands-free Siri while the former uses the older W1 Chip. Besides hands-free Siri, the more expensive H1 Chip supports Bluetooth 5 versus the W1\u2019s Bluetooth 4.2, which means you\u2019ll get a slightly longer battery life with the H1 Chip, too.",
    "Surprisingly, though, we didn\u2019t find any of that to be a deal-breaker. The W1 Chip is less advanced than the H1 but it still gets the job done, and the semi-wireless form factor is manageable if a little unwieldy. In fact, so far, the biggest fault of the Beats Flex\u2019s design is that they don\u2019t come with wing tips to secure them in your ear \u2013 without them, getting that perfect seal can be finicky and can come undone easily.",
    "On a positive note, the Beats Flex does come with a few different eartips \u2013 including some large and double-flange tips \u2013 that can help make finding the perfect fit a little easier.",
    "After trying a few combinations of eartips we eventually landed on a decent seal and were finally able to test out the Beats Flex\u2019s audio quality. What we heard is pretty much what you\u2019d expect \u2013 a deep v-shaped sound that accentuates the highs and lows of the audio spectrum at the expense of the mids.",
    "In our two weeks with the headphones we listened to a bunch of songs on Amazon Prime Music and Spotify, and have a good idea of what you can expect in terms of sound quality. What we found was that the sound quality was actually relatively clear for a pair of in-ear drivers, however they don\u2019t have a very large soundstage to the audio. Thankfully, there wasn\u2019t any drop out or delay in the audio during our testing, which can be a problem with wireless models, so that stability is a huge boon for the Beats Flex.",
    "While all songs mostly had the same steep v-shape, a few examples worth calling out were bass-heavy classics like Rick James\u2019 Super Freak and the treble-rich Jackson 5\u2019s ABC that truly exemplified the rich treble and chunky bass. Unfortunately these songs also highlight how anemic the mids sound, so proceed with caution. On that note, there\u2019s also no real way to tweak the EQ if you\u2019re not happy with the default sound \u2013 which is a bit of a bummer.",
    "Now, if you\u2019re using the Beats Flex with an iOS device, you\u2019ll get prompts to sync them to your Apple ID and iCloud \u2013 which, in total, takes under a minute. But if you use Android, you\u2019ll have to pair them like a regular pair of Bluetooth earbuds which not only takes a bit longer but will impact the sound quality as the Beats Flex doesn\u2019t support high-end audio codecs like aptX or aptX HD \u2013all you\u2019ll find here is SBC and AAC.",
    "It goes without saying, but at this price the Beats Flex also doesn't offer noise cancellation, either. The right eartips can help provide some passive noise isolation by sealing off your ear canal, but there\u2019s no fancy noise-cancellation tech inside of them to block out unwanted noise on your next plane flight.",
    "The good news here is that people we spoke to with the earbuds on said we sounded great - even better than we did over speakerphone or other headsets. That\u2019s a huge feather in the Flex\u2019s cap and could make them great work-from-home or out-on-the-town headphones.",
    "You also can\u2019t knock them for their battery life: you\u2019ll get a little less than 12 hours of use per charge, and charging only takes about an hour or two. That said, if you need some quick charge just to get from work back to the house, Fast Fuel (Beats\u2019 name for fast charging) does provide an hour-and-a-half of battery life from only a 10-minute charge.",
    "The last feature that\u2019s worth pointing out is that the Beats Flex \u2013 like all W1 or H1 Chip headphones \u2013 will have iOS\u2019s new audio sharing feature that allows you to share music between two pairs of headphones. It\u2019s not a killer app by any means, but it is nice if you\u2019re in a house with multiple Apple or Beats headphones and like to share music."
