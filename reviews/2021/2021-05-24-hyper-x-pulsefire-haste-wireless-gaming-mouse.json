    "The HyperX Pulsefire Haste wireless gaming mouse is such great value for money. It\u2019s ultra-lightweight, and has a gorgeous and subtle RGB lighting, making it a slice of pure gaming mouse joy.",
    "The most striking thing about it is the honeycomb perforations that keep its weight down, and look, we think, very cool. It\u2019s small and black with a soft-matte finish, and has RGB lighting running around each side of the scroll wheel. The thumb buttons are glossy plastic, as are the four-level preset DPI button \u2013 by default 400, 800, 1600 and 3,200 DPI \u2013 located below the scroll wheel.",
    "The Pulsefire Haste\u2019s 3335 pixart sensor has a max resolution of up to 16,000 DPI, making tracking super-accurate and a great peripheral for any gaming genre that asks for quick, accurate movements, like RTS and FPS.",
    "The Haste comes with grip tape, which you can stick on yourself, but we didn\u2019t feel the need. Also included are replacement PTFE mouse skates. The mouse grips work very well on hard surfaces like wood.",
    "The Pulsefire Haste is wired, but its 1.8m braided cable is so flexible you won\u2019t notice it while gaming, and you could in fact use it to tie your shoes (though we don't recommend using it in that way).",
    "Add to this its weight \u2013 59g (very light) \u2013 and you get a featherweight mouse that indeed floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.",
    "Its mesh shell allows for air to flow through it better, making it well ventilated. That additional \u201cventilation\u201d is no doubt the reason the Haste\u2019s switches are TTC Golden Micro Dustproofs \u2013 nobody likes dust in their peripherals. Or coffee \u2013 it should be mentioned that this one\u2019s perforated design will increase your chance of spilling something in it.",
    "We put the Pulsefire Haste to the test on several different games, from MOBAs to FPS games, and found no issues with it. It\u2019s super-comfortable to play with, and can stand strong against other mice that are multiples of its price.",
    "Speaking of price, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste sells for an impressive $50 (\u00a350, AU$90) and comes with a 2 year warranty. For US customers it\u2019s available to purchase on the HyperX US site, HyperX UK site, for UK customers and at a reduced AU$72.12 on Amazon for Australian customers.",
    "It\u2019s super easy to set up, you just plug it in and you\u2019re good to go. It\u2019s compatible with any plug and play PC, although the HyperX\u2019s configuration software, NGENUITY only works on Windows. With it, you can set up your macros, bindings and customize the RGB lighting.",
    "While we have very few criticisms of the Pulsefire Haste, it does have lackluster lighting effect options. There are only four: breathing, cycle, solid and fade. But you can program them in all sorts of ways.",
    "So if you\u2019re looking for a light well-designed, aesthetically pleasing and great-value-for-money gaming mouse, then \u2013 need we say more? The Haste doesn\u2019t have the best RGB customization settings, and potentially there are more ergonomic mice, but it is still a worthy gaming mouse that can lead you and your team to victory."
