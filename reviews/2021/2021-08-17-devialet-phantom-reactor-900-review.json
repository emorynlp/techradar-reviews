    "Devialet's Phantom speaker line screams opulence. From their sci-fi stylings to their expressively wild side-firing bass reflex ports, they look unlike anything else on the market \u2013 but the speakers have also been big, heavy, and intimidatingly expensive, too.",
    "The company is now looking to make its wares a little more approachable with two new speakers, the Devialet Phantom Reactor 900 and Devialet Phantom Reactor 600. We\u2019re looking at the former of the two, with its 900W output compared to the latter\u2019s 600W. Smaller and more affordable than the full-size Phantom speakers, the Phantom Reactor 900 still packs a punch, and still looks like a prop from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey \u2013 and that\u2019s no bad thing.",
    "But by pointing the shrink ray at the full-size Phantom has any compromise been made? And is that sleek design worth the premium price tag?",
    "[Update: The Devialet Phantom Reactor 900 has been given a name change \u2013 it's now known as the Phantom II. And, it's currently available in another color \u2013 Sage Green. There are only 1000 units, so it's pretty exclusive.]",
    "The Phantom Reactor line up is available to buy now. Prices start at $999/ \u00a3990 / AU$1990 for the Phantom Reactor 600 and go up to $1299 / \u00a31290 / AU$2490 for the Phantom Reactor 900, which is reviewed here.",
    "It's still not cheap, but it is uniquely designed, offering superior audio quality over the majority of single standalone Bluetooth speakers, though not quite the audio performance you\u2019d get from less lavishly-designed stereo systems of a similar price.",
    "Keep that in mind if audio performance is your absolute priority, though to all but the most highly tuned ears, it\u2019s a very pleasing unit.",
    "You'll find it in stores including Selfridges, JohnLewis.com, Amazon UK and Harrods in the UK, and Corso Como, B8ta, Nordstrom, Microsoft Store, Barneys and Amazon in the US, as well as Mr Porter worldwide.",
    "You won\u2019t find a speaker that looks anything like the Phantom Reactor from any manufacturer other than Devialet \u2013 it\u2019s a truly unique design.",
    "Coming in either a gloss white finish or matte black, it looks a bit like some sort of space-aged vitamin pill, being broadly ovaloid in shape. The Devialet logo, cut from the chassis itself, sits like an eye on the front of the speaker, with ventilation grills curving down from the back.",
    "Given its 219mm (length) x 157 mm (width) x 168 mm (height) size, it's an astonishingly loud system \u2013 comparable to a symphony orchestra in your living room if blasting at full volume.",
    "Likewise, the 18Hz infra-bass would lead you to believe there's a dedicated subwoofer in the room \u2013 made all the more dramatic by the way the bass-reflex ports on either side of the Phantom Reactor pump air rhythmically and forcefully in time with the beat.",
    "However, don\u2019t confuse this for a portable speaker \u2013 you\u2019re going to need a mains supply to power that mad output, and it remains deceptively heavy at 4.3kg.",
    "Along the top of the speaker you\u2019ll find five touch-sensitive capacitive buttons \u2013 volume up, volume down, play/pause, Bluetooth pairing / input selection and the link button that\u2019s used when setting up the device with its accompanying control app.",
    "They\u2019re a welcome addition, given how all control of the Phantom line was determined by app alone in previous models.",
    "Physical inputs now include a hybrid minijack and optical point for TVs, as well as an Ethernet connection if that\u2019s your best bet for stable broadband. Wireless connectivity includes Bluetooth, AirPlay, UPnP and Spotify Connect, but you don\u2019t get any support for voice assistants, be that Amazon\u2019s Alexa, the Google Assistant or Apple\u2019s Siri.",
    "For the price, it feels like an oversight, given as they\u2019re in basically everything these days. You\u2019ll have to jump into the app to control the speaker from afar then, but it\u2019s at least mercifully simple, with just playback controls and source options taking up the majority of the application.",
    "All in, it\u2019s a fantastic-looking speaker. If you like your tech to be as much talking point as gadget, the Phantom Reactor 900 will set tongues wagging.",
    "Thankfully, the Phantom Reactor 900 is more than just a pretty face too \u2013 it sounds phenomenal, if falling just a little short of the price-to-performance ratio we\u2019d hope for in a more-than-a-grand speaker.",
    "Despite the small package and extreme volume levels, the Phantom Reactor 900 is able to deliver its output without as much as a hint of distortion as it approaches louder peaks.",
    "Its Analog Digital Hybrid (ADH) amp delivers the quality of an analogue amp in a digital-sized package, while the company's Speaker Active Matching signal processing system retains detail even at the Phantom Reactor 900's 98db max volume.",
    "Thanks to its 24bit/192kHz hi-res DAC and Wi-Fi connection, you\u2019ve room to play around with high-resolution audio sources, too.",
    "Bass impact will be a big draw here. Primal Scream\u2019s Kill All Hippies from the XTRMNTR album is awash with processed guitars and samples, but when its bass line crunches in, the Phantom Reactor delivers it with weight, and taut energy.",
    "It\u2019s even more pronounced during the percussive \u2018Why So Serious?\u2019 element of Hans Zimmer\u2019s Dark Knight soundtrack, where an intense sub bass movement holds its integrity immaculately, while still allowing the sharp stopwatch-like clicks to be present.",
    "It doesn\u2019t lack in detail with softer moments either. James Rhodes\u2019 take on Claude Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune saw the Phantom Reactor 900 beautifully represent the piano piece\u2019s twinkling highs and comforting mids, without smothering either section. There\u2019s a dynamism present that can reveal details at both the most soft and dramatic moments.",
    "But there is the sensation of everything feeling a bit narrow \u2013 bands crammed onto a soapbox rather than a stage. It remains a heartily enjoyable listen, but the design here does little to provide a more natural, wider sense of space.",
    "Devialet\u2019s Phantom Reactor 900 is a marvel to witness in action. There\u2019s no other speaker out there (other than another Phantom, that is) that, through its design, can give the sense of kinetic action your music delivers. It\u2019s futuristic, detailed, and fun.",
    "It suffers in its soundstage though, lacking the width you\u2019d hope to find in such a pricey speaker.",
    "It makes the Devialet Phantom Reactor 900 difficult to wholeheartedly recommend on pure audio quality alone \u2013 but it\u2019s a single black mark against its name, rather than one that sullies the whole.",
    "It\u2019s overall a marvelous piece of engineering, and an enjoyable audio device in its own right even when taking its striking looks out of the equation."
