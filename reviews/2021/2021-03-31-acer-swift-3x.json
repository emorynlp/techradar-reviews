    "We were very impressed with the Acer Swift 3X. It\u2019s a brilliant laptop that manages to deliver a lot despite its size and weight. This very well could be the best Acer laptop \u2013 if not the best laptop \u2013 for someone who works on the go.",
    "At just 3.1lbs (1.4kg) the Swift 3X is incredibly light, and measuring only 12.7 x 8.4 x 0.7-inches (17.95 x 322.8 x 212.2 mm) you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble carrying this laptop with you on your commute.",
    "The model we were sent was packaged with an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and an integrated Iris Xe Max graphics chip. The Acer Swift 3X had more than enough power to handle a typical workload in most jobs - and it\u2019ll have school and college work covered too.",
    "An upgraded version of the Swift 3X with an Intel i7 CPU alongside 16GB RAM and 1TB SSB will likely be overkill for most people, but if your work needs the power boost it\u2019ll be worth it.",
    "The only downside of the hardware is the screen. The display itself looks good, but 14-inches can be noticeably small. If you\u2019re used to a larger monitor, it takes a little adjusting to.",
    "However, you can\u2019t complain about the battery. This thing lasts for a surprisingly long time, so as long as it\u2019s fully charged up when you leave, you should be able to get away with leaving your laptop charging cable at home.",
    "In the worst-case scenario, if you carry a USB-C phone charger around you should be able to keep your device alive for a while longer.",
    "All of this is packaged in a reasonably priced, mid-range laptop that is well worth the $899.99 / \u00a3899.99 / AU$1,199 price tag it comes with. If you're looking for your next work laptop, the Acer Swift 3X is definitely one to consider.",
    "The Acer Swift 3X is available starting at $899.99 / \u00a3899.99 / AU$1,199. At that price you\u2019ll get an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and a 14-inch full-HD screen. You\u2019ll also get Intel\u2019s integrated Iris Xe Max graphics.",
    "That\u2019s the model we tested, and we\u2019d safely say that for what you\u2019re paying, you\u2019re more than getting your money\u2019s worth out of this laptop.",
    "For $1,199 / \u00a31,199.99 / AU$1,599.99 you can grab a version of the Acer Swift 3X with an Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor, 16GB RAM and 1TB SSB. The cheaper version offers more than enough power for regular use, but if you\u2019re looking to spend a bit more for a laptop that packs a stronger punch you\u2019d again be hard pressed to find something better.",
    "As for availability, it seems like the Swift 3X is a popular laptop as it was a little difficult to find when we searched for it online. It can take a little bit of looking across the UK, Australia and the US to find the exact model you\u2019re after \u2014 something that isn\u2019t helped by the similarly named Swift 3.",
    "However, the Acer Swift 3X is well worth looking for, as it should be able to pull off almost everything you could need. It\u2019s not going to be suited to heavy duty tasks like 4K video editing or high-end gaming, but for regular work \u2014 and more casual photo or video editing \u2014 we found this laptop can more than handle what you throw at it.",
    "What you get with the Acer Swift 3X is a fairly standard, yet clean, laptop design. It won\u2019t blow you away, but we still like the look and feel of it. Our only worry is that the screen seems a little thin, as it feels like it wouldn\u2019t take much to break it \u2014 though thankfully we didn\u2019t find out during our review.",
    "Apart from that, the HD display is good. Acer\u2019s Swift 3X comes with a 14-inch (35.6 cm) LCD screen that looks great and uses ComfyView (anti-glare) technology. A slightly larger display would be nice, but that\u2019s our only complaint on this front.",
    "We\u2019re also fans of the fingerprint scanner. It was as easy to set up as on any smartphone, and we found it reliable too. However, it was placed off to the side in a slightly weird position below the keyboard, rather than being incorporated into the trackpad or power button. If you find it awkward to use, you can always opt for a more traditional password or pin instead.",
    "Weighing in at 3.1lbs (1.4kg) this laptop is incredibly lightweight and can easily be picked up with one hand. Measuring only 12.7 x 8.4 x 0.7-inches (17.95 x 322.8 x 212.2 mm) it will fit in most bags too, so you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble carrying it around wherever you go.",
    "However, the small size does come at a cost, as ports-wise the Swift 3X is a little lacking. On the left side, there are USB-A 3.2, HDMI and USB-C 3.2 ports. The USB-C slot doubles as an alternative laptop charging port too if you\u2019re looking to reduce the number of cables you carry with you.",
    "Over on the right, you\u2019ll find another USB-A 3.2 port as well as an Aux port for headsets. Overall it\u2019s not awful, but a few extra ports could have been nice \u2014 perhaps another USB-C port or two to keep the laptop\u2019s smaller form but not sacrifice on utility. There\u2019s also no SD or microSD slot on the Acer Swift 3X, but that\u2019s by no means the end of the world.",
    "The keyboard is one thing that doesn't suffer from the Swift 3X\u2019s size, however. The keys are well laid out and are more than large enough. An inbuilt backlight can be toggled on or off if you want to make them glow in lower light conditions \u2014 just don\u2019t expect anything too fancy as your only color option is white.",
    "The Acer Swift 3x (2021) is a pretty powerful laptop - boasting one of Intel\u2019s 11th generation mobile processors and integrated Intel Iris Xe Max graphics. The model we reviewed came with an Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and a 14-inch full-HD screen.",
    "The 16:9, 14-inch FHD display put the Iris graphics to good use, offering us a great image, and thanks to the anti-glare technology \u2014 or ComfyView tech as Acer calls it \u2014 bright sunlight shouldn\u2019t get in the way of you seeing what\u2019s on screen while you work.",
    "On top of this, the Acer Swift 3X\u2019s specs meant that it performed impressively when running Windows 10, booting up quickly and performing regular day-to day tasks \u2014 like document creation and browsing the internet \u2014 with ease.",
    "The speakers are a little lacklustre, but unless they are vital to the work you do, they\u2019ll be more than good enough. A pair of headphones can also solve any problems you might have.",
    "For those looking to stop working from home when you can, this should be a more than powerful enough laptop that you can easily carry with you on the days where you need to head into the office \u2014 or into school or college. For any Zoom meetings, the webcam and microphone are more than passable as well.",
    "However, more difficult tasks like high-end gaming and 4K video editing will be a little outside of this computer\u2019s abilities. But if you\u2019re okay settling for a more casual experience in these areas, you shouldn\u2019t find too many problems at all.",
    "When it comes to general use though, the Acer Swift 3X packs a lot into its relatively low price tag, making this an excellent mid-range choice.",
    "When it comes to battery, the Acer Swift 3X excels - we were blown away by how well the laptop ran in our benchmarking tests. If you need a laptop that can go the distance, the Acer Swift 3X might be the one you need.",
    "PC Mark\u2019s battery test is designed to see how long the device can last while the program mimics intensive workloads while at 50% screen brightness. At 10 hours and 43 minutes, the Acer Swift 3X showed that it\u2019s more than capable of handling whatever you\u2019d need to throw at it in a typical nine-to-five day job - and it\u2019d still have more to give on a single charge.",
    "In our movie test, where we ran a 1080p video on loop at 50% brightness, the Swift 3X managed to last for a whopping 16 hours 39 minutes. With the times it\u2019s putting out you could happily leave your laptop charger at home, as long as you remembered to charge it up the night before.",
    "If you are caught in need of power, you can always use the USB-C port to charge up the Acer Swift 3X with your phone charger. The fast charging should recharge your laptop quickly or, if your phone charger can\u2019t muster up enough power, it should let you coast on whatever battery life is left.",
    "The Acer Swift 3X runs on the Windows 10 operating system, which it comes with pre-installed. Otherwise, the laptop doesn\u2019t have too many applications already loaded onto it - much to the relief of \u2018bloatware\u2019 haters everywhere.",
    "While some could be useful - there\u2019s easy links to access Express VPN and the Firefox browser - others are ones you\u2019ll want to remove to free up space. In our testing there weren\u2019t any that stood out as ones that are particularly worth keeping, so feel free to delete any programs you don\u2019t want.",
    "Thankfully, though, even with all the programs you aren\u2019t sent many unwanted notifications. We got warnings about the pre-installed Norton antivirus trial ending soon, but only just after start up, and we otherwise didn\u2019t have any problems."
