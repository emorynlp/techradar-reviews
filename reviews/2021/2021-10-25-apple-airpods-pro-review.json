  "verdict": "If you're an iPhone user and have been toying with the idea of going true wireless with your earbuds, then the Apple AirPods Pro are a great choice. The new noise-cancelling feature is neat and useful, and the overall improvements to sound and design couldn't be more welcome \u2013 though, they are quite pricey.",

    "[Update: Finally, after months of speculation and waiting, Apple has finally launched its third generation of AirPods. You can read our Apple AirPods 3 review for the lowdown on the new earbuds, which support immersive Spatial Audio, adaptive EQ, and a longer battery life than their predecessors. Too pricey? Fear not, as the 2019 AirPods have also been given a permanent price cut.]",
    "The Apple AirPods Pro are the best-sounding earbuds from Apple. They deliver active noise cancellation as well as an improved design compared to the original AirPods. This is why these are still the best Apple headphones you can buy today, as well as some of the best earbuds on the market more generally \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve already bought into the Apple ecosystem.",
    "The Apple AirPods Pro have recently become even better, too. A slew of new upgrades have come to the earbuds since the iOS 15 update in September 2021. These upgrades include Conversation Boost, which is designed to help you hear face-to-face conversations more clearly when you\u2019re using them, as well as the ability to announce notifications with Siri, and integration with Apple's Find My app, among many others.",
    "One of the biggest drawbacks about these buds is the price. At $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399, they\u2019re expensive, and as such, can\u2019t be called the very best wireless headphones out there, even though they do come close. A rumored entry level version of these Apple earbuds \u2013 the so-called AirPods Pro 2 \u2013 could change this in the future. But for now, they\u2019re pricey.",
    "However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user looking for some well-fitting wireless earbuds with strong sound quality, you could do a lot worse than the latest AirPods. The redesign means they\u2019re far less likely to fall out than their predecessors, and the additional microphones that have been built-in to the Pro version now provide strong noise cancellation (particularly when commuting), as well as a useful Transparency mode, which really does let the outside world in to the perfect degree.",
    "Although the fit might be better than the original AirPods, you will need to get used to controlling them with the capacitive, touch-sensitive ridge on each stem \u2013 we found that this does take some getting used to, but it\u2019s a cool way to quickly activate noise cancellation and skip tracks once it becomes second nature.",
    "There\u2019s so much \u2018Apple-ness\u2019 that runs through the AirPods Pro. From the initial setup, where the true wireless earbuds scan your ears to check they\u2019re the right fit, through to the fact there\u2019s a small air vent to make putting them in or removing them a more comfortable experience. In short, fans of the Apple ethos, clean design and exceptionally user-friendly design experience will be overjoyed with their purchase here.",
    "Although we did enjoy our experience with the original AirPods, the sound quality of the AirPods Pro has certainly improved \u2013 there\u2019s a notable emphasis on vocals and bass, meaning these earbuds are better for pop fans than those that enjoy a more natural presentation that lends itself to classical music or more orchestral sounds.",
    "The battery life is strong for Apple earbuds. Although, it\u2019s not great compared to the eight or even nine hours that other true wireless earbuds offer. During our testing, we found that the advertised four to five hours from a single charge was accurate, although we recommend charging the case regularly (a wireless charging pad is a convenient and cool way to do this) as you can get caught out when the case has suddenly run out of juice.",
    "It\u2019s rumored that the Apple AirPods Pro 2 will be launching in 2022 to usurp the AirPods Pro. However, details are very thin on the ground, and there's no confirmation that the rumored earbuds even exist. In any case, you can expect to find some great AirPods deals over Black Friday 2021, so the AirPods Pro are still worth picking up, even if they are a few years old now.",
    "If you want some of the best headphones Apple has made, the AirPods Pro are the culmination of many years\u2019 work into a strong audio product. There are better true wireless earbuds out there, but for Apple fans and iPhone users (with the means to afford them) they\u2019re a great choice.",
    "The AirPods Pro release date was 30 October 2019 worldwide, and you can pick them up from Apple and a number of other retailers.",
    "The important thing to note here is that they are not a replacement for the 2019 AirPods model... and that\u2019s reflected in the AirPods Pro price point.",
    "You can buy the AirPods Pro for $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399 \u2013 which is a considerable hike over the 2019 AirPods' $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249 (with the standard charging case), and even the $199 / \u00a3199 / AU$319 with the AirPods' Wireless Charging Case bundled in. AirPods Pro deals are often available, but don't expect any huge price cuts.",
    "Still too pricey? It's rumored that a cheaper AirPods Pro model is on the cards; the AirPods Pro Lite could be an entry-level version of the noise-cancelling earbuds, though a release date still eludes us.",
    "Like so many other Apple devices, the AirPods Pro instantly connect to your iPhone or iPad \u2013 you simply need to open the case to get going.",
    "Well, we say \u2018simply\u2019 \u2013 you'll need to make sure that iOS 13.2 or above is downloaded to your device so you can get, in Apple\u2019s words, \u201call the advanced features\u201d on offer \u2013 we believe these are the new icons for the AirPods Pro as well as the ability to control the Transparency and noise cancellation directly from the Control Center.",
    "Once activated, the AirPods Pro will be automatically paired with your phone and all Apple devices linked to your iCloud account (including Apple Watch, iPad and Macs), so you won't need to keep connecting your new buds to your other Apple devices.",
    "Once you're in, heading into the Bluetooth settings will assess your fit, checking whether the earbud tips you've chosen (whether that's small, medium or large \u2013 medium is the default) are creating the right seal.",
    "Achieving a tight seal against your ear canal is an important aspect of the overall sound quality of the earbuds, and helps to create physical sound isolation and passive noise reduction; in a perfect world, no sound gets in, and no sound leaks out.",
    "This is achieved by the playing of a short piece of music, with the AirPods Pro microphones internally assessing whether this sounds as it should \u2013 if you're like most people and get a good fit, you're given the green light (or green lettering, to be more precise).",
    "This writer's ears are just terrible when it comes to having most kinds of earbuds fall out, and we achieved a good fit straight away, with the AirPods Pro feeling like they were in no danger of detaching from the ol' head holes easily; in the headphones-reviewing world, we call that a plus.",
    "Playing around with the fit and letting them dangle loosely out showed that the AirPods Pro are able to tell when there\u2019s sound leakage \u2013 another pal of ours who used the new AirPods for the first time found that Apple suggested a larger bud, and then the seal was fine.",
    "Switching between the tips in the box is, once again, very Apple \u2013 whether that\u2019s a positive or negative thing depends on how you feel about the company. Rather than a silicon bud that you have to wiggle onto or off a small stem, these just click into place.",
    "This allows the AirPods Pro to have a more compact design, and makes setting them up feel more premium\u2026 but at $4 apiece, they're not exactly cheap to replace. And while you can pick up new silicon tips for standard earbuds easily, fitting them to the new AirPods isn't as easy thanks to the little clips, rather than simply wiggling silicon onto a stem.",
    "Getting the eartips on and off is really fiddly though \u2013 they don\u2019t snap off instantly, and require a little bit of force to remove. However, the system seems robust and once you gain the confidence to do so, it\u2019s fairly easy \u2013 and it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll have to do it that often.",
    "You might want to remove them once in a while for cleaning purposes though, and we\u2019re still not confident taking the bud off and on the stem without worrying a little that we\u2019re going to break something.",
    "The first thing we noticed in our early test is that the AirPods Pro are light \u2013 they\u2019re so light that, once plopped into the ears, it\u2019s hard to tell that they're actually there. While this lightness is a plus in terms of comfort, it could be a minus in other ways \u2013 we could easily imagine a situation where you lose one, and don't actually realize for a while that they're not there (except that your music would have stopped playing).",
    "The stems are much shorter than on the regular AirPods, and where you were able to tap the body of the older AirPods in order to skip tracks or activate Siri, the fit of the AirPods Pro means that would be a less comfortable experience here.",
    "Instead, there\u2019s a \u2018capacitive force sensor\u2019 in the stem, a small ridge on each of the AirPods Pro, where squeezing said area will activate noise-cancelling / Transparency mode, or skip and pause tracks.",
    "Initially this was a little tricky to get used to, as the shorter stems made it hard to find the ridge, but after a few minutes it became second nature \u2013 although as the buds are quite compact, it does feel a little like you\u2019re pulling them out your ear every time you activate it.",
    "After a week\u2019s use, we found that it was thoroughly second nature, and there was an instant instinct to play, pause and skip tracks using this method.",
    "It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s not a haptic click on the bud itself to confirm the touch, as that would have made the new AirPods Pro feel so much more tactile.",
    "You can change what squeezing the ridge does, setting it to control Siri if you\u2019d prefer, and you can assign a different function (noise cancelling on one, Siri on the other) to each earbud as well.",
    "We\u2019ll tell you one thing that would have been awesome \u2013 touch-sensitive volume control on the stems. Straight away we were irritated by having to reach for our phone to do that \u2013 the Powerbeats Pro, for instance, have a clickable button to change the sound level and it\u2019s really useful.",
    "A reader got in contact and suggested that we use the \u2018Hey Siri!\u2019 command to change the volume. Reasons we don\u2019t want to do this:",
    "In short, Apple should have made the outside of the AirPods Pro touch sensitive for volume control.",
    "Inside the AirPods Pro is an accelerometer, and on the bud itself an optical sensor - combined, they allow the buds to stop and start the music accordingly when your AirPods are removed.",
    "Speaking of which\u2026 the improvement in the fit of the AirPods Pro over the original AirPods is huge. The silicon buds lock them in place snugly, and the earbuds are so light that they don\u2019t bounce around, even if you\u2019re jogging down the road or charging up a flight of stairs at the train station.",
    "We wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying they\u2019re the most securely-fitting earbuds on the market, however. When running and sweat comes into the mix, the silicon tips can start to slide around a little.",
    "Here\u2019s a scientific test: we found that it took four far-too-vigorous-hurt-your-brain shakes of the head to get the AirPod Pro to fall out in the dry, but when they were coated with sweat it was just one violent skull-pivot.",
    "We want to stress they never fell out, but the fit was far looser. If you\u2019re someone who struggled with the fit of the original AirPods when running, these are a huge step forward and fit far more comfortably.",
    "They\u2019re also IPX4 water resistant \u2013 which essentially means you can use them in the rain and buckets of sweat won\u2019t affect their performance. Big tick there from us.",
    "The \u2018Pods were also knocked them out a little too easily when removing a coat or accidentally brushing them (removing a backpack saw one fly out with minimal contact). But compared to the fit of the original AirPods, the Pro models are light years ahead.",
    "One thing that could explain that slight lack of in-ear grip is the air vent Apple has designed in, so the seal is strong but there\u2019s not a strange \u2018sucking\u2019 sensation when removing the buds.",
    "Honestly, we never really felt this was an issue with other true wireless earbuds, so we can\u2019t comment on whether it\u2019s made a huge difference \u2013 but putting the AirPods Pro in our ears was always a comfortable experience.",
    "Ultimately, the AirPods Pro are pricey, but they\u2019re well engineered throughout, with little design tweaks and flourishes that really add to the overall experience.",
    "It\u2019s one thing to fit well, but how do the new AirPods Pro sound? Well, Apple is touting custom drivers, improved bass, \u201cclear and detailed mid and high frequencies\u201d and an adaptive equalizer.",
    "We tested the Apple AirPods over a variety of tracks, and found a number of similarities across the genres. We noted that vocals often sounded really rich and the bass, in particular, was more powerful than the AirPods 2.",
    "This was present across acoustic / indie rock, electro, pop, and hip-hop - but equally across these genres, separation between high mid and low was only okay. There is a still a 'closed off' feeling (as in, it sounds as though the music is coming from inside your head, which isn't natural \u2013 really good headphones make it sound as if the sound is coming at you from all angles).",
    "Compared to a high-end pair of on-ear headphones (or even some other top true wireless earbuds, like the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1), it was harder to hear all the details in the music in the AirPods Pro.",
    "When listening to electro / pop tune Fortune by Little Dragon, the vocals come through clearly \u2013 this shows that mid-frequencies are well balanced and rich. Bass sounds really warm, too, though audiophiles might not like this as it isn't strictly 'natural', but it makes for an enjoyable listen.",
    "Compare that to the performance when listening to classical music, like Mozart\u2019s \u2018Jupiter\u2019 Symphony No. 41 in C Major, sounds a little duller. You can pick out the different harmonies of the strings well enough but the flute is lacking the sparkle that should make it soar above the mix.",
    "Essentially, it feels like Apple is going for a stronger performance when it comes to the vocal or bass elements, which would make sense if it\u2019s aiming to please those that like pop music.",
    "Part of that sound quality is down to the noise cancellation, which is noticeable and strong when turned on \u2013 you turn it on by squeezing the capacitive stem of the AirPods Pro, or by heading into the volume section of your iPhone and swiping to the left-hand icon (you can even toggle it on the Apple Watch, with a menu enabling you to turn the feature on and off).",
    "Apple has placed two microphones in the AirPods Pro, allowing for both internal and external sound analysis.",
    "The former will monitor the audio quality in the ear to see if the music that you\u2019re playing sounds as it should, and alter it accordingly using an algorithm. The latter cancels out background sound, and creates a far more serene listening environment.",
    "While we can\u2019t test how well this algorithm that monitors sound inside your ear actually works, as there\u2019s no way to turn it on and off \u2013 but the active noise cancellation has a strong and noticeable effect.",
    "It won\u2019t shut out all other sound around you \u2013 if you\u2019re in an office and there\u2019s music playing, a small amount might still bleed through \u2013 but, when walking down the street, the AirPod Pros practically shut off all the noise of a motor bike, and any constant noise (like a fan or constant wind) is shut out very well.",
    "The AirPods Pro noise cancellation worked particularly well on a train, with the difference when the mode turned on and off being particularly stark.",
    "One odd thing we did note: if you just have the AirPods Pro switched on, but with no music playing, a strange, hushed \u2018wub wub\u2019 sound can sometimes be emitted as the noise-cancelling tech tries to deal with no sound going into the ear. It\u2019s pretty infrequent but still feels strange when it happens.",
    "Transparency is the other end of the noise-canceling scale from Apple, with the microphones inside the AirPods Pro able to pass external sound through ably.",
    "It\u2019s well-implemented feature, with the world fading slowly in and out when Transparency is turned on, rather than a sudden dump of sound landing in your cranium. You can have a conversation with someone even with your music playing (although if you\u2019re over half-volume it\u2019s a little tricky), and when there\u2019s no music playing you\u2019re barely aware you\u2019ve got headphones in at all.",
    "One thing that irks: the videos advertising the AirPods Pro make it seem like a simple brush of the capacitive stems on the earbuds is all that\u2019s required to turn on Transparency, where in actual fact it takes quite a forceful and prolonged touch.",
    "As with adjusting other settings, it\u2019s something you get used to quickly, but it\u2019s different from what we expected based on the videos.",
    "One thing we did find interesting: if you\u2019re planning on using the AirPods Pro to take calls when you\u2019re out and about, you may find that you struggle when noise cancellation is turned on.",
    "This seems to be because one naturally lowers their voice when the sound is more encompassing, and this stops the microphones picking up your voice as clearly as they might.",
    "Turn on Transparency and the world comes back to life, sonically, and you\u2019ll find that you automatically speak louder. You can have a decent conversation using the new AirPods, but it\u2019s still not as good as just holding your phone to your ear.",
    "One extra feature that we\u2019re pretty into: hearing health. If you use the AirPods, Powerbeats Pro or the AirPods Pro, they send exact volume levels to your iPhone and you can see if you\u2019re listening to things too loudly.",
    "We noticed a marked improvement in the volume being pumped into our ears when switching from the AirPods Pro from the Powerbeats Pro - showing that the noise cancellation allowed us to drop the sound levels a little and still enjoy the same quality of audio.",
    "So if you\u2019re into saving your hearing health, the AirPods Pro offer an improvement over the original AirPods or even the Powerbeats Pro.",
    "The AirPods Pro now come with a Spatial Audio feature thanks to a firmware update, bringing Dolby Atmos immersive audio to the true wireless earbuds.",
    "First announced at the company's WWDC 2020 keynote in June, the Spatial Audio feature works in 5.1, 7.1, and Dolby Atmos, which positions sound all around you within a virtual sphere \u2013 that means that if you're watching a Dolby Atmos film that shows a plane flying overheard, it will sound as though the plane is really passing above you.",
    "What\u2019s unique to Spatial Audio though, is that it uses the built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes inside Apple\u2019s earbuds and headphones to track the position of your head, as well as the position of your iPhone or iPad.",
    "You\u2019ll need an Apple device with iOS 14 or iPadOS 14, as well a streaming service that supports 5.1, 7.1, or Atmos. Stereo content can also be converted to Spatial Audio as long as the streaming service has enabled a special plugin for stereo spatialization.",
    "Right, let\u2019s talk battery life: the AirPods Pro\u2019s charging case will give you over 24 hours of listening time when fully charged, with each full charge of the AirPods Pro getting you five hours of listening (that\u2019s with noise cancelling or Transparency off \u2013 you\u2019ll get four and a half hours with it on), or three and a half hours of use if you use the AirPods Pro as a hands-free mic for calling.",
    "These numbers are pretty accurate in real-world use \u2013 you\u2019ll never really use the AirPods without either noise cancellation or Transparency on, but when flipping them in and out of the case you\u2019ll rarely hit a dead battery.",
    "Should your new AirPods Pro die on you, Apple claims you\u2019ll get one hour of listening time from just five minutes of charging, and we found that to be a little stingy - chucking them in the charging case from dead yielded 35% battery life, which was a little over an hour\u2019s use.",
    "That charging case is slightly annoying in that it\u2019s hard to know how much juice is left in it. When you take the AirPods out you can head to your iPhone\u2019s battery widget to check out how much power is left, but otherwise you\u2019re left looking at the small LED on the front, which is only ever green or amber.",
    "While we only needed to charge the case twice over a week\u2019s hard use, we did hit a situation where it was completely dead - it would be nice if there was an early warning somehow.",
    "In terms of charging the case, Apple has unhelpfully put a USB-C-to-Lightning cable in there. Unless you\u2019ve got a new iPhone 11 Pro, or new MacBook, you won\u2019t have the necessary charging block (as there isn\u2019t one in the box either).",
    "However, the good news is that nearly every person that buys the new AirPods will have a standard Lightning cable or two kicking around, so you\u2019ll be able to charge them that way.",
    "Don\u2019t forget that this is a wireless charging case, so you can plop it down on a charging pad and get juicing. You might think this is something of a \u2018nothing\u2019 feature that you don\u2019t want to pay for, but trust us, invest in the ecosystem.",
    "There\u2019s something really awesome about being able to just put down a phone or set of AirPods and have them charge up over the day - get one of our best wireless chargers and you\u2019ll rarely run out of power again.",
