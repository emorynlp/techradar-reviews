  "summary": "Intuitive and powerful, but also missing some key features at the moment",
  "verdict": "The Bose QuietComfort 45 are a strong successor to the company\u2019s 2019 flagship model, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II, and yet don\u2019t quite have the refinement of last year\u2019s Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. The QC45 are missing a few features like an EQ, adjustable noise reduction and their audio performance isn\u2019t audiophile-quality. They\u2019re comfortable for long periods of time, however, and are easy enough for anyone to use, which is enough to get them a tepid recommendation.",

    "Fantastic noise cancellation",

    "The Bose QuietComfort 45 are a rock-solid pair of noise-cancelling headphones. They\u2019re easy-to-use and feel incredibly comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Those are traits that Bose has always been known for and they continue to live on here.",
    "Of course, the QC45 aren\u2019t without a few new tricks. Among them are an Ambient Aware mode that allows you to hear sounds around you at the press of a button as well as upgraded noise cancellation tech that\u2019s more responsive than before.",
    "On top of that you\u2019ve got a good-but-not-great battery life of 25 hours and a beam-forming microphone array that is, well, not quite as good as we had hoped. Neither of these are deal-breakers, but they do make the Bose QuietComfort 45 slightly less appealing than some of its competitors.",
    "In fact, the Bose QuietComfort 45\u2019s biggest issues aren\u2019t anything that they do wrong - there are minor issues, but nothing absolutely awful - and instead they have everything to do with two other amazing headphones out there: the Sony WH-1000XM4 and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Both offer more customization options, better sound, and present a better value for just a little bit more cash.",
    "The Bose QuietComfort 45 became available on September 23, 2021 and cost $329 / \u00a3329 / AU$499.95, depending on where you live.",
    "That\u2019s on the expensive side for noise cancelling headphones \u2013 as some can be had for as little as $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$200 \u2013 but this isn\u2019t unreasonable for Bose as the QuietComfort 35 II cost $350 / \u00a3330 / AU$500.",
    "At this price point, the biggest competition for the Bose QC45 is the similarly spec\u2019d Sony WH-1000XM4, which we currently consider to be the best noise-cancelling headphones, and Bose\u2019s own Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 that aren\u2019t much more expensive. The WH-1000XM4 have a few features the QC45 do not \u2013 like the DSEE Extreme audio upscaler and support for the LDAC codec \u2013 while the NC700 offer an EQ and adjustable cancellation, two major missing features on the QuietComfort 45.",
    "Bose has kept a consistent design with its flagship headphones for the better part of the last decade, and that hasn\u2019t changed with the QC45.",
    "The exterior of the headphones looks sleek and feels comfortable thanks to its padded foam bridge and faux-leatherette ear pads. The pads themselves swivel and fold to help them fit into the included carrying case, which makes them easy to throw in your carryon bag when they\u2019re not around your neck.",
    "What\u2019s surprising about the design is how light they are \u2013 at just 8.5 ounces (238g), they really feel light on the ear and are comfortable to wear for hours on end. To get them so light, Bose uses some plastic on the arms of the headphones but uses metal for all the joints and the bridge - basically all the parts that are most likely to snap in use.",
    "To control playback, Bose has equipped the QC45 with a number of intuitive buttons. On the right earcup you\u2019ve got controls for pause/play, volume up and volume down, while on the left earcup you\u2019ll find a button for the new ambient aware mode. You can also summon your phone\u2019s built-in assistant by holding the play/pause button, which is nice. It\u2019s not as nice as having an always listening assistant built into the headphones, but better than not having an option for an assistant at all.",
    "Last but not least, you\u2019ll find two main ports on the headphones: there\u2019s a 2.5mm audio jack on the bottom of the left earcup and a USB-C port on the bottom of the right earcup. Both ports are fairly self-explanatory \u2013 but it\u2019s still nice to see them as opposed to, say, MicroUSB and no headphone jack at all.",
    "On the features front, things are a bit more disappointing. The big new obvious draw here is Awareness Mode that allows you to significantly lower the volume of your music and turn off noise cancellation without taking off the headphones. If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s what Sony\u2019s offered on its noise cancelling headphones for the last few years and it\u2019s nice to finally see it on a pair of Bose cans.",
    "So how does it work in practice? It\u2019s just OK. The QC45 don\u2019t do a great job of using the external microphones to amplify outside audio, and more or less just turn off the noise cancellation technology. That means announcements or conversations that are happening further away are still kind of hard to hear - or at least not as easy to hear as they would be if Bose amplified them using the external microphones.",
    "The other major missing features here are the ability to change the strength of noise cancellation and change the tuning of audio playback via an EQ. Both these features are available on the Bose NC700 and may eventually be available on the QC45, however as of right now neither are available.",
    "Finally, it would\u2019ve been nice to have a built-in virtual assistant like Alexa or Google here. You\u2019ll still be able to use your phone\u2019s assistant by long-pressing the play/pause button, but an always-listening assistant is great when you\u2019ve got your hands full.",
    "The Bose QuietComfort 45\u2019s sound performance is also a double-edged sword. On one hand, these are definitely not the bassiest or detail-rich pair of over-ear headphones we\u2019ve ever heard. On the other hand, though, they are one of the most listenable pairs of headphones among the ones we\u2019ve tested thanks to Bose\u2019s smart design choices.",
    "One such example of that is the QC45\u2019s distinct lack of bass response. Songs like Bad Guy by Billie Eilish don\u2019t have much power behind that driving bass line that other headphones have, nor do they have a richness and clarity in the upper registers. That means details in both areas are hard to hear and less impactful compared to other over-ear headphones.",
    "That said, it wouldn\u2019t surprise us if Bose tuned them that way on purpose as both areas can quickly become fatiguing if not properly done. To prove that point, there are a number of bass-heavy headphones out there that are certainly fun to listen to, but they\u2019re not great on flights when any extra pressure can feel uncomfortable. The same is true for hyper-clear headphones that excel at critical listening \u2013 they\u2019re fun at home, but not great on the road.",
    "The other performance issues we experienced were occasional dropouts in connection and less-than-ideal call quality. This happened several times with the Amazon Prime Music app \u2013 unsurprising as the app can be a little unstable \u2013 but also once or twice when listening to videos on YouTube, an app that has always been rock-solid in the past. As for the call quality, many of the folks we spoke to said it sounded like we were on speaker phone when we used the headphones. They reported that we sounded loud, but not necessarily clear.",
    "The good news? So far, we\u2019ve yet to be disappointed with their noise cancellation performance. Just wearing them around the house blocks out those annoying everyday distractions \u2013 there\u2019s no noise from the AC unit or laundry room, and conversations happening elsewhere don\u2019t interfere at all with the music we\u2019ve got playing.",
    "To get the best noise cancelling experience, it\u2019s important to have some music playing at a moderate volume rather than, say, a podcast or meditation that has breaks in between dialogue where outside noise can leak in. Keep the music playing and you shouldn\u2019t be able to hear outside conversations, dull rumbling noise or, well, pretty much anything.",
    "According to Bose, the QC45 have a class-leading battery life of 25 hours, which we\u2019ve found to be just about accurate over our two week testing period. Our sample unit took a number of days to get to under 40% despite listening to them for four or more hours every single day.",
    "That being said, however, they\u2019re not quite as class-leading as Bose wants you to believe. The Sony WH-1000XM4 are good for around 30 hours of playback with noise cancellation on and up to 38 hours with ANC turned off. Both headphones have more than enough juice to get you across the ocean and back, but Sony still has Bose beat in overall battery life.",
    "Thankfully, when the battery runs out, the Bose QC45 has quick charging that refills three hours\u2019 worth of battery in just 15 minutes, allowing you to charge them in the morning before you head out the door and still make it to the office and back."
