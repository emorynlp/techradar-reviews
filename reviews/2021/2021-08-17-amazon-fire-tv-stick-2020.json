  "summary": "The Amazon Fire TV Stick (2020) adds HDR, a 60fps frame rate, and Dolby Atmos audio",
  "verdict": "The Amazon Fire TV Stick (2020) is still the most major refresh of the standard Fire TV streaming stick, adding a host of new improvements such as HDR, a 60fps frame rate, and compatibility with Dolby Atmos audio. There's now a cheaper iteration in the Fire TV Stick Lite, but you'll want this step-up model for a remote with fully-fledged volume and AV controls.",

    "Even in 2021, the Amazon Fire TV Stick (2020) is a solid choice if you're looking for a capable and affordable streaming option. This HD streamer boasts a decent interface and some substantial improvements over its previous 2019 iteration, even if it doesn't have the 4K functionality of its newer siblings.",
    "With the 2020 model, though, you do get HDR support, as well as a 60fps frame rate, which brings you both smoother and richer images \u2013 as long as your TV can support the same specs.",
    "As mentioned, you won't get native 4K resolution with the Amazon Fire TV Stick (2020) (you'll need the Fire TV Stick 4K for that), but if you have a HD TV or 4K TV with competent upscaling capabilities, this is a smart, mid-price buy that won't cost you as much as an Ultra HD model.",
    "The difficulty in judging the Fire TV Stick (2020) \u2013 and buying the right one you need \u2013 is that Amazon has since brought out a new entry-level model, which is called the Fire TV Stick Lite.",
    "There are some notable differences between this one we're reviewing here and the Lite \u2013 mainly, the inclusion of volume controls and a mute button on the step-up model's remote, as well as the ability to connect and control other AV equipment. If your home theater system is bigger than simply a TV and streamer, it'll be a better bet for ensuring harmonious collaboration between your streaming stick, soundbar, and you.",
    "The volume controls might not seem all that important, but they make a difference. Switching back to the Lite model's remote is difficult \u2013 forcing us to constantly handle a separate TV remote to increase or decrease audio. Using the Fire TV Stick (2020) is a far smoother experience, one aided by the voice-navigated Fire TV platform and ongoing updates to simplify and improve the interface.",
    "Less forgivable is the at-times domineering presence of Amazon-owned or Amazon-affiliated content, including ads for Audible subscriptions on every menu \u2013 but if you're a Prime subscriber, this won't be a deal-breaker.",
    "The Amazon Fire TV Stick (2020) is available now. You can buy it for $39.99 or \u00a339.99 in the US and UK respectively \u2013 the same price as the previous Fire TV Stick \u2013 or AU$79 in Australia, now that this model has come to the region.",
    "When you open the box, you'll find a neatly packaged assortment of accessories. There's the Fire TV Stick (2020) streamer itself, as well as a short (but pliable) extension cable, which is useful for helping the stick fit in narrow spaces behind a television.",
    "You'll also get two Amazon Basics AAA batteries for the Alexa voice remote, and a charger to plug the streamer into (via micro USB).",
    "The streaming stick itself is pretty nondescript: a short black slab, the size of a small candy bar, which plugs into a TV via HDMI 2.0, and measures 86 x 30 x 13mm.",
    "It's essentially the same design as the Fire TV Stick Lite or Fire TV Stick 4K, so if you're juggling a couple \u2013 as we were during our review \u2013 it may be hard to tell the difference. There is a subtle Amazon logo, but it's not obtrusive, and the sleek black design and curved remote give it all a premium feel, despite the low price.",
    "The main difference here is not in the streamer, though, so much as the remote.",
    "Every Fire TV device ships with some version of the Alexa voice remote. They all support voice functionality and some basic inputs such as return, home, menu, power, and navigation (with a d-pad disguised as an omni-directional circle). The Fire TV Stick (2020) also adds in volume controls for increasing / decreasing audio levels, as well as a mute button for switching off the sound entirely.",
    "So, what's new with the 2020 model of the Amazon Fire TV Stick? This version is still a Full HD streamer, and still comes with the same Alexa Voice Remote of its predecessor \u2013 a clicker with playback, power, volume and voice command inputs that also ships with the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube, and can be used to control connected AV receivers and soundbars.",
    "There are a few notable upgrades over the previous HD Fire TV Stick model, though, even though it launched pretty recently (in 2019).",
    "For one, there's the introduction of HDR (high dynamic range), meaning you'll get increased color and contrast in your HD images, with more nuanced tones and a larger spectrum of light and dark shades. You get the basic HDR10 format here, as well as the dynamic HDR delights of HDR10+ (which uses metadata to calibrate picture settings shot-by-shot) though not its Dolby Vision competitor.",
    "It's also worth noting that you won't get the full impact of HDR without 4K resolution either, given there are fewer pixels on show. A 4K TV will upscale the video output to make it output in 4K on the screen, though you'll be at the mercy of that particular set's processing ability.",
    "While the 2019 model supported 30fps playback, the 2020 version pushes this up to 60fps \u2013 which is fitting, given that most new 4K TVs these days come with a 60fps panel (if not 120fps). This should make for smoother motion with less blur or judder during fast-moving scenes, though some of this will come down to your television's processing. It should be especially good for any gaming on the Fire TV Stick, as with the upcoming Amazon Luna game streaming service.",
    "Amazon tells us that the new model is \"50% more powerful\" than the 2019 iteration, thanks to an \"enhanced 1.7 GHz quad-core processor\". We're told that the \"dual-band, dual-antenna WiFi supports 5 GHz networks for more stable streaming and fewer dropped connections\" \u2013 and does all this \"while consuming 50% less power\" too.",
    "On the audio side, the Fire TV Stick (2020) supports Dolby Atmos surround sound. That means you can get more immersive audio, though you will need to be using speakers that support the format also.",
    "The Fire TV Stick (2020) makes use, as you might expect, of the Fire TV interface \u2013 and if you've ever used another Fire TV streamer, or a Fire TV-based smart TV, then you'll be familiar with what's on offer.",
    "There are various content rows to navigate horizontally, such as your Recent apps, Your Apps & Channels, and Prime Originals & Exclusives.",
    "This is a pretty comprehensive platform, with streaming apps such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney Plus, YouTube, and more packed in, without any glaring absences.",
    "There's no aggressive hiding away of Amazon Prime Video's main competitors, then, though Amazon does make sure its own content gets priority. Much of the Fire TV interface is clogged up with Amazon Prime Video content \u2013 whether that's titles sourced from the platform directly or affiliated TV channels such as StarzPlay.",
    "It's common to click through on an interesting title to find you need a subscription, and it can be frustrating now to have this signposted around the content prior to you clicking through and attempting to view it. (There's also no onscreen-prompt to 'cancel' once you've selected a film or TV show; you'll have to use the back button on the voice remote, which isn't overly obvious at first glance.)",
    "Most content panes also have a Sponsored section for Audible, the audiobook subscription service owned by Amazon. As ever, paying for hardware that then shows you advertisements is a bit of a slap in the face \u2013 though the Tizen OS on new Samsung TVs does it too, if less visibly.",
    "You'll enjoy the UI and its suggested content the most if you're a Prime subscriber already, then, though other streaming platforms such as Roku are a bit less biased towards funnelling you towards particular purchases.",
    "You also can't sign in to the Prime Video app unless the Amazon account registered to the device has access. This problem should get fixed when Amazon launches user profiles later in 2020, but for now it's an annoying pain point \u2013 especially if (like me) you and your cohabitants share various streaming subscriptions.",
    "There are changes afoot, as with the recent overhaul of Alexa integration, aping the UI of the Echo Show smart display range when accessing information through Amazon's voice assistant. You're soon getting a picture-in-picture mode, too, meaning you can load up more than one app at one time on your Fire TV interface, say to bring up a smart security camera feed on the side of the screen.",
    "It's not an unpleasant interface at all, even if Amazon-affiliated content is a bit domineering, and the Home / Your Videos tabs are essentially identical.",
