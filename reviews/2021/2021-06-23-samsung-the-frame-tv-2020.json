    "Samsung The Frame TV (2020) is that curious of creatures: a new Samsung TV designed as much around its place as decor as a display for television shows. The Frame\u2019s design-first mentality has already drawn plenty of attention, with sleek cabling solutions, wall-mounting and bezel options that ape an actual picture frame, and dedicated modes for accessing iconic artworks or \u2018ambient\u2019 imagery.",
    "We last reviewed The Frame back in 2018, finding a gorgeously-crafted television that nonetheless suffered in the picture department, with issues with color and brightness that stopped it feeling like a living room essential.",
    "Two years and two model iterations later \u2013 including a QLED panel and a host of new sizing options \u2013 Samsung The Frame (2020) is a much better proposition, even if some minor complaints with brightness and off-color images remain.",
    "With a mix of TV sizes, different colored bezels you can change on the fly, and a host of available artworks, wallpapers, and screensavers to display, The Frame really can cater to any number of homes, with a huge amount of variety in its appearance, function, and placement (wall-mounted or stuck on a counter).",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that the 2019 The Frame wasn\u2019t available for review, meaning that Samsung is clearly more confident in their product this time around \u2013 which is largely warranted in our minds.",
    "Read on for our full Samsung The Frame (2020) review, where we\u2019ll cover the design choices, smart TV interface, Art and Ambient modes, and sound quality you\u2019ll find when buying the latest version of The Frame.",
    "Samsung\u2019s The Frame is available in the UK, US, and Australia \u2013 with some slight differentiation in sizes between those territories. The smallest 32-inch size is currently only available in the US for $599 though we expect it to come elsewhere in the course of 2020. The 43-inch, 50-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models can now be found in all three territories, though.",
    "We reviewed The Frame in its 50-inch size ($1,299 / \u00a31,399 / AU$1,799). For other sizes, you\u2019ll be paying $999 / \u00a31,199 / AU$1,559 for the 43-inch, $1,499 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,295 for the 55-inch, $1,999 / \u00a32,199 / AU$2,695 for the 65-inch, and $2,999 / \u00a33,499 / AU$3,995 for the 75-inch.",
    "It\u2019s not the cheapest QLED in 2020 \u2013 that moniker goes to the Q60T, which retails at $529 / \u00a3799 (around AU$800) for its smallest 43-inch size \u2013 but the premium you pay on The Frame does bring a host of visual benefits (on the outside, at least).",
    "Customizable frames start at $99 / \u00a3169 / AU$99, depending on the model size you're buying for.",
    "Don\u2019t want to splash out on a new TV? Check out the 2019 model:",
    "The most important aspect of The Frame is, naturally, the design.",
    "More so than any other of Samsung\u2019s QLED TVs, The Frame is a television that puts appearances first. The idea is that, even if you\u2019re a regular TV-watcher, there are probably hours of the day when you\u2019re stuck with a big black rectangle dominating your living room \u2013 which is why The Frame has so many features designed to help it blend in with your home decor.",
    "The base body of The Frame is a polished black metal: classy up close, but not very attention-grabbing from a few meters away. For a small addition to the cost of the television, though, you can buy a variety of bezels that attach magnetically for a full-on picture frame aesthetic: colors include white, black, brown, beige, burgundy red, and clay beige.",
    "The Frame is a set that doesn\u2019t try to be super slim \u2013 with a thick, quality-material bezel \u2013 but it has a very flattering silhouette, without a protruding rear or jutting parts. There\u2019s space in the back of the television for a flush wall-mount to be attached; you can attach two solid feet to the underside of the display instead \u2013 thankfully, without having to using any screws \u2013 but the wall still feels like the natural home for The Frame.",
    "The Frame (2020) is also one of the few new Samsung TVs to feature the OneConnect box: a sleek cabling solution that outsources power, HDMI, USB ports and the like to a separate piece of hardware, to prevent numerous wires ruining the clean and classy look of your television. It\u2019s a brilliant addition, especially here where the aesthetic is so crucial.",
    "The rear of the box features four HDMI 2.0 ports (including eARC support), optical, ethernet, CI, satellite, Air/Cable, and ExLink, with two USB ports on the side \u2013 but even in 2020 it\u2019s still incredible that one, near-invisible wire can carry all that information over to the display.",
    "As with most high-end Samsung TVs, you get a pair of remotes: one basic remote with rubbery buttons and a full numerical keypad, and one \u2018designer\u2019 remote with a slimmed-down form factor and minimal button layout.",
    "The sleek model is far more satisfying to hold and use, and carries dedicated buttons to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Rakuten TV (in the UK, at least) as well as a \u2018123\u2019 button to easily type in channel numbers onscreen.",
    "There are a couple of tricks worth checking the manual for \u2013 such as pressing in the volume button for mute \u2013 but nothing particularly frustrating. (A hint: pressing the power button once will switch between TV and Art Mode, but holding the button down will turn off the television entirely.)",
    "Samsung\u2019s Tizen smart TV platform is one of the best in the business, and there\u2019s little really to cover in this section.",
    "Tizen makes use of a straightforward row of apps and services \u2013 which overlays over whatever app or content you currently have playing on the television \u2013 with a second content row that pops up above whatever app you\u2019ve selected containing the programming available within it.",
    "The app selection is customizable, too, meaning you can pin, delete, and rearrange what\u2019s on show \u2013 so if you want Disney Plus ahead of Netflix, Rakuten TV between YouTube and Apple TV, or otherwise, that\u2019s all right with The Frame. We might have expected a more streamlined or distinct layout, given the design focus of The Frame, but there really isn\u2019t that much that could be improved (aside from the rather untidy Samsung TV Plus app, which is permanently half-visible at the bottom of the home screen, and a bit of an eye-sore).",
    "You get two choices for voice assistant support, too, with both Amazon Alexa and Samsung\u2019s in-house (and much maligned) Bixby assistant available.",
    "As expected, Alexa works fine, and you can set up the set to work in conjunction with Amazon Echo smart speakers and other Alexa devices too. Bixby isn\u2019t quite as capable, and we don\u2019t particularly recommend it unless you're sticking to simple commands that jump between apps and source inputs \u2013 though there is a hugely useful set of Bixby commands listed in the TV\u2019s Settings (e-Manual > Smart Features > Using Bixby) which is handy for knowing how exactly to speak to Bixby to get it doing what you want.",
    "One of The Frame\u2019s most distinctive features is Art Mode: a setting that displays artworks, paintings, landscapes, or your own personal photos instead of a black TV screen.",
    "Notably, Samsung has partnered with a number of renowned museums and galleries, including the V&A and Saatchi Gallery in London, the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, and plenty others from around the world. Out of hundreds of artworks, you technically only get 20 for free, and you will need to upgrade to a paid monthly subscription to get a wider variety of paintings and the like \u2013 but there\u2019s plenty of other background fodder to use without paying a penny.",
    "The app\u2019s layout could be improved, though: selecting Art Mode brings you automatically to a screen asking you to pay for the premium option (\u00a33.99 per month in the UK), and the most useful sections \u2013 brightness and motion sensor settings, for one \u2013 aren\u2019t visible unless you scroll down to \u2018Spotlight\u2019 and sift through the tabs that appear. Overall, though, Art Mode feels distinct and curated enough to make The Frame feel different from other 2020 Samsung TVs.",
    "We\u2019re told by a Samsung rep that Art Mode uses around 30% of the power that streaming a movie on Netflix would, meaning it\u2019s not as eco-friendly as simply turning the TV off, but is a good option for when you\u2019re around the house a lot or having company over.",
    "Ambient Mode is also well worth a look, utilizing \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 \u2018ambient\u2019 animations and customizable color gradients to help generate a calming atmosphere (or just match the wallpaper as precisely as possible). The various clock faces and floating rubber duckie are some personal favorites, but there\u2019s plenty to try out here, including real-time weather information and news headlines supplied by Samsung\u2019s upday news app.",
    "Samsung The Frame (2020) may be as pretty as a picture, but the actual picture quality isn\u2019t always up to scratch.",
    "It\u2019s still a notable improvement on the 2018 model, helped by a newer Quantum Processor 4K, which ensures Samsung\u2019s usual upscaling excellence is fully on show \u2013 with both HD and 4K sources looking crisp and detailed on The Frame\u2019s 50-inch UHD screen.",
    "Motion is highly smooth, too, with the action sequences in Scott Pilgrim vs The World looking as polished as we hoped, whether skateboards were raining down on the hero\u2019s head or swords and hammers were swinging across the screen. The Frame automatically uses a Picture Clarity mode to aid with this, though we found motion entirely passable even without it.",
    "Almost all the sources we tried looked great on Samsung The Frame\u2019s QLED panel, with a couple of exceptions.",
    "While some QLED panels can output thousands of nits brightness (important for illuminating the wider color gamut in HDR), The Frame is a bit dim by comparison, at only a few hundred. This is fine for everyday use \u2013 you certainly won\u2019t need the Mona Lisa dazzling you at 2,000 nits \u2013 but it means the picture isn\u2019t quite as impactful as some other Samsung TVs.",
    "It also means that the set can struggle to show detail in darker scenes \u2013 especially with some ambient light in the room. It's not an issue most of the time, but means that shows that depend on dark environments to set the mood (Netflix's dystopian sci-fi Altered Carbon, for instance) can suffer. In these cases, we found the Movie picture setting was the best option to help out.",
    "SDR (standard dynamic range) is fully capable here, with largely getting decent color recreation \u2013 as is fitting for an artistic television. HDR is where The Frame really looks best, with Samsung's proprietary dynamic HDR format, HDR10+, favored by Amazon Prime Video. We put HDR10+ to the test with the Amazon Original The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and were impressed by the vividly-colored costumes, dresses, and headwear throughout.",
    "Skin tones aren\u2019t always color-accurate, though \u2013 especially for non-white faces \u2013 and we found ourselves repeatedly switching between picture settings to try and amend this. When watching Mindy Kaling\u2019s Netflix show Never Have I Ever, we found the default Standard setting gave the predominantly Indian cast a rather reddish tinge, with Cinema mode jumping to a slight green tint instead. It\u2019s a slight issue, but disappointing nonetheless.",
    "Samsung The Frame TV may look good, but how does it sound? You\u2019ll get a pretty standard 20W output here, without Dolby Atmos surround sound or any fancy built-in driver arrays (as with the Q950TS).",
    "The Frame is more for looking than listening, then \u2013 but the sound still holds up for general usage. Dialogue is brilliantly clear, too, with an overall balanced sound, though you can start to hear some audio distortion when you get to higher volumes. This last point isn\u2019t a huge issue, but enough to mean you\u2019ll want a dedicated soundbar if you want to use The Frame for loud music or big-impact movie scores.",
    "The wall-mounted LG GX Gallery Series OLED is worth keeping an eye on, too, as a similarly artwork-minded television, but with 60W Dolby Atmos audio and an OLED panel thrown in. You\u2019ll be paying around twice the price for an equivalent size \u2013 and it\u2019s only available in 55-inch, 65-inch, and 77-inch \u2013 but the GX seems like a sensible upgrade if you have the cash to spend."
