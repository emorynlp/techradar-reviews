  "summary": "Apple\u2019s cheapest iPad gets a slightly bigger screen",
  "verdict": "The iPad 10.2 (2019) is Apple\u2019s refreshed and still-reasonably-priced iPad with a marginally bigger screen, Smart Keyboard Cover compatibility, and extra RAM. Even though it\u2019s not very different from last year\u2019s iPad 9.7, which now also runs iPadOS, this 7th-gen iPad continues to be brilliant at the basics.",
  "pros": [
    "Great price for a new iPad",
    "Slightly bigger screen",
    "Works with Smart Keyboard Cover"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Marginally better than iPad 9.7",
    "Older iPads may be cheaper",
    "iPad Air is superior for sketching"
  ],
  "article": [
    "The iPad 10.2 continues from where its predecessor, 2018's entry-level iPad 9.7 left off: offering Apple\u2019s best value for a brand-new iPad at a ridiculously reasonable price \u2013 and a price that\u2019s often discounted by third-party retailers.",
    "This isn't the newest member of Apple's entry-level iPad family - that's the new iPad 10.2 (2020). The new tablet is the same size as the one you're in the review for, but with a few spec improvements.",
    "We\u2019d describe the 2019 iPad 10.2 in three succinct ways: bigger, budget and basic. New is the 10.2-inch display that\u2019s marginally bigger than the classic 9.7-inch screen size of the predecessor. Every fraction of an inch helps if you\u2019re planning to use Split View on iPadOS, and the actual iPad dimensions aren\u2019t much larger.",
    "There\u2019s also compatibility with Apple\u2019s fabric Smart Keyboard Cover, which we\u2019ve always found to work better than often-unreliable Bluetooth keyboards, no syncing or charging needed. It simply snaps onto Apple\u2019s Smart Connector (the first time the pogo-pin port has appeared on a basic iPad). Note: the keyboard is sold separately, as is the Apple Pencil, and it\u2019s quite expensive.",
    "That\u2019s basically it. Besides having more RAM tucked into the iPad 10.2, you won\u2019t find any other upgrades over the iPad 9.7 from March 2018, and that\u2019s okay. Most people don\u2019t need all of the premium bells and whistles of the bezel-reduced iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9, or have a need for the thinner, laminated display of the 10.5-inch iPad Air 2019 (though we highly recommend this version if you\u2019re serious about sketching with the Pencil).",
    "What\u2019s important is that the iPad 10.2 can do all of the basics \u2013 and a bit more than you may realize thanks to the iPadOS update. In our tests, it ran all of the same apps, supported hardware-intensive augmented reality (AR) games, displayed the tweaked home screen, and even acted as a second Mac display thanks to the macOS Catalina \u2018SideCar\u2019 feature.",
    "Buying the iPad 10.2 is a no-brainer if all you need is a brand-new iPad \u2013 and can find it at the same price as last year\u2019s iPad. That\u2019s going to be our one caveat for everyone.",
    "If you find the older iPad model at a great price it would make sense to buy it, given so little has changed. But, on an even price playingfield, there\u2019s just enough here to ensure that this year\u2019s entry-level iPad continues to be brilliant at the basics.",
    "Update: iPadOS 15 has been unveiled for tablets, and the iPad 10.2 is one of them. Apple's new operating system update, coming towards the end of the year, brings an app library, changes to multitasking and improvements to widgets.",
    "The iPad 10.2 was a surprise announcement at Apple's iPhone 11 launch event, and its official release date was September 29, 2019. It actually started shipping early for some people on September 25, the day after the iPadOS update came out.",
    "The most important thing is how much it costs: the iPad 10.2 price starts at $329 (\u00a3349, AU$529) for the rather-limited 32GB version, and $429 (\u00a3449, AU$689) for the 128GB version. You can get away with just 32GB if you plan on streaming most things and using iCloud.",
    "Serious work from the iPad 10.2, with a desire to save and edit photos and video, begs for the 128GB version, and maybe investment in the Smart Keyboard Cover $159 (\u00a3159, AU$235), the Apple Pencil $99 (\u00a389, AU$145), or maybe the cellular version of this iPad starting at $459 (\u00a3479, AU$729). Even for the \u2018cheap iPad\u2019 things can add up when you go for the extras.",
    "It's worth pointing out that during deals and sales periods - take for example, Black Friday or Cyber Monday- the price of the iPad 10.2 can go down a little. We'd recommend checking out our best iPad Black Friday deals article when the time is right for deals.",
    "This is the 7th-generation iPad and it shows, with a solid-feeling, yet familiar design that, at first blush, looks as if it hasn\u2019t changed in several years. There\u2019s a durable aluminum shell, glass on top, and the traditional home button. It comes in three colors: Silver, Gold and Space Gray.",
    "New this year, Apple has made its iPad enclosure from 100% recycled aluminum, and it grew ever-so-slightly thanks to the 10.2-inch screen size. The height and width are actually identical to the bigger 10.5-inch iPad Air 2019 \u2013 it\u2019s just not as noticeably thin and light as the Air.",
    "The Smart Connector is the biggest perk if you plan to upgrade. It makes the iPad 10.2 the cheapest iPad to work with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard Cover, Logitech\u2019s Slim Combo Keyboard Case and a few other accessories. They never need to be charged and they pair instantly.",
    "The iPad 10.2 uses the same Smart Keyboard as the new Air, so we already knew we loved the one-piece laser-etched fabric keys. They\u2019re water- and stain-resistant, and impervious to debris. Last iPad review we ate a crumbly croissant and easily wiped away the many pieces that didn\u2019t make it into our mouths. This time, same deal, but with Doritos. Again, it checks out by cleaning up nicely.",
    "We do have reservations with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard. It\u2019s expensive and none of the keys are backlit. That makes it hard to use in the dark (think: college students who have roommates and are pulling all-nighters on projects with the lights turned off). There are more shortcuts as part of the iPadOS update, but none of the 64 keys are customizable like they are on a MacBook.",
    "There\u2019s exactly half an inch of extra display real estate on the iPad 10.2, and we found it to be a modest improvement over the classic iPad screen size. It won\u2019t change your life or your viewing habits, but it\u2019s nice to see more screen-to-body value from the entry-level iPad.",
    "What\u2019s important is that Apple increased the LCD\u2019s resolution to keep the same pixel density as its iPad predecessors, so it continues to look great in its stretch to 10.2 inches. It\u2019s colorful, bright and supports the Apple Pencil, the latter being a new feature as of the iPad 6th gen.",
    "This makes the new iPad a fine choice for watching Netflix and playing mobile games (see: our Apple Arcade review), and its 4:3 aspect ratio is primed for reading. That extra half-inch does come in handy with iPadOS changing up the home screen and pushing Split View, or if you use macOS Catalina\u2019s \u2018Sidecar\u2019 feature that turns your iPad into a second Mac display.",
    "You are, however, going to get more out of the 10.5-inch iPad Air if you plan to seriously use the Apple Pencil. Its fully laminated display reduces the gap between the screen and glass, so you feel as if you\u2019re drawing directly on the display. The iPad 10.2 screen isn\u2019t pressed up against the glass so tightly, making the Pencil tip feel as if it\u2019s floating a bit.",
    "We found the new iPad 10.2 capable of handling the same rigorous apps, high-end 3D games and light video editing as the iPad 9.7 in our tests. That\u2019s not a big surprise since it contains the same A10 Fusion chipset, which also happens to power the iPhone 7 and iPod touch 7th gen.",
    "Apple did increase the memory from 2GB to 3GB of RAM in a year\u2019s time, and we did see better Geekbench multi-score results: (5,921 on the iPad 9.7 vs 6,047 on the iPad 10.2). So the A10 chipset is aged-but-completely-adequate for the basic iPad. Our desire is for more internal storage than the given 32GB or 128GB is more pressing and sorely missed.",
    "Its extra RAM is a modest upgrade, but all the more important as Apple pitches the 2-in-1 form factor using the Smart Keyboard as a laptop replacement for some people. Yes, you\u2019ll get more grunt and video editing power out of the iPad Air and iPad Pro, which have A12 and A12X chipsets, respectively. But at this price point, you can\u2019t complain about lag-free performance.",
    "The iPad 10.2 has an unchanged 8MP rear camera that\u2019s serviceable for capturing photos and videos. But serious photographers should rely on their smart-HDR-equipped iPhone and avoid using the 1.2MP selfie camera that looks soft and blows out backgrounds.",
    "More importantly for a tablet, the camera acts as a fully operational AR gaming tool. We tested it using new Pokemon Go-like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite and robot-filled multiplayer affair Machines. It\u2019ll become a nicely-sized 10.2-inch window into the world of Minecraft Earth too.",
    "The iPad 10.2 offers the first taste of the iPadOS software update for a lot of people, especially those upgrading from the iPad 4 and original iPad Air that are forever stuck with iOS 12.4.1.",
    "iPadOS makes multi-window app support more robust with Slide Over and Split View easier to manipulate, and the new App Expos\u00e9 helpful for realizing all of the apps that are open. Long overdue: the ability to have two of the same apps open side-by-side. It\u2019s finally here.",
    "That new home screen boils down to you being able to pin the Today View widgets, previously on the left-most screen, right next to the first set of apps. It\u2019s not as dramatic of a change as we\u2019d hoped when first hearing the words \u2018new home screen\u2019, but seeing your next calendar appointment and the weather forecast at a glance is positive nonetheless.",
    "The biggest iPadOS change is actually one that arrives with the macOS Catalina update. It\u2019s called \u2018Sidecar\u2019 and it made our iPad 10.2 a fully-functional second screen when we tested it with our MacBook Pro. We were able to offload Slack and spreadsheets from our main monitor to the iPad, treating it as a second display in a tight New York City coffee shop.",
    "Sidecar makes carrying an iPad a must for productivity-focused travelers. Ever wish your laptop had a second monitor when you were on the road? This is the solution you\u2019ve been waiting for. And at its rock-bottom price, the iPad 10.2 is going to make an ideal choice to fill this need.",
    "Here\u2019s another way that the new iPad 10.2 hasn\u2019t changed, and we\u2019re thankful: it has the same excellent battery life we found in the iPad 9.7. It\u2019s again rated for 10 hours of video playback or web surfing, and we found that to be true in our tests.",
    "Moreover, the iPad lasted us a solid three days with intermittent use \u2013 playing games, watching two shows on Netflix and writing this review using the Smart Keyboard. We did see that battery percentage took a hit when we were playing AR games, as expected, but overall it held up when we used it for half of our work day \u2013 roughly four hours a day.",
    "We have good news and bad news to report based on our recharging tests: the iPad 10.2 takes forever using the included 12W charger. You\u2019re going to need nearly four hours to go from 0% to 100%. In an age where new iPhone 11 Pro phones come with an 18W fast-charger in the box and charge full in a little over 90 minutes, this feels painfully slow.",
    "Here\u2019s the good news: when we swapped out the 12W charger for Apple\u2019s 30W USB-C charger, (the one that comes with the iPad Pro) we were able to get much faster charging speeds. You can even use the 18W iPhone Pro charger to juice back up more quickly.",
    "So the iPad 10.2 is fast-charge compatible, which is something we found out about the iPad Air and iPad mini 5 earlier this year. But all come with 12W iPad 4-era adapters, so you need to make an investment \u2013 or borrow a higher-watt iPhone, iPad or Mac charger."
