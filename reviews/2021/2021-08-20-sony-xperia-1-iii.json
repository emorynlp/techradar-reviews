  "verdict": "The Sony Xperia 1 III isn\u2019t for everyone, but for those who enjoy Sony\u2019s Android phones, or who want a top-tier smartphone with a versatile camera, a beautiful screen and strong battery life, this is a great choice. It\u2019s expensive, and its design means it isn\u2019t for everybody, but if your budget can stretch to it, and you're a fan of its looks, it could be a great option.",
  "pros": [
    "Great battery life",
    "Incredible display",
    "3.5mm headphone jack"

  "cons": [
    "Tricky to handle, for some",

    "The Sony Xperia 1 III is the best smartphone the company has made for years, offering a top-tier smartphone display, great battery life and a versatile camera that\u2019s easier to use than those on previous Sony handsets.",
    "It isn\u2019t the right phone for everyone \u2013 there are some unique elements to Sony\u2019s approach to handsets that means it may not be for you \u2013 but if you like Sony smartphones, or you\u2019re willing to try something a bit different, this could be for you.",
    "Sony is making a song and dance about how this is the world\u2019s first 4K 120Hz smartphone \u2013 although that claim isn\u2019t quite as impressive as it sounds, as Sony is currently the only brand making 4K phones. That 120Hz upgrade makes this screen better than ever though, with super-smooth scrolling the icing on the ultra-high resolution cake.",
    "The 21:9 aspect ratio won\u2019t be for everyone \u2013 it\u2019s designed that way to offer a \u2018big screen\u2019 experience when watching video \u2013 and this has a big impact on the design of the handset, and will make it difficult for people with smaller hands to hold. That said, this is the best screen we\u2019ve seen from Sony for some time, and it\u2019s one of the best on any phone released in 2021 so far.",
    "The camera has been upgraded over the Xperia 1 II \u2013 the new features aren\u2019t game-changing, but the company has included a variable telephoto camera and a few tweaks to the main shooter that make this a stronger handset for photography than previous Sony phones.",
    "In fact, we found this to be the easiest camera to use on a Sony phone for some time. The automatic mode works well, and if you\u2019re willing to play around with the settings you\u2019ll find even more is possible via the in-depth shooting app.",
    "Inside the phone are a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset and 12GB of RAM, which we found delivered impressive performance throughout our testing, and you\u2019ve got the option of 256GB or 512GB of storage. That\u2019s plenty of power, and more than enough storage space for the average user.",
    "Sony has also improved the battery life here, by increasing the size of the cell, as well as by implementing a few new optimizations enabled by the new chipset. We found that the phone was able to last a full day even with intensive usage, and there are also new wireless charging features, such as reverse charging.",
    "There\u2019s no denying that the price of the Xperia 1 III is high, and the 21:9 aspect ratio design will put some off, too. But if those aren\u2019t issues for you, and you want a highly capable smartphone with a superb screen, the Xperia 1 III may be the perfect phone for you.",
    "The Sony Xperia 1 III was revealed on April 14, 2021, and the official release date was set for over four months later on August 19. That was a long gap between being announced and it being on sale, but you can now readily buy the handset in the US and UK.",
    "The starting price of the phone is $1,299.99 in the US and \u00a31,199 (around AU$2,200) in the UK, which is slightly more than the launch cost of the Xperia 1 II.",
    "There's no word on whether it'll arrive in Australia. Sony doesn't traditionally sell its phones in Australia, so we're not expecting it to be easily on sale there.",
    "The design of Sony Xperia 1 III isn\u2019t significantly different to that of recent Sony flagship phones, so if you've seen previous handsets from the company you can expect a similar affair here.",
    "The same long-and-narrow design returns here, with a 6.5-inch 21:9 aspect ratio display. This aspect ratio means the phone is longer than a lot of rival flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Xiaomi Mi 11.",
    "The main difference between this phone and 2020\u2019s Sony Xperia 1 II is that it\u2019s slightly thicker \u2013 that\u2019s to fit in a larger battery, which we\u2019ll cover below. It doesn\u2019t feel too thick though, and it feels reassuringly premium.",
    "The handset weighs 186g, and that increases by a few grams if you opt for the Xperia 1 III in its mmWave 5G variant (that\u2019s the one on sale in the US).",
    "It has a glass rear with a brushed finish that makes it easy to grip, although its sheer size, at 165 x 71 x 8.2mm in a 21:9 aspect ratio, makes it an awkward handset for those with smaller hands to grasp comfortably \u2013 if you\u2019re one of these people we\u2019d recommend getting a case for the phone, as you may find it\u2019s easily dropped",
    "The volume rocker and power button are on the right edge of the phone, and the fingerprint scanner is built into the power button, so you\u2019re not getting an in-screen sensor, as you do a lot of other phones around this price.",
    "Below the power button is a Google Assistant button, which we didn\u2019t find we used much during our testing time. This sits flush with the handset, so it\u2019s unlikely to be something you\u2019ll find yourself hitting by accident.",
    "There\u2019s also a dedicated camera shutter button at the bottom of this edge, positioned so that it\u2019s easy to hit when you\u2019re holding the phone in landscape mode; Sony has even embossed it on the Xperia 1 III so it's easier to work out which button you\u2019re hitting.",
    "The bottom edge houses the USB-C port and the SIM tray is on the left edge, while on the top edge is the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 this will be a major selling point for some, as it\u2019s a feature that\u2019s not available on a lot of top-end phones.",
    "There are also front-facing stereo speakers on the Xperia 1 III, something that has always been a highlight of Sony\u2019s top-end phones. For this generation, they\u2019re 30% louder and it makes a noticeable difference; if you\u2019re after a phone with great speakers, this is a serious contender.",
    "Sony is selling the Xperia 1 III with the tagline of it being the world\u2019s first smartphone with a 4K 120Hz display. As we\u2019ve mentioned, this isn\u2019t a huge surprise, as Sony is the only company offering 4K displays on a smartphone right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean the experience isn\u2019t fantastic.",
    "A 4K resolution is often wasted on a smartphone screen due to the limited size \u2013 and particularly with a 6.5-inch screen it can sometimes be difficult to see the difference between a QHD resolution and 4K, but it\u2019s noticeable when watching 4K movies and videos.",
    "That 120Hz refresh rate, meanwhile, is a game-changer \u2013 previous 4K Sony smartphones haven\u2019t offered anything above 60Hz. 120Hz means the image on your screen refreshes at 120 times per second, which means the on-screen image will look smoother when you're playing games or watching movies, or even just scrolling your Instagram feed.",
    "There are two image quality modes on the Xperia 1 III: Standard mode (which is on by default), or a Creator mode, which is designed to offer faithful color reproduction and a variety of other image-processing enhancements to make content look as close as possible to how its creators intended.",
    "We found ourselves using this mode more regularly, and it didn\u2019t seem to have a detrimental effect on the battery life of the handset. Colors weren\u2019t as vibrant when navigating the phone\u2019s user interface, but they looked more true to life in video.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a phone on which to watch films, videos or TV shows, the Xperia 1 III is a great option. The 21:9 aspect ratio also offers something unique for mobile gaming, as it allows you to see more of the playing environment than on other handsets.",
    "Sony has tweaked the camera experience on its flagship smartphone for 2021 rather than overhauling it, and that isn't a bad thing. The camera isn\u2019t the absolute best on the market in its auto mode, but we found that it captured images that are comparable with those from most top-end phones in 2021.",
    "Heading up the camera array is a 12MP f/1.7 aperture 24mm wide-angle shooter, which acts as the main camera. There\u2019s also a 12MP f/2.2 16mm ultra-wide for when you need to get more people, or more of a scene, into the frame.",
    "The unique element of the Xperia 1 III\u2019s camera setup is an adaptive telephoto camera, which comprises a 12MP sensor and two lenses \u2013 a f/2.3 70mm telephoto lens, and a f/.2.8 105mm lens for even greater reach.",
    "Why would you want an adaptive camera? Sony says this is faster than switching between two separate telephoto cameras, and in our testing we found using the camera to be a smooth experience that can offer great image quality and more flexible use than on other phones.",
    "The 70mm lens is designed to zoom in to 2.9x, while the 105mm lens offers 4.4x zoom; beyond that there\u2019s digital zoom up to 12.5x. The zoom won\u2019t offer the same quality of Samsung\u2019s telephoto zoom on products like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but it does offer a good experience alongside the main camera.",
    "If you\u2019re looking specifically for a telephoto shooter you\u2019re better off going for a flagship phone from Samsung, but it\u2019s a nice perk to have on the Xperia 1 III, and you\u2019ll find it helpful when you want to capture long-range shots. Here\u2019s an example of what the Xperia 1 III telephoto cameras can do:",
    "The big photography feature of the Xperia 1 III that Sony is talking up is the company\u2019s fast autofocus Dual PDAF technology. We found this to work fantastically in our testing, with the camera able to track objects such as animals or humans to ensure it\u2019s less likely to blur when you hit the shutter button.",
    "It\u2019s especially useful when you\u2019re taking photos of pets or other animals who can\u2019t be relied on to keep still while you snap their portrait, and the autofocus meant we were consistently getting a great image.",
    "Images contain impressive levels of detail, and colors feel true to life. The colors may not be exactly to your taste \u2013 for example, Samsung and iPhone cameras both produce a slightly more vibrant image \u2013 but if you want colors that look as close as possible to what you see in real life, you won\u2019t go far wrong with the Xperia 1 III.",
    "The front camera is exactly the same as the one on the Xperia 1 II, which we found produced good-quality selfies. This camera is housed in the bezel at the top of the phone, and it\u2019s an 8MP f/2.0 camera that\u2019s good enough for the odd shot for social media, as well as for video calls.",
    "The Xperia 1 III is equipped to offer flagship performance, with the top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 running the show, teamed with 12GB of RAM.",
    "You can pick up the handset with either 256GB or 512GB of storage, but unlike in previous generations you\u2019ll get 12GB of RAM with both \u2013 and if you need more storage on top of that, you can expand on it via the microSD slot.",
    "In everyday use we found that the Xperia 1 III delivered top-tier smartphone performance \u2013 it\u2019s able to run any game you\u2019ll find on the Google Play Store, and we found that apps loaded as quickly as you\u2019d expect for a top-end phone.",
    "We didn\u2019t encounter any stuttering, and the Android 11 software onboard worked smoothly. Sony lays its own user interface over the top of Android \u2013 we like the look it brings, and it also offers a few extras that you don\u2019t get with stock Android.",
    "The phone will launch with Android 11 software onboard, and the company has suggested it'll be upgrading to Android 12 and Android 13 (or whatever that iteration is called) in future.",
    "The Xperia 1 III scored an average of 3233 in our Geekbench 5 testing, which is a touch below what we\u2019d expect from a top-end phone in 2021. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S21 scored 3367 (that\u2019s the version running the Exynos 2100 chipset), and the OnePlus 9 Pro beat that with 3630.",
    "That may look subpar on paper, but in real-world use we didn\u2019t notice any performance shortfalls compared to the OnePlus 9 Pro.",
    "5G is a big focus for the Xperia 1 III, and this is the first time Sony has offered the next-gen internet technology on its US flagship phone. The variant of this phone in the US is compatible with mmWave technology.",
    "In our limited testing (pandemic restrictions have limited our travel options), we found 5G connectivity to work well, with the strength and reliability of the signal being comparable with other handsets of this type.",
    "Sony has included a larger battery here than in the Xperia 1 II, and it makes a noticeable difference, with the phone lasting for at least an hour longer than during our testing time with the last-gen phone.",
    "It\u2019s a 4,500mAh cell, compared to a 4,000mAh one in the Xperia 1 II. That doesn\u2019t seem like a huge difference on paper, but combined with the power-usage optimizations enabled by the Snapdragon 888 we found it to make a noticeable difference.",
    "We often found the Xperia 1 III would have plenty of charge left at the end of a full working day, and we always had around 10% or so left in the tank at around 11pm.",
    "Sony has also improved its fast-charging here, so you\u2019ll get a 30W charger with the phone. While many other manufacturers have dropped the charger from the box, Sony has decided to continue including one.",
    "What does 30W charging mean in practical terms? In theory it means that if your phone is at zero it\u2019ll get you to 50% charged in just 30 minutes, and having used the charger in the box we found this to be accurate.",
    "Wireless charging is also an option here, although we\u2019ve yet to learn the exact stats for that.",
    "Sony has also included reverse wireless charging for the first time here, which we found worked well \u2013 this allows you to charge devices such as headphones, smartwatches or other phones from your phone\u2019s battery.",
    "This is particularly helpful, for example, if your headphones have died and you want to give them a quick boost. As with other brands\u2019 reverse-charging tech, the charging speeds aren\u2019t particularly impressive, but it\u2019s useful in a push.",
