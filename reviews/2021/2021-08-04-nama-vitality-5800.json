  "verdict": "The Nama Vitality 5800 comes with a high price tag, it\u2019s aimed at serious juice fans who are happy to pay the extra money for a juicer that performs well and extracts maximum juice yields. It makes clear smooth juices with minimal froth and can also be used to make smoothies and sorbet too. It\u2019s neat, compact and simple to use, but the parts can\u2019t be washed in the dishwasher.",

    "The Nama Vitality 5800 is a vertical masticating juicer, also known as a slow juicer. These juicers work by grinding or chewing up the fruit and vegetables, then pushing through a filter to extract the juice. This model includes three filters or strainers, one for juice, one for smoothies, and another that allows you to use frozen fruits to make instant sorbet.",
    "Good quality slow juicers are usually much more expensive than centrifugal juicers and this model is no exception, it\u2019s got a high price tag, but the smoothie and sorbet strainers are included in the price and make it more versatile than a traditional juice only model, and it's one of the best juicers we\u2019ve tested.",
    "It has a neat compact design that won\u2019t take up too much space on the countertop and the juice jug and pulp container are big enough for daily juice requirements unless you\u2019re a large household, in which case you may need to empty them part way through juicing. The small feed chute does also mean that larger fruits will need to be chopped up before juicing, which does add a bit more prep time.",
    "With good juice yields and very smooth clear juice, this high-priced juicer is excellent when it comes to producing clear, froth-free juice and will suit those looking for a juicer that minimizes waste and makes great juice.",
    "The Nama Vitality 5800 is available through the Nama website in the US / Australia or through UK Juicers in the UK.",
    "It\u2019s an expensive masticating juicer but is designed to be a multi-purpose model that can be used for smoothies, nut milk, and sorbets without having to purchase additional attachments separately.",
    "From the minute you open the box, it\u2019s clear that a lot of thought has gone into the Nama Vitality 5800, it\u2019s packed in a very considered and neat way that makes unboxing a pleasure. At 14.1lbs/ 6.5kg it\u2019s noticeably heavy for a juicer which is something to consider if you plan to put it away in a cupboard after every use. On the plus side, the compact footprint means if you\u2019re planning on leaving it on the countertop, it won\u2019t take up too much space. It measures 18 x 8.8 x 7.1 inches/ 45.5 x 23.2 x 20.3 cm (h x w d).",
    "It\u2019s simple to assemble without having to refer to the instruction manual and with only two settings to choose from; on or reverse, it\u2019s a simple juicer to use. It comes with three interchangeable strainers, for smoothie, juice, and sorbet - making it more versatile than a standard juicer. There\u2019s also a pulp control lever for additional control over the amount of pulp in smoothies.",
    "The 0.2 gallon / 1 liter juice jug and 0.37 gallon / 1.7 liter pulp container are large enough for most people\u2019s daily juicing needs but also quick and easy to empty should they fill up. The juice jug comes with a lid for storing juice in the fridge and the juice cap can be closed so it doesn\u2019t drip onto the countertop while the jug isn\u2019t in place.",
    "There\u2019s a feed tube that has an integrated feed hopper making it easy to feed in smaller items like nuts or berries and it can be assembled with the hopper to the right or left depending on your preference. The feed tube is small though so fruits like apples and pears need to be cut up before juicing.",
    "We tried out several juices in the Nama Vitality 5800, first off orange juice. Oranges need to be peeled and broken into smaller segments so they\u2019ll fit into the feed chute. From 1.47lb / 667g oranges we got 0.13 gallon / 499 ml juice which is a good yield of almost 75%, meaning only 25% of the oranges ended up in the waste pulp container. The orange juice was very clear and smooth with absolutely no froth at all, an impressive result.",
    "Next up we juiced carrots which just had to be cut in half lengthways and again the juice was very clear and smooth with no froth. The juice yield was almost 46% which is an average result.",
    "Fans of kale shots will be pleased to know this juicer impressed us when juicing kale, with a juice yield of 51% which far exceeds the performance you\u2019ll get from a centrifugal juicer. There was a small amount of froth on top and some very fine pieces of kale got into the juice which meant it wasn\u2019t 100% clear and pulp-free but a good result nonetheless. At 78dB juicing kale was the noisiest of the juices we made in this juicer but it is still quiet in comparison to centrifugal juicers.",
    "Next we put it to the test with a mixed green juice and some tough ingredients. We juiced ginger, celery, broccoli, parsley, apple and pear. The apple and pear had to be cut up to fit in the feed chute, but the celery stalks could be fed in whole. It didn\u2019t struggle with any of these ingredients, making another clear juice although it did contain a small amount of very fine pulp and there was a small amount of froth on top too. With a yield of 72% it processed these tough ingredients well with minimal waste.",
    "It comes with a sorbet attachment, so we tried it out using a berry and yogurt sorbet recipe from the included recipe book. Initially the sorbet came out looking dry, with the berries and yogurt not fully mixed, but after a minute of standing and a good stir, it turned into a tasty healthy dessert that took very little time to prepare.",
    "It takes around 30 seconds to juice a whole apple, which is slower than a centrifugal juicer, but typical for this type of masticating juicer. None of the parts are dishwasher safe which will be disappointing to some, but it comes with a cleaning brush and it\u2019s not too tricky to clean, the instruction manual also explains how to run water through it to aid the cleaning process.",
