  "verdict": "LED light strips aren\u2019t new, but to get one that\u2019s as affordable and smart as the Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip isn\u2019t easy. This is the first light strip from the brand known for its wall panels, and Nanoleaf has got it just right. The Essentials Lightstrip is bright, produces beautiful colors and is easy to set up. It\u2019s future-proof with Thread connectivity onboard, but it works just as well on a Bluetooth connection.",

    "UPDATE: The Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip had a few missing features at launch, namely music and screen syncing. Those have now been rolled out and we've updated our original review below to reflect that change.",
    "Stepping away from its light panels, Nanoleaf has gone back to basics with its Essentials A19 smart bulb and Essentials Lightstrip. What makes them both exciting offerings in the smart lighting market is their affordability without compromising on features.",
    "Like its bulb brother, the Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip is also compatible with Apple\u2019s HomeKit and Google Assistant, it\u2019s remarkably easy to set up and has its own little controller that can be wall-mounted to be used like a regular switchboard.",
    "It can definitely give Philips Hue\u2019s Lightstrip Plus a run for its money, especially now (almost a year since its original launch in late 2020) that there's features like monitor syncing which was missing until the last round of firmware updates.",
    "Like the Essentials smart bulb though, the light strip\u2019s full potential can only be unlocked by using a Thread-enabled device like the Apple HomePod mini or the latest Apple TV 4K. But we found its Bluetooth connectivity to more than sufficient for anyone without either of the aforementioned Apple devices.",
    "All in all, the Essentials Lightstrip is an attractive option for anyone looking to brighten up their home decor with some smart lights.",
    "At just $49.95 / \u00a344.99 / AU$99.99 for the two-meter strip, the Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip is arguably the most affordable smart light strip you can get today. In comparison, the 2m Philips Hue equivalent (V4 White and Color Ambiance) costs about $80 / \u00a370 / AU$149. That makes the Essentials a far more attractive option, with a similar feature set and Thread connectivity built in.",
    "The Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip isn\u2019t remarkably different from most others available on the market today. The starter pack is a 2m (80 inches) strip that\u2019s a touch over half-inch wide, housing 21 LEDs per meter in groups of five.",
    "Meter-long (40-inch) expansions are available, and up to eight can be connected to the Lightstrip for a total of 10m (400 inches). Anything more and the brightness will be affected.",
    "Like the Nanoleaf light panels, the Essentials Lightstrip has a peel-and-stick adhesive layer on the back, and comes with a power cable connected to a small controller (also with its own adhesive pads) at one end and a rather chunky AC adaptor at the other. Another small cable connects the strip itself to the controller via tiny pins.",
    "The controller can handle all the basic functions \u2013 power on/off, cycle through single colors and dim/brighten the light. It can\u2019t change Scenes, though, for which you will need to use the Nanoleaf app.",
    "Setting up the Nanoleaf Lightstrip isn\u2019t very different from any other light strip on the market. You need to measure the surface you want the lights on, then cut the required length and stick it on. You can\u2019t cut anywhere, of course \u2013 Nanoleaf has marked the correct spots with a scissor icon at intervals of 33cm (13 inches), so your final strip might be either a little small or a little longer than you might need, an issue you\u2019ll face with any light strip.",
    "Once you\u2019ve stuck your strip where you want it, you can stick the controller to a nearby surface (wall or shelving unit) to resemble a switchboard. Then plug the AC adaptor into a wall socket, switch it on and scan the QR code provided in the box with either Apple\u2019s Home app or the Nanoleaf companion app. Even if you use the latter and happen to be an iPhone or iPad user, the light will automatically get added to the Home app. You can set it up via the Google Home app if you\u2019re an Android user.",
    "As mentioned earlier, the Lightstrip is Thread-enabled, meaning there\u2019s an alternate way to connect, provided you have what is called a Thread \u2018border\u2019 router. While there are several devices from Google and Amazon that have Thread radios in them to work as routers, none of them have been \u2018switched on\u2019, with the sole exception of the Apple HomePod mini and, more recently, the latest Apple TV 4K. If you happen to own Apple\u2019s diminutive smart speaker or streaming box, the Lightstrip will be connected immediately with no extra steps needed.",
    "When connected via Thread, the Lightstrip is quick to respond, but is a little slower when used over Bluetooth.",
    "The light strip has a rated life span of 25,000 hours, with white light temperatures ranging from a warm 2,700 Kelvin to a cold 6,500 Kelvin. There\u2019s also support for 16 million colors but only a single color can be displayed at a time, which is a shame as the effects of color zones can be quite mesmerizing.",
    "For a light strip, the Essentials is bright \u2013 where the Philips Hue V4 White and Color Ambiance has a maximum brightness of 1,600 lumens, the Nanoleaf tops out 2,200 lumens, with average brightness of 2,000 lumens. When using a just a white or yellow hue in full brightness, it's enough to light up a room quite well.",
    "If you already have an Apple HomePod mini or the Apple TV 4K and have connected the Lightstrip using Thread protocol, then you\u2019ll find the lights responding to any command immediately. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve connected via Bluetooth \u2013 which is what will happen if you don\u2019t own a HomePod mini \u2013 the lights take between two to four seconds to respond, even if you\u2019re well within range. This lag is a little longer than what we found with the Essentials A19 light bulb working over Bluetooth, and can be a little frustrating, but not once did we find that the Lightstrip failed to respond.",
    "At launch, the Lightstrip\u2019s most interesting features hadn't been rolled out yet, like being able to mirror a monitor\u2019s colors or the lights syncing to existing Nanoleaf Shapes panels and ambient music. A recent firmware update has now added those features, but you will have to be connected to a Thread device to use those features \u2013 anyone operating the light strip via Bluetooth is going to lose out.",
    "That said, Circadian Lighting is available on the Lightstrip (like it is on the Essentials bulb) and this automatically tunes the color temperature of the light to suit the time of day in your location. You can also apply some Scenes that are available on the Nanoleaf app (there's a vast library of those), and the adventurous can create their own custom Scenes, but note that only a single color will be displayed at a time \u2013 no rainbow hues here.",
    "While the Lightstrip is compatible with both Siri and Google Assistant, there\u2019s no support for Alexa, although Nanoleaf has promised that it\u2019s high on its to-do list.",
    "While smart bulbs have become commonplace, light strips are still not quite as mainstream. But when you have one that\u2019s as affordable as the Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip, it\u2019s easy to reach for it. And you really don\u2019t need an Apple HomePod mini to use the Lightstrip. Yes, it\u2019s slow to respond when connected via Bluetooth, but that\u2019s on the wireless protocol, not a problem with the smart lights. Once more Thread-enabled devices become available, the need for Bluetooth connectivity might be eliminated.",
    "Until then, there are just a couple of Apple devices that can be used to take full advantage of the Essentials Lightstrip, an important consideration if you want to play around with the advanced features like monitor mirroring and music syncing. If you can live without those features, though, we couldn\u2019t recommend the Essentials Light Strip highly enough.",
    "It\u2019s easy to answer that question with a simple \u2018yes\u2019, but only if you\u2019re really keen on bias lighting. The good thing about bias lighting is that it doesn\u2019t have to be for a TV or a computer monitor \u2013 you can stick the Essentials Light Strip on shelving units and even behind your bed\u2019s headboard for some beautiful effects.",
    "It\u2019s bright enough to be the only light source you might need in a small room (albeit not to read by) and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. If you can be patient with its response time over Bluetooth, then you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a similar product as affordable and feature-packed as the Essentials Light Strip.",
