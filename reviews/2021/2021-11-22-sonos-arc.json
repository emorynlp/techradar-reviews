    "Sonos' latest surround sound solution is contained entirely in a single soundbar it calls Arc. While we\u2019re not sure if the device gets its name from the HDMI interface it uses, the curved sound it pitches or the fact that it is perhaps, metaphorically, a vessel delivering impressive surround sound to the modern minimalist home, whichever the case this system is hell-bent on short circuiting the surround sound game.",
    "The Sonos Arc draws on Dolby\u2019s latest TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus sound codecs to deliver the best quality lossless audio found on cutting edge Blu-ray disks and some of the leading streaming services. It then enhances the 3D soundscape using Dolby Atmos object tracks to bounce certain sounds off the walls around you so they feel like they\u2019re coming at you from all angles.",
    "While all this might sound complicated, the Sonos Arc setup couldn\u2019t be simpler, involving just a couple of steps on the smartphone app. The minimalist cable connections and all-in-one system construction add to this no-fuss feeling and streamlined aesthetic. If you\u2019ve got a media room with four walls and a roof then this Dolby Atmos soundbar is really all you need for great surround sound.",
    "There are some caveats for those with expansive TV rooms \u2013 or smaller rooms that might be able to get away with using the smaller and more affordable Sonos Beam (Gen 2) instead \u2013 but all up, the Arc is a pretty amazing bit of kit that can mimic true 3D sound from a sleek and self-contained unit \u2013 and that's why it's our best soundbar of 2021.",
    "Read on to see what really separates it from other soundbars.",
    "The Sonos Arc soundbar launched globally on June 10, 2020 and cost $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 as a standalone unit. However, after Sonos announced a nearly product-wide price hike, it now costs $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,499.",
    "While this Atmos-enabled speaker is perfectly capable on its own, you can also add the Sonos Sub (Gen 3) for $749 / \u00a3749 / AU$1099 for a bit of extra bass, or a pair of One SLs for rear left and right surround sound which will set you back $199 / \u00a3179 / AU$289 each. These speakers have also increased in price since their launch, which can really hurt if you planned on buying them one piece at a time.",
    "The Arc has been designed to sit on the tabletop beneath your TV, but you can also mount it below a screen using the Sonos Arc compatible wall mount ($79 / \u00a379 / AU$99). Of course, if that takes up too much space, you can always snag a Sonos Beam (Gen 2) for a significantly lower price or wait for Black Friday and Cyber Monday to save some money.",
    "There was a time where you wouldn\u2019t consider anything other than a multi speaker array for the best quality surround sound, but Dolby Atmos is leading the charge to deliver 3D audio effects from a more streamlined system \u2014 and there's no better example of this than the Sonos Arc.",
    "The self contained single unit has only two essential inputs: a power cable and a HDMI in, and while an Ethernet socket and a Digital Optical to HDMI adapter are available out of the box, it\u2019s only recommended you use them if you absolutely have to. Sonos doesn\u2019t even include a remote, suggesting you instead connect the soundbar to your TV via the Audio Return Channel (ARC) and just use your TV remote or control it through the new Sonos S2 smartphone app.",
    "Even the colour choices are simple with the Arc, being available in just Black or White. And while you can of course pair the Sonos Arc soundbar with the Sonos Sub or a pair of One SL speakers for deeper bass and true surround sound, it\u2019s been created to be an excellent audio solution on its own, which cuts down on overall clutter.",
    "Since the Arc is intended to bounce audio off the roof and walls of your room to create a 3D soundscape, it\u2019s wrapped on the top, front, and either end by metal, hole-punch speaker grilles that cover the various orientations of the Atmos driver array.",
    "The soundbar sits a little higher than some at 3.4-inches (8.7cm), but the built in IR repeater means it won\u2019t block your remote connection and this extra headroom gives a little more space to the upward firing Atmos drivers. At 45-inches (114.17cm) wide it\u2019ll line up roughly with the edges of your average 55-inch TV, but it also looks fine with anything bigger.",
    "There is a simple status LED light that self-adjusts brightness according to ambient light and the subtle capacitive play/pause, volume and mute buttons help it blend into the background.",
    "There\u2019s two rear reinforced holes to wall mount the 13.78 lb (6.25 kg) unit for a forward facing mounting setup, but naturally the bass response is a little more concentrated when it can reflect off a tabletop surface.",
    "In order to get proper Dolby Atmos surround sound, you\u2019ll need your media to be encoded in DolbyTrueHD or Dolby Digital Plus, and you\u2019ll need your app, TV and receiver to be able to process, or at least pass-through, these formats.",
    "While there is a Digital Optical converter included with the Arc, Atmos can only be carried over HDMI 2.1, so by connecting it you\u2019ll be sacrificing top quality sound. Dolby Atmos still isn't ubiquitous in terms of availability so making sure you have all the right bits can be a bit of a process. To see if your other current components are Atmos-ready check out our Dolby Atmos explainer.",
    "Much like everything else with the Arc, the setup process is designed to be as simple as possible, all done through the new Sonos S2 smartphone app. After the initial plug in, you\u2019re asked to download the app from the App store or Google Play Store (if you don\u2019t already have it).",
    "Then, you'll need to follow a couple of prompts to connect the TV to Wi-Fi, any audio streaming or internet radio services you may already be signed up to, and your choice of Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. Other than this there\u2019s not much else to the setup, it\u2019s a relatively painless process (especially if you already have a Sonos account).",
    "There is one last task you\u2019ll want to perform before firing up your favourite high definition audio, however: Trueplay Tuning. Trueplay is Sonos\u2019 proprietary adaptive soundscape tool which analyzes the shape of a room in order to best balance the sound output for everyone in it.",
    "We got a feel for how capable Sonos was in this department when it released its Move portable speaker which was able to compensate for acoustic environments as hostile as being covered by pillows. It\u2019s the feature that really distinguishes the Arc from your average soundbar.",
    "There is one pretty considerable hitch, however: Trueplay is only compatible with iOS devices. This is a big inconvenience for non-Apple users and Sonos says that the diversity in Android hardware means it isn\u2019t planning on developing it anytime soon.",
    "Fortunately, you can borrow an iOS device to run the calibration in the soundbar\u2019s final location and it\u2019ll remain true as long as you keep things in vaguely the same place. It\u2019s a bit of an inconvenience, but on balance it\u2019s probably simpler than having to store a dedicated tuning microphone somewhere memorable after setup.",
    "The one area we did have some issues was integrating our smart assistant into the Sonos Arc. While a number of Sonos systems have already featured integrated Google and Amazon smart assistants, they have offered capped experiences and because we weren\u2019t able to quickly set this feature up we haven\u2019t been able to see if there\u2019s been any development here yet.",
    "The most notable of these limitations is that you can\u2019t use them in third-party multi-room Wi-Fi speaker arrangements, but since we suspect Sonos does this to encourage investment in additional Sonos speakers, we don\u2019t expect this to change anytime soon.",
    "The Sonos Arc\u2019s audio capabilities are pretty amazing all up. Eight elliptical woofers combine to deliver a solid overall bass response and the tuning balances a nice amount of warmth through the mids with an impressive level of clarity.",
    "This precision is matched by the three silk dome tweeters that deliver particularly crisp highs with an impressive level of control. We were particularly taken by the unit's ability to deliver soundscapes that distinguished sound from individual instruments during particular arrangements without feeling disjointed.",
    "This type of spatial precision makes sense when you consider that the Sonos Arc was designed to make the most of Dolby Atmos, an audio codec which separates sounds into object based audio tracks, so particular sources can be quickly shifted between speakers and bounced around the room more easily. So unsurprisingly, the Arc is very capable once you\u2019ve tuned it to the room and it\u2019s able to bounce effects around and behind you.",
    "It\u2019s worth pointing out that because the system uses your room to actually get the sound around you there\u2019s going to be some variation in the Arc\u2019s ability to deliver surround sound.",
    "We tested it in a room with a 20 foot (6 meter) vaulted ceiling and a nib wall behind the sofa, which makes it essentially impossible to bounce audio around behind you.",
    "So while we were able to experience excellent height and left/right soundscape movement, we definitely didn\u2019t get the same surround sound experience as a multi-speaker array.",
    "That said, the speaker\u2019s audio positioning was good enough that in a boxier media room we\u2019d expect you\u2019d be able to get surprisingly close to multi-speaker surround sound using just the Arc soundbar.",
    "We really didn\u2019t see any need to add a Sub to the Arc soundbar, there was more than enough powerful bass to allow you to feel those on-screen explosions or beat drops when turned up loud. We even felt the night mode settings that lower the bass EQ would be a useful feature for those in apartments with thin walls.",
