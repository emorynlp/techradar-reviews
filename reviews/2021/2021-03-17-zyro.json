    "After looking at the various best website builder platforms available, it\u2019s easy to see how Zyro stands out: it\u2019s extremely straightforward and easy for new website builders to use. You don\u2019t have to worry about learning complex features. You can build your website or online store faster since most of the work is already done for you. It\u2019s easy to choose a template and start filling in the test, images, and videos you\u2019d like to place on your website.",
    "There are more than 150 templates available, which is less than some other providers. However, templates are segmented according to the category and elements are aligned according to their functionality, so there's a lot of versatility. That\u2019s why this website builder is great for beginners.",
    "It\u2019s surprising how affordable the paid plans are compared to other web hosts. For example, the Basic plan costs $1.89 per month ($1.70 with discount code), comes with 3GB of bandwidth and 1GB of storage. You can link to your own domain, receive an SSL certificate, have access to stronger SEO, and the Zyro ads are removed from your page. Many other web hosting programs offer similar services for $4.00 per month or more for a basic plan. If you\u2019re interested in building a personal brand or creating a quick website, this plan will help you complete the job.",
    "The Unleashed plan is a big step up from the Basic plan at a small price difference. For $3.09 per month, the Unleashed plan includes unlimited storage and bandwidth, access to Google analytics, Google tag manager, and a Messenger live chat. This plan is designed for people starting their own businesses who don\u2019t want to spend too much time creating their website.",
    "If you\u2019re interested in selling your own products, then the Ecommerce plan might be right for you. This plan allows you to sell up to 100 products and costs $8.99 per month. Zyro doesn\u2019t take any commission from what you sell, making you entirely independent. There\u2019s a lot of ecommerce features, including discount coupons, gift cards, and order tracking.",
    "Zyro\u2019s interface is very easy to use. Setting up an account is straightforward. It\u2019s easy to browse the website and find templates to view before ever deciding to purchase Zyro. All of the templates are labeled by design so you can easily look through them, and are easy to search for by keyword. If you scroll over one of the designs, you\u2019ll have the option to view the template in more detail, or start building right away.",
    "There are a number of exciting features associated with Zyro, such as a bunch of AI supported tools, such as AI writer, AI logo maker, AI slogan generator, brand name generator and other. These can offer a great way for inexperienced users to get started faster.",
    "Additionally, global styles can be easily edited, so that all fonts, sizes and colors could be changed in all templates can be changed with just a few clicks.",
    "The ecommerce platform offers over 50 payment options, allowing you to sell on wb, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, order tracking, inventory management, as well as shipping and tax management.",
    "There's even a blogging feature available for all websites, so users don't need to worry about setting that up separately.",
    "Speed is a constant feature of Zyro, not just with set up but publishing, too, with finished websites currently loading up especially fast, which can be important not just for customers but also a factor in search engine placement.",
    "Unlike other platforms there is also 24/7 live customer support.",
    "Some of the top competitors to Zyro are Wix and Squarespace. Both of these web hosting options are considerably more expensive for even the most basic plans. Wix personal plan starts at $13.00 per month. Although Squarespace and Wix offer more design features, Zyro is the best place to start if you\u2019re looking for something less expensive.",
    "Overall, Zyro is a great drag-and-drop website builder for beginners. Because there are less design features, setting up your own website is less time consuming. Even if you already own a domain, you can still register with Zyro and start using a web host that\u2019s cheaper.",
    "With plans starting at $1.89 per month, there\u2019s little to complain about. The great thing about Zyro is you can always upgrade or downgrade any of the plans you use. Plus, if you decide to cancel a paid plan, there\u2019s a 30 day money back guarantee.",
    "The unique AI writer could end up saving you hours of time you\u2019d otherwise spend creating text content for your website. Zyro is a web host designed to be quick and easy. Rather than dealing with fancy design tools, you can focus on getting your website up and running."
