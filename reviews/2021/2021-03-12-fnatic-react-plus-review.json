    "The Fnatic React Plus is an impressive gaming headset that delivers where it matters. Armed with two 53mm drivers in either earcup, which are calibrated to prevent bass frequencies from overpowering the mids/highs, we\u2019re not exaggerating when we say you\u2019ll perform better in your favorite competitive online multiplayer games when wearing these headphones.",
    "These aren\u2019t the most comfortable pair of headphones we\u2019ve ever worn, but we\u2019re huge fans of the memory foam, protein leather earpads that conform to your head shape and isolate sound extremely well. The headset\u2019s controls take a pleasing no nonsense approach, too: there\u2019s a dedicated volume wheel, a mic mute button and that\u2019s it.",
    "Competitive gamers will know that sound is only one part of the equation, however. If you can\u2019t communicate clearly with your teammates, you could cost your squad that vital win. Thankfully the Fnatic React Plus headset\u2019s microphone won\u2019t let you down \u2013 we were told that we always sounded crystal clear during voice chat, and that the headset\u2019s microphone actually sounded clearer than some of the more expensive cans we\u2019ve tested like the Astro A50 Wireless Headset.",
    "Falling into that under $100 / \u00a3120 / AU$140 sweet spot, you\u2019re getting a lot for your money here, which makes this gaming headset incredibly easy to recommend. Some may find the sound signature slightly bright, but the clarity provided during games is first-rate.",
    "The Fnatic React Plus cost $74.99 / \u00a384.99 / AU$140. That pits Fnatic\u2019s headphones in direct competition with the Razer Blackshark V2, HyperX Cloud Alpha and cheaper wireless headphones.",
    "It\u2019s a lucrative market to target for gaming and audio companies, as some might argue that higher end gaming headsets have diminishing returns when it comes to audio quality, but focus more on additional features instead.",
    "The Fnatic React Plus gaming headset has a delightfully understated but considered design. The all black color scheme is embellished with silver accents and tasteful branding, and it helps the headset look smart without screaming \u201cthis is for gamers\u201d. Fnatic\u2019s signature orange color can be found inside the earcups, which are lined with large \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 indicators that let you know how to wear the headset at a glance.",
    "The Fnatic React Plus comes fitted with premium protein leather earcups, but there\u2019s also a pair of velour earcups in the box if you\u2019d prefer more breathability and a more open soundstage. We opted for the leather earcups for the majority of our testing, as we enjoyed the amount of passive isolation and comfort they provided.",
    "Our particular review unit was rather light when it came to clamping force, causing the bottom of the earcups to flair outwards slightly unless we positioned the headset band directly on top of our head. We\u2019ve seen reports that other people haven\u2019t experienced this issue, though, which means build quality could be a bit hit or miss on some units. That being said, we\u2019ve been pleased with the ruggedness of the headset overall and found it remained comfortable during hours of play.",
    "This is where the Fnatic React Plus surprised us most. For a headset that is focused on esports, we were expecting blown out highs with a harsh sibilant sound. However, the Fnatic React Plus provides a smooth sound signature that\u2019s packed with detail. Bass bleed is also avoided thanks to the headset\u2019s designated frequency chambers that deliver tight bass, but those who enjoy a noticeable thud whenever explosions happen may be disappointed.",
    "When testing the Fnatic React Plus in titles such as PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone and Halo 5: Guardians, we had no problems whatsoever determining where an enemy was positioned, or where the latest firefight was taking place. The headset helped us hear the most crucial audio information we needed, but also delivered a natural sound that didn\u2019t make titles we\u2019ve sunk countless hours into come across as artificial in any way. We quickly found ourselves missing the headset\u2019s audio quality when using other headsets that we\u2019d come to depend on when gaming.",
    "The Fnatic React Plus are incredibly easy to drive, too. With an impedance of 23 Ohms and a frequency response of 20Hz-40kHZ, you won\u2019t have any problems when it comes to volume. These cans get loud, seriously loud, and can be driven by a PS5 DualSense controller or Nintendo Switch with plenty of headroom to spare.",
    "If you care about getting that edge when gaming, then, we can\u2019t find many criticisms of what the Fnatic React Plus deliver, though the 7.1 virtual sound that comes when connected to PCs via the USB sound card seems rather superfluous in a world where spatial audio solutions like Dolby Atmos and Windows Sonic exist. Still, the effect does create a far wider soundstage which some players may enjoy, and it is plug and play so you don't need to download any additional software or specific drivers.",
    "Another strength of the Fnatic React Plus is its microphone. Not only is it detachable, which has become a feature we really like to see on gaming headsets, but the cardioid design and pop filter ensured we were always heard loud and clear when calling out to our fellow Spartans in Halo 5: Guardians, or instructing our crew members when sailing through stormy weather in Sea of Thieves.",
    "The headset doesn\u2019t include mic monitoring, though. If you prefer to hear yourself back when you speak to avoid shouting, the Fnatic React Plus might have you raising your voice louder than you\u2019d like, particularly as the earcups do such a good job at isolating noise. You can switch to the headset\u2019s velour earpads, however, which provide less passive noise isolation."
