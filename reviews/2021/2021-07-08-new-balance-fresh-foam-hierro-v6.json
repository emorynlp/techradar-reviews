    "If you\u2019re looking for a running shoe that you can use for just about everything \u2013 trail running, road running, hiking, as well as casual use around town and for work \u2013 the great looking New Balance Fresh Foam Hierro v6 could be for you.",
    "For those long weekend runs, thanks to the 28mm of cushioning on the heel and 20mm on the forefoot, it offers a very comfortable, soft and forgiving ride, yet it's still just about agile enough for those regular shorter park training sessions too.",
    "A Vibram Megagrip outsole means it also has fantastic grip so you can throw it on and be sure-footed in all weather. You\u2019ll also be well set on trails too, although its lugs are on the smaller side, so perhaps consider another option if you run on super muddy, or technical and steep trails.",
    "Thanks to a breathable synthetic mesh upper, the New Balance Fresh Foam Hierro v6 also has good ventilation for all day use and your foot sits nice and secure. Granted, at 340g it's certainly not lightweight, but with its comfort, grip and solid build quality, you\u2019ll soon forget about the weight and clock up hundreds of niggle-free miles.",
    "This newly updated model was released on April 15 2021, and is priced at $135 / \u00a3125 (about AU$180).",
    "Intended for trail running use, this rugged-looking shoe features a fuller specification to ensure it withstands off road rigors. The downside of this is its weight \u2013 at 340g, it's on the heavier side, but given the comfort and protection it offers, that heft is fully justified.",
    "New Balance\u2019s Fresh Foam midsole underfoot brings really nice comfort that\u2019ll be welcome to all runners. A Vibram MegaGrip outsole offers one of the best grips going, plus it\u2019s really durable to help bring a long life to the shoe.",
    "The upper is straightforward \u2013 a synthetic mesh with some perforations in the toe box area for cooling, and some extra protection around the heel and toe.",
    "New Balance has taken strides to be eco-friendly, with recycled materials used for the collar and tongue, including cork on the tongue tag. It's also partnered with 1% for the Planet, meaning 1% of net sales of this shoe will be donated to organizations that are working on climate change and protecting public lands.",
    "Oh, and it looks great too.",
    "Straight out of the box, the New Balance Fresh Foam Hierro v6 is a joy to use. The whole shoe - simple synthetic upper, comfortable midsole and grippy outsole - has been well throughout and executed to create a brilliant package.",
    "The upper is made from what could be described as a more conventional upper material. It\u2019s a synthetic mesh that's pretty breathable, which means you can wear it all day (for chores even, or at your desk) without getting uncomfortable hot and sweaty feet. It's on the softer side when running, thereby minimizing the chances of rubbing.",
    "There's some extra protective material overlaid around the toe area, and the heel has a sturdier patch stitched on to protect you from rocks if you\u2019re off road.",
    "A generously sized loop on the heel cup and a loosely gusseted tongue means the shoe is easy to take on and off. Once laced up, it sits securely in place, and there's an extra eyelet if you like to lock the laces in place.",
    "The Fresh Foam midsole does exactly what it claims to, bringing a really comfortable ride with a touch of responsiveness too. There are some diamond like notches places on the sides of the midsole which brings a nice aesthetic.",
    "This midsole makes the New Balance Fresh Foam Hierro v6 a great option for regular use and clocking up high miles, and would even work brilliantly for commuting to work too, laden with a backpack of gear.",
    "The Vibram MegaGrip outsole is great as well \u2013 no complaints here \u2013 and you\u2019ll be as sure footed as you can be in any shoe, even on wet ground. The lugs aren\u2019t hugely generous, so you could find a lack of traction in super muddy or loose gravel trails, but for more regular countryside tracks and off road paths, it's perfect.",
