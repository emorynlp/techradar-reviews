  "summary": "The Amazon Echo (2020) is a definite step up",
  "verdict": "The new Amazon Echo (2020) is a serious step up from its predecessors, even if it still doesn't have the best sound of any smart speaker. Add to that the built-in Zigbee smart home hub and a new AZ1 neural edge processor that will reduce the time it takes for Alexa to respond to commands, and you\u2019ve got the recipe for the best Echo design yet.",
  "pros": [
    "Futuristic look",
    "Improved, adaptive sound",
    "Alexa responds faster",
    "Zigbee hub integration"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Max volume level isn\u2019t loud enough",
    "Not as clear as the Echo Studio",
    "No Chromecast or Home Kit support",
    "Privacy is still a big concern"

    "Having stuck with essentially the same design for its iconic smart speaker since it first appeared 2014, aside from making it more compact and introducing more refined finishes, Amazon has taken the Echo (2020) in an entirely new direction \u2013 well, 360 directions, technically speaking.",
    "The new spherical Amazon Echo is a complete revamp of the company\u2019s flagship smart speaker, and the aesthetic overhaul, while impressive, is just the half of it: with improved audio, a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, and a new AZ1 neural edge processor that will reduce the time it takes for Alexa to respond to commands, it\u2019s a complete makeover.",
    "Of course, while the hardware is all-new, it\u2019s still the same ol\u2019 Alexa under the hood. Alexa will still be able to answer your basic questions or make calls within your country of residence, as well as control any number of smart devices you have around your home.",
    "So are there any negatives? Not many, really. The Echo\u2019s only real issues are that its max volume level is a bit soft, especially compared to larger smart speakers like the Apple HomePod (now discontinued) and Google Home Max, and that Amazon remains a rather insular company, limiting the technology that\u2019s compatible with its speakers. That means you won\u2019t be able to Cast audio to the Echo the way you can with the Google Nest Audio, and you\u2019ll have to use Bluetooth any time you want to connect to your phone.",
    "There\u2019s also privacy to consider: Amazon keeps a recording of every Alexa request you\u2019ve ever made, and there\u2019s always a lingering fear that Amazon could be using that data in ways that you wouldn't be comfortable with, although Amazon insists that your recordings are, and will remain, private.",
    "Having Alexa know when you open your garage or turn off your lights is still a huge source of concern for a lot of us, though, and Amazon hasn\u2019t done much to allay those concerns. It\u2019s not enough to stop millions of us from using Amazon\u2019s devices, but it\u2019s something we remain leery of all the same.",
    "But if you shrug off the privacy concerns \u2013 or at least give Amazon the benefit of the doubt \u2013 and invest in Alexa\u2019s broad smart home ecosystem, the Amazon Echo is easily one of the most affordable and responsive smart speakers we\u2019ve yet to see, and offers supremely good value.",
    "The Amazon Echo (2020) has been available to buy since October 22, 2020 for $99.99 / \u00a389.99 / AU$149 \u2013 the same price as the previous Echo was when it launched in 2019.",
    "In terms of the competition, the Amazon Echo is the same price as the Apple HomePod Mini and the Google Nest Audio, which were both launched around the same time. Well, whichever smart home ecosystem you\u2019re tied into, there\u2019s a wireless speaker in that price range for you.",
    "It\u2019s an obvious place to start, and we feel obligated to begin with the design of the latest Echo \u2013 it\u2019s a massive difference that contrasts with what we\u2019re used to seeing from Amazon, and it looks downright 'space age'. While Amazon sent us the Charcoal color sample to review, the Echo is also available in two other colors \u2013 Glacier White and Twilight Blue.",
    "The spherical chassis of the Echo is divided into two parts: there\u2019s a layer of hard mesh and a plastic back piece with rubber feet on the bottom so that it doesn\u2019t scratch your table. You\u2019ll also notice a plastic translucent ring along the bottom, which serves as the LED indicator light, telling you when Alexa is listening (blue), when the microphone is muted (red) or when the speaker has lost its internet connection (yellow).",
    "On the top of the sphere is where you\u2019ll find four control buttons \u2013 volume up, volume down, microphone off/on and a button that summons Alexa. All of these buttons can be replaced by voice commands, with the exception of microphone off, which always requires you to physically go over to the speaker and turn it off.",
    "Spin the Amazon Echo around and you\u2019ll find a power connector and a 3.5mm aux line in/out jack that can be used to either send the audio signal to an external speaker or connect the Echo to a separate source like your phone or tablet. To select which way you want it to work, head to the Alexa App > Devices > Select your Echo device > go to Settings (gear icon) > AUX Audio (where you can select Line-in or Line-out).",
    "Under the hood of the new Echo, you\u2019ll find a 3-inch bass driver that points slightly upward, and dual 0.8-inch tweeters that are angled to deliver a fairly wide cone of sound. That\u2019s slightly different from the 360-degree audio array that we got on the last-generation Amazon Echo and very different from the six-tweeter-equipped HomePod. That will drastically change how the new Amazon Echo sounds compared to the previous model, but we\u2019ll cover that in more detail later on in the review.",
    "While in the past it might take Alexa a second or two to process our requests, the latest Echo responds in half the time thanks to the new AZ1 neural processor that will work in tandem with a revised speech model to process commands.",
    "Not only is Alexa a bit faster to respond this time around, it\u2019s more capable of connecting to other smart devices, too, thanks to the included Zigbee hub. Connecting a smart home device is typically as simple as plugging the product in and asking Alexa to search for devices. Once it\u2019s found, you can change the name of it inside the Alexa app and you\u2019re done.",
    "Once you have a whole smart home\u2019s worth of devices at your disposal, it\u2019s time to invest in some routines to make your life easier. Routines can be created inside the app and can consist of, say, turning on the light any time you open your closet by using a door sensor and a smart light bulb, or have your thermostat turn on when you get home by telling Alexa that you\u2019re back. Creating routines is fairly simple, and they\u2019re a fun way to feel like you\u2019re living in Tony Stark\u2019s mansion\u2026 even if you don\u2019t have a basement full of Iron Man suits.",
    "To bolster what Alexa can do, you\u2019ll need to add separate Skills, which can be found in the Alexa app. While most of the added Skills really aren\u2019t that helpful, there are a few neat ones worth looking into like Headspace that will help you de-stress or Song Quiz that turns your speaker into a music quiz host. They\u2019re fun, ephemeral experiences if nothing else.",
    "In terms of actual entertainment Alexa supports most major music streaming services including Amazon Music (Standard and HD), Apple Music, Spotify, TIDAL, Deezer, Pandora, SiriusXM, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn, though you\u2019ll mostly want to stick with the default Amazon Music, as you\u2019ll then have around 30,000 songs at your fingertips, plus a smorgasbord of podcasts. If you have a Fire TV, Alexa can control that, too, but if that\u2019s a feature you\u2019re looking for specifically, you should pick up an Amazon Fire TV Cube instead.",
    "Although it\u2019s not exactly a Sonos system, you can use Alexa to create a multi-room music setup by grouping your Alexa speakers together. This is especially useful if you want to have the same song playing across every room in your home.",
    "Last but not least, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Alexa can watch over your home while you\u2019re away with a feature called Alexa Guard. Once it\u2019s set up, you can tell Alexa you\u2019re leaving and it will enter Guard Mode and will alert you if it hears the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, or glass breaking. We\u2019ve never needed to use it thanks to the smart cameras we have set up around the house, but it\u2019s nice for folks who don\u2019t quite have that level of home security setup yet.",
    "So how does the new Amazon Echo sound? Well, its spherical design might lead you to believe that it will offer 360-degree sound, but in actuality you\u2019re getting pretty focused, directional audio that\u2019s at its best when you\u2019re standing a few feet in front of it.",
    "In terms of tonal quality, you\u2019re getting a fair amount of bass and midrange, but not a ton of sub-bass so that it rattles the walls or too much treble that the sound quality is fatiguing. The result isn\u2019t the richest sound quality we\u2019ve heard on a speaker, but it is significantly better than the first-generation Echo speaker we\u2019ve had sitting on our shelf for a few years now.",
    "The problem with the sound quality is two-fold, though. The first issue is that, at a medium volume level, the music isn\u2019t as detailed as it could be due to its limited soundstage. Lyrics are audible, for example, but they don\u2019t sit outside the mix in a way that makes them crystal clear - it just sounds like a flat wall of sound. The second problem is that, if you turn it up, the mix doesn\u2019t improve much and the peak volume level is still lower than some party-focused Bluetooth speakers like the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom.",
    "Listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Californication you\u2019ll hear the slamming snares, John Frusciante\u2019s melodic guitar and Flea\u2019s driving bass \u2013 all of which sound great individually - but begins to fall apart slightly when singer Anthony Kiedis joins the mix 20 seconds in. Richer compilations of sound like this usually go the same way \u2013 beautiful in the beginning when there aren\u2019t many layers, and then worse when the music gets complicated.",
    "The upshot here is that you can actually tweak the EQ using Alexa voice controls. You can use Alexa to raise the bass, midrange or treble, which we tried in search of the perfect sound. While adjusting the EQ can help some, you should temper your expectations, there\u2019s only so much tweaking the EQ can do.",
    "All that being said, the sound you get from the speaker will be impressive to folks who haven\u2019t heard the likes of the Apple HomePod or Sonos One, both of which produce fuller audio, and to anyone who still owns the canister-shaped Amazon Echo as the improvements Amazon has made truly are steps in the right direction."
