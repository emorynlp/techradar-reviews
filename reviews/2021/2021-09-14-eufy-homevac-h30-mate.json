  "summary": "A compact but powerful handheld vacuum",
  "verdict": "The Eufy HomeVac H30 Mate is a compact handheld vacuum that\u2019s lightweight and easy to maneuver. It\u2019s powerful and collects fine dust and debris with ease, and also comes with a mini motorized tool as well as a 2-in-1 crevice tool and when you\u2019re done it stores neatly in the charging dock. It\u2019s a great little addition to your cleaning toolkit, although it\u2019s almost expensive as many stick vacuums.",

    "Eufy by Anker is a brand familiar in the smart home security market, but it\u2019s also growing in popularity in the floorcare market too, after launching its first models in 2016. Its latest model is a cordless handheld vacuum designed for pet hair.",
    "The HomeVac H30 Mate, which comes with the 2-in-1 crevice tool and a mini motorized brush is one of three different configurations of the cordless vacuum available. The HomeVac H30 Venture comes with the 2-in-1 crevice tool and a multi-surface tool, and is best suited to cleaning cars, while the HomeVac H30 Infinity builds on the H30 Mate with a wand and cleaning head so it can be used to vacuum carpet and hard floors as well.",
    "The HomeVac H30 Mate has a 0.06-gallon / 0.25-liter dust canister and offers two levels of suction power. The rechargeable battery offers up to 20 minutes of runtime, although this is on the lowest power setting. When not in use, the handheld vacuum can be stored in its charging dock so that it\u2019s always fully charged and ready when you need it to pick up unexpected spills.",
    "At $179.99/ \u00a3169.99, it's the same price as many stick vacuums that can be converted into a handheld cleaner, but its powerful suction impressed us. It\u2019s perfect for busy households where it\u2019ll come in handy for quick clean-ups but also for vacuuming stairs, cars, and awkward spots that you can\u2019t reach with a bigger vacuum.",
    "The Eufy HomeVac H30 Mate is priced at $179.99/ \u00a3169.99 and is available directly from Eufy. The brand does plan to launch the cordless vacuum in Australia, however it has yet to confirm the price and availability.",
    "As we\u2019ve already mentioned the Eufy HomeVac H30 is also available in two other configurations. The HomeVac H30 Venture, which comes with a 2-in-1 crevice tool and a multi-surface tool costs $159.99/ \u00a3149.9, while the HomeVac H30 Infinity, which builds on the H30 Mate with a wand and floor-cleaning head will set you back $199.99/ \u00a3189.99. The cleaning tools, filter, charger, and battery are all available to purchase separately when you need replacements.",
    "This handheld vacuum has a neat and compact design, measuring just 16.7 x 3.5 x 2.9 inches/ 42.5 x 9 x 7.3 cm. At 1.78lbs/ 808g the main body of the vacuum is also super lightweight.",
    "It\u2019s available in either black or white and the small subtle design means that when stored on the charging dock it\u2019ll easily go unnoticed in the corner of a room.",
    "There\u2019s barely any setup required and with just two suction modes: eco or max, it\u2019s very intuitive to use. The 0.06-gallon / 0.25-liter dust canister is in proportion to the compact size of the vacuum but is still more than big enough to vacuum a car and several spills before it\u2019ll need emptying.",
    "This model comes with a 2-in-1 crevice tool which has a small crevice nozzle and a dusting brush. It also comes with a mini motorized tool which is perfect for pet hair pick up and carpet.",
    "The slim and lightweight design makes the Eufy HomeVav H30 Mate ideal for car cleaning. Both tools are useful for car cleaning, but on test, we found the crevice tool could do with being a little longer to reach into the gap at the side of the seats.",
    "The mini motorized tool is perfect for cleaning carpeted stairs and picks up all debris as well as hair, and crucially it\u2019s much easier than lugging a full size vacuum up the stairs. Some hairs do get tangled in the rotating brush but there\u2019s a cleaning and cutting tool in the box that makes it easy to cut them away.",
    "The pick-up is great, it vacuumed up everything in its path \u2013 there was a small amount of very ground in bits stuck in the carpet of our car that it didn\u2019t collect but other than that we really couldn\u2019t fault it.",
    "At first, the dust canister is fiddly to remove and empty but you soon get used to it and it becomes second nature. After a couple of weeks of use, we noticed the filter had become quite clogged so it\u2019s worth checking it regularly and brushing out any dust with the cleaning tool, to make sure it continues to operate at maximum suction.",
    "One main drawback of the Eufy HomeVav H30 Mate is that it\u2019s quite loud, our decibel meter registered 76dB on eco mode and 80dB when used on max mode, which is a level similar o a truck traveling down the road at 40mph and is one of the louder vacuums we\u2019ve tested.",
    "Eufy claims the battery will last up to 20 minutes, but this is on the lowest power setting, while using the most powerful setting reduces this to 10 minutes. In our tests, the battery lasted nine minutes when using the mini motorized tool, while when we had the the 2-in-1 crevice tool attached, the battery lasted the full ten minutes with",
    "The battery takes up to three and a half hours for a full charge, but if it\u2019s stored in the charging dock it\u2019ll always be ready to go when you need it. The battery is swappable, which means you won\u2019t have to stop vacuuming if the battery runs out, providing you purchase an additional battery directly from Eufy. The charging dock is freestanding so can sit on the floor or on a counter, or alternatively it can be screwed to the wall.",
