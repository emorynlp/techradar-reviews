  "summary": "A skilled UK host famous for its speed",
  "verdict": "Easyspace is a battle-hardened veteran of web hosting from the UK that offers a wide selection of hosting solutions and hosting-related services intended for casual bloggers and business owners alike. Their only significant handicap is the non-existence of a free trial or any refund policy.",
  "pros": [
    "Beginner-friendly approach",
    "Customizable hosting solutions",
    "Free domain name for the first year",
    "Ten self-run data centers through the UK",
    "100% uptime guarantee and fast load times"

    "Operating since 1997, Easyspace has been part of the domain registration and web hosting industry in the UK from the get-go. In 2004, it was purchased by iomart, a Scottish information technology and cloud computing company that was the first to offer consumer broadband connections in the UK. Easyspace has since greatly benefited from iomart\u2019s investment into the network and infrastructure with ten self-run data centers that stretch across eight locations throughout England, Scotland, and Wales.",
    "Easyspace takes satisfaction in the simplicity of its mission, and that\u2019s to supply its customers with the \u201cbest service, uptime, and reliability.\u201d Headquartered in Glasgow (the UK), Easyspace offers ten data centers in locations across the UK including London, Manchester, Nottingham, Gosport, St. Asaph, Leicester, Maidenhead, and (naturally) Glasgow. These data centers are monitored 24/7 and managed by Easyspace\u2019s own technical team, which the company considers as one of its greatest assets.",
    "If you want to find more about Easyspace\u2019s network and infrastructure, its official site provides plenty of information on the subject. However, if you want to know a bit more about the company itself, you\u2019ll have to get off the beaten track since the official site is somewhat secretive.",
    "To be fair, it still goes into the details about how the site itself looked over the years, from \u201cbasic with bright colors\u201d to \u201ceye-catcher\u201d we have today. Today, the site looks overwhelmingly orange, modern, and very convenient to use. It will also lead you to Easyspace\u2019s official blog which features everything a blog should have, although it isn\u2019t too enthusiastically updated.",
    "Fans of social networking websites can follow Easyspace on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, where some accounts feel lively while others are almost dead to the world.",
    "With Easyspace you can decide between various hosting types including shared hosting (entry-level, standard, premium, and WordPress-oriented), cloud and VPS hosting (where you\u2019ll find highly flexible solutions), and dedicated server hosting (where you can opt between pre-built and custom servers). In addition to hosting, Easyspace offers Microsoft 365 packages, business email, SSL certificates, a website builder, web design solutions, and management services.",
    "With all shared hosting plans you can opt between Linux and Windows, even with the entry-level one, and for the same price. The most pocket-friendly plan Entry starts at \u00a32.99 ($4.05) and provides a single site, one free domain name for a year, countless subdomains, 1GB of storage space (that\u2019s hardly enough), unlimited bandwidth, but no SSL certificate. To get a free SSL certificate, you\u2019ll have to go with the \u201cPremium\u201d plan at least, and even then it will be yours for one year only.",
    "There are no free trials or refunds with Easyspace, so consider everything very carefully before giving them a chance.",
    "Easyspace isn\u2019t too flexible with the payment methods allowing its customers to pay with their credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express) and PayPal.",
    "Tap into \u201cWeb Hosting\u201d, select a hosting type, hit \u201cRead more\u201d and \u201cCompare\u201d options to get a clearer picture of features you\u2019re going to get with each plan, and (after some consideration) opt for one of them by clicking \u201cBuy Now\u201d. Afterward, you\u2019ll get an opportunity to further configure your plan. Although selecting a plan shouldn\u2019t be complicated, if you\u2019re not certain which one is best for you, don\u2019t hesitate to contact the pre-sales support staff.",
    "After picking out a plan, you\u2019ll be asked to select a billing period (three months, or one, two, three, four, or five years), an operating system (Linux or Windows), and whether to include email with the hosting package (it\u2019s free). After this, you\u2019ll be prompted to add a domain name, some of which are available at a bargain price.",
    "When it's all set and done, you\u2019ll have to create an account with Easyspace (or sign in if you already got one), and for that, you\u2019ll have to provide your full name, both email and physical address, telephone number, and a sturdy password. After adding payment information and completing a purchase, you should get a welcome call so prepare any questions you might have. However, if you\u2019re not from the UK, you might just get an email instead.",
    "Easyspace\u2019s custom control panel is simple-looking and easy to use with its familiar layout, colored tiles for every area, and handy sidebar menu. There are no one-click installs, which would have been bad news if you couldn\u2019t request the technical team to install WordPress (or any other useful app) on your behalf. If you went with a WordPress-oriented plan, then WordPress will be installed automatically for you. We should also note that users that purchased cloud-based packages can expect to get either cPanel or Plesk as their control panel.",
    "As for site building tools, Easyspace also provides a WebBuilder which comes with plenty of in-depth guides, both in textual and video format. It also comes at an extra cost.",
    "Even though Easyspace seldom mentions speed on its site, it seems it has nothing to worry about when it comes to speedy performance. According to our trusty tool of choice GTmetrix, Easyspace\u2019s official site took 2.2 seconds to fully load and a total of 70 requests at the same time. The site also mastered all other vital speed measuring metrics (largest contentful paint, total blocking time, and cumulative layout shift) but not enough to earn a top grade. Nevertheless, GTmetrix rated the site with a respectable B (89%), which was only one percent away from an A.",
    "As for uptime, Easyspace guarantees an impressive 100% of it. Although it seemed unlikely that they would fulfill this, after monitoring the site\u2019s uptime for two weeks via UptimeRobot we were proved otherwise. There was no downtime at all and no major oscillation in response time to boot, all of which is an unspoken promise of reliable performance.",
    "If you run into trouble with your website, or simply want to throw a question or two, your best bet is to get in touch with Easyspace\u2019s staff via live chat. It is supposed to be available round-the-clock, but our experience tells us that you\u2019ll be better off trying to reach them during office hours. Alternatively, you can give them a ring Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM, submit a support ticket, or send them an email.",
    "As for self-support options, Easyspace\u2019s support section offers a \u201cSystem Status\u201d page and a comprehensive knowledgebase well-stocked with step-by-step guides. These guides are separated into ten suitable sections (like email help, hosting help, server help, and such) which are further divided into more specific subjects. As far as we can see, most of the guides follow the rule \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d and seem pretty user-friendly.",
    "If you are looking for a UK-based host with a similar scope of options and features, but with a 30-day money-back guarantee, check out Heart Internet. This company also provides its users with an industry-standard cPanel with Linux-based packages (and Plesk for Windows), so if that\u2019s your thing, take them up on the offer.",
    "Both Certa Hosting and Easyspace are UK-based hosts quite similar in terms of hosting types, options, and available features. That being said, if you are looking to save some money, Certa Hosting\u2019s solutions come a bit cheaper and with more freebies, such as weekly backups, a 30-day money-back guarantee, and a website builder.",
    "Bluehost offers affordable hosting packages but with a wider variety of features (abundance of apps for one-click installation, an SSL certificate, and a money-back guarantee among other things). However, since all of Bluehost\u2019s data centers are US-based, while Easyspace\u2019s centers are based in the UK, this may be a critical point for some users.",
    "Much like Bluehost, HostGator is a user-friendly host from the USA with a bit of something for just about everyone\u2019s needs, from sharp-witted bloggers to business owners. If you don\u2019t mind hosting your site in the USA, with HostGator you\u2019ll get unlimited disk space, unmetered bandwidth, a free domain (with yearly plans), an SSL certificate, one-click installs, a website builder, and a generous 45-day money-back guarantee which will give you enough time to make up your mind.",
    "With a wide variety of reasonably priced hosting solutions that come with all the essential features you need for a successful start, there isn\u2019t much to dislike about Easyspace. A welcome setup call, 24/7 support, and in-depth guides are likely to attract less tech-savvy users, while superb speed performance and ten self-run data centers across the UK will easily charm everyone, especially the users from the Old Blighty.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a host from the UK and don\u2019t mind the lack of a free trial or refund policy, Easyspace might be one of the top choices for you. If that is not the case, hosts like HostGator and Bluehost will give you plenty of time before compelling you to part with your money permanently."
