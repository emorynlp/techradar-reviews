  "summary": "LG\u2019s entry-level Nano Cell TV pales in comparison to the rest of the line-up",
  "verdict": "The LG Nano 81 is a step up from the company\u2019s UHD TVs, but by far the worst Nano Cell TV in the lineup due its edge-lit LED panel and awful local dimming. It\u2019s missing many next-gen features like HDMI 2.1 ports and Dolby Vision, and it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz native refresh rate. While its picture performance leaves a lot to be desired, it does have an eye-catching design and uses WebOS, which is great, and comes with the Magic Remote, so there are a few redeeming factors.",
  "pros": [
    "Eye-catching design",
    "Decent upscaling",
    "Fine viewing angles",
    "WebOS is still great",
    "Comes with Magic Remote"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Edge-lit LED panel",
    "Awful local dimming",
    "No HDMI 2.1",
    "Limited to 60Hz",
    "No Dolby Vision or Atmos"

    "The LG Nano 81 is one of those TVs that, if you don\u2019t know what you're looking for, might actually appear pretty appealing on paper. It\u2019s part of LG\u2019s Nano Cell lineup and uses the same color-enhancing technology with a 4K resolution with HDR support. It\u2019s a big step up for folks coming from a 1080p TV and yet, for the money, leaves a lot to be desired.",
    "That\u2019s because, while other Nano Cell TVs in LG\u2019s lineup offer Dolby Vision, native 120Hz refresh rates and full array panels, the LG Nano 81 uses edge lighting with awful local dimming. It\u2019s missing VRR and HDMI 2.1 ports, and many other next-gen features you can find just one step up higher in LG\u2019s 2020 TV catalogue.",
    "The good news here, and it\u2019s not much, is that the LG Nano 81 benefits from the company\u2019s advancements in upscaling algorithms \u2013 even though it doesn\u2019t have the Alpha a9 or even the Alpha a7 Gen. 3 processor inside. That, combined with the better viewing angles of the IPS panel and its eye-catching design mean that this TV isn\u2019t completely meritless, but it does severely limit who this TV is works for.",
    "Long story, short? This is the worst \u2018premium\u2019 TV in LG\u2019s lineup. While it\u2019s a bit better than some of the company\u2019s regular 4K UHD TVs, it\u2019s probably a good idea for everyone to step up to the LG Nano 85 or LG Nano 90 for a bit more money instead.",
    "The LG Nano 81 is part of LG\u2019s 2020 TV catalogue and was released this year. It\u2019s available in three potential screen sizes \u2013 55 inches, 65 inches and 75 inches \u2013 that start at $649.99 / \u00a3699 (around AU$900) for the 55-inch 55NANO81 and shoot up to $1,499 for the 75-inch 75NANO80, exclusive to the US.",
    "The good news is that we\u2019ve already seen some decent discounts on the LG Nano 81 \u2013 the 55-inch version is down to just $499.99 before Black Friday at retailers like Best Buy and will likely remain there, and the 75-inch version is already discounted to under $1,000 at some retailers. That\u2019s great considering their starting prices and means that they could fall even lower for Black Friday.",
    "The bad news for the Nano 81 is that LG\u2019s better Nano Series TVs aren\u2019t much more expensive. The next step up, the LG Nano 85, starts at $699.99 for the 55-inch model, and offers HDMI 2.1 with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it a better partner for the Xbox Series X and PS5, while the LG Nano 90, is only $100 more at $799.99.",
    "While its design is what leads to the LG Nano 81 to some of its biggest performance flaws, it does actually look like a premium TV: its front face has a minimal amount of bezel, and the crescent-shaped stand makes it look very modern.",
    "Because it uses edge lighting, the back of the TV doesn\u2019t jut out very far which will make it a dream for wall-mounting, and it\u2019s not the heaviest screen in the world, either, if you only opt for the 55-inch screen.",
    "On the back of the TV, you\u2019ll find a decent selection of ports \u2013 there\u2019s four HDMI ports, one USB, a set of component inputs, optical audio and an ethernet port. Problematically, these HDMI ports are all version 2.0b, which is now the older standard. Having HDMI 2.1 ports would\u2019ve enabled a number of better features, but because the TV is limited to a 60Hz native refresh rate the biggest of those \u2013 4K@120Hz \u2013 was never even a possibility.",
    "The bright spot here, however, is that this TV does come with the LG Magic Remote that feels wonderful in the hand. The remote has dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but you can actually hold the Amazon Prime button to bring up Alexa. But, if you\u2019d rather use Google Assistant, all you have to do is hold down the microphone button on the remote to summon it.",
    "In the pantheon of smart TV platforms, LG\u2019s WebOS is easily one of the most respected. In terms of usability, responsiveness and app support, WebOS is fantastic.",
    "For starters, load time is nearly non-existent on a decent wireless connection. We were able to zip from Netflix to Amazon Prime Video in a matter of seconds, with both apps loading their respective content at near instantaneous speeds.",
    "Moreover, while LG\u2019s latest WebOS is missing a few fringe services, you\u2019ll find nearly every major player here with Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and more all supported. Recent additions to the lineup include Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, which is great for folks looking to get their fix of The Mandalorian or Ted Lasso.",
    "The last feature worth mentioning for WebOS is its support of screen mirroring, a feature that allows anyone on your Wi-Fi network to Cast content from the phone or tablet to the TV without pairing over Bluetooth. This feature is supremely helpful when you have company over and you want to show them a quick clip from YouTube, or when you\u2019re watching something on your phone that you think would look better on a 65-inch screen. Either way, its inclusion here is incredibly convenient.",
    "The LG Nano 81\u2019s picture performance is a bit of a mixed bag. Colorful content like full screen video games and cartoons look great, while cinematic films and TV shows look simply rough due to the limited brightness and awful local dimming.",
    "How bad of local dimming are we talking? Well, expect to see a halo around almost any bright image on a dark background as well as the backlights near the top and bottom of the screen. In an all-dark room, this is incredibly noticeable and will certainly detract from your next movie night. You can thankfully set the local dimming to a lower threshold inside the picture settings, but even that doesn\u2019t make things much better.",
    "So while darker films suffer from the bad local dimming, bright films never quite shimmer because of the TV\u2019s low peak brightness. It\u2019s not a huge problem for HD/SDR content like, say, your local news, but you\u2019ll notice it more when watching 4K/HDR content like The Mandalorian or any of Netflix\u2019s original shows or films.",
    "Speaking of HDR support, the LG Nano 81 is the only TV in the Nano Cell lineup to not support Dolby Vision and is limited to HDR10 and HLG. What that means is that you\u2019ll still be able to stream shows in HDR on Netflix and Vudu, but they won\u2019t have the more refined color grades or higher peak brightness you\u2019d find on the Dolby Vision version.",
    "The upside here to the TV\u2019s lower peak brightness is that SDR content looks great due to LG\u2019s steadily improving upscaling algorithm that works wonderfully here, despite not using the Alpha a7 or a9 III processor, and the TV does have decently-wide viewing angles, allowing you to sit up to 60 degrees off axis with only a slight loss in saturation.",
    "We also have to give the LG Nano 81 props for being a decent console companion - especially for the PS4 and Xbox One X. With a low input lag of around 10ms and fast response time, most games we played on it felt super smooth at 60 frames per second. It\u2019s not a good match for next-gen consoles that can push out 120 frames per second gameplay, but for the current crop of hardware, it\u2019s a solid pick.",
    "The LG Nano 81 is neither a complete disappointment nor likely to win any awards in the audio department \u2013 what you\u2019ll find here is decent sound that pushes the mids forward for audible dialogue and an overall balanced sound. It\u2019s by no means detail-rich, and music therefore really doesn\u2019t sound the best here, but it\u2019s workable for most content.",
    "I\u2019d say the biggest disappointment in terms of the way the TV handles audio is that there\u2019s no Dolby Atmos support. If you want spatial audio, you\u2019ll have to step up to Nano 85."
