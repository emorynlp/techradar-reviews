    "The Amazon Echo Dot (2020) is one of the newest products in the Amazon Echo range and the latest Echo Dot. The Amazon Echo Dot \u2013 in its various iterations over the past few years \u2013 is one of the best options for people who aren\u2019t sure about smart home tech but want to take the first step. With such an easy set-up and such a low price tag, it\u2019s a way to try connected tech without the commitment of too much time, money and energy.",
    "This small, sphere-shaped device provides a compact home for Alexa to live inside yours. It also packs in enough sound performance to fill most rooms \u2013 although audiophiles be warned, this isn\u2019t going to compete with your sound system. You can pick up the Dot for under $50 / \u00a350 / AU$80, which makes it easy to see why the Dot has so consistently been one of the most popular smart speakers on the market to date. We know many people that have two, three, and more in their homes because they\u2019re so useful.",
    "This newest Dot, the Amazon Echo Dot (2020), lives up to the legacy set down by all of the previous Echo Dot devices that came before it \u2013 it\u2019s small, decently loud and, thanks to Alexa, it\u2019s pretty smart, too.",
    "However, the unfortunate part of the new Echo Dot is that it seems to have many of the same foibles as its predecessors as well \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a Zigbee hub inside and, the line-out jack, while great for folks who have a big speaker system, doesn\u2019t cater to the crowd who want to use the Echo Dot as a speaker for their audio player. The sound is fine, but audio-lovers take note: it\u2019s not the best-sounding speaker in the world.",
    "Simply put, the new Amazon Echo Dot, while aesthetically different to the models that came before it, brings more of the same as last year's 3rd gen model to your home. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing considering how much we loved last year's model, and many that came before it. But the latest Echo Dot doesn't innovate enough to push it within range of a 4 or 4.5 star rating in our eyes \u2013 in case you were wondering.",
    "The new Amazon Echo Dot is available in three colors \u2013 Charcoal (dark gray), Glacier White (white), and Twilight Blue (grayish-blue).",
    "The standard Amazon Echo Dot price is $49.99 / \u00a349.99 / AU$79, while the Echo Dot with Clock costs $59.99 / \u00a359.99 / AU$99.",
    "Buying an Echo Dot for your child's room? There's now a special Dot just for them. Check out the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition. It costs slightly more than the standard Echo Dot at $59.99 (likely \u00a359.99 / AU$99 in the UK and Australia if it becomes available in those markets), but this super-cute smart speaker continues the ball-like design and makes it kid-friendly with panda and tiger-style grilles.",
    "There aren\u2019t many other cheap smart speakers available to buy right now, but the closest competitor we think it's worth mentioning here is the Google Nest Mini that\u2019s supposed to cost $49.99 / \u00a349 / AU$79, but is usually on sale for $35 / \u00a335.",
    "Amazon definitely took a different approach when it was coming up with this new Amazon Echo Dot: instead of a hockey puck shape like last year, the new Echo Dot is a palm-sized sphere.",
    "Like the larger Amazon Echo, the Amazon Echo Dot\u2019s spherical chassis is divided into two parts: a layer of hard mesh and a plastic back piece with rubber feet on the bottom so that it doesn\u2019t scratch your table. You\u2019ll also notice a plastic translucent ring along the bottom, which serves as the LED indicator light, telling you when Alexa is listening (blue), when the microphone is muted (red) or when the speaker has lost its internet connection (yellow).",
    "On the top of the space age-looking speaker are four control buttons \u2013 volume up, volume down, microphone off/on and a button that summons Alexa. You won\u2019t necessarily need to use them if you don\u2019t want to \u2013 as almost all of them can be replaced by voice commands \u2013 but they\u2019re nice additions.",
    "If you turn the speaker around you\u2019ll find a power connector and a 3.5mm aux jack that can be used as a line out port to send the audio signal to an external speaker. That\u2019s an especially handy feature considering the Echo Dot\u2019s less-than-sterling sound quality that we\u2019ll discuss in a minute, but it\u2019s also somewhat disappointing that the 3.5mm aux jack doesn\u2019t double as a line in port like it does on the full size Amazon Echo.",
    "Tear away the top layer of the Amazon Echo Dot and you\u2019ll find a single 1.6-inch full-range front-firing speaker. This tiny-but-powerful speaker is responsible for producing the entire frequency range of sound for the speaker and the results, well... aren\u2019t exactly inspiring.",
    "That said, there\u2019s also the included microphone array packed inside there as well and we don\u2019t have any complaints about the Echo Dot\u2019s ability to hear us over the dull roar of our music and process our commands perfectly.",
    "Getting the speaker setup is simple \u2013 especially if you have one or more Alexa devices already setup in your house. If that\u2019s you, all you need to do is head into the Amazon Alexa app and tap the plus icon in the Devices section \u2013 the app will do a quick scan for nearby devices and before you know it you\u2019ll be up and running with your new smart speaker.",
    "If you don\u2019t have the Alexa or an Echo Device already installed, you\u2019ll have to go through the process of downloading the app and signing into your Amazon account, but then it\u2019s more or less the same process as above.",
    "Once it\u2019s set up, you can ask Alexa to set timers, create calendar events, play music, tell you the weather, call other Echo speakers and mobile phones, and read the news, as well as a host of other actions thanks to Alexa Skills.",
    "Disappointingly, while the Amazon Echo Dot 2020 can control other smart home devices that you\u2019ve previously paired with another Amazon Echo device, it can\u2019t pair any devices on its own because it lacks a built-in Zigbee hub. You can ask Alexa to do everything from turning your smart lights on to locking your front door, but you\u2019ll still need another Amazon Echo to set up those devices.",
    "While the Echo Dot really isn't a great buy for flourishing smart home enthusiasts, the Kids Edition is great for parents who want a little more privacy for their little ones: Amazon has added a new feature alongside the Echo Dot in the form of Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids which allows Alexa to automatically change its responses to be kid-friendly when it recognizes a child's voice is speaking to it.",
    "While using it in this mode, Amazon says children can \"ask Alexa questions, set animal sound alarms, get help with homework, and call approved friends and family\" and you won't have to worry about them getting into something they shouldn't. There\u2019s also a new Alexa feature called Reading Sidekick that helps with your kids reading, and offers encouragement when they're struggling that's perfect for quarantine learning.",
    "None of these features make up for the lack of a Zigbee hub if you're looking to build out your smart home, but for families the Kids Edition is a nice option that should allay parent\u2019s fears of keeping a smart speaker around their kids.",
    "In terms of sound quality, the Amazon Echo Dot really hones in on the mid-range, presenting clear vocals in songs and emphasizing speech in podcasts. Conversely, however, the soundstage isn\u2019t particularly wide and instead is fairly shallow with little separation between instruments.",
    "Now, its spherical design might lead you to believe that it will offer 360-degree sound, but in actuality you\u2019re getting pretty focused, directional audio that\u2019s at its best when you\u2019re standing a few feet in front of it. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but it\u2019s worth noting.",
    "Songs we\u2019ve tested include pop hits like Hey Jude by The Beatles and Justin Bieber\u2019s Lonely, as well as some classic funk and rock as well. The trend seems to be the same throughout: great vocals in that midrange sweet spot but at the expense of the trebles and bass response that sound muted at almost any volume level. Like the larger Echo, you can tweak each of these areas individually by asking Alexa to raise the bass, midrange or treble, but it doesn\u2019t radically impact the sound of the speaker.",
    "In terms of overall volume level, the Amazon Echo Dot gets moderately loud if you max it out, however it doesn\u2019t seem to be able to hold that volume level for an extended period of time and eventually drops to a more sustainable level. If you're looking for a good party speaker, this isn't it.",
    "So what are you to make of the Echo Dot\u2019s performance? Well, as a desk speaker that sits in front of you and plays music for a half-hour at a time, it\u2019s perfectly fine \u2013 but as a home speaker that you\u2019ll use to play songs during parties? Well, the Dot doesn\u2019t really cut it."
