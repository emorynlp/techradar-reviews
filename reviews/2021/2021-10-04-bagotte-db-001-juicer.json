  "summary": "An affordable and compact centrifugal juicer that works",
  "verdict": "Not only is the Bagotte DB-001 juicer one of the cheapest centrifugal juicers available, it\u2019s also super compact, so is a great solution both for people on a budget as well as those with limited space. It\u2019s simple to use and extracts juice yields that are better than some other more expensive models we\u2019ve tested, but it can only be used for short bursts of juicing and comes with a small juice container so it\u2019s most suited to making a single glass of juice at a time.",

    "Bagotte may be a brand you\u2019re not familiar with, but the home appliances manufacturer is hoping to give more familiar names such as Philips and Ninja a run for its money with affordable kitchen gadgets.",
    "The Bagotte DB-001 is the brand\u2019s entry-level juicer, which is one of the most compact centrifugal juicers we\u2019ve ever tested, making it appealing if you don\u2019t have the space for a bigger bulkier model. In addition to juicers, it makes an air fryer and a range of floor care appliances including robot vacuums. It\u2019s not a brand that has a strong hold in the juicer market but it\u2019s worth considering if you\u2019re in the market for a juicer but have a relatively tight budget.",
    "It has a 600w motor and comes with two modes; one for soft fruit and vegetables, and a second designed to extract juice from leafy vegetables such as Kale. It comes with a 0.37-quart / 0.35-liter juice jug, which is one of the smallest we\u2019ve seen on a juicer, and a 1.27-quart / 1.2-liter pulp container.",
    "Unsurprisingly for the price, it doesn\u2019t have a premium appearance, but the small size means it doesn\u2019t stand out and it\u2019s simple to assemble and use. It surprised us with good juice yields and while it can\u2019t match up to the more expensive models, it did out-perform some of them especially when juicing carrots.",
    "At $39.97/ \u00a344.99, it offers a good opportunity for novice juicers to get started without spending a fortune on a more premium model. But the small juice container and restrictions on usage times mean you\u2019ll find it frustrating if you\u2019re looking to juice much more than a glass of juice at a time.",
    "The Bagotte DB-001 is priced at $39.97/ \u00a344.99 and is available through Amazon in the US and the UK.",
    "This is one of the most inexpensive centrifugal juicers we\u2019ve seen and while it doesn\u2019t lack any features, it\u2019s very small and is really only designed for juicing small quantities.",
    "As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the most striking design feature of this juicer is its size, it\u2019s one of the most compact juicers available, measuring 11 x 6.7 x 9.3 inch / 28 x 17 x 23.5cm (h x w x d) making it ideal for smaller kitchens. While the unfussy stainless-steel exterior isn\u2019t an eye-catching design, the compact size means it\u2019s subtle and it\u2019ll sit neatly on your countertop. It\u2019s lightweight too, weighing just 4.9lbs / 2.2kg, so if you\u2019re planning to store it in a cupboard or drawer when not in use, you won\u2019t struggle lifting it in and out.",
    "The 1.27-quart / 1.2 liter pulp container is a good size but the 0.37 quart/ 0.35 liter juice container is small and if you\u2019re making more than one glass of juice at a time, you\u2019ll need to empty it regularly, which can be frustrating. Fortunately, the spout can be tilted upwards to stop drips, which is handy when you\u2019re emptying the juice container.",
    "There\u2019s very little assembly required and the only extra included in the box is a cleaning brush. There are just two speed settings to choose from so it\u2019s simple to get up and running. But it\u2019s important to take note of a sticker on the juicer which states it shouldn\u2019t be operated for longer than one minute at a time, with a minute\u2019s rest in-between each use, and that after three minutes use it should be switched off for 15 minutes. So it\u2019s not designed for lengthy juicing sessions and is best used to produce a single glass of juice at a time.",
    "All the detachable parts are dishwasher safe so cleaning is easy, but the manual doesn\u2019t give you this info, so we had to find it online.",
    "This compact juicer is simple to use, and the wide feed chute means you don\u2019t need to cut fruits and vegetables into small pieces, although it isn\u2019t quite wide enough to fit a whole apple. However once cut up to fit, it juiced a whole apple in just 17 seconds, making it one of the quickest juicers we\u2019ve used.",
    "When juicing five large oranges, the juice container filled quickly, and we had to empty it halfway through juicing. We also noticed that despite having rubber feet, the juicer moved around on the counter. The orange juice was very frothy, but had a smooth texture, with just a small amount of very fine powdery pulp. The juice yield was 64% which is less than you\u2019d get with more expensive juicers but still not bad.",
    "With lots of whole un-juiced pieces left in the pulp container, this juicer didn\u2019t juice kale very effectively. The juice yield was just 16% so there\u2019s a lot of waste. The kale juice that it did make was fairly smooth with a slight powdery texture.",
    "It was particularly successful at juicing carrots, with a juice yield of 55% which is better than a lot of centrifugal and slow juicers we\u2019ve tested. There was only a small amount of froth on top of the juice, and it had a slightly gritty texture, but a good, sweet flavor.",
    "Lastly, we made a mixed juice containing apple, pear, celery, parsley, broccoli, and ginger. Again, we had to stop juicing to empty the juice container, which is frustrating. But it coped well with all of the ingredients except parsley. There were lots of un-juiced pieces of parsley in the pulp container at the end of juicing. Overall the juice was quite frothy with a slightly gritty texture and the juice yield was a respectable 68%.",
    "During juicing, our decibel meter registered a maximum of 84db, which is the equivalent to a diesel truck traveling at 40 mph, but still not the loudest juicer we\u2019ve ever tested. As the noise level is only experienced for a minute at a time, we think this is acceptable. It\u2019s simple to disassemble and clean and if you\u2019re cleaning it by hand the included brush is useful for getting the mesh strainer clean.",
