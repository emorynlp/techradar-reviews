  "verdict": "The Razer Blade 14 will be the go-to gaming laptop for anyone who wants a luxury gaming laptop. It\u2019s powerful enough to play any games out there, while being beautiful enough to show off wherever you go. The thin and light chassis is just a bonus. Though, you will have to pay for the pleasure of using it, and you won\u2019t get as much performance out of the components as you would elsewhere.",

    "With the Razer Blade, Razer basically made portable gaming laptops a thing, and now that we\u2019re starting to see ultraportable gaming laptops like the Asus TUF Dash F15, Razer is bringing the Razer Blade 14 to revolutionize the space again.",
    "This is a 14-inch gaming laptop, and while there are plenty of 13-inch gaming laptops like Razer\u2019s own Blade Stealth 13 series, the name of the game here is bringing some incredible performance to a laptop that\u2019s easy to carry around wherever you go.",
    "The Razer Blade 14 we looked at is packed with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. It\u2019s not the same performance you\u2019re going to get out of something like the Alienware m17 with the same specs, but it\u2019s also half the size \u2013 and you don\u2019t lose that much performance, either.",
    "Though, just like any other time you\u2019re getting both portability and high power in the same package, you\u2019re going to be dropping a lot of cash on it. The model we\u2019re looking at today costs a whopping $2,799 (\u00a32,799, AU$4,999). That\u2019s a lot to ask for, but it\u2019s actually cheaper than the Blade 15 with the same specs \u2013 though you\u2019re getting a slightly smaller and slower screen (165Hz vs 240Hz).",
    "But while there\u2019s surely some use in comparing the sticker tags to slightly bigger 15-inch laptops, this is a laptop that\u2019s just 0.66 inches thick and weighs 3.92 lb, and unlike a lot of thinner gaming laptops out there, there\u2019s nothing about this laptop that doesn\u2019t feel premium.",
    "Razer has been called the \u201cApple of gaming laptops,\u201d a label the company certainly hasn\u2019t shied away from, and it\u2019s no different in the Blade 14. This is one of the most solid and premium-feeling laptops we\u2019ve ever used. So while it is certainly very expensive, it feels like an expensive product, and if that\u2019s something you\u2019re after, you\u2019ll find a lot to love.",
    "The Razer Blade 14 is available starting in June 2021, starting at $1,799 (\u00a31,799, AU$3,099). Every configuration of the laptop will get you an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, but where the entry configuration differs is in the display and graphics processor.",
    "That starting $1,799 (\u00a31,799, AU$3,099) will net you an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 and a 144Hz 1080p display. You can go up to a 165Hz QHD display with an RTX 3070 for $2,199 (\u00a32,199, AU$3,999). Or you can get the model listed to the right for $2,799 (\u00a32,799, AU$4,999).",
    "Especially for a Razer laptop, the starting configuration really isn\u2019t that bad a deal, and the RTX 3060 is a perfect companion for that 144Hz display. And even at the high end, the RTX 3080 with this gorgeous QHD display for $2,799 is priced pretty competitively with other gaming laptops \u2013 especially when you consider the bonus to portability.",
    "Don\u2019t get us wrong, it\u2019s still a premium price that Razer is asking you to pay, but we\u2019ve seen the green-themed company ask for much more for much less in the past, and this laptop is genuinely a pretty good deal if you\u2019re in the market for something a bit more on the luxe side of things.",
    "The Razer Blade 14 basically looks like the Razer Blade 15, but, like, smaller. It has the same general profile, with its all-black aluminum chassis with the signature bright green razer logo on the back of the laptop. And yes, the logo lights up.",
    "Despite the slightly smaller chassis, there are still speakers on either side of the keyboard, looking a lot like a MacBook again. However, unlike the Blade 14, the power button isn\u2019t awkwardly placed in the middle of one of the speaker grilles, and instead, there\u2019s a dedicated power button on the top right corner of the keyboard.",
    "The keyboard is also pretty much identical to what you\u2019ll find on any other Razer Blade, though a couple of the keys, notably the \u2018~\u2019 and \u2018\\\u2019 keys have been trimmed down, and they\u2019re now very narrow. They\u2019re not keys we use very often, but if you for some reason need to use them often, it\u2019s something to be aware of.",
    "The chassis itself is just 0.66 inches thick, and the laptop weighs just 3.92lb. That\u2019s certainly not the lightest laptop we\u2019ve used, but with the beautifully made aluminum unibody chassis, it\u2019s still quite an accomplishment, and definitely something you\u2019ll be able to easily carry around in your backpack.",
    "Some of the novelty in the lightweight build is lost, however, when you look at the power brick. Because of the power that the Razer Blade 14 wields, you can\u2019t really get away with USB-C charging like on a lot of ultraportable laptops. That means there\u2019s a charging brick, and while it\u2019s definitely on the lighter side, it is still added bulk you\u2019ll have to deal with. You can still get power from USB-C, but it won\u2019t be enough to keep up with the power draw when gaming.",
    "And while this is an incredibly thin gaming laptop, there\u2019s still a wealth of ports available. Both the left and the right sides of the laptop have a USB 3.2 Gen 2 C port, as well as a USB-A port. The right side of the laptop also has a HDMI port, and the Kensington lock. Then, on the left you have the dedicated charging port and a combo 3.5mm audio jack. In a laptop that\u2019s this portable, having this many ports available is definitely a win, and most people shouldn\u2019t have to drag around dongles.",
    "You can also upgrade the Razer Blade 14 yourself \u2013 to a point. The SSD and Wi-Fi card are both easily accessible, but the RAM is not. Probably a casualty of the laptop shrinking so much in size, but it\u2019s still a shame. To open the case, there are just 10 Torx screws, and then you just need to pry off the bottom of the panel. We had to use a tool to pry it off, but your mileage may vary.",
    "All of this combines to make for a gaming laptop that\u2019s not just portable but extremely comfortable to use. The keyboard, while some parts have been shrunken down, is very comfortable with just the right amount of key travel and spacing. Some gamers might want to go with a mechanical keyboard instead, but, again there\u2019s plenty of ports.",
    "Razer has also knocked the trackpad out of the park, which is no big surprise. Tracking is accurate, and it feels good to the touch. And clicking is satisfying and tactile without feeling wobbly like some other Windows laptops do. Again, you\u2019re probably going to be using a dedicated gaming mouse rather than the trackpad when gaming, but when you\u2019re just getting work done on the side, it\u2019s nice to have a trackpad that doesn\u2019t suck.",
    "The highlight here is definitely the display though. Razer has been getting better and better at laptop displays, and the Blade 14 is one of the most beautiful gaming laptop displays on the market right now. While a lot of faster refresh rate displays will usually cut corners when it comes to color accuracy or brightness, you\u2019re getting a full 111% coverage of the sRGB spectrum, as well as an average brightness of 332 nits.",
    "It\u2019s not a MacBook Pro display, but when it comes to gaming laptops, it\u2019s probably the closest you\u2019re going to get while still getting a speedy 165Hz refresh rate.",
    "Because the Razer Blade 14 is so thin, there are some compromises that just had to be made. While the model tested here does have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, it\u2019s far from the fastest version of that GPU in a laptop today.",
    "This is because the RTX 3080 in this laptop is configured to max out around 100W of power, rather than the full 165W that, say, the Alienware m17 R4 can do. In practice, this means that the Razer Blade 14 is around 30% slower in games than the Alienware m17, with Razer\u2019s ultraportable being a full 34% slower in Metro Exodus at 1080p and Ultra settings.",
    "Of course, the Razer Blade 14 is much smaller than the Alienware m17, so it really shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise that you\u2019re not going to get the full amount of horsepower out of it. But you should be aware of it, because while both of these laptops do have an RTX 3080, they are definitely not the same, and have a completely different power profile.",
    "Luckily, the Razer Blade 14 also has the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, and it\u2019s just as powerful as ever. With this CPU, the Blade 14 absolutely wipes the floor with the Alienware m17, scoring 11,690 points in Cinebench R23 to the Alienware\u2019s 8,992 points. This makes the Razer Blade 14 a great fit for any creative professional on the road, as it will easily be able to keep up with whatever Adobe project you throw at it \u2013 we only wish you could add more RAM to the laptop.",
    "Don\u2019t take any of this to mean that the Razer Blade 14 isn\u2019t powerful enough. While you won\u2019t get the full power of the RTX 3080 with this laptop, it\u2019s still incredibly powerful for a device that\u2019s this small. We\u2019re still able to play all the games we usually play on it, and with higher than 60 fps. You just need to realize that you\u2019re giving up a bit of performance for the lightweight design.",
    "The Razer Blade 14\u2019s camera is decent enough, but it isn\u2019t going to blow stream viewers away or anything. It\u2019s 720p and supports Windows Hello, but it\u2019s a bit blurry. We also find that the camera lags behind the mic in video calls.",
    "The mic itself is great. Our voice comes through nice and clear, and you can hop on a call with someone without their voice getting picked up with your mic. It\u2019s still no substitute for having a PC gaming headset on hand, but for those quick Zoom calls, you can\u2019t go wrong.",
    "While there are a lot of gaming laptops that are starting to break the 8 hours of battery life barrier, the Razer Blade 14 just isn\u2019t one of them. In the PCMark10 battery test, which simulates a bunch of real-life workloads like word processing and video calls, the Razer Blade 14 lasted 7 hours and 31 minutes. It lasts even less in our video playback test, where it dies after 6 hours and 31 minutes.",
    "It\u2019s certainly not bad for a gaming laptop, it wasn\u2019t so long ago that you could only expect about 3 hours if you were lucky. But considering how portable the Razer Blade 14 is, you\u2019re going to want to use it away from the charger. You\u2019ll still be able to get some work done, but you\u2019re still going to have to pack a charger with you."
