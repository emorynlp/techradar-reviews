  "summary": "The SteelSeries Arctis 7X is a great-sounding, great value and versatile headset",
  "verdict": "Though its color scheme is clearly pointed at Xbox Series X gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis 7X\u2019s connectivity options make it as versatile as it is comfortable and rich-sounding for gamers across the console divide.",
  "pros": [
    "Comfortable and easy to adjust",
    "Works with practically all devices",
    "Great battery and sound"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No Bluetooth",
    "Could be better with music"

    "Its Xbox stylings may make you believe the SteelSeries Arctis 7X is only good for Microsoft\u2019s line of consoles \u2013 but whether you\u2019ve got an Xbox Series X / S, PS5, Nintendo Switch, a gaming PC or a mobile phone with USB-C, the Arctis 7X is a great headset.",
    "Versatile support for multiple devices, solid sound and reliable connectivity add up to a comfortable and easy-to-recommend gaming headset \u2013 even if its musical capabilities aren\u2019t quite as sharp.",
    "The SteelSeries Arctis 7X is available now, and is priced at $149 / \u00a3174.99, making it a fair chunk of change more expensive for those in the UK than across the pond stateside. Its feature set make it worth the expense though, especially in the US where its cheaper price tag makes it incredibly competitive.",
    "Note that there\u2019s a PlayStation-focused SteelSeries Arctis 7P model available too, but it\u2019s actually a little less fully-featured than the 7X, as it doesn\u2019t support any Xbox models, whereas the 7X remains perfectly compatible with PlayStation too. So long as color matching devices aren\u2019t a big deal for you, make sure to pick up the 7X instead.",
    "If you\u2019re familiar with earlier SteelSeries Arctis headsets, particularly the Arctis 7, you\u2019ll feel right at home with the Arctis 7. The design is very similar, with a black plastic build connecting to a flexible steel band.",
    "The fit clamps comfortably to your head, with a stretchy velcro fabric strap used to loosen or tighten the fit. A smattering of neon green lines are the only flourishes on the headset, making for a relatively smart-looking headset, and a lightweight one too at about 340g.",
    "The SteelSeries Arctis 7X has smartly placed onboard controls. The right cup houses the power button and chat mix dial, balancing friends and party audio with game audio.",
    "The left cup houses a general volume dial, a mic mute button, micro USB, a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct connection to a controller or phone, and a proprietary port to accompany an included cable which SteelSeries believes will give you a better 3.5mm connection.",
    "A flexible and retractable mic arm is also housed in the left cup, complete with LED mute indicator. It\u2019s a nice, tidy set up, and keeping the two dials on separate cups helps to avoid confusion mid-game. The cups are well padded too, with a breathable fabric covering keeping your ears cool during long play sessions.",
    "Connectivity is simple, but does not make use of Bluetooth. Instead, a USB-C dongle is used to connect to your device of choice, with SteelSeries providing a USB-A adaptor for devices not equipped with a USB-C port.",
    "A small switch on the dongle lets it swap between Xbox and all other platforms. While it does necessitate you take the dongle with you between devices, and that a port is used on whichever machine you pair the headset with, it does provide a reliable, flexible connection, and an easy pairing process.",
    "Battery life is impressive, too \u2013 SteelSeries claims 24 hours of battery life per full charge of the headset, and that seems roughly in keeping with our testing. Expect to eke a few hours less per charge if you\u2019re playing at full volume, but regardless, you shouldn\u2019t be caught short too often when it comes to battery.",
    "Audio and microphone performance are exemplary when it comes to gaming. With a great max volume level, it balances booming explosions and sharp dialogue with accurate and pleasing results, giving a cinematic mix to action games and sports titles alike.",
    "It handles directional audio well too \u2013 playing a preview of the new Aliens: Fireteam Elite game on Xbox saw the SteelSeries Arctis 7X keenly highlight any creeping xenomorphs ready to pounce from behind our marine. The mic, comfortably and adjustably placed, was excellent too, clearly delivering chat to pals without too much sibilance or pop.",
    "Where the SteelSeries Arctis 7X is a bit weaker is with music. Complex layering on tracks can see the 7X struggle a bit, without the width and detail needed to pull out all facets of a song. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker at all if you\u2019re after just a gaming headset, and the tunes sound fine. But don\u2019t expect the 7X to compete with the best wireless headphones for music."
