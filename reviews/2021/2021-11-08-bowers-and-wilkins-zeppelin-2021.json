  "summary": "Bowers & Wilkins takes to the air once more",
  "verdict": "Ignore its claim to \u2018true\u2019 stereo sound and the latest Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin is the best yet, offering a balanced, detailed sound, an array of wireless streaming options, and a decent control app.",
  "pros": [
    "Balanced, detailed, full-range sound",
    "Very acceptable control app",
    "All sorts of wireless streaming options"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not quite the stereo separation we were led to expect",
    "Would suit an HDMI input nicely"

    "Not before time, Bowers & Wilkins has revived its iconic Zeppelin wireless speaker. Well, in terms of looks, anyway \u2013 the internal hardware is all new and, it turns out, more than fit for purpose.",
    "The Zeppelin comes with aptX Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect built in \u2013 plus you get access to pretty much all the rest of the planet\u2019s stock of music via its clean, tidy and responsive Music control app. There\u2019s support for the Amazon Alexa voice-assistant, too. And the unit is just as good-looking, just as well-made, and just as big as it ever was.",
    "Best of all, it sounds better than ever. While it isn\u2019t a substitute for an actual pair of stereo speakers, the Zeppelin serves up a wide, well-defined and endlessly engaging sound, no matter the genre of music. And although $799 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,199 is plenty to pay for a wireless speaker, in this case it seems absolutely justified.",
    "The Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin is on sale now, and in its home market of the UK it\u2019s priced at \u00a3699. In the US it costs $799, and customers in Australia should prepare to part with AU$1,199.",
    "This is a significant sum to spend on a single-enclosure wireless speaker \u2013 but it\u2019s by no means unheard of. We have a lot of time for Naim\u2019s good-looking, great-sounding Mu-so Qb 2nd Gen ($899 / \u00a3749 / about AU$1,200), and our affection for Sonos\u2019 bland-looking, great-sounding Play:5 ($549 / \u00a3499 / AU$799) hasn\u2019t faded with time, either. Suffice to say, the Zeppelin has its work cut out.",
    "When the original Zeppelin launched 15 years ago as an iPod speaker dock it was, not surprisingly, Zeppelin-shaped. Each new version that followed added functionality (or deleted it, in the case of the iPod dock itself), but retained what rapidly became an iconic silhouette. So what does the Zeppelin 2021 look like? You\u2019ve guessed it...",
    "At 210 x 650 x 194mm (h x w x d) and 6.5kg, it\u2019s a fairly big and imposing device; but thanks to its central metal pedestal, it doesn\u2019t actually need all that wide a space to stand on. There\u2019s a dimmable light that shines from the bottom of the enclosure onto that stand, for no reason that one can really ascertain. It\u2019s available in Midnight Grey (or black), or Pearl Grey (more readily identifiable as grey) finishes. Build quality is as impressive as you\u2019d expect from the brand at the price.",
    "This is the most wireless Zeppelin so far \u2013 it\u2019s even more wireless than 2015\u2019s Zeppelin Wireless \u2013 so there isn\u2019t much to talk about where the cabinet is concerned. Physical inputs consist of a socket for mains power and a USB-C input for service only, and there are a few controls on the rear of the enclosure, too.",
    "Wireless possibilities are much more numerous, though. AptX Adaptive Bluetooth 5, Apple AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect are available for painless wireless connectivity, and the Bowers & Wilkins Music app adds further functionality. It\u2019s possible to integrate any or all of your favourite music streaming services into the app, including Amazon Music, Deezer, Qobuz and Tidal, as well as the likes of SoundCloud, Last.fm and TuneIn.",
    "Controlling the Zeppelin via its app is straightforward and reasonably intuitive. There\u2019s a degree of EQ adjustment available here, too (not much, mind \u2013 because you couldn\u2019t possibly know better than Bowers & Wilkins where this sort of thing is concerned). Or, it\u2019s equally straightforward to ask Alexa to deal with your requests.",
    "No matter the way you go about controlling the Zeppelin, nor the methodology you use to get digital audio files on board, music is delivered by a five-strong speaker driver array designed to deliver true stereo sound from the single box. There\u2019s a 25mm double-dome tweeter (as seen in Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 award-winning 600-series loudspeakers) at either end of the cabinet, while dead-centre sits a 150mm subwoofer for low-end presence.",
    "Either side of that you\u2019ll find a 90mm mid-range driver, using the same Fixed Suspension Transducer technology deployed by the company\u2019s flagship \u2013 and super-expensive \u2013 800-series speakers. This lineup is driven by a total of 240 watts of Class-D power.",
    "First, however, the audio has to be dealt with by the Zeppelin\u2019s DAC. A 24bit / 192kHz hi-res device, it\u2019s currently \u2013 and inexplicably \u2013 limited to a \u2018not quite so hi-res\u2019 24bit / 96kHz maximum file size; however, that\u2019s likely to change for the better sooner rather than later. At the moment, the only hi-res tier accessible through the Music app is that of Qobuz, but Apple AirPlay 2 and Bluetooth 5.0 are both capable of dealing with hi-res audio from your preferred streaming service while Bowers & Wilkins sorts things out.",
    "Also on the company\u2019s to-do list is getting the Zeppelin some multi-room connectivity. Right now it\u2019s a stand-alone device, but soon it will be possible to create a multi-room system using multiple Zeppelins, as well as Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 Formation range of wireless speakers. However, what you won\u2019t be able to do is configure a couple of Zeppelins as a stereo pair \u2013 because this is a stereo speaker, remember?",
    "First thing's first \u2013 and we\u2019re starting here because there\u2019s really very little to criticize about the way this speaker performs \u2013 the Zeppelin isn\u2019t as stereo as it believes itself to be.",
    "There\u2019s no denying the separation of its sound, nor the definition of its soundstage, and when wide stereo effects or pans are deployed in a recording, the Bowers & Wilkins gives a fine indication of \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019. But as far as the sort of focus and staging that\u2019s available from a pair of speakers, the Zeppelin doesn\u2019t do much more than allude to it.",
    "But with that out of the way, the news is basically all good. The Zeppelin is a well-judged listen when it comes to tonal balance. The journey from the (deep, textured and information-heavy) bottom of the frequency range to the (bright, attacking and just as detailed) top-end is smooth and even, with no area understated or overplayed.",
    "It\u2019s particularly adept through the mid-range, especially where vocals are concerned. Streaming a hi-res file of On by Kelly Lee Owens via Qobuz lets the Bowers & Wilkins show off its fearsome powers of communication.",
    "No transient detail is too fine to elude it, and no subtlety of technique is too fleeting to escape attention. Vocalists exist in a comfortable area of autonomy in the Zeppelin's presentation, even as they\u2019re integrated seamlessly into the recording as a whole.",
    "The same recording allows the Zeppelin to show off its dynamic prowess, both in giving the spaces in the song their due, and in putting authentic distance between the quietest and loudest moments. And it\u2019s equally attentive to the smaller dynamic variances in the harmonics of individual instruments. By the prevailing standards of wireless speakers (or, at least, those wireless speakers that don\u2019t cost well into four figures), it\u2019s an insightful and revealing device.",
    "And it manages to adopt this attitude without sacrificing any of its powers of engagement, and without sounding at all detached or dispassionate. Despite having more individual speaker drivers than many wireless speakers, it has real unity and coherence of presentation.",
    "So even though it lacks outright stereo separation, it\u2019s still an open and well-defined listen. The idea that it\u2019s a \u2018wide\u2019 listen, given that it\u2019s such a relatively wide device, may seem redundant; but the fact is that this is one of the most open-sounding, single-enclosure wireless speakers around."
