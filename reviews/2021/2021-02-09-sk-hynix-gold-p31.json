  "summary": "A speedster for the 3.0 generation",
  "verdict": "The SK Hynix Gold P31 goes above and beyond in performance compared to many of its competitors, but new PCIe 4.0 SSDs are starting to enter the same market space with much better speeds and fair prices.",

    "Fast for PCIe 3.0",

    "The SK Hynix Gold P31 SSD has something special going for it: SK Hynix makes the very NAND flash that goes into the best SSDs, so it gets the latest tech \u2013 128-layer 4D TLC NAND flash memory. SK Hynix also pairs that with its own controller and DRAM, so it should see its components working together effectively, and that certainly seems to be what the benchmarks indicate.",
    "The SK Hynix Gold P31 may not be the fastest SSD, as it\u2019s still using the PCIe 3.0 interface while the market is seeing more and more PCIe 4.0 options, but it\u2019s one of the fastest PCIe 3.0 SSDs we\u2019ve tested, and an impressive value.",
    "The SK Hynix Gold P31 comes in at $135 (about \u00a3100, AU$175) for a 1TB model, however this is down from its original $224 (about \u00a3165, AU$295) price. That puts it in tight competition with old standbys like the $160 Samsung 970 Evo Plus and $140 WD Black SN750 as well as the $115 Corsair MP400. However, only the Corsair MP400 offers a more compelling price-per-gigabyte value, and none of the drives match the SK Hynix Gold P31 for speed.",
    "The P31 steps well above the competition in terms of raw speed using the PCIe 3.0 x4 interface. We see it hit 3,602MB/s sequential read speeds that edge out former speed champions like the Samsung 970 Evo, 970 Pro, and WD Black SN750. The sequential write speeds give it an even stronger lead at 3,432MB/s, which outpaces all three of those competitors by over 400MB/s. Only the Corsair MP400 comes within striking distance of the P31\u2019s speeds in our recent testing, but it still falls short by over 100MB/s in either test.",
    "The P31 furthers its lead when it comes to random performance, which will likely be more important for your everyday needs. With random read speeds of 2,442MB/s and random write speeds of 2657MB/s, it\u2019s a closer match to PCIe 4.0 SSDs than it is to the 300-400MB/s speeds of the Samsung 970 and WD Black SN750 families of products. In fact, it outpaced the PCIe 4.0 Silicon Power US70 in random write speed, though it can\u2019t compete with sequential read/write performance.",
    "As long as the current pricing of the SK Hynix Gold P31 holds, it\u2019s an easy product to recommend, especially for laptop upgrades, where it\u2019s single-sided PCB design should make it an easier fit and it\u2019s green PCB won\u2019t be an eyesore. The Corsair MP400 offers strong competition, and is a better bet for capacity since the P31 tops out at 1TB. But, the P31 has more speed and a much higher endurance at 750TBW (compared to the MP400\u2019s 400TBW) while only costing slightly more."
