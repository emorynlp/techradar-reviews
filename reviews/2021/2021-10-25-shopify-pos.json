    "It's a near-faultless POS system if you\u2019re opening up a brick & mortar store, pop-up shop or a market stall and want to be able to take payments without investing heavily in infrastructure.",
    "Alternative retail competitor POS platforms include AirPOS, Lightspeed POS, EposNow and Square POS.",
    "Shopify offers a selection of pricing options designed to make it affordable for every business, regardless of size. So if you plan to scale up in the near future, Shopify POS is a safe choice. Their pricing plans include:",
    "Their pricing is very clearly stated, and comes with the added benefit of a free 14 day trial, which doesn't require a credit card for sign up. There\u2019s no set up fee for any of the plans that Shopify offers either.",
    "As part of your POS search, it's useful to keep in mind the perks you get from partnering with a globally recognised brand like Shopify.",
    "\u2714 Get competitive shipping rates up to 77% - 88% off from DHL Express, UPS, or USPS when you work with them. Not a bad retail saving to have!",
