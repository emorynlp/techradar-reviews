  "summary": "Streamlined system repair and optimization",
  "verdict": "Although it\u2019s far from the most popular system repair and optimization tool available, Restoro\u2019s streamlined scan, excellent features, and competitive prices make it stand out as an excellent choice.",
  "pros": [
    "Fast, efficient scans",
    "Very competitive prices"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Very average customer service",
    "Scan configuration is a little limited"

    "Over time, the performance of your computer can decrease due to any of a number of problems. By selecting one of the best system utilities and repair software though, you will be able to fix these problems, restoring your device to a much better condition and improving long-term performance.",
    "In our Restoro review, we take a look at a powerful system repair program that\u2019s designed for various uses. We provide information about every aspect of this program to help you decide whether it\u2019s right for your situation.",
    "There is only one version of Restoro, although there are three different licensing options available. Payments are accepted via both credit/debit card and PayPal, and there\u2019s an excellent free trial available that enables you to test the platform.",
    "A one-time license that enables you to scan one device and perform one repair will set you back $27.95. Unlock unlimited use for a year, along with full customer service, for just $41.95, or upgrade this to three annual unlimited-use licenses for just $58.95.",
    "One thing we didn\u2019t like was the way Restoro markets its free version. At first glance, you would be forgiven for thinking that it\u2019s just a simple version of the premium edition.",
    "However, you will soon find out something very different if you download it, run a scan, and attempt to repair your device. You will be able to run a full system scan, but a license key is required to access any repair tools. So really, you can\u2019t do anything useful with the free version.",
    "Although Restoro certainly doesn\u2019t boast the largest feature list we\u2019ve seen, it does a great job of providing the essentials without adding too many unnecessary extras.",
    "All Restoro scans include built-in malware detection. Any suspicious files will be immediately identified, and you can decide whether or not they need to be removed.",
    "We also love Restoro\u2019s performance optimization tools, which are designed to return slow or laggy computers to their original state. Numerous problems are scanned for, listed if found, and repaired with the powerful system repair tool.",
    "If you have one of the two unlimited use plans, you will benefit from the power of Restoro\u2019s excellent real-time monitoring tools. These are designed to help you keep tabs on your computer, identifying potentially dangerous apps or security breaches before any damage is caused.",
    "This should be quite self-explanatory, but Restoro\u2019s full money-back guarantee basically means that you can request a full refund if you\u2019re not happy with the program\u2019s performance.",
    "Downloading and installing the Restoro software shouldn\u2019t take you more than a few minutes. Virtually no setup is required, and the program will start an automatic scan once installation is complete.",
    "This will analyze various aspects of your computer, starting with full data compilation and analysis. Various aspects of PC security and stability will also be analyzed, and the entire scan shouldn\u2019t take more than a few minutes.",
    "A quick scan of our test computer (which is very well maintained) revealed one security issue, 12 stability issues, 1.38GB of junk files, and over 1000 registry files that needed repair. With a premium plan, dealing with these problems is as simple as hitting the Start Repair button and letting the program work its magic.",
    "Unfortunately, Restoro\u2019s support services are quite limited. You can submit a ticket request online, but there\u2019s no phone or live chat available.",
    "Meanwhile, the help center is quite limited as well. There are a few resources available to help you get started, along with a decent troubleshooter wizard to help you solve problems. The FAQs are very basic, and we couldn\u2019t get the built-in search bar to work at all.",
    "Restoro is a great option for those looking for a simple yet powerful system cleanup tool. However, there are plenty of alternatives out there that are worth considering.",
    "Business users will appreciate the power and bulk-licensing features of CCleaner, which comes with a suite of advanced features. Along with similar tools to Restoro, it also offers a neat web browser add-on, a startup manager, a drive wiper, and more.",
    "System Mechanic by iolo Technologies is another powerful tool, especially for those with a little more tech experience. It comes with tools to help you identify and deal with issues with your CPU, memory, internet connection, and more. The most noteworthy feature here is that you can look closer at each individual problem before deciding what actions (if any) to take.",
    "Restoro appears to be an excellent system optimization tool at first glance, and a deeper analysis doesn\u2019t disappoint. It boasts a great range of advanced features designed to help you clean up your device and improve performance, along with a neat user interface and very competitive prices.",
    "Scans take no more than a few minutes, and you can manage the cleanup process if required. The only downside is the limited customer service, but the program is so easy to use that you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems anyway.",
    "The bottom line: Restoro is a powerful system optimization and repair tool that we\u2019d definitely recommend considering. Take advantage of its free trial to test it before purchasing a license."
