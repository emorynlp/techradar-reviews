    "It\u2019s a confident or foolish company that enters the mid-range true wireless fray. Happily, Technics is the former, and where the EAH-AZ60 are concerned, it has every right to be.",
    "The plus column is a long one, and covers quite a few aspects. Fit, first and foremost, is good \u2013 the earbuds are a good shape, light and come with quite the widest selection of eartips we\u2019ve seen so far. So getting them comfy, and having them stay that way, is simple. Ergonomics are great \u2013 the touch controls are sensitive and can be customized in the control app, which is extremely thorough. Or there\u2019s (very responsive) voice control available, too.",
    "And there are many positives to the way the Technics sound. They\u2019re a punchy and assertive listen, with plenty of detail available and a nicely unified, coherent overall sound. Their noise cancellation is good, and doesn\u2019t interfere where the sonic signature is concerned. It\u2019s really only a lack of rhythmic conviction when compared to the best of their numerous rivals that costs them that final half-star.",
    "The Technics EAH-AZ60 are on sale now, and in the United Kingdom they\u2019re priced at \u00a3199. In the United States they go for around $229, while in Australia they\u2019re marked up at around AU$379.",
    "At this price, they\u2019re on the coattails of some of the best true wireless earbuds around. Sennheiser\u2019s great-sounding Momentum True Wireless 2 can be yours for a similar cost, while Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds deliver all the quiet and comfort the model name promises for not much more. And, of course, $279.99 / \u00a3249 / AU$379 buys you a pair of The Best True Wireless In-Ear Headphones Currently Available (according to, oh, everyone): the Sony WF-1000XM4.",
    "The long and short of it is this: The competition is fierce and the Technics has its work cut out.",
    "As far as the design goes, Technics took the welcome step of reducing the bulk of these wireless earbuds relative to the EAH-AZ70W (its first entry in the premium true wireless in-ear market). The EAH-AZ60 are more ergonomic in shape, lighter (7g per bud) and smaller (26 x 23 x 28mm) \u2013 and those three facts, taken along with the fact the package includes seven differently sized pairs of eartips, means the Technics are a cinch to get comfortable and will stay that way for easily as long as the battery lasts.",
    "Battery life, while we\u2019re on the subject, is an OK-but-hardly-dazzling 25 hours. That\u2019s your best-case scenario, when listening to the standard Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec content with active noise cancelling (ANC) switched off \u2013 between seven and eight hours from the buds themselves and a little over two charges held in the slender little charging case. Go to town (in performance terms, at least) by streaming using the LDAC codec with noise-cancelling engaged and you\u2019re looking at more like 16 hours \u2013 four-and-a-bit from the earbuds, and the rest from the case.",
    "Wireless connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.2, which we\u2019re always happy to see, and naturally enough there\u2019s support for the sub-band codec (SBC) as well as AAC and Sony\u2019s hi-res LDAC. There\u2019s no sign of aptX, though, let alone aptX HD \u2014 and that\u2019s a pity.",
    "Control freaks will enjoy the options here, though. Amazon Alexa is built in, and Siri is available, too. The four-mic-per-bud array here is every bit as good at receiving instructions as it is at delivering decent call quality or assessing ambient conditions as they relate to the active noise-cancellation circuitry. Like the mics, each earbud features a capacitive touch surface which gives swift and reliable control of the most obvious functions: play/pause, volume up/down, skip forward/backward, answer/end/reject call, wake Siri and \u2018switch between noise-cancelling and ambient sound.",
    "It\u2019s possible to customize those controls in the expansive yet rather unglamorous Technics Audio Connect app. It\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find five-band EQ adjustment, where you can adjust the level of noise cancelling and ambient sound (which gives external sound a boost), ask your earbuds to emit a chirp in case you\u2019ve temporarily misplaced them, enable multi-point connection, you name it\u2026 \u201cthorough\u201d doesn\u2019t really do the earbuds justice.",
    "Quite often a product \u2013 especially earbuds \u2013 will reveal their essential character quite quickly. The Technics EAH-AZ60 immediately let you know how confident they are.",
    "There\u2019s more to them than that, of course, but on a fundamental level these earbuds sound assertive, positive and self-possessed. A quick pass through Belle and Sebastian\u2019s Nobody\u2019s Empire allows them to make their case almost entirely: they lay out a coherent soundstage, they don\u2019t scrimp on even the finer details and they are unarguably in charge of the tune.",
    "This front-foot attitude is carried over into their tonal balance (assuming you haven\u2019t been fiddling with the EQ levels, anyhow). The low frequencies are robust, hefty and carry plenty of well-controlled momentum, while at the opposite end of the frequency range the treble is bright and shiny but never hard, not even at a high volume.",
    "In between, there\u2019s more than enough space in the mid-range for a singer to comfortably do their thing, and enough detail revealed to make it obvious what that particular thing is. It may seem redundant to talk about powers of communication when discussing a product like this, but there are enough true wireless earbuds around that simply don\u2019t communicate. These Technics do, and pretty explicitly.",
    "They\u2019re dynamic, too. They can handle the straightforward variations of Leafcutter John\u2019s Yes! Come Parade With Us and the more subtle harmonic dynamics of Sampha\u2019s (No One Knows Me) Like the Piano. The intentions of a musician, a singer or a band are really never in any doubt.",
    "It\u2019s with the rhythm-dependent aspect of music that the EAH-AZ60 come up a little short when compared to the best alternatives at this price. They don\u2019t seem capable of the same rhythmic certainty of their best rivals, and end up sounding rather less musical as a result. Heard in isolation, there\u2019s not too much to criticize where rhythmic expression is concerned, but swap them for Sony\u2019s all-conquering WF-1000XM4 and they sound just slightly mechanical and less than deft. It\u2019s a marginal difference, but it\u2019s a difference nevertheless.",
    "They\u2019re effective at noise cancellation, though \u2013 not quite on a par with Bose\u2019s almost-eerily quiet QuietComfort Earbuds but they\u2019re among some strong second-tier alternatives. Dial up the ANC to 100% in the app and the outside world is near enough banished. And without skewing the sound of your music, either."
