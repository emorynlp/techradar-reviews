  "summary": "More channels plus huge power equals all kinds of awesome",
  "verdict": "While the number of audio channels a home cinema sound system has isn\u2019t everything, it certainly helps. It\u2019s fair to say, then, that Samsung\u2019s HW-Q950A soundbar hits the ground running by delivering no less than 16 separate channels of sound. The new rear side channels Samsung has added to 2020\u2019s 14-channel maximum contribute to the most immersive Dolby Atmos performance we\u2019ve heard from a soundbar. The Q950A\u2019s price could assemble a decent separates system instead. But nothing better combines a near separates-grade performance with the convenience of a soundbar.",
  "pros": [
    "Hugely powerful movie playback",
    "Remarkably well-rounded Dolby Atmos soundstage",
    "Dolby Vision and HDR10+ passthrough"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Expensive compared to rivals",
    "Poorly positioned display",
    "A little unrefined with music"

    "Even though the Samsung HW-Q950A stretches the definition of soundbar to the max by actually comprising four separate bits of kit, there\u2019s nothing about its appearance that prepares you for the scale of sound it delivers.",
    "The main soundbar is more than a metre wide, but slim enough to tuck under the screen of most of today\u2019s TVs. The rears are heavy but sufficiently compact to easily fit on a bookshelf, and despite carrying an unusually large 8-inch driver, the subwoofer has a slim-enough profile to hide down the side of a sofa or under a sideboard.",
    "Tucked inside the HW-Q950A\u2019s relatively unimposing set of speakers is a remarkable \u2013 unprecedented, in fact \u2013 16 channels of sound, delivered via 22 speakers. And driving all those channels of sound is a mammoth 616W of unbridled audio horsepower.",
    "While the HW-Q950A\u2019s masses of power and huge channel count might not be obvious just by looking at it, it becomes blissfully obvious when you turn it on. Film soundtracks erupt out of each speaker with enough power and projection to fill even the biggest living rooms, putting you at the heart of the action more completely than with any other soundbar. Especially since the HW-Q950A\u2019s two new channels fill the slight gaps that previously existed off each shoulder.",
    "Soundbars are now available for under \u00a3100, and some very impressive models can be had for as little as $400 / \u00a3400 / AU$550. Yet the Samsung HW-Q950A costs $1,499.99 / \u00a31,599 / AU$1,999. Ouch.",
    "As we\u2019ll see, though, through a combination of the sheer number of physical speakers, channels, and the power it delivers, the HW-Q950A has a good stab at justifying its price. In fact, there\u2019s no other soundbar out there at the moment that\u2019s able to provide so many real audio channels. However, for the price you could, just about, get yourself a pretty good separates system instead.",
    "The HW-Q950A is available now in every major territory across the world.",
    "The HW-Q950A soundbar is much more than just a soundbar. Yes, it takes the usual form of a long, slim speaker designed to sit under your TV screen. But this unit is joined by a large subwoofer with a huge 8-inch driver, and a pair of wireless \u2018bookshelf\u2019 rears, which, despite their compact size, contain three drivers each. One fires upwards for height effects with Dolby Atmos/DTS:X sources; another faces forward towards your seating position; the third faces out towards the rear side of your room.",
    "The main soundbar continues the theme of being stuffed to bursting point with speakers. As well as the dedicated front-centre, front-left and front-right channels you\u2019d hope to see with a serious soundbar, there are two more upfiring drivers, two drivers firing off to the side, and a further two drivers firing forwards at an angle to deliver mid-side effects reflected off your walls.",
    "Since a number of these channels need to bounce their sound off walls or ceilings for best effect, you should consider if your room design and layout is well suited to the HW-Q950A\u2019s needs. For instance, vaulted or barrelled ceilings won\u2019t help the height effects, and big disparities in the distance between the walls to the soundbar\u2019s left and right side could cause some balance issues.",
    "You can manually adjust the relative weight of each channel, although it\u2019s a pity that Samsung still provides a full-bore audio calibration system, despite the HW-Q950A being its flagship soundbar. This year, at least, there\u2019s a built-in bass adjuster. And if you happen to have a reasonably recent Samsung TV, then you can use its mic to provide the soundbar with information on your room characteristics.",
    "The 11.1.4 channels of sound supported by the HW-Q950A is the most we\u2019ve seen \u2013 or, rather, heard \u2013 from any soundbar to date. The idea behind this being to get the most from the Dolby Atmos and DTS:X formats\u2019 \u2018object-based\u2019 approach to sound, where audio effects are placed within a carefully crafted 3D space created around the listener. The more channels there are, in theory at least, the more complete that 3D space will sound.",
    "The HW-Q950A even carries a Q-Symphony feature that lets you combine its speakers with those of a compatible Samsung TV, to create more of a wall of sound at the front. This works surprisingly well, at least with Samsung\u2019s premium TVs \u2013 although, at the same time, the HW-Q950A is more than good enough on its own not to need any assistance from other speakers.",
    "Samsung provides processing modes that can remix any sound source so that it takes advantage of the system\u2019s full speaker and channel count, and even includes a Game preset that emphasises surround and ambient effects for greater immersion into the game\u2019s world.",
    "Connectivity comes by way of two HDMI inputs, one HDMI output, an optical digital-audio input, and the now obligatory Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support. Samsung even provides support for Tap View technology, where you can establish a connection between a compatible Samsung phone and the soundbar simply by touching the phone to the soundbar\u2019s chassis.",
    "The HDMI loop-through system supports all the key HDR formats: HDR, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. However, they don\u2019t support pass-through of 4K at 120Hz, or variable refresh rate signals now available from premium PC cards and the latest Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles. To be fair, most other soundbars don\u2019t support such gaming features either, although there are new soundbars from Klipsch and Sony (as well as many AV receivers) that do.",
    "The question we have to ask here is \u2013 does the HW-Q950A really make its ground-breaking number of audio channels count? The short answer is, yes. The long answer is, yes \u2013 with knobs on.",
    "For starters, the extra drivers that Samsung has shoehorned into each of the two wireless rear speakers seriously punch above their weight in terms of the difference they make to the HW-Q950A\u2019s soundstage. What\u2019s more, they do so without negatively impacting the sound quality of the other rear speaker drivers they sit in such close proximity.",
    "In terms of the new rear side channels\u2019 impact on the HW-Q950A\u2019s sound, there\u2019s clearly an enhanced sense of width to the rear soundstage versus its HW-Q950T predecessor. This immediately makes three-dimensional Dolby Atmos and DTS:X object-based soundstages appear more complete; there are no gaps in the \u2018dome\u2019 of sound to your rear left and right. They also remove the \u2018funnelling effect\u2019, where sound can narrow as it moves from spacious-sounding front soundbars to smaller, less-effusive rears.",
    "Sounds that pass from front to back and rear-left to rear-right are handled with far more conviction than they are not only by last year\u2019s HW-Q950T, but also, arguably, by any other soundbar. Plus, you can hear specific rear-left and rear-right sound details that would have been delivered with less precision by just the front side drivers on last year\u2019s HW-Q950T.",
    "In addition, the HW-Q950A\u2019s new rear channels provide an unexpected secondary benefit: they make the rear soundstage feel generally more involved in the action. This again underlines the cohesion of the wrap-around 3D soundstage, further sealing your immersion in the world of whatever movie you\u2019re watching.",
    "While this is clearly at its most effective when that movie is using a DTS:X or, especially, Dolby Atmos soundtrack, the soundbar\u2019s processing options can do an excellent job of reworking lower-channel sources to take advantage of the HW-Q950A\u2019s unprecedented speakerage.",
    "The HW-Q950A\u2019s new drivers merely add another layer of excellence to the class-leading experience that was introduced by last year\u2019s HW-Q950T. All of that predecessor\u2019s qualities remain intact. So, the main soundbar still spreads its sound left, right, forward, up and down with a combination of precision and scale that at times is hard to believe. From floor to ceiling, wall to wall and back to front, even the largest room is filled with the sort of sound you should only really achieve through a separates system that would likely cost much more than the HW-Q950A.",
    "This isn\u2019t a vague audio space, either. The HW-Q950A\u2019s extreme power is partnered with impressively accurate channel \u2018throw\u2019 and effects placement, resulting in a soundstage that\u2019s as busy and involving as it is loud.",
    "And, man \u2013 can it go loud. Louder than your ears will be comfortable with, in fact. And without a trace of distortion, speaker fall-out, cabinet buzzing/rattling, or harshness. The sound can grow to fill out the most extreme action scenes, and never misses a beat when it comes to thumping out even the hardest impact sounds. It isn\u2019t polite in the slightest \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly how we like it.",
    "That\u2019s not to say the HW-Q950A doesn\u2019t care about the little things. Not even the tiniest detail in the mix escapes the soundbar\u2019s attention \u2013 and it shows an impressive knack, too, for understanding the relative weight that each element in a mix is supposed to have. The main soundbar has enough dynamic range to never sound thin or boxy, and it latches on to the bass whumping out from the subwoofer seamlessly. Despite that subwoofer hitting depths of bass as profound and well-rounded as anything I\u2019ve heard from a soundbar system.",
    "Voices are always clear and natural, and seem to enjoy a little lift in the mix, so that they appear to be partnering the on-screen images, rather than coming from below the picture.",
    "While the HW-Q950A is undoubtedly made with movies at the forefront of its mind, its room-filling power is in evidence with music playback, too. The staging is sufficiently big and aggressive to make you feel like you\u2019re at a concert, rather than just playing a CD or audio file. While this is seldom less than fun, it doesn\u2019t suit every type of genre or recording. There are other soundbars out there that deliver a better and more refined ear for music. But none of them have the HW-Q950A\u2019s flair and feel for films.",
    "The only other complaint that could be levelled at the HW-Q950A is that neither its \u2018reflected\u2019 side or height channels are as precise with the effects they produce as speakers in a separates system. That\u2019s pretty much inevitable, though. And if you\u2019re looking at a soundbar rather than a separates system, you\u2019re surely doing so in the knowledge that you\u2019re prepared to accept one or two compromises (albeit small ones, in the HW-Q950A\u2019s case) in return for not having lots of speakers all around your room.",
    "No soundbar system we\u2019ve heard sounds more powerful and immersive with film soundtracks than the HW-Q950A. So if you\u2019re looking to turn a living room into a serious home cinema with the minimum of fuss, the HW-Q950A is currently as good as it gets.",
    "If you\u2019re not fussed about having lots of speakers around the room and even, potentially, in/on your ceiling, then you could try (although you\u2019ll struggle) to put together a separates system for around the HW-Q950A\u2019s asking price. Or, if you\u2019re a hi-fi as well as a music buff then you could consider something with more music pedigree, such as a Sonos Arc and Sub. Although, obviously, while that system is very good, it doesn\u2019t deliver anywhere near as many real Dolby Atmos-friendly sound channels as the HW-Q950A.",
