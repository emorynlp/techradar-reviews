  "author": "sead-fadilpasic",
  "summary": "Guaranteed VPN quality",
  "verdict": "AVG Secure isn\u2019t as fully featured as some VPN services, it can\u2019t be installed on non-mainstream platforms and we failed to get in touch with customer support. That said, it does everything else you\u2019d expect a strong VPN solution to do: it effectively hides your real location, unblocks all sorts of geographically restricted content, supports torrenting and provides some very good download speeds.",
  "pros": [
    "Unblocks Netflix, BBC iPlayer",
    "Excellent speeds",
    "No-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee",
    "7-day free trial",
    "Supports torrenting",
    "Starts as really cheap"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not many features",
    "Limited platform support",
    "Contacting support is difficult"

    "AVG Secure VPN is a VPN product from cybersecurity giant AVG Technologies (now owned by Avast), well-known for its antivirus and other software solutions for desktop computers and mobile devices.",
    "The VPN service is available under three subscription lengths: one-year, two-year, and three-year. The three-year option is the cheapest in the long run, as it costs only $3.99/month for the first three years, after which it is renewed at $269.99 billed every three years (around $7.50/month).",
    "Regardless of the chosen subscription plan, you can run simultaneous VPN connections on up to 5 devices at the same time.",
    "The best part? You can take this service for a spin during its seven-day free trial and you don\u2019t even need to leave your financial details. Speaking of which, it only accepts credit/debit cards and PayPal as methods of payment.",
    "In addition to a free trial period, AVG also has a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee if its VPN solution isn\u2019t up to your standard.",
    "AVG Secure VPN is a decent alternative to the major industry names like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, and CyberGhost. It provides solid speeds, unblocks popular streaming content, supports torrenting, offers a free trial and generous money-back guarantee, and isn\u2019t expensive, at least at first.",
    "However, the more demanding users will find themselves disappointed with its lack of features, as well as support for platforms besides the mainstream ones.",
    "This VPN is a great option for anyone who wants to unblock their favorite localized libraries on today\u2019s popular streaming platforms like BBC iPlayer and Netflix, as we witnessed ourselves during our tests. As a matter of fact, AVG Secure VPN even offers special servers that work best for streaming.",
    "AVG Secure VPN is run by Avast Software, with headquarters in the Czech Republic. Its anonymity product provides users with access to 50 VPN locations around the world including in Iceland, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, Portugal, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, and other places. Avast also markets AVG antivirus.",
    "To safeguard your privacy online, AVG Secure uses the 256-bit AES encryption standards, but it doesn\u2019t say which protocols are deployed during your VPN connection.",
    "All the apps, except the one for iOS, feature a kill switch - the mechanism that shuts down your internet access if there\u2019s an interruption to the VPN connection. Do note that this option isn\u2019t turned on by default.",
    "This provider supports torrenting and P2P traffic and even offers specialized servers that are optimized for this purpose.",
    "AVG\u2019s Privacy Policy states that \u201cyour IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided, for the purpose of facilitating our billing process\u201d but that the company doesn\u2019t store this information. Your IP address is also processed \u201cfor the purpose of downloading certain products, fraud and malware detection\u201d.",
    "Unfortunately, that\u2019s the closest we get to a no-logs policy, so having an independent auditor coming in to check the platform would be very helpful.",
    "AVG Secure VPN is available as an app for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android.",
    "At the time of writing, its iOS app has an excellent score of 4.7 stars (out of 5), as rated by 6,700 users. Its version history shows that the app is regularly updated, several times each year. Its Android counterpart had 4.3 stars as rated by 31,300 users. It was updated just weeks before this review.",
    "If you need assistance, you can try looking at the vendor\u2019s blog, which has a special section dedicated to its VPN service. Here you can read all about unblocking restricted content with a VPN, proxy servers, data encryption, setting up a VPN, and more.",
    "You could also visit AVG\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube profiles for some general updates.",
    "As for a more direct approach, it is available in the support center, support community, or via support form and one of the vendor\u2019s agents will be right with you. Note that phone and email support are available only to paying customers.",
    "You can, however, try using Avast customer support email. We\u2019re yet to receive an email response to our more general query about AVG Secure VPN.",
    "The apps not only look very nice and sleek but are also incredibly easy to use, in part due to their lack of options and features (aside from a kill switch). Connecting is a walk in the park as well, as the app connects within seconds and triggers a notification in the lower right corner each time the user connects and disconnects.",
    "We tested the provider\u2019s download speeds on a 71.45Mbps testing connection from a location in south-east Europe, letting the app connect us to the most optimal VPN server for our location first. It connected us to Budapest and delivered a very good result: 32.52Mbps.",
    "Then we decided to give Glasgow, UK a chance and it didn\u2019t do as well, hailing a much lower 15.43Mbps. After the UK, it was time for a bigger challenger: the US. We connected to a server in \u201cGotham City\u201d and got a decent result considering the distance, 14.11Mbps.",
    "Finally, we skipped over to the other side of the globe and gave a server in Taipei, Taiwan a chance. The speeds were expectedly lower for this location at 6.50Mbps.",
    "AVG Secure VPN is a very good anonymity product, one that can almost stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the industry giants. It checks all the boxes: strong encryption, good speeds, user-friendly and gorgeous apps, P2P support, Netflix unblocking. It also offers a few extras like a free trial, generous refund policy and low starting prices.",
    "However, there are some elements that need work, like being more available to its customers, covering more platforms and throwing in more features. Otherwise, there\u2019s a lot to like about this VPN.",
    "Other VPN providers we have recently tested include:",
    "VPN Gate, Seed4.me, Hideway VPN, BulletVPN, Tuxler VPN, VPNsecure, b.VPN, FastestVPN, X-VPN, SuperVPN, VeePN, ProXPN, Dashlane VPN, TouchVPN, Goose VPN, SlickVPN, Namecheap VPN and VPN Proxy Master"
