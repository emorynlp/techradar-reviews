  "verdict": "The Eufy RoboVac 11S is a great choice for those who like to keep their technology ultra-simple. It effectively collects fine dust and large debris from hard floors and is best-suited to light daily cleans to keep your floors free from dust. Its remote control, pared-back features, and easy operation mean it's simple to use. In an ideal world, it\u2019d give you more useful information \u2013 when it needs emptying and the battery level, for example \u2013 but it\u2019s still good value for the price and almost guaranteed to be headache-free.",

    "Eufy might be a smart home company, majoring in the best video doorbells and home security cameras besides robot vacuums, but unlike some, making easy-to-use products is its USP. So it comes as no surprise that one of its entry-level models, the RoboVac 11S, is devilishly simple to use. There\u2019s no app, no WiFi control, no voice control \u2013 just a charging station, remote control, and a sleek, slimline vacuum cleaner.",
    "This isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s a basic appliance. If anything, much of its simplicity comes from a thoughtful design and an excellent balance of functionality \u2013 there\u2019s enough flexibility to be able to switch between spot, overall and perimeter cleaning, and three power levels, but not so many options that it\u2019s overwhelming. A programmable timer means you can quite easily set it and forget it.",
    "The other reason to choose RoboVac 11S is that it\u2019s Eufy\u2019s slimmest RoboVac at 2.8 inches / 7.25 cm tall, enabling it to sneak under beds and other furniture to keep dust bunnies at bay. And even with its shorter stature, there\u2019s still a 0.15-gallon / 0.6-litre dust canister hidden inside.",
    "The Eufy RoboVac 11S is effective at collecting fine dust and larger debris from hard floors, but struggles to give medium and thick pile carpets an effective deep clean. Eufy claims the robot vacuum will last for 100 minutes between charges, but this is in Standard mode on hard floor.",
    "There\u2019s also a BoostIQ mode that cycles between high and low power when the robot vacuum switches between carpet and hard floors, but this knocks the battery life down to 60 minutes, while when used in Max Mode the battery lasts just 50 minutes. All of this means that if it\u2019s presented with particularly dusty or dirty larger floors, it may run down before the job is done.",
    "The Eufy RoboVac 11S is the ideal robot vacuum for newbies and technophobes. It\u2019s effective at light daily cleaning of large areas but doesn\u2019t come with a raft of features that can complicate the robot vacuum, making it more complicated to use.",
    "The Eufy RoboVac 11S is priced at $219.99 / \u00a3189.99 / AU$229. It\u2019s available to buy now in the US and UK from Eufy or Amazon, while in Australia, it\u2019s available at Kogan.com.",
    "The Eufy RoboVac 11S Max, which offers more powerful suction is available in the US and UK for $249 / \u00a3239.99 respectively but isn\u2019t available in Australia. Aside from power, the Eufy RoboVac 11S Max is very similar in terms of features, size, and dust capacity.",
    "The Eufy RoboVac 11S is anything but chunky. It\u2019s a mere 2.85 inches / 7.25cm off the floor, meaning that it can scoot under low furniture, and is also light enough to carry from room to room if required, at 5.73lb / 2.6kg. The charging station is similarly compact at 6.5 inches / 16.5cm wide, with a recess at the back for storing excess cable. Like many robot vacuums, you\u2019ll need some clearance against a wall at either side of the charging station, but the station itself is so small that this should be easy.",
    "Its design is pared-back \u2013 there\u2019s a single button on top to wake it up (an on-off switch sits underneath the unit for a more permanent turn-off), tempered black glass surface, and infrared sensors at the front to help it steer clear of obstacles.",
    "Underneath, you\u2019ll find a pair of counter-rotating side brushes twinned with a 14.5 cm rolling brush. The 0.15-gallons / 0.6-liter dust box simply slides out from the back of the robot vacuum, but there\u2019s no warning light when it\u2019s full - we found the best way to know when it needs emptying, is if it isn\u2019t picking up as well as usual.",
    "From the box, it\u2019s easy to get it up and running \u2013 clip on the side brushes, charge it up and you\u2019re ready to go. There are five different cleaning modes; Auto, which ensures the robot vacuum pottles from room to room cleaning as it goes, as well as Spot for cleaning for specific areas, and Edge for 20 minutes of perimeter wall cleaning. These are joined by Single Room, which unsurprisingly will clean just one room, and Manual, where you can use the directional buttons on the remote to tell it where you want it to go \u2013 back, forward, right, or left.",
    "The Eufy 11S also offers three power levels \u2013 Standard, BoostIQ, which uses a mix of Standard and Max when moving between hard floors and carpet, although this only works in Auto or Single Room cleaning mode, and Max.",
    "Setting a schedule for cleaning is easy as it\u2019s a case of choosing the hour and minute you\u2019d like it to start using the remote control. The only downside is that there\u2019s no option to clean every other day or twice a day but a daily vacuum should suffice for most. It comes with an extra set of filters, two additional side brushes, and even some cable ties so you can clip power cords out of its way.",
    "If it\u2019s larger particles that often litter your home, the Eufy RoboVac 11S can handle them. It picked up dry oats from both a medium-pile carpet and a hard floor with ease, with no need to resort to the higher settings. Finer dust made from flour and cookies was also no problem for it on a hard floor but when it came to picking that up from the carpet, the RoboVac 11S struggled. Even the Max suction setting couldn\u2019t pull it out from the fibres once it had been trampled in by wheels running over the surface.",
    "The RoboVac 11S\u2019s cleaning pattern doesn\u2019t always look logical \u2013 sometimes it\u2019ll go in straight lines, sometimes seek out the edges of a room, sometimes it\u2019ll want to travel in circles \u2013 but this random path of Bounce Navigation results in the entire room being cleaned, even if it can take some time. It wasn\u2019t always that good at moving around objects \u2013 low-level things seemed to fox it the most, such as deep-pile rugs, piano pedals and pet food bowls.",
    "While we had vacuumed before testing, the Eufy RoboVac did still manage to pick up other dust, pet dander and human hair from the edges of our rooms, although the latter tended to tangle around the rolling brush. The rotating brushes didn\u2019t gather any dirt but a few of the bristles were bent or twisted slightly by the time we\u2019d finished testing, so it\u2019s a good idea to check on the condition of these regularly to maintain efficient cleaning.",
    "It\u2019s not especially noisy while in use - our decibel meter measured 55db when cleaning hard floors on the Standard mode, rising to 60db in Max. This is the equivalent of the sound a dishwasher makes mid-cycle, which is more than acceptable.",
    "There\u2019s no alert when the dust box is full, so you\u2019ll need to remember to empty it or watch for when it doesn\u2019t do a great job. The box is simple to empty though \u2013 it slides out with a button push, flips open and dust can be tipped out in one motion. Finer dust tended to clump in the corners, but this could be brushed out with the cleaning tool provided. This also serves for cleaning the rolling brush and filters, which is a weekly job.",
    "As mentioned, Eufy claims the battery will last 100 minutes on standard cleaning, and during our testing, it actually outdid this by lasting 105 minutes before its light turned from blue to orange and it trundled back to base to recharge.",
    "However, we were disappointed there\u2019s no battery level indicator that offers more detailed stats about just how much charge remains. That said, the battery took 4.5 hours to fully recharge, which is speedier than the claims made by Eufy.",
