    "SimplyHired is one of the biggest and most powerful job boards around, so it\u2019s a great option if you want to scour job adverts from hundreds of different sources in one place.",
    "Employers can post jobs for free on this job site, and listings are also aggregated from elsewhere. SimplyHired has an impressive pedigree \u2013 it\u2019s owned by the same parent company as both Indeed and Glassdoor.",
    "That bodes well when it comes to a high-quality recruitment experience, but there\u2019s plenty of competition in the market, and so SimplyHired will still need to deliver a good experience if it\u2019s going to impress.",
    "SimplyHired looks like a search engine, and the result is a focused interface that puts job listings front and centre.",
    "When you search for a position and location, you\u2019re presented with a list of jobs on the left and their job descriptions in a larger window on the right, and you can filter the roles by their posting date, job type, salary, and distance from your location. On each listing, you\u2019ll see the hiring company, the skills needed and the job description, and the site also offers estimated salary ranges if information about compensation isn\u2019t provided. This is solid, but more filtering options on those searches would have been welcome.",
    "Due to SimplyHired\u2019s shared ownership with Glassdoor, you\u2019ll also see each company\u2019s overall rating if it\u2019s available. And, as jobs are aggregated here from loads of other sites as well as being posted natively, there\u2019s no shortage of postings to browse.",
    "You can apply for some positions directly on SimplyHired by uploading your resume, while other listings will take you to external sites. As usual, you can establish customized job alerts and save job listings, and users can upload resumes or build them using SimplyHired\u2019s free building module. This portion of the site is impressive \u2013 users can deploy loads of different templates and rely on pre-written phrases to keep things professional.",
    "SimplyHired has some impressive job-seeking tools elsewhere. There\u2019s an extensive salary estimation module and a cost-of-living calculator, and company review data is pulled across from Glassdoor \u2013 although you will find more detailed information over on that site. The feature set is rounded off with a careers hub that provides job seekers with resume and cover letter templates and sample interview questions. There\u2019s a mobile app for job-searching, too.",
    "There\u2019s plenty to like here for recruiters. It\u2019s free to post a job vacancy on SimplyHired, and the position will usually appear on more than 100 different job boards. The site has a sleek dashboard to allow employers to manage their job listings and applications.",
    "Easy toggles allow job listings to be customized and enable employers to add screening questions that can narrow down the field before applications are sent, and a straightforward workflow template illustrates how candidates are moving through your recruitment process.",
    "Elsewhere, SimplyHired can also be used to onboard new staff members, track employee attendance, monitor paid time off, and manage all of the documents required by the recruitment process. These are many of the features that are usually found in ATS and other kinds of HR software, and it\u2019s unusual but welcome to find them on a job board like SimplyHired.",
    "This system isn\u2019t powerful enough for large businesses, but it\u2019s a great option for smaller companies that need some help to streamline and standardize their HR processes.",
    "It\u2019s free for job-seekers to use SimplyHired, and it\u2019s free for employers to post job listings on the site \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pay a fee for each candidate you wish to contact. The price per candidate starts at $9.99, but it will rise based on the number of applicants, their level of experience, and how in-demand they are.",
    "SimplyHired\u2019s HR features are free to use, which is an impressive feature \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the power of other tools, but for simpler tasks, it\u2019s ideal.",
    "SimplyHired is one of the best options around for job seekers and recruiters. Its aggregation means you get access to a huge number of job listings, and the site uses data from Glassdoor to enhance its listings.",
    "There\u2019s a good range of features elsewhere, including salary and cost-of-living data. This is a great choice for employers, too \u2013 recruiters can rely on innovative pricing, a slick dashboard, and a surprisingly extensive selection of HR tools.",
    "SimplyHired lives up to its name with powerful features and straightforward design. Whether you\u2019re on the hunt for a job or looking for staff, it\u2019s an excellent addition to your arsenal.",
    "We've also highlighted the best US job sites, best free job boards and best recruitment platforms"
