    "For more advanced team- and order-management features and a full range of Brilliant POS add-ons, opt for the Register Plan. This plan is also available for Clover Station users.",
    "Cash Register Express and Restaurant Pro Express software are available for Clover Station users. Instead of a monthly fee, you\u2019ll pay a one-time fee of $799.

You can neatly categorize what your employees will see on the main screen for access at any time. On the back-end, Brilliant's dashboard is just as intuitive, with easy access to tools like inventory management and employee management.",
    "While the interface on Brilliant\u2019s Clover devices is modern, the same sleek interface isn\u2019t found on Brilliant\u2019s Cash Register Express and Restaurant Pro Express software. Instead, you\u2019ll find that it looks cluttered and reminiscent of Windows 95.",
    "Brilliant\u2019s website does not have a knowledge base or FAQ section, although you do get a dedicated account manager for your business upon sign-up.",
    "If you're buying any of the Clover POS hardware from Brilliant, you'll find the company's attitude to setup support is refreshingly dedicated also. A Clover Setup Wizard walks you step-by-step through getting your POS working after you unbox, so you don't have to rely on a long list of paper instructions that could get lost in the office.",
    "Brilliant also offers 24/7/365 customer support via email or phone. On our test, we received a reply to our email within 3 hours from a friendly and helpful Brilliant agent. Rave reviews online also suggest a high rate of customer satisfaction alongside helpful, efficient customer service.",
    "Where personal information is collected, Brilliant POS uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption so that sensitive payment data and your customers\u2019 personal information will be encrypted at the POS terminal, before being uploaded to the cloud for safe storage.",
    "Therefore, you do not have to worry about someone being able to hack your system and get their hands on your data. Learn more about Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).",
    "If you\u2019re thrown off by Brilliant\u2019s complicated pricing tiers, you might appreciate Square POS for its simple pricing model: transactions come with a straightforward 2.6% + $0.10 fee.",
    "If customization is a priority for you, Lightspeed POS\u2019s flexible solution is attractive too. A basic plan sets you back $69/month, and you can add different features and options as needed.",
    "With a range of useful features, 24/7/365 support, and an intuitive interface, Brilliant is easy to recommend. Some users, however, may find its pricing model complicated.",
    "Additionally, some may find that Brilliant\u2019s add-ons, while present, pale in comparison to the integrations and customization that competitors like Lightspeed POS offer.",
    "Beyond that, the feature-rich payment solution still has lots to offer and gives its competition a run for its money."
