  "summary": "A no-nonsense running shoe with real green credentials",
  "verdict": "If you're a keen runner with an eye on reducing your environmental impact, this shoe could well be your next choice. It\u2019s a great all rounder, perfect as a daily runner and regular training companion. The design is no nonsense, with a simple two material construction (therein lies the key to its recyclability), and nearly all types of runners will feel right at home in them instantly with no rubbing or niggles. Only the slightly eye watering price might put you off, so it depends on whether you\u2019re happy to dig a little deeper into your pocket for environmental reasons.",

    "Huge kudos to Salomon for the Index.01. It's one of the first companies to make a truly recyclable performance shoe and, despite the technical challenges involved, the end result is a bona fide running shoe.",
    "Admittedly, when race day comes round, you might reach for another shoe that wasn\u2019t built with sustainability in mind \u2013 perhaps with a carbon footplate, and a bit lighter (at 285g, these aren\u2019t racers) \u2013 but for regular training sessions, park runs, tempo work, or bigger weekend mileage, they totally fit the bill. Once you\u2019re done with them, post them back to Salomon for free, and they\u2019ll be recycled into winter sports gear.",
    "Announced in September 2020 and released in Spring 2021, the Salomon Index.01 cost $200 / \u00a3165 (about AU$260), which also includes postage back to Salomon for recycling at the end of their life.",
    "Articulating the myriad components in a trainer isn\u2019t normally easy. However, with the Index.01, this isn\u2019t a problem, because in order to be totally recyclable, simplicity is key. In earlier prototypes, Salomon tried making a shoe that was made of just one material: thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) foam. However it wasn\u2019t durable enough, so the designers added a second material, and made the upper from recycled polyester. This is the shoe we see today.",
    "The sole is made from a generous wedge of durable nitrogen-infused, TPU-based foam called Infiniride. It gives a nice amount of cushioning, yet is still firm too. Under the heel is a stack height of 28.5mm, and forefoot of 19.5mm making a drop of 9mm.",
    "The sole has quite a curved shape, which is intended to keep landings well cushioned and help with forward propulsion. It also has an overhang and angled corner at the back \u2013 it\u2019s distinctive but could well have a 'love it' or 'hate it' effect for some people\u2019s aesthetic. This material is very durable.",
    "The outsole has a minimal profile, just featuring little bobbles for tread. Although these are grippy, and are perfect for use on road, the lack of any substantial lugs means you best not venture too far off road onto loose or uneven surfaces. Tor regular roads, though, they are totally perfect.",
    "The upper is made from recycled polyester, and is joined to the sole via a thin strip of water-based glue. This minimizes material contamination and ensures as much as the shoe as possible is recyclable. The end result is a highly breathable mesh-like material \u2013 so much so you could see the color of your socks through it. it feels quite soft, and there are see-through panels on the sides.",
    "When the shoes come to the end of their life, simply scan the QR code they come with and you\u2019ll be able to post them back to Salomon, free of charge. The two parts will then be separated, the sole will be made into Salomon ski boots, and the upper into clothing. The lifecycle of these shoes is then complete.",
    "This is a great no-nonsense running shoe. It doesn\u2019t overcomplicate things \u2013 running on it feels totally natural, so you won\u2019t stress unusual muscle groups or need time to get used to it, and with the curved sole, there's a jolt of forward propulsion for speed too.",
    "With a heel stack height of 28.5mm, there is a nice level of cushioning, but the foam isn\u2019t a squidgy one (unlike, for example, Nike\u2019s ZoomX foam), which we actually liked for those regular daily runs. Also, given the neutral setup, you can happily use them for walking and general life too.",
    "The upper is really breathable, so sweat can easily dissipate, helping to keep your feet cool for those hotter summer runs. It's pretty easy to slip on and off too, which is always handy.",
    "After a while, the brilliant white colour will pick up dirt and start to look grubby, so advisable to give them a sponge down once in a while if you like your trainers to have that box fresh look.",
    "Comfort wise, there\u2019s nothing to fault. Supportive around the upper, with no rubbing or pinching anywhere around the heel or toes."
