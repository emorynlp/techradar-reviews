  "summary": "The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a sleep tracker you can set and forget",
  "verdict": "The Withings Sleep Analyzer gives you the same type of data you'd get from a fitness tracker on your wrist, without the need to wear a cumbersome watch to bed. The one-time setup is very convenient, and it's surprising how much data can be gathered through your mattress. Most of the results proved consistent with other sleep trackers, though we found estimated wake-up time occasionally inaccurate.",
  "pros": [
    "One-time setup",
    "Impressive level of detail",
    "Can't be felt at night"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Has to be plugged in",
    "Some inaccuracies in results"

    "Even the best mattress doesn't guarantee a perfect night's sleep, but the Withings Sleep Analyzer can help. It's a thin mat that slips under your mattress, where it records changes in pressure and noise during the night. Calibration is a one-off process, and once it\u2019s set up and connected to your phone and Wi-Fi network, it will record your sleep patterns each night with no further input.",
    "It\u2019s a good choice if you find wearing a fitness tracker on your wrist at night uncomfortable, or want something that you can simply set and forget.",
    "You\u2019ll receive slightly more detailed results than you would from a wrist-based sleep tracker (largely due to the noise detection). Results are easy to review in the morning, and seem quite consistent with those from wrist-based fitness trackers. We wouldn't rely on the estimated wake-up time, though that's perhaps the least important data point, as you can check it yourself when you wake.",
    "It's easiest to use if your bed has a solid frame (like a divan). If you have a slatted bed frame, you'll need to place the mat on something sturdy on top of the slats.",
    "The Withings Sleep Analyzer is available now, and costs $99.95 / \u00a3119.95 (about AU$145). It can be purchased directly from Withings, but is also available from Amazon.",
    "Sleep apnea detection wasn\u2019t available at launch (likely due to the need for FDA approval), but was added in 2019 via a software update.",
    "The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a narrow, gray mat that you place under your mattress at the same level as your chest and connect to your phone via Bluetooth using the Withings Health Mate app.",
    "The Sleep Analyzer doesn\u2019t contain a battery, which is understandable as the heat generated might make it a fire risk with the lack of air circulation under a mattress. This does, however, limit where you can use it \u2013 although the cable is quite long (around three meters) you\u2019ll need an electric outlet relatively near your bed to keep it plugged in overnight.",
    "The way it works is interesting, and very different to wrist-based sleep monitors. Most data is gathered from its pneumatic sensor, which identifies and separates different types of movement. For example, it can differentiate between the changes in pressure caused by your pulse, your breathing, and any tossing and turning during the night.",
    "The device also contains sound sensors, which isolate the noise of snoring and can separate it from other sounds like traffic outdoors, your washing machine\u2019s spin cycle, and your partner\u2019s snoring.",
    "Calibrating the device is a little time-consuming, but only needs to be done once. Place the mat under your mattress at chest level (keeping it on your side of the bed if you share with a partner), plug it into a mains outlet, then install the Withings Health Mate app (available for both Android and iOS) and connect to the mat via Bluetooth.",
    "If you don\u2019t already have a Health Mate account, you\u2019ll need to create one, which will require your name, email address, a password, and your current height and weight. You\u2019ll also need to connect the Sleep Analyzer to your home Wi-Fi network, so have your password to hand when setting it up.",
    "This is the same app used by other Withings devices, including fitness trackers and smart scales, so you can manage them all from one location.",
    "Once that\u2019s done, the mat will take a few minutes to configure. During this time you might hear some whirring noises underneath your mattress, but this is nothing to worry about. Don\u2019t sit on your bed while this is happening. The app will inform you when the process is complete.",
    "Once that\u2019s done, just go to bed as normal, and your sleep stats will appear in the app once you get up in the morning. Remember that you\u2019ll need to leave the mat plugged in.",
    "When you get up, you\u2019ll be presented with a bevy of statistics on your slumber. You won\u2019t always have time to fully digest these, so it\u2019s good to see that you\u2019re presented with an overall score to begin with, with more in-depth analysis available if you choose to drill through further.",
    "You will be given overall \u2018sleep score\u2019, which is then broken down into duration, time to sleep, depth, time to get up, interruptions and regularity (measured over a period of several nights). This is more in-depth than the data you\u2019d get from a Fitbit device, which will only rate your sleep\u2019s duration, quality (time spent in deep and REM sleep) and restoration (a combination of sleeping heart rate and restlessness).",
    "Tapping each of these scores will reveal a graph showing the data recorded by the Sleep Analyzer throughout the night. This is accompanied by advice on how to improve that aspect of your sleep (such as getting to bed earlier and keeping more regular sleep patterns).",
    "The pattern of light, deep and REM sleep) represented what we\u2019d expect from a typical 90-minute sleep cycle, resting heart rate was consistent with data from our Fitbit Charge 4. The \u2018time to wake\u2019 score seemed odd though, reporting that we were still asleep when we were definitely awake and drinking a cup of tea. This might be due to us having quite a low resting heart rate while awake (around 52bpm).",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that while snoring can often be an indicator of sleep apnea, the condition can also be silent, so if you find yourself feeling uncommonly tired even after a good night\u2019s sleep, it\u2019s always wise to seek medical advice."
