  "verdict": "The Ooni Karu 16 is an outdoor pizza oven that can be run using wood, charcoal or gas. Simple to use, it produced pizzas with an authentic wood-fired taste in around 60 seconds, with the glass door handy for checking on your pizza during cooking. It\u2019s expensive, though, and bulky, too; plus it needs to be stored indoors when it isn\u2019t being used.",

    "Outdoor cooking has surged in popularity in recent years, with our grilling choices becoming increasingly elaborate. No longer are we restricted to burgers and hot dogs; everything from steaks and ribs to brisket and pizzas have become a staple for outdoor cooking.",
    "The pandemic has certainly helped cement the trend: according to market research firm NPD, consumers spent more than $4.9 billion on outdoor cooking equipment, such as grills and smokers in 2020 \u2013 which is 39% up on 2019.",
    "Ooni, having launched in 2012 as a Kickstarter, is now synonymous with outdoor pizza ovens that use charcoal, wood or gas to cook pizza in no time at all. The Ooni Karu 16 is the brand\u2019s latest top-of-the-range pizza oven.",
    "The multi-fuel outdoor cooking appliance can be used with solid fuels (charcoal and wood), while an add-on also makes it compatible with gas. It has room to hold pizzas up to 16-inch in size \u2013 and, in a first for Ooni, this oven has a hinged glass door so you can keep a check on your pizza to ensure it doesn\u2019t burn.",
    "The pizza oven can reach temperatures of up to 950\u00baF / 500\u00baC, depending upon the type of fuel being used, and heats up in just 15 minutes. A digital thermometer on the front of the oven will display the internal temperature in both Fahrenheit and celsius, so you can instantly see if you need to adjust the airflow in the oven to reach the optimum cooking temperature.",
    "The Ooni Karu 16 is an expensive outdoor cooking appliance, but for those who want to create authentic pizzas in their own home, it\u2019s worth the investment. As well as cooking pizza, the oven can also be used to grill steak and vegetables \u2013 increasing its appeal to those who want to up their outdoor cooking game.",
    "The Ooni Karu 16 is the brand\u2019s newest top-of-the-range outdoor pizza oven and will set you back $799 / \u00a3699 direct from Ooni. It currently isn\u2019t available in Australia.",
    "This model is the most expensive pizza oven that Ooni sells. For those seeking an entry-level model, the Ooni Karu 12 is capable of cooking 12in pizzas and is made from brushed stainless steel. It\u2019s priced at $349 / \u00a3299.",
    "There\u2019s no denying that the Ooni Karu 16 is a bulky appliance, measuring 31.9 x 19.7 x 32.7 inches / 81 x 50 x 83cm and weighing 62.6lb / 28.4kg. It\u2019s designed for use outside.",
    "The oven itself is made from powder-coated carbon steel and stainless steel, and comes complete with a 16.7 x 16.7-inch / 42.42 x 42.42cm pizza stone that\u2019s 0.6-inch / 0.15cm thick. It can comfortably hold pizzas up to 16 inches in size. It has three fold-out legs to raise it 4.9 inches / 12.5 cm off the surface on which it\u2019s placed, while the plastic feet on the bottom of the legs ensure it remains stable during use.",
    "As already mentioned, the oven can be used with charcoal, wood or a combination of the two. Alternatively, it will also work with the Ooni gas burner, which is an additional extra that will set you back $149.99 / \u00a379.99. When it comes to cooking temperatures, the Karu 16 is capable of reaching up to 950\u00baF / 500\u00baC. However, this is only possible if it\u2019s used with wood or gas. If you use charcoal then the oven will reach only 572\u00baF / 300\u00baC. A digital thermostat that attaches to the front of the pizza oven allows you to check the current temperature of the oven.",
    "The Ooni Karu 16\u2019s hinged glass oven door uses the brand\u2019s own ViewFlame technology to maintain temperature, while also allowing you to keep an eye on your pizza while it\u2019s cooking. The appliance comes bundled with an assembly manual and an essentials guide that offers cooking tips and recipes.",
    "For further tips and tricks, download the Ooni app, which is available for iOS and Android. It also offers a selection of videos and even more recipes to help you get the most out of your pizza oven.",
    "We found the Ooni Karu 16 relatively easy to set up. It does require some assembly, but the instruction manual guides you through every step, with the help of clear diagrams. We were impressed that Ooni even includes a compact screwdriver, so there\u2019s no need to track down one that fits the super-small screws on the back of the digital thermostat.",
    "Following Ooni\u2019s pizza dough recipe, we prepared a batch of three 16in pizza bases and set to work topping them with our favorite ingredients. For me, this meant recreating my favorite dish from UK pizza chain Pizza Express - Pollo Ad Astra, which has chicken breast, red onions and piquant peppers, along with a pinch of cajun seasoning. We also made a margarita and garlic pizza bread.",
    "We found it easy to fill the cooking grate with fuel, following the advice in the accompanying booklet, and were impressed to see that it took just 15 minutes for the digital thermometer to reach 950\u00baF / 500\u00baC when we used wood as the oven\u2019s fuel. We also used charcoal when testing the oven, and here the thermometer didn\u2019t rise above 572\u00baF / 300\u00baC.",
    "Ooni says the sweet spot for cooking pizzas is 850\u00baF / 450\u00baC. We were able to ensure the oven\u2019s temperature remained at this level by closing the ceiling vents to slow heat escape. In instances when the temperature dropped too low, opening the ceiling vents and the chimney baffle increased the air flow and raised the temperature.",
    "Note that you will need a pizza peel \u2013 which looks like a large baking tray with a big handle \u2013 to \u2018launch\u2019 your pizza into the oven, as well as rotate it every 20-30 seconds and retrieve it once it\u2019s cooked. The window made it easy to see if our pizza required rotating sooner because the crust was burning. After 60 seconds, the pizza was evenly browned, with a crisp, crunchy crust but moist toppings. Quite frankly, it was delicious.",
    "While we found the glass door useful for checking on our pizzas, if we\u2019re being really picky, we did find that it became dirty very quickly. We appreciate that it\u2019s par for the course when cooking with these fuels, but we\u2019re not fans of having to clean appliances more than is necessary. Since the door must be lifted up first (the hooks on the hinge aren\u2019t connected to the pins on the front of the oven), it\u2019s a little fiddly to open \u2013 especially on the first use, as it\u2019s natural to want to pull the handle straight down. However, it didn\u2019t take too long to become used to this way of opening the pizza oven.",
    "While Ooni says the oven can be left outside, it recommends bringing it indoors when it isn\u2019t in use. During testing, it took around 90 minutes for the appliance to cool down enough so we were able to move it.",
    "Cleaning the Karu 16 is simple \u2013 just wipe it over with dry paper towels after each use, and use soap and water to clean the glass door. Ooni also recommends the pizza stone should be flipped over after one use, so next time it\u2019s used, the heat will burn off any food remnants on the underside of the stone.",
