  "summary": "The Turtle Beach Battle Buds prove you can\u2019t argue with value",
  "verdict": "The Turtle Beach Battle Buds are music to a Nintendo Switch player\u2019s ears (no pun intended). Portable, easy to use, and offering great value for more, these plucky little wired buds dominate the market at this wallet-friendly price point. Sure, they\u2019re not going to deliver headset-quality sound (and they may not look amazing), but if you need some headphones to keep in your Switch case for hassle-free travel or commute gaming, these little darlings are essential.",
  "pros": [
    "Remarkable value",
    "Easy to store and use on-the-go",
    "Flimsy, but useful, detachable mic"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Sound is as basic as it gets",
    "Unstylish",
    "Mic can be overly sensitive"
  ],

    "Perhaps the best thing about the Turtle Beach Battle Buds is the versatility: you can plug the weird-looking Buds into practically anything you play games on. Though primarily targeted at the Nintendo Switch and mobile platforms, the Battle Buds can be used with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5 and beyond \u2013 anything with a headphone jack, basically.",
    "So if you\u2019re something of a \u2018grazer\u2019 when it comes to gaming (you know, having your main meal at home on your PS5 before having a little Nintendo Switch snack on the train), the buds are going to be your best friend.",
    "Oddly, for such a slight bit of hardware, the earbuds are loaded with a powerful frequency response \u2013 and actually produce such aggressive high-end and sharp sounds that it can be uncomfortable if you\u2019re playing something with a lot of treble mix. The bass response is fine \u2013 just fine \u2013 but then you shouldn\u2019t be expecting some sort of dedicated bass response in little buds like this anyway. The sound stage is good enough to tell you what\u2019s going on in a game at any given time, but don\u2019t get into anything particularly competitive with these guys jammed in your ears.",
    "If you want to take control of your games\u2019 audio, you\u2019ve got a couple of useful options \u2013 in-line controls for volume, muting functionality, and multifunction support on mobile devices can\u2019t be sniffed at, especially considering it\u2019s a simple \u2018plug and play\u2019 setup. The detachable boom mic is a nice touch\u2026 though we\u2019d wager any self-respecting adult wouldn\u2019t want to wear it outside the comfort of their own homes.",
    "If you\u2019re not using these buds for music \u2013 weedy bass and aggressive treble aren\u2019t a music-lovers dream, to be honest \u2013 these buds are fine. They offer control, present game audio in a cheap and cheerful manner, and won\u2019t break the bank. For an entry-level accessory, you can\u2019t really ask for more.",
    "The Turtle Beach Battle Buds are available from $30 / \u00a325 / AU$45 and are available now. This comfortably fits into the budget end of the headset spectrum: the closest other headset you\u2019ll find in that bracket is the Turtle Beach Recon 70N, and the Corsair HS50 Stereo Gaming Headset will be another step up from that (though we\u2019d wager it\u2019s money well-spent). The Turtle Beach Battle Buds can be plugged into any 3.5mm audio jack, and as such is compatible with PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",
    "What you see is what you get with these buds \u2013 but that\u2019s not a bad thing. Less moving parts means less to go wrong, after all. We\u2019ve put these buds through their paces and moved them from machine to machine, home to commute, office to bedroom, and they still work just as well as they ever did. You\u2019d think that 1m cable might get bent out of shape or end up patching out sound, but it\u2019s a durable bit of kit \u2013 as is the rest of the design.",
    "A control box along the left-hand wire allows you to control the volume, and a mic mute button that\u2019s sometimes a touch fiddly to find in a pinch can be found there, too. If you\u2019re one of the mythical, lesser-seen people that gives a singular hoot about Google Assistant, you\u2019ll find a button for that on the back, too. That button \u2013 honestly \u2013 is more hassle than it\u2019s worth and has taken us away from the Genshin Impact phone app and into the Assistant app more times than we\u2019d care to mention. Butterfingers, beware.",
    "The big, shield-like triangles aren\u2019t pretty, but they are clever: these lil\u2019 chunks of plastic house the 10mm drivers that power the not-unimpressive sound the Buds can throw out. They\u2019re heavy, which is why those awkward little rubber scaffolds are attached to the inserts, so don\u2019t plan on keeping these in for hours and hours at a time. The aesthetic trade-off, for the sound, is worth it.",
    "What you really care about when it comes to budget gear like this is how well it can perform its primary duty: when it comes to gaming, these Buds are great. Play a shooter, and you\u2019ll hear shots and footsteps where you need to. The detail won\u2019t be as clear as it would in a headset, but then you\u2019re not spending $300 \u2013 you\u2019re spending $30. You can make out nice OSTs running the background of your favorite RPG, and even if the bass response is anemic and the treble a bit too aggressive, everything sounds fine. You can wrap your ears around a game with these things in, and that\u2019s what matters.",
    "If you\u2019re playing on a serious console, you\u2019ll likely notice some pretty severe echo in chat over PSN and Xbox Live thanks to the services\u2019 lack of post-processing, and you\u2019ll lose a fair amount of ambient noise in your big, atmospheric RPGs too \u2013 but then that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, given the price. Whack a retro game, or a port of something from the PS2/PS3 era on your Switch, pop these Buds in your ears and you\u2019ll be fine. Just try not to play any audio/visual masterpieces on the bus and you\u2019ll get the most bang for your buck.",
    "Here\u2019s where buds can come a bit unstuck: the mic is remarkably sensitive and picks up a lot of ambient noise, your breathing, and even the boom brushing against your skin. The extra 4g of weight that the little mic adds can be a bit too heavy for the buds on either side of your head, and may cause it to sag and pull against your each a bit (especially if you have those rubber hooks equipped).",
    "The mic is a nice add-on \u2013 and can be used to shout obscenities at your teammates if absolutely necessary if you\u2019re playing something competitive in Switch \u2013 but it\u2019s not a selling point for these Buds; it\u2019s an add-on, at best. You\u2019re probably better off picking up on of the fully-fledged headsets up top if you\u2019re looking for something that can handle chat."
