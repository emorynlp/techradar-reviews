  "verdict": "Is a gaming monitor with an ergonomic mount and extended colour coverage a niche proposition? Yes \u2013 but if it ticks your boxes, then there\u2019s nothing quite like it.",
  "pros": [
    "Nice 1440p 144Hz IPS panel",
    "Excellent response",
    "Highly adaptable ergo mount"

  "cons": [
    "No USB-C",
    "Limited colour space presets",
    "Not a true HDR panel"

    "Ultimately, the LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A is probably a monitor you never knew you needed. But take it for a spin and you might well be convinced. We just wish it included USB-C connectivity to sweeten its long-term appeal.",
    "If you thought you\u2019d seen it all before, the new LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A gaming monitor would care for a word. This 27-inch IPS model takes the popular 1440p 144Hz gaming formula and adds a productivity twist. At what cost? Around \u00a3398 in the UK or AU$680. The LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A isn\u2019t available in the US, but you can pick up the very similar LG 27GN880-B for $397.",
    "That\u2019s cheaper than the admittedly higher refresh rate Samsung G7, but more expensive than the LG Class UltraGear 27GL850-B, which lacks the ergo arm but is otherwise comparable.",
    "The LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A sports an ergonomic stand that clamps to surfaces and table tops, offering a very wide range of articulation. It also comes with 98% coverage of the DCI-P3 colour space, which is more than that offered by conventional gaming panels.",
    "Speaking of the gaming feature set, the 144Hz refresh rate 1440p LG Nano IPS panel is rated at 1ms for pixel response. That\u2019s 1ms gray-to-gray response, not the more problematical MPRT metric. LG reckons it\u2019s comparable with the best TN panels for sheer speed. We\u2019ll see about that. There\u2019s also HDR10 signal decoding (although limited actual HDR performance), while both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync adaptive refresh are supported.",
    "As for what the LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A doesn\u2019t have, USB-C is conspicuous by its absence. This is a pity given that this is a monitor that majors on clean ergonomics, in part thanks to clever cable management that routes through the body of the stand. It\u2019s also missing colour space presets for productivity, with sRGB the only pre-baked option. Given the DCI-P3 coverage, it will likely calibrate well. But some users would appreciate more presets.",
    "But what about gaming? Rated at 350 nits, this isn\u2019t the punchiest display \u2013 not in this era of eye-searing HDR panels. Nevertheless, it has enough juice for SDR gaming. More importantly, the pixel response is great. Three levels of pixel overdrive have been included in the LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A\u2019s OSD menu.",
    "Forget the fastest setting; it comes with unspeakable levels of hideous overshoot. However, the middle setting is perfect. It\u2019s seriously nippy, lending games those crisp, clear visuals indicative of a super-fast panel. Is it up there with the very best TN screens for speed? Not quite, but it comes very, very close.",
    "Elsewhere, the 144Hz refresh rate is a good fit with the 1440p native resolution, especially in the current context where new high-end graphics cards cost about the same as a private Caribbean island. We\u2019re also pleasantly surprised by the LG UltraGear Ergo 27GN88A\u2019s HDR performance.",
    "Okay, so this panel isn't bright enough to deliver true HDR performance and it lacks local dimming. But HDR content looks better than the same content coded in SDR, which isn\u2019t always the case. What\u2019s more, SDR content looks just dandy when HDR is enabled in Windows. So it\u2019s actually viable to leave HDR enabled on the desktop. That's unusual.",
    "As for that \u2018ergo\u2019 stand, it will clamp onto any surface up to 3.5 inches thick, offers 280 degrees of swivel, 18cm of extension / retraction, plus it can pivot into portrait mode. Nice."
