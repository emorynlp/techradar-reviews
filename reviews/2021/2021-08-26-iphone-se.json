  "verdict": "This is the phone to get if you just want a iPhone that will last you a few years, but don\u2019t want to pay a lot for it. It might not be the newest model any more but the iPhone SE 2020 offers \u2018decent but not top-end\u2019 performance: a good camera, enough power, a great App Store to plunder and a lighter iPhone than most recent models. Battery life and screen tech could be better, the headphone jack is a miss, but - for the price - this is one of the best iPhones Apple has ever made. Even now.",

    "The iPhone SE 2020 was built around one goal: to launch an iPhone for less money than ever, and it achieved that well. For just $399 / \u00a3389 / AU$679 you can have a brand-new handset from Apple \u2013 it\u2019s one of the best iPhones ever created and you can pick one up for less than half the price of a new flagship phone.",
    "The design of the phone is going to be familiar to anyone that\u2019s used an iPhone recently \u2013 unless you\u2019ve not held a handset from Apple since 2013, you\u2019ll have seen this 4.7-inch frame before, complete with bezels top and bottom and a home button with a fingerprint scanner built in.",
    "This isn't the newest smartphone from Apple - that's the iPhone 13 series, including that phone, the iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. You can find reviews for each of them by clicking the linked names, but they're all pricier and more premium devices than the SE.",
    "The iPhone SE (2020) is seen as the \u2018smaller\u2019 iPhone form factor given the all-screen designs of the more recent models, and it\u2019s both more lightweight and pocketable than any other modern Apple phone besides the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini, which are marginally smaller (despite packing in a larger screen), but also pricier than a mid-range phone.",
    "The SE is pleasingly water resistant, but does have some drawbacks: it lacks a headphone jack at the bottom, and because the display technology is slightly dated (as it comes from the iPhone 8) it can suffer in bright light when you\u2019re trying to watch videos or the like.",
    "Apple might have stuck with the same design as the iPhone 8, but the innards are much improved \u2013 notably the new A13 Bionic chipset inside, which adds speed nearly everywhere and really does improve the performance over the older 4.7-inch models. It\u2019s not quite at the level of the iPhone 12 range, but it\u2019s not far off \u2013 and getting the recent silicon means the iPhone SE has years of iOS updates head of it.",
    "That A13 chipset has improved the camera performance too, despite no discernible change to the specs of the sensor since the iPhone 8 (there\u2019s just a single lens on the iPhone SE 2020).",
    "It takes decent, bright photos that will please most people, although it doesn\u2019t quite offer the same color reproduction or clarity as the iPhone 11 Pro Max, for example, let alone the iPhone 12 Pro Max or iPhone 13 Pro Max.",
    "The portrait mode doesn\u2019t work as well as on phones that pack a second, depth-sensing sensor for precise bokeh effects , and as a result you can be left with some odd-looking fringing around the edges of subjects. But overall the camera \u2013 and especially for the price \u2013 takes impressive pictures in most scenarios.",
    "Battery life is probably one of the biggest issues we found with the iPhone SE 2020 \u2013 it\u2019s not going to easily last you a day unless you\u2019re a light and sedate user.",
    "Given the number of power-hungry apps available that will make the most of all that power provided by the A13 chipset, we would have liked to have seen at least an all-day battery in there, even for the lower price.",
    "However, don\u2019t let that detract from the fact that the iPhone SE 2020 follows on from its predecessor by bringing you a new iPhone, with not a lot of compromise, for less money than you might expect.",
    "While it doesn\u2019t hit many heights in terms of power or performance, it more than offsets that by being the cheapest iPhone Apple has ever launched while still packing refined and useful hardware, making the new iPhone SE a splendid option for those either on a budget or just wanting to find an easy route into the Apple ecosystem.",
    "The iPhone SE is available now around the world including the US, UK and Australia. The release date was April 24, 2020, with pre-orders going live the week before.",
    "Although it was rumored to be called the iPhone SE 2, the iPhone SE is the official name that Apple opted for for its 2020 device. You won't see it referred to as the iPhone SE 2020 on Apple's website - that's just our way of distinguishing it from the 2016 device.",
    "The iPhone SE price starts at $399 / \u00a3389 / AU$679, which is a slight price drop in some regions from its launch price of $399 / \u00a3419 / AU$749 / Rs 42,500. The base model comes with 64GB of storage, with 128GB and 256GB models also available for a higher price.",
    "The 128GB model costs $449 / \u00a3439 / AU$759 while the 256GB one costs $549 / \u00a3539 / AU$929.",
    "In the US, Apple is offering the new iPhone SE at $16.62/month through its financing plan or, if you have an older iPhone to trade in, you can get it for less.",
    "The iPhone SE has exactly the same design and display as the iPhone 8 from 2017. Using this form factor and screen hardware allowed Apple to keep the cost of the device as low as it has, as it didn\u2019t need to invest in a whole new manufacturing process.",
    "It feels like the iPhone world has moved on in three years though \u2013 now the 4.7-inch screen with the chunky bezels above and below feels like it belongs to the past.",
    "In that time the flagship iPhone range has moved to an all-screen design \u2013 barring a notch at the top, you\u2019re presented with barely any bezels \u2013 while with more premium aluminum inside, things have got a little weightier in recent years.",
    "So returning to the iPhone 8 design means Apple is bringing back its more lightweight phone, bridging the gap between the older iPhone SE and the behemothic (but impressive) iPhone 11 Pro Max, for example.",
    "Indeed, picking up the new iPhone SE , the first thing you\u2019ll notice is how lightweight it is. Again, some might not notice the change if they\u2019re coming from a smaller phone from 2016/17, but trust us: it could have been a lot worse, as the devices in the newer all-screen iPhone ranges are a lot heavier.",
    "While the iPhone 8\u2019s design might feel like an archaic choice for a new iPhone, it makes a lot of sense in the iPhone SE 2020 \u2013 and for some who don\u2019t particularly care for the latest features, this more familiar design will be a lot more desirable.",
    "One suspects that if Apple had rebooted the original iPhone SE shape, with the smaller 4-inch screen and clickable home button (the new iPhone SE 2020 features a haptic button that doesn\u2019t move), it would still have sold well; but the larger 4.7-inch LCD screen is more useful for today\u2019s apps, which make good use of the extended display.",
    "One thing that many will miss is the 3.5mm headphone jack. We\u2019ve been lamenting its loss for many moons now, but as the original iPhone SE (or other cheaper phones that are 2-3 years old, that you might be upgrading from) had this feature we can see it might still cause consternation.",
    "While some phone buyers might have accepted this loss by now (barely any handsets are being launched with the port now) it might still be something of a shock for those using phones from a few years ago, in spite of the plethora of true wireless earbuds.",
    "Apple has put its EarPods in the iPhone SE box, which use the phone\u2019s Lightning connector in place of the 3.5mm headphone jack, but those who already have wired headphones that they\u2019re happy with will need to spend $9 / \u00a39 / AU$15 on an adapter. Otherwise, you could use a pair of wireless earbuds.",
    "The display on the iPhone SE 2020 might not be the most feature-rich, but it\u2019s fine. Given the target market this phone is aimed at \u2013 those who want a new iPhone, but don\u2019t want to spend a huge amount of money on one \u2013 there\u2019s not really an expectation of a fancy OLED display here.",
    "The resolution of the iPhone SE screen might not be top-end (it\u2019s far less sharp than more recent iPhones, or even a number of cheap Android phones), but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s really that obvious in most use-cases.",
    "The only thing that we would like to see improved is the brightness of the display: in the years since the iPhone 8 launch the color and vividity of the screens on phones has improved hugely, and they appears brighter at default settings \u2013 and forcing the brightness right up has a strong (and negative) effect on the battery life.",
    "That brightness does need to be increased a little too often as well \u2013 there\u2019s no escaping the fact that this is an older display on offer with the iPhone SE 2020, and there were more than a few occasions when we needed to shelter the phone from brighter light to see what was on the screen \u2013 something that isn\u2019t an issue with newer iPhones.",
    "The big change with the iPhone SE 2020 (and we don\u2019t use the italics lightly there) is the upgraded engine from the iPhone 8. While the external design is nigh-on identical, Apple has supercharged the insides, with an improved chipset running the show.",
    "That extra power is designed to allow the new iPhone SE to rival the iPhone 11 range in terms of speed when flipping between apps, and editing snaps and video, and should also improve the camera performance (thanks to upgraded computational power from the new chipset).",
    "Apple looks to have implemented some serious performance improvements while keeping the cost of this phone down, and that impression has been borne out in our experience with the iPhone SE: it matched the iPhone 11 Pro Max for speed when exporting an iMovie, and actually compressed a 1080p four-and-a- half minute video at an almost identical speed.",
    "We compared it to the older iPhone 8 Plus with the same test, and when compressing and exporting a movie down to a smaller size, the iPhone SE 2020 managed the task so much quicker.",
    "If you\u2019re going to tax the phone to its limits, then the iPhone 11 Pro handsets are more able to handle graphically intensive tasks and apps - but even when playing more powerful games like Pascal\u2019s Wager, we didn\u2019t feel the new iPhone SE losing any performance. The average user will notice little difference unless intentionally trying to tax the SE 2020.",
    "Of course, the newer iPhone 12 range has it beat whatever you're doing, thanks to an even newer A14 Bionic chipset, but the iPhone SE 2020 isn't far behind.",
    "What's interesting is the way that the iPhone SE has been 'angled' by Apple in terms of power output. Our benchmark testing showed that the newest iPhone doesn't quite have the raw grunt or speed of the iPhone 11 range, suggesting that Apple is balancing power output with battery performance.",
    "Those benchmark scores saw an almost identical single-core (for low-impact tasks) score of 1300 for the iPhone SE, and 3100 for the multi-core test. That's less than the 3500 for the iPhone 11 Pro range, but not far off the standard iPhone 11.",
    "All the benchmarks we ran painted a similar picture, proving that the iPhone SE 2020 doesn't have the raw grunt of the Pro range, perhaps designed to provide the most battery life possible.",
    "You can see the same thing on the iPhone 11 vs the iPhone 11 Pro - small differences in benchmark scores, likely in a bid to make sure each experience is tailored to different target users.",
    "Those interested in the Pro model will want the absolute max power (which is why there's a larger battery to compensate) but the more 'regular' user might be fine with more of a balance - the new iPhone SE also has 3GB of RAM, rather than the 4GB the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 are packing, likely again to minimize costs.",
    "We experienced very little in the way of slowdown during our time with the new iPhone SE \u2013 apart from in the camera, where the phone took a second or two to process each image we took. That\u2019s not a huge problem in the grand scheme of things, but if you want to instantly check out a snap you\u2019ve taken it takes the shine off somewhat.",
    "It\u2019s hard to know what else to say about the upgraded chipset (which will have an impact on the performance of some apps in the future), but based on side-by-side comparisons we couldn\u2019t fault the power of the new, cheaper iPhone.",
    "The iPhone SE launched with iOS 13.4 on by default, but it's received numerous updates since then, including a major one to iOS 14 and iOS 15 - with the latest available version for the phone at the time of writing being iOS 15.1.",
    "In our view, the make-or-break feature for the iPhone SE \u2013 and so the key focus of this review \u2013 is the iPhone SE camera and how well it performs in day to day use \u2013 given that there\u2019s \u2018old\u2019 hardware on offer here, Apple has taken a gamble that it can improve photo quality using image processing powered by the A13 Bionic chipset.",
    "Spoiler alert: the gamble has paid off handsomely. The new iPhone SE can often stand up to the iPhone 11 Pro Max in terms of general snapping, and only struggles when it comes to the areas where the hardware is lacking.",
    "We\u2019ll explain more about that in a moment, but we\u2019ve compared the iPhone SE 2020 to the iPhone 11 Pro Max, the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 8 Plus, and it holds its own well.",
    "Before we go into more detail about the camera\u2019s performance, let\u2019s look at the hardware: the iPhone SE camera is basically using the same set of lenses, and megapixel count, as the iPhone 8, with a 12MP camera, a six-element lens and a sapphire glass cover for strength.",
    "We don\u2019t know the exact sensor that\u2019s being used - Apple wouldn\u2019t confirm whether it had upgraded the hardware there - but the same 12MP camera and f/1.8 aperture remains, so it seems that there\u2019s very little change to the sensor.",
    "However, Apple has kept the same hardware specs for the \u2018normal\u2019 wide-angle lens on the iPhone range since the iPhone 8, but hugely improved the quality of the pics \u2013 which suggests the processor is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. So just how much difference does imbuing the iPhone SE with the same A13 Bionic chipset, complete with that improved image signal processor inside, make?",
    "The short answer is: a lot. Put photos from the iPhone SE 2020 next to snaps taken with the iPhone 8 Plus, for example, and you can instantly see improved sharpness, more accurate color reproduction, and an overall \u2018better\u2019 photo whether taken in brighter or darker conditions.",
    "Apple\u2019s \u2018tuning\u2019 of images from the new iPhone SE \u2013 the way it thinks a photo should look \u2013 is interesting, with the processing appearing to follow in the footsteps of that in the iPhone 11 range, favoring a cooler-looking scene.",
    "This results in images that look less warm compared to those from even the iPhone XS from 2018 (which, to our eye, are more visually appealing), but the processing does produce snaps with good levels of sharpness and clarity.",
    "In a side-by-side comparison with the iPhone 13 Pro Max, one of the most feature-packed phone Apple has ever created, the iPhone SE doesn\u2019t perform as well\u2026 but that\u2019s understandable for the price. It\u2019s clear that the SE has a tendency towards overexposing in some scenarios, with some of the color and vividness lost in a few pictures.",
    "One in particular saw us having to massively drop the exposure of a nature scene taken under forest cover. Despite the darker conditions, the image was far too bright \u2013 it seemed the new iPhone SE camera was trying too hard to compensate. We often found that the images on the viewfinder were much brighter than in real life, which usually meant we had to tweak the exposure.",
    "However, in a direct comparison with the best iPhone on the market, there wasn\u2019t as much of a difference as the massive gulf in terms of price tag would suggest. You don\u2019t get things like night mode (which is superb, and worth looking into if you\u2019re considering the iPhone 11) or the additional ultra-wide and 2x zoom cameras.",
    "In terms of the image quality you do get, the differences are small, but still there to see. Not all the tricks have come off \u2013 for instance, the depth of field capabilities on the iPhone SE aren\u2019t as strong (due to the aforementioned lack of a depth-sensing lens).",
    "This means portrait mode doesn\u2019t always quite work out the edges of the subject (and it can only manage to use the background defocusing on humans, not on objects).",
    "The new iPhone SE camera will blur around the edges of a subject at times, meaning using one of the smart effects, like Stage Light Mono, look quite strange, with parts of the hair missing at the sides. It\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s not easy to get the smart-looking snaps Apple uses in its marketing.",
    "While any phone that can algorithmically work out a subject using machine smarts alone is impressive, there\u2019s a gulf in quality between a portrait mode photo taken with a phone with two-cameras compared to a single sensor.",
    "Elsewhere, the low-light detail isn\u2019t as robust, and the color reproduction is behind that of the behemothic iPhone 11 Pro Max or above.",
    "But when you consider the relative cost of the phones, and the fact that the new iPhone SE is about a third of the price of the 11 Pro Max, it\u2019s easy to forgive some of these mild deficiencies, and instead be impressed that Apple has managed to improve things so well just by putting a new engine inside what is in many respects an old handset.",
    "The front-facing camera, a 7MP affair, has also been given smarter capabilities: you\u2019re able to take the aforementioned portrait mode pictures, meaning the background blurs away and you can arrest the world with only your dazzling features.",
    "There\u2019s no \u2018slofie\u2019 (read: slow-motion selfie video) option here, and we can\u2019t say we miss it \u2013 although that may just be because we\u2019re still slightly sickened by the invention of the word \u2018slofie\u2019.",
    "The quality of the images is good \u2013 they\u2019re sharp and clean, and even look decent in low-light too. Apple has applied its photography algorithms well here, and improved the capability of the front-facing camera to take smooth, well-lit photos.",
    "Again, using any of the portrait mode options will mostly lead to a closely-cropped image, with hair looking somewhat unnatural or blurred \u2013 but standard selfies come out well.",
    "In terms of video too, the overall power of the iPhone SE 2020 is as good as anything Apple is offering elsewhere in its lineup: you can shoot 4K video at up to 60 frames per second (fps).",
    "The 60fps option should only be used in good light though, as movies will look dark in lower light. The slickness of the footage looks a bit odd \u2013 it almost looks too slick \u2013 but it gives a nicer look for fast-moving scenes.",
    "The new iPhone SE battery size hasn\u2019t been announced by Apple (it never reveals this spec), but we do know that the iPhone 8 came with a 1,821mAh power pack, and we anticipate something similar for the iPhone SE 2020.",
    "And if that is indeed the case then it\u2019s a potential issue, because the iPhone 8 didn\u2019t have stellar battery life \u2013 it could just about last a day in normal use, with the charger needing to be in reach towards the end of the evening.",
    "The new iPhone SE should, in theory, have a longer-lasting battery as it\u2019s got a more efficient engine at its heart, and iOS 13.4 is better at managing power consumption.",
    "However, Apple says the iPhone SE \u201clasts about the same as iPhone 8\u201d, which is surprising and suggests that you should see about 2-4 hours\u2019 less battery life in normal use than an iPhone 11, and up to 25 hours less if just using the iPhone for audio.",
    "In practical use, we saw a mixed performance from the new iPhone in terms of battery life: it certainly wasn\u2019t in the same power-use bracket as the impressive iPhone XR and iPhone 11 range, and we found ourselves having to regularly reach for the charger in the evening.",
    "However, on low-usage days, where we didn\u2019t use the iPhone for a heavy amount of photography or web browsing, we got to the end of the day with over 30% left in the tank, and we saw little power-drain overnight too, suggesting that the iPhone SE is pretty power-efficient in standby mode.",
    "You'll get around 5% performance drain overnight depending on what devices you have linked via Bluetooth (we had two wearables linked, which caused more of a drop.",
    "But, overall, we felt that the iPhone SE was indeed a throwback to the older, 4.7-inch iPhone models, where it just felt like the power pack inside wasn\u2019t big enough to comfortably last the day \u2013 we definitely didn\u2019t have the confidence in this handset that we\u2019ve come to enjoy with more recent iPhones.",
    "However, if you\u2019re coming from an original iPhone SE or older iPhone model you won\u2019t notice any issue (and you\u2019ll probably see a slight improvement) \u2013 it\u2019s just a shame that this feels like an opportunity to improve things that Apple has surprisingly missed.",
    "One way of alleviating this issue is to invest in a fast charger. Anything with USB-C PD or 18W power delivery (such as the charger that comes in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro and is available for an extra $29 / \u00a329 / AU$49) will charge the phone rapidly \u2013 we\u2019re talking getting you from empty to over 50% in around 30 minutes.",
    "The overall charging speed is around one hour and 50 minutes for a full, dead-to-100% recharge, but the 5W charger that comes in the box will be a lot slower. We\u2019d suggest picking up a fast iPhone charger from Apple or Anker to suit your speedier charging needs.",
    "Then again you could buy a wireless charger instead, as the iPhone SE 2020 is Qi-charging enabled. Grab a cheap wireless pad or two, for home and when (eventually) at work, and you\u2019ll never have an issue with power levels again.",
    "It\u2019s not ideal \u2013 we\u2019d rather the iPhone could just easily last a day without you needing to reach for the charger, giving you some breathing room going into the next day or in case of emergency, but that\u2019s not the case here for some reason.",
