    "A second plan, offers the same software and hardware at a one-off fee of $999. You\u2019ll also get a free chip card reader, a two-year hardware warranty, and a lifetime POS software license.",
    "You can purchase additional hardware like tablets with charging docks, barcode and label printers, and other accessories. The prices of these items are not listed on the site, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.",

    "POS Nation also offers a unique mix-and-match pricing feature that allows you to create and sell grouped items and product bundles. This can help you increase sales and get rid of items that have long been sitting in your inventory.",
    "Like most POS service providers, POS Nation\u2019s system allows your staff to clock in and out for you to track their working hours.

A blind counts feature also hides from employees how much cash is in the cash drawer at any point in time.",
    "This level of control is extended to POS Nation\u2019s customer management tools. The service\u2019s built-in customer management program records your customer\u2019s data and purchase history for you to provide better customer service and create loyalty programs.

You\u2019ll be able to access business reports, graphs, and charts at any time of the day.

Its software has a clean interface and you can easily attach photographs to items for easy viewing. Your employees can use graphical buttons and customized departments to categorize your items to streamline their workflow.",
    "POS Nation\u2019s mobile dashboard on the backend is similarly intuitive. On its uncluttered interface, you\u2019ll find easy-to-read charts and graphs of sales data broken down by department, by hour, or by item.",
    "Customers subscribed to a Flex Monthly plan are granted 24/7 phone and email support. Users subscribed to the Freedom plan can pay $39.99/month for this priority support. Otherwise, the Freedom Plan only comes with three months of support during business hours.",

    "Instead, they are encrypted at the pinpad and passed directly to the processor for authorization. In other words, sensitive information is never stored in the database.",
    "POS Nation\u2019s lack of third-party integrations might leave some business owners disappointed. If this is you, consider Brilliant POS or Lightspeed POS, both of which seamlessly integrate with a large selection of third-party apps. With Brilliant POS, however, you\u2019ll have to spend some time navigating complicated pricing plans.",
    "Lightspeed POS plans are much more straightforward and feature the same level of customization as POS Nation, but a lower price\u2014the cheapest plan is $69/month.",
    "As an all-in-one retail POS provider, POS Nation offers straightforward pricing plans, comprehensive customer support, and a great range of features packed within a secure and intuitive interface.",
