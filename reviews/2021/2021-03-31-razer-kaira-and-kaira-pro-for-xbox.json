  "verdict": "The Razer Kaira and Kaira Pro are solid, mid-range headsets custom-built for the Xbox Series X and Xbox One. They offer a powerful (and detachable) noise-cancelling microphone and colorful RGB lighting, but their plastic construction and so-so audio performance prevent them from overtaking the new Xbox Wireless Headset as our favorite Xbox Series X headset.",

    "Razer might be known as one of the premier PC peripheral manufacturers, but the company\u2019s not afraid to dabble in console accessories, too. Just take a look at the new Razer Kaira and Razer Kaira Pro Gaming Headsets for Xbox. With built-in Xbox Wireless support, the headsets work natively with the whole suite of Xbox consoles \u2013 from Xbox One to the new Xbox Series X \u2013 adding one more headset to gamers\u2019 arsenals.",
    "Despite what their names might suggest, the only difference between the Razer Kaira Pro and the regular Kaira is that the former supports Bluetooth 5.0 while the latter does not. That means the Kaira Pro can connect to PC, Macs and mobile phones over Bluetooth, but both require a separate dongle to connect to the Razer Headset Setup for Xbox app on PC for full customization options.",
    "Thankfully, the headsets have an exceptional detachable microphone that sounds great and the side RGB lighting definitely has a strong visual appeal. Plus, thanks to their foam earpads, they\u2019re also pretty comfortable as well.",
    "Otherwise, however, there\u2019s nothing really special about them: their 50mm drivers sound fine, but not amazing; the construction is lightweight but also mostly plastic. Those aren\u2019t exactly deal-breakers \u2013 and even help to make the Razer Kaira a decent alternative to rival headsets from Turtle Beach \u2013 but they prevent the Kaira and Kaira Pro from winning top accolades and a spot on our list of the best Xbox Series X headsets.",
    "Razer released both the Kaira and Kaira Pro in November 2020, right around the same time as the launch of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles.",
    "In terms of price, you\u2019re looking at $99 (\u00a399, AU$169) for the Razer Kaira that only supports the Xbox Wireless connection and $149 (\u00a3149, AU$259) for the Razer Kaira Pro that supports both the Xbox Wireless connection and Bluetooth.",
    "While that\u2019s a great price for a wireless headset, it puts the Razer Kaira squarely up against the new Xbox Wireless Headset from Microsoft, which we absolutely loved for its stellar audio reproduction capabilities. The Razer Kaira Pro feels a decent value as well, but we feel that other headsets like the Steelseries Arctis 9X offers more for just a little more money.",
    "The Razer Kaira is pretty sleek\u2026 for a gaming headset. With a black and green color scheme and RGB lighting on the sides of the earcups, it\u2019s definitely got that gamer aesthetic \u2013 so much so that you wouldn\u2019t want to wear it anywhere else outside of your house \u2013 but it\u2019s not an awful look by any stretch of the imagination.",
    "In terms of construction, the Razer Kaira is mostly plastic with the exception of a thin metal band that runs through the bridge of the headset. What that means is that the bridge is fairly sturdy, but the joints themselves are plastic and are more likely to be prone to snapping. That\u2019s not exactly what you want to hear when you\u2019re buying a $149 headset, but that\u2019s what Razer went with here.",
    "The good news is that, because it\u2019s mostly plastic, it\u2019s a fairly light headset at only 293g for the regular Kaira and 330g for the Razer Kaira Pro. That lightweight design, alongside the memory foam padding and cloth earpad coverings, really makes the headsets soft and comfortable to wear for an extended period of time.",
    "Speaking of the earcups, each one comes with its own set of controls. On the left you\u2019ve got a mic mute switch, volume wheel and power button; on the right you\u2019ve got the Xbox pairing button, chat/game volume balancer and the Bluetooth pairing button (exclusive to Kaira Pro).",
    "The only port on the headset is for a USB-C charging cable that you can also use to connect the headset to your PC for firmware updates \u2013 but that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no 3.5mm audio jack on either headset, which means you can\u2019t run them wired.",
    "Last but not least, there\u2019s the detachable, ambient noise-reducing microphone that makes you sound great. To detach, all you need to do is pull on it, and then you can reattach at any time by simply plugging it back in.",
    "In terms of tonal balance and overall audio quality, the Razer Kaira and Kaira Pro lie somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. To wit, the headset doesn\u2019t focus much on treble or bass and instead homes in on the mids to make dialogue come through crystal clear. The result is a headset that sounds fine, but not dynamic, spacious or full of detail.",
    "We played a few different games with the Kaira Pro including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order from Xbox Game Pass and competitive shooter staple, Overwatch. In both cases we were able to hear some nice details in the ambient sounds and a few positional audio cues, but everything lacked a level of precision we\u2019ve heard on other headsets.",
    "For music and movies, the Kaira and Kaira Pro are good but not great. You\u2019ll notice that focus on the midrange that you\u2019ll hear when paired with consoles and even a little bit of bass response, but it\u2019s lacking details you\u2019d hear with a pair of proper over-ear headphones.",
    "The good news is that, while their audio reproduction skills aren\u2019t great, they do make you sound great to others thanks to Razer\u2019s HyperClear Cardioid microphone. The mic does an exceptional job picking up your voice and radically reduces the amount of ambient noise that comes through on the other end. To put it to the test we called someone with music playing in the background. The person on the other end, surprisingly said they couldn\u2019t hear anything besides our voice coming through the mic.",
    "While the microphone was a particular highlight, the Kaira\u2019s battery life is just so-so. Razer says the Kaira can get up to 20 hours of playback if you turn off the RGB lighting \u2013 something you\u2019ll need the Razer Headset Setup for Xbox app to do \u2013 you\u2019ll most likely get around 15 hours or less. Worse, because there\u2019s no real battery indicator over Bluetooth, you can\u2019t see how much battery the headset is down to until you start hearing low-battery warning beeps.",
    "Speaking of beeps, if you connect the headset to both your console and a Bluetooth device, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll hear them beep incessantly. Despite being charged and connected over Bluetooth, the Razer Kaira Pro would give us a warning beep every minute or so to tell us that something wasn\u2019t right when paired to both devices. As it turns out, because our Xbox was in the living room and the PC was in the office, the headset beeps to let you know that you\u2019re nearly out of range \u2013 which, apparently, is only about 20 feet or so.",
    "This is a common problem with other Razer devices, according to the Razer Forums, and has even been noted in other reviews. Of course, not everyone is going to be affected by this problem \u2013 as long as you keep whatever Bluetooth device you have connected close to the Xbox and the headset you should be fine \u2013 but it\u2019s an annoying caveat."
