  "summary": "Is Ring\u2019s third version of its battery-powered video doorbell the best smart doorbell you can buy?",
  "verdict": "On the surface, the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus seems to offer few improvements over its predecessor. However, under-the-hood tweaks means it\u2019s faster to launch a livestream from your smartphone, there are fewer false positives when it comes to motion detection, and its pre-roll feature lets you view the four seconds of footage before motion is detected, making it easier to identify what caused an alert. It retains the clear, sharp audio and video too.",
  "pros": [
    "Records clear and sharp video and audio",
    "Can be battery-powered or wired",
    "Works with Amazon Echo smart speakers"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No free video storage",
    "Pre-roll video is black and white and doesn\u2019t include audio",
    "Larger than the average doorbell"

    "The Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus is the third version of Ring\u2019s smart doorbell that lets you see and speak to anyone on your doorstep. If you\u2019re looking to put an end to missed deliveries, or want to avoid cold-callers, this could be the smart doorbell for you.",
    "Like all of the best video doorbells, as well as alerting you via the smartphone app when the doorbell has been pressed, it will also notify you of any motion detected on your driveway. The doorbell\u2019s camera has a 160-degree field of view which results in a slight fisheye effect, both when viewing a livestream from the doorbell or playing back recorded footage, although this doesn\u2019t detract from the clear and detailed Full HD color video the doorbell captures. Night vision means video recorded after dark is also clear and easy to see, although it\u2019s in black and white rather than color.",
    "UPDATE: Ring has recently launched the Ring Video Doorbell 4 - an incremental update on the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus, that stores the pre-roll video ( four seconds of video captured before motion detection was activated) in color rather than black and white. It's available to buy now for $199.99 / \u00a3179 / AU$329 and we'll be putting it to the test very soon.",
    "Like the Ring Video Doorbell 2 (launched in 2017), the Doorbell 3 Plus can be wired in place of an existing doorbell or used as a battery-operated doorbell. The battery is removable, which means you don\u2019t have to take the entire doorbell off the wall to recharge it. If you\u2019ve chosen a wired installation, the doorbell will trigger an existing chime in your home, if you have one. If you\u2019re using the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus on batterypower, you\u2019ll need to purchase the Ring Chime ($29.99 / \u00a329.99 / AU$59) or Ring Chime Pro ($49.99 / \u00a349.99 / AU$79) if you want to hear a sound inside your home when the doorbell is pressed. It\u2019s not the smallest of doorbells, at more than three times the size of many traditional wired doorbells, and it won\u2019t fit on most door frames.",
    "It builds on the Ring Video Doorbell 2 with support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, which should bring an end to the connection issues that have plagued some users, in particular those with slower broadband. It\u2019s also the only Ring video doorbell that comes with a \u2018pre-roll\u2019 feature. This stores the four seconds of black-and-white video that were captured before motion detection was activated to help you identify exactly what triggered the alert. There\u2019s no audio on these clips, and the feature only works in good lighting conditions, so while footage after dark is saved, we found it was extremely hard to see.",
    "As Ring is an Amazon-owned company, the doorbell is fully integrated with Alexa. If you have an Amazon Echo in the house, you can set it to announce when the doorbell is pressed or motion is detected. You can converse with anyone on the doorstep through Echo smart speakers too, and view the doorbell\u2019s live feed on Echo Show devices \u2013 you can even set up your Echo Show to automatically display the doorbell\u2019s video feed as soon as it's pressed.",
    "At $229.99 / \u00a3199.99 / AU$369 it\u2019s not the cheapest smart doorbell on the market, especially when you factor in the monthly \u00a32.50 / $3 / AU$4 cost for subscribing to Ring Protect, but it\u2019s certainly one of the most flexible and simple to install.",
    "The Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus is positioned as Ring\u2019s mid-range video doorbell, sitting between the newly-updated original Ring Video Doorbell, and the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 and the Ring Video Doorbell Elite. It\u2019s \u00a320 more expensive than the Ring Video Doorbell 2, which cost \u00a3179.99 at launch, however, this model has now been discontinued. There\u2019s no denying the Doorbell 3 Plus is one of the more expensive smart doorbells available, although it does offer the flexibility of wired or wireless installation, and a clear Full HD stream (the majority of other battery-powered smart doorbells currently only record in 720p).",
    "To get the most out of the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus you\u2019ll need to subscribe to Ring Protect. This subscription service stores video captured by the doorbell, securely online for up to 30 days. Prices start from $3 / \u00a32.50 /AU$4 per month or $30 / \u00a324.99 / AU$40 for a year - you do get a 30-day free trial of Ring Protect included with the doorbell. If you opt to battery-power the doorbell, you\u2019ll need a Ring Chime if you want to hear a sound in your home when the doorbell is pressed. There are two versions available; the Ring Chime, which costs $29.99 / \u00a329.99 / AU$59, and the Ring Chime Pro, which doubles as a Wi-Fi extender, and is priced at $49.99/ \u00a349.99/ AU$79.",
    "Even though it\u2019s bigger than your average doorbell, measuring 5.1 x 2.4 x 1.1 in (128 x 62 x 28mm), the stylish design of the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus means it doesn\u2019t look obtrusive. It comes with two interchangeable face-plates in silver and dark grey, although other colors \u2013 including gold if you like a bit of bling on your front door \u2013, are available to buy for $14.99 / \u00a313.99 / AUS$25 from the Ring website.",
    "The doorbell is relatively simple to install. You\u2019ll need to download the free Ring app, which is available for iOS and Android, and create an account, then follow the instructions in the app, which guides you through every step of the install process. Ring has even included the correct size drill bit and a miniature spirit level in the pack, so you have everything you need to get started.",
    "As we\u2019ve already highlighted it can be hard-wired or used on batterypower. If it\u2019s hard-wired the LED around the doorbell\u2019s button glows white permanently, and switches to blue when the doorbell is pressed. However, if it\u2019s being used on batterypower, the LED doesn\u2019t illuminate unless the doorbell is pressed. If you opt for battery-power, while the doorbell itself will make a sound, we found we were unable to hear this in the house. This is where the optional Ring Chime comes in (\u00a329.99) as it plugs into a power socket in your home and connects to the doorbell over Wi-Fi, when the doorbell is pressed it plays a tone to indicate someone is on the doorstep.",
    "The doorbell has a security screw in the bottom that secures the faceplate to the body of the doorbell, and can only be removed by a unique type of screwdriver (included in the box). This reduces the likelihood of anyone removing the battery rendering the doorbell useless, and Ring also promises that if the doorbell is stolen, as long as you can provide a crime reference number, it will replace the doorbell free of charge.",
    "In a first for Ring, the doorbell works on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands, which should ensure it takes less time from tapping the notification to being able to see who\u2019s on your doorstep.",
    "The Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus is simple to use. You\u2019ll get a notification on your smartphone when the doorbell is pressed, and a tone from your home's existing Chime if the doorbell is wired. If you're using batterypower and have the optional Ring Chime, that will play a tone. If you tap the notification, you\u2019ll be able to activate \u2018live view\u2019. In this mode, you can see and converse with anyone on your doorstep. We found it took just a couple of seconds between tapping the notification and \u2018live view\u2019 being activated. The video and audio from the live stream was clear and we found conversing with anyone on the doorstep was natural and with very little distortion, although we were unable to see the full length of the person on our doorstep. The doorbell records video once the doorbell has been pressed too, so if you\u2019re unable to answer at the time, you can go back and view the video at a later time, providing you\u2019ve subscribed to Ring Protect.",
    "It also doubles as a Wi-Fi security camera, recording video clips when motion is detected. You can choose to be alerted about these as well, again tapping the notification to log in live, or reviewing the footage at a later time if you subscribe to Ring Protect.",
    "The Doorbell 3 Plus works with Amazon smart speakers too. You can opt to have an Echo speaker in your home to announce that someone is at the door (when the doorbell has been pressed) or that motion has been detected, and if you have an Echo Show you can see a live feed from the doorbell on its screen rather than picking up your smartphone.",
    "The Ring app is intuitive and uncluttered. When you open the app you\u2019re presented with a dashboard showing all your Ring devices, with a snapshot of the most recent motion detected by each. Tap the image to bring up a timeline which you can scroll backwards through reviewing any motion or doorbell presses; you can activate live view from here too. If you subscribe to Ring Protect, you\u2019ll also get a feature called \u2018snapshot capture\u2019 that takes still images throughout the day at set intervals and stitches them together so you can see what's happened between motion detection and doorbell presses.",
    "If you prefer not to scroll through the timeline looking for events, you can choose the History option from the main menu, which breaks down the events into doorbell presses, motion detection and live view.",
    "In the settings menu you can adjust the area that is monitored for motion, meaning those with shorter drives won\u2019t be plagued by false positives created by vehicles or people walking past on the street. There\u2019s also the option to create privacy zones, where motion isn\u2019t detected, which is best-suited to when some of your neighbour\u2019s property falls within the doorbell\u2019s field of view. There\u2019s also a People Only mode that can be enabled from this section, again to reduce the number of false positives created by vehicles, animals or trees moving in the breeze.",
    "There\u2019s also a stripped-down version of the Ring app called Rapid Ring, which can be downloaded from the app store. This can\u2019t be used to set-up the video doorbell, but it can be used alongside the original app to reduce lag when it comes to launching liveview.",
    "Ring claims the battery will last anywhere from six months to a year. We weren\u2019t able to fully test these claims, and we used the doorbell heavily during testing so we don't have a realistic reading of battery depletion. How quickly the battery drains will depend upon how many times the doorbell is pushed, how many times motion is detected and how often live view is activated. We found the battery took around eight hours to recharge using the bundled USB cable.",
    "You want a simple-to-install device If you use the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus on battery power, it\u2019s extremely simple to install, especially as Ring even provides the drill bit you need and a mini spirit level.",
    "You don\u2019t have any Wi-Fi security cameras at the front of your property As the Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus records video when motion is detected it does the job of a Wi-Fi security camera too, saving money on having to buy both a smart doorbell and a security camera.",
    "You want Alexa integration Ring is an Amazon owned-company, which means the video doorbell works with Alexa. If you have an Echo smart speaker in your home, you can use that to hear and speak to anyone or your doorstep, while an Echo with a screen, such as the Echo Show, can display a live feed to you can see and talk to the person at your door rather than using the app.",
    "You don\u2019t want to pay for a monthly subscription. Without Ring Protect, the doorbell has limited smart features. For example, you won\u2019t be able to go back and view any footage recorded by the doorbell.",
    "You already have a Ring Video Doorbell 2 While the pre-roll feature and the improved Wi-Fi are great, they\u2019re not enough to warrant upgrading from the Ring Video Doorbell 2. Save your cash and hold out for a model that brings more improvements.",
    "You don\u2019t have an Amazon Echo speaker The Video Doorbell 2 isn\u2019t compatible with Google Home or other non-Amazon smart speakers, so if you don\u2019t have an Echo and want smart assistant integration you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere."
