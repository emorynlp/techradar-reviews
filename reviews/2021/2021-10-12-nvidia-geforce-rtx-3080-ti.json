    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has come along at a strange time. The typical time frame for a refresh might usually be nine months, about how much time separates it from the non-Ti version of the RTX 3080. And, Nvidia may have its reasons for launching this mid-generation refresh on that schedule. But, the world is in a very unusual place right now. Even the world of GPUs, from either Nvidia or AMD, has been affected.",
    "It\u2019s been incredibly difficult for consumers to get their hands on any of the best graphics cards. That\u2019s because a worldwide silicon shortage has severely limited the available supply. Additionally, potential buyers have had to either deal with store lotteries or pay exorbitant prices to scalpers for the pleasure of owning one. Given Nvidia\u2019s asking price of $1,199 for a 3080 Ti, this is a tough time to try and get one.",
    "Yet, the RTX 3080 Ti is a very powerful card, using the RTX 3090 as a template and halving the VRAM for a more consumer-oriented card. And, though a 20GB version of the 3080 Ti is rumored to be on its way, the current iteration of the card will be able to run just about any game on the market at a 4K resolution at 60 fps. Even in more normal times, it\u2019s not the easiest GPU to recommend. It\u2019s not that much more powerful compared to the RTX 3080 but it is much more expensive.",
    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is available June 3, starting at $1,199 / \u00a31,049 / AU$1,949. Prices for the RTX 3080 Ti will probably vary wildly from that minimum price, and third-party versions of the GPU will probably sell for much higher.",
    "Given that the RTX 3080 launched in September 2020 for just $699 (\u00a3649, about AU$950), you\u2019re paying at least twice as much for the RTX 3080 Ti. Given that this GPU has just 2GB more VRAM and 17% more CUDA cores, that 100% price mark-up might be hard to swallow right now.",
    "Although, this graphics card does deliver pretty much the same level of performance as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 at $300 cheaper (at least going by MSRP), so it might be worth grabbing if you had your eyes on Nvidia\u2019s top-end graphics card.",
    "Just like the rest of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series, the RTX 3080 Ti is built on the Nvidia Ampere architecture, and brings with it the same improvements as the rest of the lineup. There is something new to the table, however.",
    "As with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 that launched in March 2021, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti has a hardware-based hash rate limiter that should limit the appeal to cryptocurrency miners. We don\u2019t test mining performance at TechRadar, so we can\u2019t speak to how effective this limit actually is. But given that the hash rate limiter on the RTX 3060 was accidentally bypassed by Nvidia\u2019s own driver update, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how well this actually dissuades miners from buying this graphics card in bulk.",
    "Beyond that, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is actually quite a bit beefier than the original RTX 3080, and that largely falls to core count and memory bandwidth.",
    "Because, sure, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti does have more VRAM, with 12GB of GDDR6X compared to 10GB of the stuff on the original card, but it\u2019s also on a faster 384-bit memory bus. That means you get 912 GB/s of memory bandwidth on the RTX 3080 Ti compared to the RTX 3080\u2019s 760 GB/s. With faster VRAM, not to mention just more memory, the RTX 3080 Ti should be even more adept at 4K gaming in the future.",
    "The RTX 3080 Ti is straight up more powerful, as well. The GPU has 10,240 CUDA cores across 80 compute units, compared to the RTX 3080\u2019s 8,704 CUDA cores. That\u2019s a 17% increase in core count, but don\u2019t expect a strict 17% performance increase - more on that later.",
    "You\u2019re also going to get access to Nvidia\u2019s whole suite of software features, and it\u2019s not just limited to gaming.",
    "The one we are still in love with is Nvidia Broadcast, which is ostensibly designed for streamers and content creators, but we find that it is incredibly useful in just day-to-day life. We use it a lot when we\u2019re taking meetings, or even just hanging out with friends in Discord, especially because it filters out most of the New York City street noises outside our street-facing apartment window.",
    "Of course, you also get access to Deep Learning Super Sampling, or DLSS. This tech uses the Tensor cores \u2013 the RTX 3080 Ti has 320 of those \u2013 to upscale a lower resolution to your native resolution. The idea is that DLSS will let you turn on more of the shiny graphics options, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice image quality just to hit a decent framerate, especially at high resolutions like 4K.",
    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti we reviewed is Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition, and, well, it looks like the rest of the RTX 30-series Founders Edition cards. The graphics card has an attractive black and gunmetal gray colorway. You\u2019ll aso see Nvidia and RTX 3080 Ti branding etched into the metal. That\u2019s not something you\u2019ll notice once you actually have the graphics card in your PC, but it\u2019s a nice touch.",
    "The RTX 3080 Ti is the exact same size and weight as the original RTX 3080, which means it\u2019s 4.4 inches thick and 11.2 inches long, so it should fit in most cases.",
    "There are two fans on the RTX 3080 Ti and just like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, there\u2019s one on the front and one on the back. This fan configuration pulls air through the front of the card, it\u2019ll go through the card, and go out through a fan on the back of the card, probably shooting the hot air through the top of your case.",
    "It\u2019s an extremely effective method of cooling the RTX 3080 Ti, and even with a peak power consumption of 350W, the RTX 3080 Ti peaks at just 78.9C. That is a lot higher than the RTX 3090\u2019s 72C peak temperature, even though that card has the same level of power consumption.",
    "But it\u2019s actually impressive that Nvidia was able to get that close in thermals, considering that it was able to shrink the cooler back down to a dual-slot design, rather than the giant triple-slot RTX 3090 Founders Edition.",
    "Finally, Nvidia has of course included the 12-pin power connector. It does mean that you\u2019re probably going to have to use an adapter to power the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, but of course, Nvidia has included an adapter in the box.",
    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is basically as fast as the RTX 3090 in PC games, even despite the fact that it has half the VRAM. So, the RTX 3080 Ti is what you should buy if you want the best gaming performance you can get right now, and don\u2019t really need to be running Blender or Resolve all the time.",
    "And when we say that the performance is exactly the same, we\u2019re not really exaggerating. Across our entire suite of benchmarks, the RTX 3080 Ti is usually within 1-2 fps of the RTX 3090. The biggest difference between the two is in Dirt 5 at 1440p, where the RTX 3080 Ti gets 139 fps to the RTX 3090\u2019s 146 fps. But if you\u2019re playing Dirt 5, you\u2019re probably not going to notice that 5% performance difference.",
    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti also beats the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT in all but two tests: Fire Strike Ultra and Assassins Creed Valhalla. But even then, at 4K the RTX 3080 Ti delivers the same performance as the RTX 3090, so you\u2019re getting extremely good performance either way.",
    "In the rest of the games though, the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT is between 7-26% slower than the RTX 3080 Ti, so Assassins Creed Valhalla is definitely not the norm. This would usually be enough to make us flatly recommend the RTX 3080 Ti over the Radeon RX 6900 XT, but if we\u2019re just going off of MSRP, Nvidia\u2019s Graphics card is an extra $200. So, you\u2019re going to want to make sure that the RTX 3080 Ti is worth that extra cost.",
    "For pretty much any game that you\u2019re looking to play, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is going to be able to max it out at 4K, and that\u2019s including all the fancy ray tracing effects you\u2019ve probably been hearing about."
