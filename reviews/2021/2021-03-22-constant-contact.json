    "Established and trusted platform",

    "Constant Contact is one of the staples of email marketing services, enabling business owners to create unique email marketing campaigns to reach their customers.",
    "Constant Contact\u2019s email marketing services can also be bundled with their e-commerce platform, website builder, and social media marketing, depending on the needs of your business.",
    "However, for users just looking for email marketing services, Constant Contact is an affordable and easy-to-use option.",
    "In this Constant Contact email marketing review, we\u2019ll take a look at the cost, features, usability, and support options available to find out if Constant Contact is the best email marketing software for you.",
    "Constant Contact offers two main email marketing plans: Email, and Email Plus. The cost of each plan depends on the size of your contact list.",
    "The Email plan includes the basic essentials you\u2019ll need for email marketing, like scheduling unlimited email campaigns, e-commerce integration, tracking and reports, the ability to import and manage contact lists, and contact list segmentation.",
    "The Email plan starts at $20 a month for users with under 500 contacts. The monthly cost increases to $45 for 501\u20132,500 contacts, then to $65 for 2,501\u20135,000 contacts, then to $95 for 5,001\u201310,000 contacts. After 10,000 contacts, the price for Email and Email Plus plans become the same.",
    "The Email Plus plan includes all the basics of the Email plan, plus some extras that can take your email marketing up a notch. With Email Plus, your emails can include surveys, polls, RSVPs, coupons, and personalized content.",
    "Email Plus plans begin at $45 a month for under 500 contacts, rising to $70 a month for under 2,500, then to $95 a month for under 5,000, then to $125 a month for under 10,000. The cost continues to rise based on your contact list size: a contact list of 30,000 will cost $295, while a list of 75,000 will cost $455.",
    "Constant Contact offers a 60-day free trial, but you can only email up to 100 contacts before you\u2019ll have to pay. Discounts are also available for nonprofit organizations.",
    "There is also a more advanced Ecommerce Pro option which offers a full website builder and AI automation, among other things, and is clearly a more complex and comprehensive product than the main email plans. However, it's not available outside of North America. Although pricing isn't advertised on the website, expect it to cost around $195 a month.",
    "For business owners who aren\u2019t particularly design-minded, Constant Contact has over a hundred customizable templates that are already optimized for mobile. There\u2019s also a handy feature that will scan your website and auto-generate a template themed to your website\u2019s colors and images.",
    "Templates are easily edited with drag-and-drop layouts or image and text boxes. For users with coding skills, you can create an email template based on a custom code.",
    "In building your contact list, Constant Contact gives you the option to enter contacts one by one, import them from a spreadsheet or file, or pull them from Gmail or Microsoft Outlook.",
    "Once your contact list is complete, you can create segments\u2014enabling you to target, for example, customers who haven\u2019t opened an email in awhile with a special promo or update.",
    "Constant Contact can integrate with Shopify and WooCommerce, enabling you to create contact list segments based on what customers have purchased. With Constant Contact\u2019s e-commerce integration, customers can also shop your store directly from their inbox.",
    "Constant Contact is extremely easy to set up and get started with, taking just a few minutes to register a new account. Once you create an account, you\u2019ll be asked to answer a few questions about your business and existing contact lists, if any.",
    "The web browser app is intuitively set up and it\u2019s pretty easy to find what you\u2019re looking for, be it campaigns, contacts, or reports.",
    "Constant Contact also has an app available for iOS and Android. Though the app is sleek and the ability to draft emails and organize contacts on the go is appealing, its usefulness is extremely hindered by the inability to edit draft email campaigns created on desktop. For example, users hoping to begin drafting a campaign on their work computer and edit it from their iPad later will be out of luck.",
    "Constant Contact offers users a pretty comprehensive level of support: you can chat or speak to a service representative on the phone, or pose your question to the community. A nice touch is an in-depth library of video tutorials, covering everything from pricing and payments to advice on how to grow your contact list.",
    "For users worried about the security of their contact lists or private information, Constant Contact keeps a list of the measures taken to keep your data secure.",
    "Some of the measures taken include: restricting access to Constant Contact\u2019s physical servers, firewalls, encryption of user data such as credit card numbers, and third-party security reviews of its internally developed software.",
    "For businesses tight on budget, Mailchimp is a worthy competitor to Constant Contact, offering most of the same email marketing basics, such as templates and list segmentation, at a lower price. Mailchimp even offers a free plan if you have under 2,000 contacts, ideal for users who are just starting out.",
    "If webinars are a core component of your business, it might be worth looking into GetResponse, which allows for easy integration of webinars with your email contact list.",
    "Constant Contact is one of the first names people think of when it comes to email marketing, and there\u2019s a reason why. Constant Contact is easy to set up and use, and offers great levels of support and security.",
    "However, there\u2019s nothing that really sets Constant Contact apart from its competitors among its normal email marketing plans. Considering Constant Contact offers a 60-day free trial, it\u2019s worth checking out. But don\u2019t expect game-changing innovation at these levels.",
    "Where Constant Contact does have a chance to stand out is the separately featured and more comprehensive Ecommerce Pro plan, but as with the Constant Contact Website Builder, we'll consider that in its own review."
