  "summary": "The PS4 Pro is a great option for 4K TV owners",
  "verdict": "Five after its launch, the PS4 Pro is still an easy buy for newcomers to the world of PlayStation and 4K HDR TV owners but it's increasingly hard to find. For most, the new PS5 is likely to be the most sensible option for future-proofing.",
  "pros": [
    "First 4K HDR Sony console",
    "Larger 1TB hard drive",
    "The best Pro Mode games look great"

  "cons": [
    "No 4K Blu-ray player",
    "Pro Mode support varies"

    "The PS4 Pro is no longer Sony\u2019s most powerful console thanks to the PS5 but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it\u2019s still a great bit of gaming kit, thanks to its slick design, 4K capabilities and its continued compatibility with the latest PlayStation games.",
    "Of course, now that the console has been discontinued you might find it hard to get your hands on a brand new one but a pre-owned PS4 Pro isn\u2019t out of the question if you decide it\u2019s the console for you. That does mean you\u2019ll struggle to find one in the Black Friday 2021 and Cyber Monday sales, though. There\u2019s always a chance you might find a decent standard PS4 bundle but if you\u2019re looking for the latest specs and 4K gaming then you might be better off looking out for some PS5 Black Friday bundles instead.",
    "Our review of the PlayStation 4 Pro below details everything you need to know about Sony\u2019s 2016 mid-generation upgrade. We've covered the specs, outlined the capabilities and listed some of the games that are great to play. There are other important things to mention too, like whether you should grab a PSVR headset to go along with the PS4 Pro.",
    "The PS4 Pro has the same impressive back catalogue of titles as the standard PS4. The titles released for the PS4 Pro will continue to work on the original console (as well as the PS4 Slim). That's not to mention the PS Now service offering game streaming for over 800 titles too.",
    "The big question is: should I get a PS4 Pro? That largely depends on what kind of TV you own, and what kind of console you have at the moment.",
    "If you don't yet have a PS4 console, then the PS4 Pro gives you 4K capabilities (on some titles) and extra power over the PS4 Slim, in return for paying a bit more money. As we've said, though, the PS4 Pro has been discontinued and with ongoing shortages, you may find the prices of second-hand consoles are inflated at the moment. As a result, trying to get your hands on the newer and more powerful PS5 could be a better way to go for future-proofing purposes.",
    "You should also note that Sony's PS4 Pro system has a few deficiencies in the home entertainment department: particularly in not having an Ultra HD Blu-ray player installed. If that's important to you, you might need to look elsewhere. Keep reading for our full review of the PS4 Pro.",
    "We wouldn't say the PS4 Pro's design is a complete copy of the original PS4's, there are a lot of similarities \u2013 the first being the decision to keep the console a flat parallelogram.",
    "When Sony first unveiled the PS4 Pro, there were jokes that the system felt like two PS4s stacked on top of one another, but the second you pull the system from the box that observation becomes less of a joke and more a fair observation.",
    "Compared to the original PS4's 27.5 x 30 x 5.3 cm package, the PS4 Pro takes up a bit more shelf space at 29.5 x 32.7 x 5.5 cm (W x L x H). It's both a little wider and a little taller than the original PS4, and a fair bit heavier, too (though unless you carry your console around a lot, that's unlikely to matter).",
    "The system is encased in a matte black shell, similar to the one used on the PS4 Slim released in September 2016. However, this time around you won't find rounded corners along the edges \u2013 the PlayStation 4 Pro is sharp in every sense of the word.",
    "Another design difference is the silver PlayStation logo that sits in the center of the top surface, adding a nice touch of elegance. The PS4 Pro also uses a bulkier female connector on its power cable to draw more power, instead of the generic two-prong cable Sony has traditionally supplied with every PS4.",
    "On the front of the console, you might notice that there are no touch-capacitive buttons: Sony has decided to ditch the accident-prone pads for more traditional plastic buttons, but they do the job just the same.",
    "Next, let's talk inputs and outputs. You've got two Superspeed USB 3.1 ports on the front of the PS4 Pro and one on the back, used for syncing and charging controllers, as well as connecting your brand new PlayStation VR, should you buy one. HDMI 2.0a, Ethernet, optical audio and PlayStation Camera ports line up along the back next to the power connector.",
    "You won't find an HDMI input port here like you would on the Xbox One, but Sony's workaround to its cable conundrum, PlayStation Vue, is an arguably effective one.",
    "One final point here: while the exterior is nice, Sony has spent more time working on the inside of the console. Inside is a larger 1TB hard drive, which is 500GB more than you'll find on the original PS4 or the base model of the PS4 Slim. There's also an improved Wi-Fi antenna that uses dual-band 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth 4.0 instead of 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.1.",
    "While the swapping out of a Wi-Fi antenna may not seem like a big deal, it helps the PS4 Pro download games faster: a 160MB game (Pac-Man 256) downloaded in under a minute on a 15Mbps connection, something that should have always been the case but wasn't on the original PS4.",
    "A new system needs a new PS4 controller, and Sony obliges here \u2013 the controller that ships with the new PS4 Pro is the same one that will also ship with all PlayStation 4 Slim systems going forward.",
    "It is, essentially, a very small iteration on the DualShock 4 controller you've probably been using for years. There's now a light bar built into the touchpad \u2013 a nice feature when you don\u2019t want to turn the controller over in your hand to find out what player you are \u2013 but more importantly the triggers have been tweaked and it feels a bit lighter in the hand.",
    "Plus, as we pointed out in the PlayStation 4 Slim review, the controller can also switch seamlessly between Bluetooth and wired mode when it's connected to the system via USB cable. While that might not sound like a huge addition, for a pro gamer it can mean the difference between a win (and a pot of esports prize money) or a loss."
