  "summary": "A HomeKit-compatible smart plug that can even monitor your energy consumption",
  "verdict": "The Eve Energy smart plug is a simple-to-use smart plug with support for HomeKit. It can be controlled via Eve\u2019s own app and the Apple Home app, as well as Siri, and can even track your energy consumption. However, if you\u2019d like control of it when you\u2019re not at home, you\u2019ll need a HomePod Mini, HomePod or an Apple TV 4K.",

    "Energy monitoring",
    "HomeKit integration",

  "cons": [
    "No Alexa or Google Assistant support",

    "Eve is a brand that\u2019s been around since 2014, growing a reputation for making premium-quality smart home devices that exclusively offer HomeKit support. From the best home security cameras and other security devices, such as motion sensors to the best smart lights, Eve offers a range of gadgets to automate your home.",
    "Eve Energy is a new version of the brand\u2019s single-socket smart plug, which connects to the internet to ensure you can control the device connected to the plug via the app or using Siri. It also monitors the power consumption of the device connected to it.",
    "However, this new version uses Thread smart home technology to link the plug to the internet, rather than Wi-Fi, which improves the stability of the connection, putting an end to smart home devices failing to respond. Thread-enabled devices create a mesh network that all such devices can use, rather than an individual Wi-Fi connection between the devices and the internet. This means that if a particular device loses its connection, other Thread-enabled devices can share their connection so that it doesn\u2019t become unresponsive.",
    "Using the Eve app you can switch the smart plug on or off, as well as set schedules for when it should be switched on or off automatically. It\u2019s possible to view energy consumption, and the total cost, too, if you provide specific details from the energy provider, of course. You can even control the smart plug from the Home app on iPhones and iPads. Note, however, that if you want to control the smart plug when you\u2019re not at home, you\u2019ll need a HomePod Mini or Apple TV 4K in your home to act as a smart home hub.",
    "For those deeply tied into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, or starting to use HomeKit to power their smart home, the Eve Energy is the best smart plug you can buy right now.",
    "The Eve Energy Smart Plug will set you back $39.95 / \u00a339.95 / AU$85 and is available worldwide from the Apple Store and Amazon. It\u2019s one of the most expensive smart plugs on the market, but on Amazon Prime Day 2021, there\u2019s a chance it will be discounted so you could make a substantial saving.",
    "The Eve Energy smart plug is, like the best smart plugs, a plain, white device that connects to a mains outlet. It may be one of the bulkiest smart plugs we\u2019ve tested, at 2.8 inches / 7.1cm deep, but the square-shaped design \u2013 if you\u2019re in the UK or Australia (the US version has a rectangular shape) \u2013 ensures it doesn\u2019t block access to other outlets.",
    "A single socket can be found on the front of the plug, while a power button and LED, which glows green when the plug is switched on, reside on the top of the smart plug. On the left-hand side is a QR code, allowing the smart plug to be easily set-up in both the Eve and Apple Home apps.",
    "As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the smart plug uses Thread technology rather than Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. If you don\u2019t have a Thread border router (a HomePod Mini or Apple TV 4K 2021), the plug will use Bluetooth to connect to the Eve or Apple Home app, but this means the Eve Energy smart plug can't be controlled when you're not at home.",
    "Like all devices offering HomeKit support, the Eve Energy smart plug is extremely easy to set up, using either the Eve app or the Apple Home app. Selecting Add Accessory will prompt you to scan the QR code, which can also be found in the quick start guide as well as on the side of the smart plug itself. The app will then do all the hard work, connecting the device to your Wi-Fi network.",
    "Now you\u2019re free to assign the smart plug to a particular room or group of devices and to use your voice or your smartphone to control the plug. During testing, we found the plug switched on and off instantly through the app or Siri, and made a reassuring click in the process.",
    "We were disappointed to learn that you\u2019ll need an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini in order to control the smart plug when you\u2019re not at home. In addition, there\u2019s no Away mode that switches the plug on or off at random times to help simulate occupancy whilst you\u2019re out, as some TP-Link plugs such as the KP-105 offer.",
    "Both the Eve app and Apple\u2019s Home app, which can be used thanks to HomeKit integration, are simple to use, so you\u2019ll find controlling the smart home plug a breeze, no matter the app you choose. If you assign the smart plug to a set room, it will be displayed on this tab; otherwise, you\u2019ll find it on the main home screen of both apps \u2013 just tap it to turn it on or off. Both apps also have an automation tab from where you can create scenes that see several smart home devices controlled at once.",
    "If you want to set schedules for when the smart plug will turn on and off, or you want to view how much energy the plug is using, and the monetary cost of this, you can do so via the Eve app. However, as we\u2019ve already mentioned, there\u2019s no Away mode to simulate occupancy by switching the plug on and off at random times.",
