  "summary": "An affordable Alexa-compatible smart plug that can kick-start your plans to create a smart home",
  "verdict": "The Amazon Smart Plug is an easy-to-use smart home gadget that integrates with Alexa and enables you to control otherwise \u2018dumb\u2019 electrical appliances from your smartphone, even when you\u2019re not at home. Unlike some models, it lacks the ability to track your energy consumption, but for those who want simplicity, it\u2019s a great buy.",

    "Simple setup",
    "Compatible with Alexa",
    "Easy to create automations with other smart home devices"

    "Amazon has been one of the biggest names in smart home devices since the launch of its first Echo smart speaker in 2017. As well as its range of speakers with voice assistant Alexa built in, the brand also offers a range of home security cameras that integrate with its smart speakers, and a smart plug.",
    "The Amazon Smart Plug is a single socket that connects to a power outlet and uses your home Wi-Fi network so Alexa can control any electrical device connected to it, such as a lamp, air purifier or even a pair of hair straighteners. It can also be controlled using the Alexa app on your smartphone \u2013 but, chances are, if you\u2019re considering this smart plug then you already have, or are planning to purchase, an Echo smart speaker with Alexa support in your home ready to spring into action.",
    "Through the Alexa app you can create \u2018Routines\u2019 for the smart plug, to switch on or off automatically, which either happen every day at a set time, or on speaking a certain command. These Routines can include other Alexa-compatible devices in your smart home, too. So, for example, you could ensure a radio switches on and your smart lights illuminate when you say \u201cGood Morning\u201d.",
    "For those who are deeply tied into the Alexa ecosystem, or who want to dip their toe into the water of an Alexa-enabled smart home, the Amazon Smart Plug is a sensible purchase.",
    "The Amazon Smart Plug is priced at $24.99 / \u00a324.99 and is available in the US and UK from Amazon.",
    "Like most of the best smart plugs, the Amazon Smart Plug sports a fairly inoffensive look. It\u2019s rectangular in shape, with an all-white finish complete with a subtle Amazon logo. However, the US and UK versions of the plug look slightly different.",
    "In the US, the plug measures 3.2 x 1.5 x 2.2 inches /8 x 3.8 x 5.7cm ( w x h x d) to ensure it fits into vertical outlets without blocking access to the lower outlet. The UK version measures 3.7 x 2.2 x 2.5 inches / 5.6 x 9.62 x 6.3cm, since vertically aligned outlets aren\u2019t common \u2013 they sit horizontally instead.",
    "The front of the smart plug features a single socket and a tiny blue LED, which illuminates when the plug is switched on and flashes when the plug is in set-up mode. On the left-hand side you\u2019ll find a manual power button. The smart plug only works on the 2.4GHz band, so if you\u2019re installing it in a different room to your router, you may suffer connection problems. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no Wi-Fi indicator that alerts you to any connectivity issues.",
    "The Amazon Smart Plug is an extremely simple smart home device to set up. Once connected to an outlet, we opened the Alexa app, which took on all the hard work \u2013 identifying the plug and, once we scanned a QR code on the quick-start guide, connecting it to our home Wi-Fi. The QR code can be found on the back of the plug, too, if you can\u2019t locate the quick start guide.",
    "Following this, you can assign the smart plug to a particular room or group of devices, if you want, leaving you free to use your voice or your smartphone to control the plug. During testing, we found the plug switched on and off instantly when controlled by the app or Alexa, and the \u2018click\u2019 it made when switching on and off was reassuring.",
    "While we were able to set schedules for the smart plug to switch on and off at set times, we were disappointed to find there\u2019s no Away mode that switches the plug on or off at random times. This is a better way to help simulate occupancy when you\u2019re not at home, rather than relying on a schedule. Such features can be found on TP-Link plugs such as the KP105. There\u2019s no tracking of energy consumption on offer, either.",
    "The Alexa app is easy to use, with a clearly marked Devices tab that allows you to control all of your compatible smart home gadgets from one platform. We found all devices were split into categories, and tapping them provided quick access to control them or create a Routine for them.",
    "Through the app it\u2019s also possible to add the smart plug to a group of devices and, not surprisingly, set up integration with Alexa. However, as already mentioned, features such as Away mode and energy monitoring features are lacking.",
