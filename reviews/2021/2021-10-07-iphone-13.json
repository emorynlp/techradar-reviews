  "summary": "Everything on the iPhone 13 is just a bit better",
  "verdict": "The iPhone 13 isn\u2019t a game changer for Apple\u2019s series of smartphones, but it\u2019s an important iteration that offers better battery life, a better processor and an upgraded camera setup than iPhones that have gone before it. If you\u2019re looking for a fast and capable smartphone, and don\u2019t need the extra features of the pricier Pro model, this is a top choice.",
  "pros": [
    "Strong battery life",
    "Great design",
    "Powerful internals"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Minimal design changes",
    "No 120Hz screen",
    "No Ceramic Shield on rear"

    "The iPhone 13 doesn\u2019t bring with it a huge number of new features, but it does improve on the iPhone 12 in several areas \u2013 chiefly battery life, power, display and cameras \u2013 to make this one of the most impressive all-round handsets we\u2019ve seen from Apple.",
    "On paper, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a reason why Apple didn\u2019t call this phone the iPhone 12S. The design is largely the same, the specs don\u2019t look hugely different, and there aren\u2019t many headline-grabbing new features.",
    "However, everything on the iPhone 13 is a touch better than before \u2013 and some elements are significantly better.",
    "The highlight of the iPhone 13 is its battery life. Previously, iPhones haven\u2019t been synonymous with strong battery life, but during every day of our testing we\u2019ve been hard-pressed to run the iPhone 13 out of juice.",
    "Apple has finally cracked it when it comes to battery life, and it's now far better than it has been on previous iPhone iterations.",
    "The iPhone 13\u2019s new A15 Bionic chipset, meanwhile, is incredibly powerful, and paired with 4GB of RAM it\u2019s capable of running multiple apps and tasks quickly and efficiently.",
    "A new duo camera for the iPhone 13 improves clarity in images, while the introduction of the company\u2019s Sensor Shift optical image stabilization (OIS) technology, previously only available on Apple\u2019s Pro Max handsets, is a big deal for those who want to shoot quickly without losing their subject in a blur.",
    "Even the screen on the iPhone 13 is a touch better than what we\u2019ve seen on previous \u2018standard\u2019 iPhones, and that\u2019s a big deal if you\u2019re upgrading from an iPhone XS or older. The OLED technology here enables a brighter picture than ever, and the picture quality is simply fantastic.",
    "One disappointment, however, is that Apple hasn\u2019t included a 120Hz refresh rate on the iPhone 13, so you\u2019re not getting as smooth an experience as on the iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max.",
    "As ever, Apple\u2019s new iPhone will cost you, with the iPhone 13 price starting at $799 / \u00a3779 / AU$1,349 \u2013 although this year that gets you 128GB of storage, rather than the 64GB of the base-model iPhone 12.",
    "While at first glance the iPhone 13 may not seem like a great leap forward for Apple, the improved battery life, performance, screen and camera all add up to be a worthwhile upgrade for anyone who\u2019s coming from an older iPhone, or looking to make the switch from Android.",
    "The iPhone 13 series was announced on September 14 at the company's annual launch event, with pre-orders opening on September 17. The iPhone 13 release date was September 24, and unlike with 2020's iPhone 12 series it was possible to buy all the new handsets on the same day.",
    "The iPhone 13 starts at $799 / \u00a3779 / AU$1,349, which is the same price as the iPhone 12 in the US and Australia, and a touch cheaper in the UK. The iPhone 12 cost $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,349 at launch.",
    "You\u2019ll get 128GB of storage for that price \u2013 Apple has dropped its 64GB models this year, and not before time. If you need more storage, the 256GB iPhone 13 costs $899 / \u00a3879 / AU$1,519, while the 512GB model costs $1,099 / \u00a31,079 / AU$1,869.",
    "If those prices are a bit of a stretch, the iPhone 13 mini has similar specs but is a not-insignificant amount cheaper, starting at $699 / \u00a3679 / AU$1,199, while going in the other direction you\u2019ve got the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max if you\u2019re looking for higher specs and, in the case of the latter phone, a larger screen.",
    "If you own an iPhone 12, you\u2019re unlikely to see a big difference between that handset and the iPhone 13. If, however, you own an older iPhone, or an Android device, you\u2019re certainly going to see some differences.",
    "The new iPhone features a flat-edge design, which debuted with the iPhone 12 range. That means the design is a touch more angular than the rounded finish of previous iterations, but the phone is still comfortable to use one-handed.",
    "The front and rear of the handset are glass, but only the front panel has Apple\u2019s patented Ceramic Shield technology, introduced on last year\u2019s iPhone 12 . Apple says this offers four times the drop resistance of the glass on older iPhones, but we still wouldn\u2019t recommend putting this claim to the test.",
    "We\u2019ve yet to drop this handset, but it\u2019s comforting to know that the Ceramic Shield tech is there as a safety net \u2013 although we\u2019d be more comforted if it was on the rear of the phone too.",
    "On the subject of durability, the iPhone 13 series is IP68 dust and water resistant, which means it can survive in up to six meters of water for a period of 30 minutes. Don\u2019t expect this handset to be fully waterproof, but it\u2019ll survive the odd dunk.",
    "On the left edge of the phone are the silence switch, the volume buttons and the SIM tray. The right edge hosts just the power button, so it\u2019s easy to find with your thumb or finger when you\u2019re trying to wake the handset.",
    "On the bottom edge are the speakers, and the Lightning port connector for charging and data transfer.",
    "We found the iPhone 13 was easy to use one-handed \u2013 it measures 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.7mm \u2013 although if you want a truly one-handed device, or you have smaller hands, the iPhone 13 mini may be a better choice.",
    "The iPhone 13 weighs a touch more than the iPhone 12, at 174g compared to 164g, but it\u2019s not something you\u2019ll notice in everyday use, and it\u2019s roughly the norm for a phone of this type.",
    "The rear of the iPhone 13 is plain, but looks sophisticated, with the Apple logo taking center stage and the camera module at the top-left. A minor change this year is that the company has opted to arrange the main lenses in the camera array diagonally, rather than vertically as on previous iPhones.",
    "There are five color options for the iPhone 13: Blue, Midnight, Starlight (a cream color), Product Red and Pink \u2013 the shade you see pictured throughout this review.",
    "These shades are rather muted, and if you\u2019re not a fan of any of them you may want to hang on and see if Apple introduces more colors at a later date \u2013 the company introduced a purple iPhone 12 around six months after that phone first launched. If you own an iPhone 12, you should note that the cases for that handset won\u2019t fit the new model.",
    "The display on the iPhone 13 is 6.1 inches, with a resolution of 2532 x 1170. It\u2019s a Super Retina XDR OLED display made by Apple, and it makes for a clear and bright image \u2013 the brightness has been improved on the iPhone 13, and it can hold its own against other smartphones in direct sunlight.",
    "That resolution equates to 460 pixels per inch, which isn\u2019t the best we\u2019ve seen on the market but is perfectly suitable for everyday use \u2013 we didn\u2019t find we ever needed a higher resolution, even when watching video or playing games.",
    "There are thin bezels around the handset\u2019s screen, and some of the display is also taken up with the notch at the top. Yes, there\u2019s still a notch on the iPhone 13, but it\u2019s 20% smaller than the notch on the iPhone 12, giving you a touch more screen real estate.",
    "It\u2019s not a big change, but it\u2019s noticeable when you compare the handset to the iPhone 12. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll quickly grow used to though.",
    "An important note here is that the iPhone 13 display doesn\u2019t get the new 120Hz refresh rate that Apple debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max \u2013 the displays on those phones refresh twice as fast as a standard 60Hz screen for a smoother experience when scrolling web pages or playing games.",
    "If you\u2019ve experienced this technology before \u2013 it\u2019s now common now on a lot of Android phones \u2013 you\u2019ll notice the difference here, although it\u2019s a feature that\u2019s nice to have, rather than indispensable.",
    "Going on the headline specs, the iPhone 13 camera setup doesn\u2019t look that different to the array on last year\u2019s model, but you\u2019re getting some worthwhile upgrades here, with tweaks to the cameras themselves as well as a variety of software updates.",
    "You\u2019ve got two cameras on the rear: a 12MP wide camera with an aperture of f/1.6, and a 12MP ultrawide camera with a f/2.4 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. There\u2019s no telephoto shooter here \u2013 you\u2019re reliant on digital zoom, so this phone isn\u2019t going to be the best for grabbing long-distance shots.",
    "When not shooting at a distance, this is a fantastic and versatile experience. The main camera uses 1.7\u00b5m pixels (up from 1.4\u00b5m on the iPhone 12) that give a noticeable difference to the picture quality here.",
    "You\u2019re also getting Apple\u2019s Sensor Shift OIS technology, which debuted in last year\u2019s iPhone 12 Pro Max, and which offers the best image stabilization we\u2019ve seen on an iPhone, enabling you to get sharp shots even when you\u2019re not able to keep the phone perfectly still.",
    "There\u2019s less noise in images taken in most scenarios than in comparable shots from the iPhone 12, and there were few situations where the camera didn\u2019t perform to the level we\u2019d expect \u2013 it\u2019s a great point-and-shoot experience.",
    "The ultra-wide camera\u2019s 120-degree field of view is useful when you want to get more of your subject or scene in, but we mostly found ourselves sticking with the main camera.",
    "There\u2019s digital zoom up to 5x, but the results aren\u2019t very impressive, and you\u2019ll find that many other smartphones are more capable in this area, although it\u2019s by no means an essential feature.",
    "Another new feature here is Photographic Styles, which you can access through the camera app. These enable you to apply custom looks to your images, such as Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm and Cool.",
    "These are useful if you have a particular style of shooting, and the idea is that unlike a simple filter they will allow the phone to apply adjustments to different elements of an image. We didn\u2019t find this made a huge difference to our shooting, but it\u2019s another tool in your photography arsenal.",
    "On the front of the phone is a 12MP f/2.2 wide camera that we found worked well for selfies and video calls. The front cameras on iPhones have been impressive for some time now, and while there are no big improvements here you\u2019ll be happy with the results you get.",
    "You can shoot video on the iPhone 13 at 4K at 24, 30 and 60 frames per second, as well as Full HD at 30, 60, 120 and 240fps.",
    "The big video recording upgrade is the introduction of Cinematic Mode that allows you to film with a bokeh effect where the background of your shot is blurred. The effect also follows faces that are in the frame, so it'll switch between subjects.",
    "We've found this to work well, but it takes some getting used to and you may need to play around with it a few times to be able to get the absolute perfect shot. This is a fun tool though, and it's something you may enjoy if you like playing around with video modes.",
    "Apple\u2019s iPhone 13 series all feature the company\u2019s new A15 Bionic chipset, it\u2019s latest attempt at making the most powerful smartphone chipset on the planet. Apple says it has a 50% faster CPU and 30% faster GPU than the competition.",
    "Whatever the accuracy of those claims, Apple\u2019s new handset is undeniably powerful, and while everyday performance won\u2019t be noticeably different to what you\u2019d get from the iPhone 12 or the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, this will be a huge step up for those using an iPhone 8 or below.",
    "During our testing we found that the iPhone 13 could launch apps in an instant, and was easily capable of swapping between apps with a limited wait for each to load.",
    "Gaming on the handset was also a breeze, with titles loading as quickly as we\u2019ve seen on other products like the iPad Pro (one of Apple\u2019s most powerful devices in 2021). Games looked fantastic on the OLED display, with those GPU performance upgrades particularly noticeable.",
    "Geekbench 5 scores match our testing with the phone having an average multi-core score of 4688. The iPhone 12 scored 3859 in the same test, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 scored 3367 and the OnePlus 9 Pro scored 3630.",
    "Apple has made another big step up here, but it\u2019s most noticeable in benchmarking results. The everyday experience is largely the same, but it\u2019ll be a marked step up from much older iPhone models.",
    "The A15 Bionic chipset is teamed with 4GB of RAM, and that\u2019s enough to keep it running at full tilt. That\u2019s less RAM than you\u2019d see on most equivalent Android phones, but Apple doesn\u2019t seem to need a lot of RAM to make the most of its A15 Bionic.",
    "Your storage options are 128GB, 256GB or 512GB, and if you\u2019re planning to load your phone up with media over a couple of years we\u2019d recommend opting for the 256GB or 512GB variant; even with iCloud support, 128GB may prove easy to fill up.",
    "Apple has, at least, dropped the ridiculously meagre 64GB storage option that\u2019s been its base offering for the last few years.",
    "The iPhone 13 series is 5G-ready, and it\u2019s nice to know that you\u2019re future-proofed for the next-gen tech, even if you don\u2019t yet need it or it\u2019s not available where you are \u2013 it\u2019s becoming increasingly widespread, and the iPhone 13 will be compatible with any 5G carrier.",
    "The iPhone 13 comes running iOS 15 out of the box, so you can enjoy all the latest software features from the company.",
    "The upgrades for 2021 are smaller than the major overhaul we saw with iOS 14, but the new additions are interesting, and include a new Focus mode that\u2019s easy to enable through the dropdown menu.",
    "Tapping the Focus label gives you easy access to the Do Not Disturb mode, as well as settings that you can enable for when you\u2019re at work or you\u2019re ready to go to sleep. Want to block your Twitter notifications when you\u2019re at your desk? This will allow you to do that.",
    "Other new features are more minor, but overall it\u2019s a nice refinement of what we\u2019ve seen before.",
    "A major benefit of a new iPhone is that Apple is likely to support it with software updates for many years to come; even the iPhone 6S is compatible with iOS 15, so if Apple continues to offer that depth of software support you can expect the iPhone 13 to continue receiving updates until around 2027.",
    "Apple\u2019s handsets have never been known for strong battery life, and while the iPhone 13 doesn\u2019t offer the best stamina we\u2019ve ever seen in a smartphone, it\u2019s a clear improvement on previous iPhones.",
    "We\u2019ve yet to find out if Apple has increased the size of the cells inside the iPhone 13, but the increase in battery life here suggests so. Rumors ahead of the iPhone 13 launch suggested that Apple would be increasing the size of the batteries in every model.",
    "According to Apple\u2019s estimates, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro Max are set to offer the better battery life in the series. We\u2019ve found the battery life to be significantly improved compared to the iPhone 12 and what has gone before it.",
    "During our testing time, the iPhone 13 made it through every day with enough charge in the tank to keep going for at least another couple of hours.",
    "On one day, we pushed the phone to its absolute limits by ensuring the screen was on for the entire day streaming video from YouTube and other services from 10:30am until 11pm. We were unable to kill the phone, and it remained with 20% battery life. That was with the screen on full brightness for eight hours and 48 minutes.",
    "As we\u2019ve said, this isn\u2019t the best battery life you\u2019ll find in a smartphone \u2013 many Android alternatives will be able to last longer \u2013 but this is a big step up for Apple, and it\u2019ll make the iPhone a more compelling option for many potential buyers.",
    "The iPhone 13 is compatible with 20 watt chargers, which we found offered good fast-charging but not the best we've seen. From zero, the phone charged to 26% in 15 minutes and 51% in 30 minutes.",
    "Wireless charging makes a return here, and if you\u2019ve got a compatible charger you\u2019ll be able to hit 15W charging. That\u2019s far from the fastest wireless charging on the market, but it\u2019s still useful to have if you don\u2019t like having to plug your phone in, or you\u2019re low on battery and find yourself with a Qi charger to hand.",
    "As with the iPhone 12 series, you won\u2019t get a charger in the box with the iPhone 13. The aim here is to cut down on e-waste, and Apple\u2019s logic is that you\u2019re likely to have a Lightning charger from a previous iPhone purchase.",
    "If you don\u2019t, you can buy a charger from Apple for $19 / \u00a319 / AU$29, while there are also third-party options that can cost less. You may also want to upgrade your charger to make the most of that 20W charging, which many older iPhone chargers aren\u2019t capable of.",
