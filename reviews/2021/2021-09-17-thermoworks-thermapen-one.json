    "Overcooked food can be dry and chewy, ruining an otherwise good meal. However, determining exactly how long to cook meat to the point that it remains juicy and succulent can be a struggle for many home cooks. This is where a meat thermometer can be a lifesaver, enabling you to check the internal temperature of food, so you know when it\u2019s cooked.",
    "ThermoWorks\u2019 Thermapen is widely considered one of the best food thermometers on the market, and it\u2019s favored by professional chefs as well as home cooks. The brand\u2019s latest model \u2013 the Thermapen One \u2013 is its most advanced yet.",
    "The Thermapen One has a built-in accelerometer that can identify the position in which the thermometer is being held, rotating the display accordingly, so it's easy to read the temperature without having to tilt your head at an angle. The display is backlit, too, so it can be clearly seen in all lights.",
    "Sporting the same compact design as previous Thermapen models, the Thermapen One comprises a stainless steel food probe that folds back 180 degrees into the side of the gadget when it's not being used. However, where it differs is that it now takes just one second to deliver a temperature reading compared to the two to three seconds of previous models of Thermapen. The Thermapen One is an expensive food thermometer, but for those who worry about how long to cook food to ensure it\u2019s safe to eat but still succulent, it\u2019s worth the investment \u2013 and it\u2019s great for cooking steak to perfection, too. As well as checking the temperature of meat or meals that have been reheated, the Thermapen One will also prove handy for bakers when making sweet treats such as fudge, swiss meringue buttercream, or even when tempering chocolate.",
    "The ThermoWorks Thermapen One will set you back $105 / \u00a366 and comes in 10 colors including red, blue, black and purple. It\u2019s available from ThermoWorks in the US, and the Thermapen website and Amazon in the UK.",
    "ThermoWorks also offers the Thermapen Classic. This slightly more affordable meat thermometer doesn\u2019t have a rotating display and takes around three seconds to register the temperature of food. It\u2019s priced at $83 / \u00a351.60.",
    "The ThermoWorks Thermapen One is a super-compact food thermometer. Measuring 6.1 x 1.7 x 0.74 inches / 0.82 x 15.62 x 1.93cm (w x h x d) and weighing just 0.25lbs / 115g, it can easily be slipped in a drawer \u2013 or even a bag, if you\u2019re planning to cook on a weekend away. The stainless steel probe folds back through 180 degrees into the side of the plastic body of the thermometer for neat storage when it isn\u2019t in use.",
    "The thermometer is available in 10 colors including red, purple, and blue, and has a 1.54 x 1in / 1.43 x 1.185cm (w x h) LCD screen that shows the temperature reading. The LCD automatically rotates based on the position in which the thermometer is being held, so no matter the angle from which you look at it, the reading will always be displayed the right way up.",
    "The display is backlit, too, and if the sensor on the front of the thermometer detects it\u2019s a low light situation, it will illuminate the panel to make it easier to read. An IP67 rating means the thermometer will survive being submerged for a short length of time \u2013 but this isn\u2019t recommended.",
    "Temperature range covers -58 to 572\u00baF / -49.9 to 299.9\u00baC, and can be customized to display in the unit of temperature you prefer. The thermometer also comes with a five-year warranty and has a new easy-to-access battery compartment, which is secured with only one screw.",
    "The ThermoWorks Thermapen One is extremely simple to use. Simply unfold the food probe from the side of the thermometer body, insert it into the food item, and the temperature is instantly displayed on the LCD screen in around one second. We found that it was also super-responsive to constantly rising temperatures, such as when heating sugar and egg whites in a bain-marie for swiss meringue buttercream.",
    "We used the Thermapen One for pan-frying steaks, and to check the temperature of reheated lasagne in the microwave. No matter the angle we held the thermometer at when checking the temperature of these foods, the display took less than a second to rotate to the correct orientation for easy reading.",
    "Note that the display orientation can be locked, if you\u2019d prefer, although doing so can be fiddly since it requires the removal of the battery compartment cover and pressing two extremely small buttons several times. These buttons allowed us to customize both the temperature units and the number of decimal places displayed on the thermometer\u2019s screen.",
    "Meanwhile, the backlight proved to be effective at ensuring we could read the screen in low light, or if the sensor on the main body of the thermostat was covered.",
    "We were also impressed that, when the thermometer was left unfolded, the display automatically switched off after 30 seconds if the device hadn\u2019t been picked up, in order to conserve battery life. Picking up the Thermapen One immediately reactivated the unit, with the temperature displayed on the screen. The default for this setting is 30 seconds, but this can be customized.",
    "The ThermoWorks Thermapen One is powered by a single AAA battery, which the company claims will last for up to 2,000 hours of use before it needs changing \u2013 although this figure is for use without the backlight. This is an increase of 500 hours on the 1,500 offered by previous Thermapen models.",
    "As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Thermapen One has a new easy-to-access battery compartment that\u2019s secured with just one screw, rather than a cover that could only be removed with the help of a coin.",
