It\u2019s a little pricey, but has great features like its curved, split design, and a double-layered soft foam wrist rest with front end tilt legs. While initially awkward to use, you soon get used to it.",

    "The Logitech ERGO K860 ergonomic keyboard is a sturdy and thoughtfully-designed peripheral that\u2019s great for long typing sessions, providing great support with its wrist rest and front tilt legs.",
    "Its design is sleek with a curved, split keyframe to provide full ergonomic support and improve posture; it\u2019s black, professional-looking and uses Logitech\u2019s PerfectStroke key system, which is similar to the scissor-key mechanism used on laptop keyboards. It\u2019s sturdy and wireless and connects via Logitech\u2019s unifying receiver USB dongle and Bluetooth. Meanwhile, its unusually-placed feet \u2013 at the front, not the back \u2013 can tilt the keyboard at 4 and 7-degree angles.",
    "The Logitech ERGO K860 Keyboard is priced at an expensive but forgivable $129.99 (around AU$230) and available for \u00a3100 on Amazon UK. It has a 2-year warranty.",
    "This full-sized keyboard measures 456mm wide and 233mm tall. There are 12 programmable keys on the top row, and up to three devices can be connected at once via Bluetooth or the 10m wireless range unifying receiver.",
    "Bluetooth is the most energy-efficient method, and when using the receiver, two AAA batteries are required, which according to Logitech have a two-year battery life.",
    "It was easy to set up, but Logitech provides a workstation setup guide that provides tips on aligning the keyboard for maximum comfort and efficiency. It\u2019s compatible with Windows, from 7 to 10, Linux, Mac and Chrome OS. We wouldn\u2019t recommend it for consoles (or gaming PCs), but that\u2019s a personal option and depends on what you intend to use it for.",
    "For individuals suffering from repetitive strain injury or disabilities, and companies that want to reduce RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) in its employees, Logitech has made a keyboard that will suit those needs.",
    "The wrist support is extremely comfortable, probably due to having a double layer of foam inside. Another massive plus for the K860 is that it\u2019s compatible with Logitech Flow-enabled mice, so if you own an MX Master 2S, MX Master 3, MX Anywhere 3 or any other Flow-enabled peripheral from Logitech, you won\u2019t need multiple receivers, as you can connect up to three devices at once.",
    "The Logitech ERGO K860's PerfectStroke keys are comfortable to use, but they\u2019re not backlit. There isn\u2019t very much else in terms of color, like RGB lighting, and the keyboard is only available in black. It\u2019s definitely more of a professional work/office keyboard, so those features are not necessary, or suitable.",
    "Even though it takes time to adjust to its split-key design, the Logitech ERGO K860 is an impressive keyboard. The front end tilt support is interesting and refreshing, and helps keep your hands correctly perched above the keyboard.",
    "It\u2019s definitely not for gaming, but great for typing all day, every day. One thing to bear in mind, though, is that the spacing of the keys can be a problem for programmers who mainly use the arrow keys when coding."
