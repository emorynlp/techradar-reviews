    "Edge is Microsoft\u2019s latest browser, and it looks its best when you use it as it was intended to be used: by running Bing, which is Microsoft\u2019s search engine. This is how you\u2019ll get Edge\u2019s richest features, the ones that revolve around online shopping.",
    "If you switch to using Google or Yahoo as the default search engine, you\u2019ll miss out on all of those components that help you save money, find deals and compare prices. And since you can\u2019t easily switch back and forth between your search engine like you can on a browser like Safari, it\u2019s best to pick one and stick to it.",
    "With Edge, you can browse on multiple devices and sync your favorites, passwords and settings across all of them. There are a ton of features, too, especially for productivity and online shopping.",
    "Productivity features",
    "Online shopping features",
    "Additional features",
    "Compared to other browsers, Edge\u2019s security features seem a bit lacking. They do cover the essentials that you may be most interested in, though:",
    "InPrivate tabs and windows: Your browsing and search data (cookies, history, temporary internet files) are not saved on your device once you\u2019re finished browsing.",
    "Kids Mode: Browsing mode just for kids with built-in protection and custom designs. There\u2019s also news curated for kids ages 9 to 12.",
    "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen: Protect against phishing or malware websites and keep the browser from downloading harmful files.",
    "Tracking prevention: Detect and block trackers, and determine the trackers you want to block.",
    "Edge has a lot of password-protection features, too. The browser can create and store strong passwords for you in its password manager. You\u2019ll also get reminders if you\u2019re using the same password on a lot of sites, so you can change them if you want the most protection possible. You\u2019ll even be notified when Edge detects that your credentials are compromised.",
    "You can customize what a page will look like when you open a new tab. There are three options:",
    "Inspirational: This has imagery that takes up a large part of the header",
    "Information: Your feed is front-and-center",
    "Focused: Completely minimalist with just icons for your top links",
    "Microsoft Edge uses the Bing search engine as its default, but you can switch it to Google or Yahoo if you prefer. However, Microsoft Edge looks best with Bing when compared to the other search engines. And Bing looks best on Microsoft Edge, too \u2013 it\u2019s not quite as attractive when you use Bing on, say, Safari. It\u2019s clear that Edge and Bing are made to go with one another (they\u2019re both Microsoft products, after all).",
    "Microsoft Edge is available on supported versions of Android, iOS, MacOS and Windows. It has a mobile app, too.",
    "Edge is more feature-rich and customizable than Safari, and since it uses the Chrome Web Store, you can theoretically outfit it in the same way you would Google Chrome.",
    "Overall, Edge just looks nicer than many other browsers. Unlike Chrome and Safari, the navigation menus in Edge are less obtrusive, putting your search results in the forefront and everything else available but pared down.",
    "There are also three ways to search right from the main search bar \u2013 via text, voice or image \u2013 and the bar at the top of shopping results is super useful (this isn\u2019t a Bing thing, by the way, it\u2019s specific to Edge).",
    "Edge is feature-packed but pretty easy to get the hang of. Ironically, the hardest feature to learn was the one that\u2019s promoted the most: Collections. It took a while to figure out what Collections were and then set them up and add to them. The feature is still sleeker than something like Bookmarks in Safari, though, which makes you open a new tab just to edit and organize your saved links. With Collections, you can do everything from a pop-up over whatever page you\u2019re on.",
    "Edge has a lot of settings that you can work your way through to get the browser looking and functioning exactly the way you want. If you\u2019re a bit tired of too-simple-to-be-useful browsers, Edge may be a great \u2013 and great-looking \u2013 alternative. And if you do a lot of online shopping (or any, really), it\u2019s the best way to go, even if you use another browser for all of your non-shopping time online."
