  "verdict": "The EPOS | Sennheiser GSP 370 headset supplies you with everything you could want when it comes to gaming audio and battery life, but an awkward form factor, dubious durability and lofty price point may put first-time buyers off.",

    "Best-in-class battery life",
    "Long-lasting comfort"

    "The EPOS | Sennheiser GSP 370 headset treads the line between quality and budget. Coming in at an RRP of $200 (\u00a3179/ AU$350), the accessory fits in the middle of the market, nudging the top-end of what most people would consider entry level.",
    "For that price, you\u2019d expect some best-in-class features \u2013 a headset that delivers on Sennheiser\u2019s legacy with a crystal clear audio profile, and a durable and stylish design. But the EPOS | Sennheiser GSP 370, sadly, is not the best gaming headset you can pick up at this price-point.",
    "The most impressive aspect of the headset is its battery: Sennheiser\u2019s unlikely promise of a 100-hour charge is no exaggeration, and we haven\u2019t had to charge the headset once in the entire 20-day period we\u2019ve been testing it (despite averaging two-to-three hours a day playtime). That convenience, to some, may be worth the price of entry.",
    "For those with keen ears listening out for teammates\u2019 comms and in-game audio cues, the sound is sharp and clear and balanced and makes for a perfectly cromulent experience even with a flat profile. Sennheiser\u2019s decades-long reign as king of the aural castle shines through with the GSP 370, especially when you\u2019re playing games that rely on situational awareness. Noise-cancelling is achieved through the earcup design and allows for full, proper immersion in whatever fictional world you\u2019ve booted up.",
    "When it comes to sound, then, the EPOS | Sennheiser GSP 370 can give even the pricer, premium-range Sennheiser 670 a run for its money. It\u2019s just a shame that it\u2019s burdened with a lack of versatility, a sub-par mic build, a non-robust design to offset its glorious sound and battery life.",
    "Let\u2019s get one thing cleared up: this headset is not subtle. Though it\u2019s not quite as bulky as its larger, more obnoxious sibling \u2013 the GSP 670 \u2013 the Sennheiser 370 is still a chunky headset. Even the most sausage-fingered gamers out there will struggle to miss the tactile, responsive volume wheel, though, and that\u2019s a big plus for the headset\u2019s traditional, smooth and matte black design.",
    "A low-slung (and, honestly, quite cheap-feeling) connector attaches the earcups to the headband, and that sometimes squeaks a little if you\u2019re mobile during a gaming session. The ball-and-socket joint that bridges the headband and earcups only allows for a few degrees\u2019 worth of movement \u2013 if you\u2019re an agitated, animated gamer, you may want to bear that in mind.",
    "The upside, though, is comfort: both the headband and the earcups sit on an average-sized head without distress, and the width of the band allows even larger-headed players (like the reviewer) to enjoy lengthy sessions without discomfort. If you don\u2019t mind faux leather, the earcups are perfectly functional, and the way they operate and noise-cancelling muffs, too, should be lauded.",
    "For all its size and conspicuous design, though, the headset is light. This is a plus and a minus, really: yes, it\u2019s great for comfort and lengthy sessions (and that really goes hand in hand with its stupendous battery life) but it also means it\u2019s not the most durable headset out there. Sit on this by accident once or twice, and the earcups or the surprisingly fat and flexible mic will know about it.",
    "Thanks to Sennheiser\u2019s unparalleled record when it comes to aural engineering, the headset is a dream to use in audio-rich games. First-person shooters and survival horror games highlight the GSP 370\u2019s 20-20,000Hz frequency range the best, but the headset makes pretty much any PS4, PS5, or PC game shine out of the box.",
    "There\u2019s no dedicated balance function, though, so if you\u2019re going to be using this to chat with mates as you mow down zombies in Call of Duty or yell at the ref in FIFA, you\u2019re going to have to use an app or the PS4/PS5\u2019s in-built functionality to tweak the balance. On PC, you have the option to mess with and EQ thanks to some proprietary software, but \u2013 frankly \u2013 it\u2019s a cumbersome and unfriendly program (especially when it comes to the mic) and you\u2019re best off avoiding it as much as possible.",
    "Speaking of the mic, that\u2019s probably our biggest issue with the headset as a gaming accessory. Our teammates could hear the clack and click of a DualShock 4 through the mic when we played, and despite claims of being unidirectional and noise-cancelling, the mic picked up a lot of ambiance on voice channels. Add to that a fair amount of crackle coming through to other players in our fireteam, and you\u2019ve got a concern \u2013 even if your voice does come through warm and clear when the mic fires on all cylinders.",
    "You may also note a very occasional connectivity glitch when paired with either PS4 or PC: an always-on USB dongle deals with connectivity, and over between 60-70 hours of use, we noticed a momentary drop-out maybe four or five times. It\u2019s not a game-changing glitch but it\u2019s worth noting (especially if you\u2019re thinking of playing ranked or competitive when using the headset)."
