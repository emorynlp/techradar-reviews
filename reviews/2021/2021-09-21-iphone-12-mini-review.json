  "summary": "The iPhone 12 mini is a dainty (yet powerful) delight",
  "verdict": "The iPhone 12 mini is built for those who have been dreaming of a small phone but don\u2019t want to compromise on quality, and Apple has done an exceedingly good job at making that a reality. It isn\u2019t perfect, with middling battery life and a high price for just 64GB of storage, but if you can put those negatives aside you\u2019ll love what the iPhone 12 mini can do in its miniature package. The camera is versatile, the screen is fantastic, it comes with reams of power and the added benefits of 5G and MagSafe mean this is a phone that will last you for years to come.",
  "pros": [
    "Smaller design looks great",
    "Fantastic display",
    "Futureproofed with 5G"

  "cons": [
    "64GB isn\u2019t enough for some",
    "Wireless charging is slower",
    "Middling battery life"

    "Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 mini is a triumph, with top-end tech and a premium design combining to produce a phone that can compete with some of the very best handsets on the market, and all in a smaller body than you\u2019d expect for a flagship device.",
    "This is essentially the iPhone 12 reprised, but in a smaller form factor that will suit those looking for a more compact phone than top-end manufacturers \u2013 including Apple \u2013 have been able to offer for the past few years.",
    "This is the smallest iPhone since the iPhone 5S, and you\u2019ll notice it as soon as you pick it up. Even comparing this phone to the iPhone SE 2020 makes it feel small, but it doesn\u2019t lose any of that premium edge we found with the iPhone 12.",
    "You will get a slightly improved experience with the iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max thanks to their more powerful engines, bigger batteries and a variety of other tweaks, but if you\u2019re after a small iPhone you no longer have to worry about missing out on the best features.",
    "To be clear, it's no longer the best small Apple phone out there now that the iPhone 13 mini has been released. But since rumors suggest the latter might be the last small flagship iPhone, you're not missing out on much by going with the iPhone 12 mini, which is still in Apple's official lineup (at a discount to boot) and shouldn't be tough to buy.",
    "The 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display is pin-sharp, and it\u2019s markedly better than the LCD display on the iPhone 11. You\u2019ll particularly see the improvements when watching video that supports HDR.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini also has a premium design, with a protected glass design called Ceramic Shield and angular aluminum edges that will pull your mind back to the days of the iPhone 4 as soon as you first handle it. It comes in a choice of five colors (black, white, red, green or blue).",
    "It may feel like an iPhone for the nostalgists, but it\u2019s anything but when it comes to spec. The A14 Bionic chipset that powers this device might not be the fastest chipset for iPhones any more but we found it to work nearly flawlessly, whatever we threw at the phone. Plus, you've got a top-end camera array with two 12MP rear shooters that perform just as well as those on the iPhone 12.",
    "Then there\u2019s the addition of next-gen 5G connectivity technology, allowing you to experience faster speeds and easier connection when using mobile data. This is great futureproofing technology to have on board, but at launch 5G isn\u2019t widely available in many areas, meaning it won\u2019t be a transformative experience for most people right away.",
    "There\u2019s also MagSafe, Apple\u2019s new magnetic docking tech, which enables you to connect a wireless charger and other accessories (just a couple at launch) by simply snapping them to the rear of the phone.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini isn\u2019t without its frustrations, as the battery life isn\u2019t as powerful as some may hope for, and 64GB of storage doesn\u2019t feel like enough for a phone in 2021. That said, these are minor issues that many who like the choices Apple has made elsewhere will be able to live with.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini is built for those who have been longing for a smaller iPhone that is easy to use in one hand, and if you want Apple\u2019s full-on smartphone experience in a more compact package, this is the iPhone for you.",
    "Even if you're committed to Apple phones, the iPhone 12 mini has little competition if you're after a small yet high-end handset. The closest Android gets is the likes of the 5.9-inch Asus Zenfone 8, with most flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 and OnePlus 9 ranges being above 6 inches.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini will likely be reduced in the Black Friday deals so it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the best Black Friday iPhone deals. We\u2019ll be conducting a re-review in the future. However, we\u2019ve updated references within our review to highlight new features that have emerged since our tests to give you a better idea of what you might be buying.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini's launch price was $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,199, but now that the iPhone 13 range has been released, the older phones have been discounted, and you can pick up a 12 mini starting at $599 / \u00a3579 / AU$999. That's for 64GB of storage, and the price goes up for more storage \u2013 check out the chart below for full pricing, but note that even these prices have dropped since launch.",
    "For context, the iPhone 12 starts at $699 / \u00a3679 / AU$1,199, the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max starts at $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849.",
    "iPhone 12 mini is on sale now around the world after being delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The iPhone 12 mini was announced in October 2020, and then it was released on November 13 that same year.",
    "You can sometimes find it for a little less than the RRP in third-party stores, but being an iPhone this has held its value quite well.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini comes without a charging block or earbuds in the box, with Apple looking to cut down on e-waste. If you don\u2019t own the right charger or a pair of headphones, this is set to add to the cost of your device as you\u2019ll need to buy these separately.",
    "If you want some new headphones, you might want to check out Apple's AirPods Pro or our selection of the best headphones.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini\u2019s design is its unique selling point, and it\u2019s a welcome alternative for those who want a smaller iPhone, and who\u2019ve looked on in dismay as Apple has released ever-larger handsets (but also don't want the dated-looking design of the iPhone SE, Apple\u2019s other mini-sized phone).",
    "It essentially mirrors the iPhone 12 design, but in a smaller body that\u2019s easier to wrap you hand around; and despite the smaller size the phone still manages to pack a large 5.4-inch screen \u2013 more on that below",
    "With dimensions of 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.4mm it\u2019s the smallest iPhone in a long time, and that\u2019s including the iPhone SE that was released earlier in 2020. It\u2019s also light, without feeling too light \u2013 at 135 grams it\u2019s easy to slip into a pocket, but doesn\u2019t feel cheap.",
    "It may seem obvious, but if you\u2019re looking for a small iPhone and you\u2019re not too worried about the cost, then the iPhone 12 mini is an instant, don\u2019t-even-think-about-anything-else choice.",
    "Away from the phone\u2019s sheer size (or lack thereof), the iPhone 12 mini comes with flatter edges than we\u2019ve seen on recent iPhone generations. It\u2019s always nice to see design evolution in an iPhone, but this move, which nods to the look of older iPhones, won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste.",
    "We found the phone easy to hold, and it feels as premium as the other members of the iPhone 12 family. The mini\u2019s design certainly isn\u2019t a case of Apple using cheaper materials in order to hit a lower price point, and you're getting the same design elements and build quality as in the rest of the iPhone 12 range, including the aluminum frame.",
    "The rear of the phone is glass, and it doesn\u2019t feel slippery, as glass on some smartphones can. You\u2019ll quickly start to notice fingerprints appearing on the rear of the phone though.",
    "The power button is on the right side of the phone, while on the left are the volume buttons and silence switch.. On the bottom edge are the Lightning port for charging, and the stereo speaker, with a grille either side of the connector.",
    "Your color choices are blue, white, red, green, or black, and that final one you can see pictured throughout this review. It seems like a good mix of \u2018standard\u2019 colors and options for those who want something a little brighter for their phone.",
    "One of the big changes design-wise is one you can\u2019t see: MagSafe, a series of magnets inside the rear of the phone, which allow you to connect a variety of accessories such as cases, wireless chargers or a car mount.",
    "This is something Apple already offers accessories for, and we\u2019re sure to see more, both Apple and third-party in the future. It\u2019s a worthwhile update, even if you don\u2019t need to use the available accessories from day one.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini has a phenomenal screen, and it\u2019s one of the best we\u2019ve ever seen on an iPhone. For the first time, the company has brought its Super Retina XDR OLED technology to all its new iPhones, and the difference between this and LCD is remarkable.",
    "The screen here is 5.4 inches, and you\u2019re comfortably able to reach all corners when using the phone one-handed.",
    "The resolution is higher than on the iPhone 11 at 1080 x 2340, and the difference is noticeable. That resolution works out to 476 pixels per inch, and it\u2019s the sharpest display we\u2019d seen on an iPhone at launch, so while the screen is smaller than the iPhone 12 Pro or Pro Max, it\u2019s arguably better. The picture is crisp and clear, and the brightness is impressive too.",
    "The display is also HDR10-ready, meaning you\u2019ll notice more detail in dark and light areas when watching content encoded with the technology. The difference is most notable when you\u2019re watching video from sources like Netflix or iTunes, but it also means photos and other images look better.",
    "A lot of Android manufacturers are now including high-refresh-rate screens on phones, which makes for smoother images when you\u2019re gaming, watching video or scrolling your Twitter feed, but Apple hasn\u2019t included this on the iPhone 12 mini.",
    "The 12 mini is still using a 60Hz display, so the scrolling experience isn\u2019t as impressive as on some other phones that cost a similar amount \u2013 and if you\u2019re swapping from a phone that does have a higher refresh rate, you\u2019ll likely miss it here. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll notice otherwise, but it\u2019s a feature we\u2019ve enjoyed seeing come to phones, and we\u2019d like to see Apple implement it soon.",
    "On paper, the iPhone 12 mini\u2019s camera setup seems very similar to the iPhone 11\u2019s, but there are enough tweaks to justify the next-gen billing \u2013 and note that this is exactly the same camera array as on the iPhone 12 though, so you won\u2019t miss out on anything by opting for the smaller phone.",
    "There\u2019s a 12MP \u2018standard\u2019 wide-angle camera with a f/1.6 aperture, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view and an f/2.4 aperture. There\u2019s no telephoto sensor here, as on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, and that means your zoomed shots won\u2019t look as impressive, as there\u2019s no dedicated camera to do the heavy lifting.",
    "Apple\u2019s cameras are among the most capable automatic shooters on the market, and the snappers on the iPhone 12 mini performed very well in our testing.",
    "Low-light performance is the main improvement over the last-gen device, according to Apple, largely down to the main camera\u2019s aperture going from f/1.8 on the iPhone 11 to f/1.6 here, and sure enough we found that the camera performed very well in dark settings \u2013 you can see an example of this below.",
    "Apple\u2019s Night Mode works with both the rear cameras this year (and on the selfie camera), and it works in a similar way to other manufacturer\u2019s technology where the iPhone will notice the lack of light and asks you to hold the phone still, for a variable amount of time (depending on how much light is around )to ensure it can shoot.",
    "You\u2019ll often be asked to keep the phone still for anything up to 15 seconds, and if you\u2019re able to do that we found that Night Mode produced good-looking shots \u2013 although this also depends on your subjects not moving, so it\u2019s not a great option for photos of your pets or other subjects that aren\u2019t good at following orders.",
    "If you\u2019re shooting in near-complete darkness then even Night Mode is going to struggle, but you\u2019ll be impressed by how much the camera is able to brighten the exposure to make a photo taken in darkness feel like it was shot in daylight.",
    "Portrait shots - where the phone can alter your background to focus on your face either by blurring it or filling it with a color - return here, and we found them to work well on the rear camera without much fiddling around.",
    "The cameras can feel a touch slow at times, but that\u2019s likely owing to the Apple\u2019s Smart HDR 3 technology, which works automatically on some shots. This uses artificial intelligence to identify elements of what you\u2019re shooting, and optimize the exposure to highlight certain features or areas.",
    "Video recording on the iPhone 12 mini is impressive \u2013 you\u2019re able to record in 4K at 24, 30 or 60 frames per second, and Full HD recording is available alongside features like slow-motion.",
    "The biggest change here is the introduction of Dolby Vision HDR, and in our testing we found the quality to be markedly better than that of non-HDR clips we shot, with footage looking more colorful and detailed. It\u2019s a solid upgrade for those who want better video quality, even if on its own it\u2019s not a reason to buy the iPhone 12 mini.",
    "The front-facing camera is another 12MP sensor, and this will be more than suitable for selfies and video calling. The quality is impressive, and Portrait mode works fantastically well thanks to the 3D depth sensor doing the heavy lifting (it\u2019s also this sensor that powers Face ID).",
    "This isn\u2019t a huge upgrade over previous iPhones, but that isn\u2019t an issue, as the selfie camera has been consistently strong over the last few generations of iPhone. Low-light performance could be better, but it still works well enough \u2013 and, as mentioned, Night Mode is available here too, so your night-time selfies should look just as good as your daytime ones.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini may be small, but it certainly doesn\u2019t lack power. Apple's chipset, the A14 Bionic, is the same processor that you\u2019ll find in the rest of the iPhone 12 family. While it's not the latest chipset any more, it's still suitably powerful.",
    "We\u2019ve previously seen this in the iPad Air, as well as the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and it performs just as well here. We put the chipset through its paces with a variety of multi-tasking activities, and the A14 Bionic always managed to keep pace with everything we wanted it to do, including running graphically demanding games.",
    "There\u2019s 4GB of RAM on tap, and while that may not match a lot of other manufacturers on paper, we found that the iPhone 12 mini never lacked for grunt. If you need a little more power for high-end video processing or similar, then the 12 Pro series packs 6GB of RAM, but for most people 4GB is fine.",
    "One issue we do have is the onboard storage: you\u2019ve got the choice of 64GB, 128GB or 256GB for the iPhone 12 mini. If you need more, you\u2019ll have to opt for an iPhone 12 Pro if you\u2019re a power user, which starts at 128GB and goes all the way up to 512GB",
    "The fact is 64GB isn\u2019t much space on a phone these days, and most people won't take long to fill it up with apps, photos, music and other media.",
    "We found that after just a week of loading our phone with apps and media we were nearing the limit, so it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need more space if you don\u2019t want to be greeted by the 'storage full' notification at some point.",
    "The iPhone 12 mini comes running iOS 14.2 out of the box, so you've got all the benefits of the latest version of Apple's mobile OS, such as the App Library and home screen widgets.",
    "Since launch it's received a few small updates, bringing it up to iOS 15 at the time of writing. These have added things like App Tracking Transparency, new emojis, Apple Fitness Plus, ProRaw mode for the camera, SharePlay, Focus and much more.",
    "You should expect this phone to get updates for at least the next few years too, as Apple is consistent with its software upgrades.",
    "Apple has yet to confirm the exact battery size on the iPhone 12 mini, but filings from a mobile agency in Brazil suggest it's a 2227mAh cell. As with most recent iPhone models, the battery life has improved over older devices, but it still isn\u2019t going to give you the best life.",
    "We found that the iPhone 12 mini would last us for a full day from a single charge, but on the odd occasion it would die off toward 10pm after a high day of usage. This was a particularly intensive day, though, and on other busy days we also found the phone would make it through to bedtime.",
    "In a mid-to-high intensity use day, we found the iPhone 12 mini got to the end of the day with 22% left in the tank. That was with four hours and 20 minutes of screen-on time, and a variety of tasks running in the background such as music playback and notifications.",
    "We had other days where we managed over six hours of usage, but that was often when we didn\u2019t connect to a mobile unit and we didn\u2019t take the phone out of the house as much.",
    "If you\u2019re switching between 5G and 4G connectivity while on the go, you\u2019re likely to see the battery life drop down from that as well. We found on the days where we were away from Wi-Fi \u2013 few and far between owing to lockdown restrictions \u2013 the battery life would drop faster.",
    "Again, this will offer a solid day of battery life for a middling amount of usage, but if you\u2019re using your phone consistently throughout the day on mobile networks, you\u2019ll find this phone will need a recharge mid-way through the day.",
    "Apple says the iPhone 12 mini will last for up to 15 hours of video playback, while the iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 both are capable of 11 hours, and those claims are accurate based on our testing, and it\u2019s reflective of how the battery life differs between the the iPhone 12 mini and the larger iPhone 12.",
    "Apple has improved its fast-charging technology here over the iPhone 11 a touch, meaning you now get 20W fast-charging. What does that really mean? We found the iPhone 12 mini was able to charge from zero to 60% in just 30 minutes.",
    "It\u2019s also important to note that this was using a specific charging block provided by Apple. If you want to make the most of these speeds, you\u2019ll need to buy this charging block (if you don\u2019t already own it) for $19 / \u00a319 / AU$29.",
    "This is part of Apple\u2019s mission to cutdown on ewaste, so you only have a charging cable in the box. The problem is, the cable is USB-C to Lightning, which is a connector that many who previously own an iPhone don\u2019t have, so it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have to buy a charger to make the most of wired charging.",
    "Qi wireless charging makes a return here for the iPhone 12 mini, and this generally worked well in our testing. Using the MagSafe fast-charger (the official Apple one is 12W) we found the phone was able to charge 12% in half an hour.",
    "This is slower than all the other members of the iPhone 12 family. Exactly why that is is unclear, and it means you\u2019ll get a slightly slower charging phone here from Apple if you truly do want that top-end spec.",
    "You\u2019re likely to find the battery life on the iPhone 12 mini is better than any older iPhone such as an iPhone 8, especially if you\u2019ve been using an older phone for a few years, but this isn\u2019t going to be the best battery life you can get from a smartphone.",
    "We regularly found the battery would die before the end of a full day (although it did often make it close to the full stretch, and just needed a quick recharge right before the end of the day) so that may prove frustrating for some power users.",
