    "It\u2019s disappointing that the Intel Core i9-11900K isn\u2019t a bigger update. It, along with the rest of the 11th-gen CPUs, seem like minor refreshes to hold us over until something special comes along. That\u2019s not to say that it isn\u2019t a powerful desktop chip. It is and it can handle just about anything you want it to. With that said, it\u2019s not a product that\u2019s going to keep Intel relevant in an increasingly competitive market, especially with such impressive processors like the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X available.",
    "It\u2019s no wonder considering that the Intel Core i9-11900K takes 10nm Ice Lake architecture and backports it to a 14nm process, for a more limited 8-core, 16-thread design. While it does have exceptional single-core performance, it just can\u2019t keep up with the competition when multi-core processes enter the picture. That means this CPU is in a strange position in the market, as it\u2019s not worth the price for anyone except gamers. Particularly, with Intel\u2019s 12th-generation Alder Lake-S processors supposedly around the corner, rumored to arrive as soon as November 2021 with promises to crush AMD\u2019s best in new leaked benchmarks.",
    "There\u2019s just not a lot to be excited about with the 11900K compared to other CPUs, especially since plenty of other processors can do better.",
    "The Intel Core i9-11900K will be available March 30, with a suggested retail price of $539 (about \u00a3390, AU$710). That price positions this processor as a direct replacement for the Intel Core i9-10900K and a competitor to the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X.",
    "Intel\u2019s processors have seemed to elude the recent availability problems faced by graphics cards and AMD processors recently, so we\u2019re not sure if the prices will go up much higher.",
    "However, when prices do get back to normal across the industry, the Intel Core i9-11900K doesn\u2019t look particularly great when put up against the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, or even the much cheaper $449 (\u00a3419, AU$799) AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. Intel does rack up some wins in some single-threaded applications and games. But when you\u2019re willing to spend nearly a thousand bucks on just your CPU and motherboard, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll just be using your computer to play some Overwatch.",
    "For folks that are looking to get in on some creative applications without jumping to an HEDT (high end desktop) platform, you\u2019re probably going to want to look elsewhere.",
    "Like every other desktop platform launched since Skylake back in 2015, the Intel Core i9-11900K is based on the Rocket Lake-S architecture \u2013 which is manufactured on a 14nm process. However, unlike Comet Lake, Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake before it, this isn\u2019t just another iteration of Skylake itself.",
    "Rather, Intel took the core design of its 10nm Ice Lake processors, which are primarily found in laptops, and backported it to the 14nm manufacturing process. Intel claims that this lets it push clock speeds higher than its 10nm process would allow, which is important for gaming. However, when combined with the Intel Xe graphics present on the die, there is less room on the chip for CPU cores, which means that the Intel Core i9-11900K has just 8 CPU cores, down from the 10-core design of the Intel Core i9-10900K.",
    "That sounds bad, but this new Cypress Cove core does allow Intel to not only push clock speeds slightly higher \u2013 up to 5.3GHz on a single core \u2013 but also allows for a pretty substantial 19% boost in Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) performance.",
    "However, it looks like a pretty big part of the improvement that comes with Cypress Cove results in higher power consumption and, with it, higher temperatures.",
    "During heavy workloads, particularly those like Blender, the Intel Core i9-11900K can reach up to a whopping 203W of power consumption, and that\u2019s with disabling the Multi-Core enhancement that the Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero enabled by default. Having that option enabled pushed power consumption all the way up to around 230W, which is more than a lot of modern graphics cards will use.",
    "With power consumption this high, temperatures can also jump up considerably. With all stock settings, the Intel Core i9-11900K can reach up to 82\u00b0C, a pretty considerable jump over the 76\u00b0C that the Intel Core i9-10900K reaches under the same conditions. We\u2019re not using a lightweight CPU cooler either \u2013 this is with a 360mm AIO cooler, so if you\u2019re thinking about grabbing this processor, consider grabbing a robust cooler as well.",
    "It doesn\u2019t look too good, either, that the Intel Core i9-11900K arrives just weeks after Team Blue discontinued its CPU overclocking warranty. We typically don\u2019t cover overclocking in our reviews, as it still voids your warranty, but with these processors consuming more power and spitting out more heat than ever before, overclocking is going to be even more difficult.",
    "If you\u2019ve been lucky enough to get your hands on a power-hungry graphics card, like the RTX 3090 and you were hoping to pair it with this processor, it\u2019s probably a good idea to make sure you have a power supply that can handle the load.",
    "It\u2019s not all bad, though. With the Intel Core i9-11900K, Intel has finally worked in PCIe 4.0 support, which means you will be able to use the best SSDs on the market. Even some Z490 boards will be able to use this functionality, but you\u2019re going to want to check your motherboard\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s website to see if it\u2019s supported.",
    "Don\u2019t get us wrong, the Intel Core i9-11900K is a fine processor. No matter what test we threw at the little chunk of silicon, it was able handle it quickly and efficiently. Gaming, content creation and even just messing around on the desktop are all extremely quick, but it\u2019s essentially the same experience you\u2019ll get anywhere these days. We\u2019re lucky enough to be living in a time where pretty much any desktop processor will be more than enough for what most people are going to need. The differences, then, lie in how quickly things get done.",
    "And when you\u2019re going to be spending this much on a processor, you\u2019re likely going to be using it for a multitude of different things, and when it comes to creative workloads, the Intel Core i9-11900K starts to seriously fall behind its main competition, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X.",
    "In Blender, the 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is a whopping 58% faster than the Intel Core i9-11900K, while costing just 2% more. Likewise, in the Puget Adobe Premiere benchmark, the Core i9-11900K was 13% slower. Which means that both with 3D modeling and video editing, the Intel Core i9-11900K is significantly slower than the competition.",
    "Things look a little better when we start to look at gaming benchmarks, which is where Intel is focusing all of its marketing this time around. In the 3DMark Time Spy test, the Intel Core i9-11900K managed a CPU score of 13,301 over the Ryzen 9 5900X\u2019s 12,163, a 9% boost.",
    "When we look at actual games, though, it\u2019s pretty much a wash. We tested Total War: Three Kingdoms and Metro Exodus, both at 1080p low settings and paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, so that as much of the workload is pushed to the processor as possible. And, well, the Intel Core i9-11900K and the Ryzen 9 5900X are nearly identical in these tests.",
    "There is a more noticeable difference over older processors, though. For instance, the Intel Core i9-11900K was about 7% faster than the Intel Core i9-10900K in Total War. That\u2019s probably not enough to convince anyone to upgrade from the 10900K, but it is movement in the right direction.",
    "But even that isn\u2019t the case across the board. The 11900K\u2019s loss of two cores means that in heavily threaded applications like Blender or Adobe Premiere, 2020\u2019s Intel Core i9-10900K is noticeably faster than the brand new chip.",
    "Even more damning is that the Intel core i9-11900K is significantly slower than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a processor that costs nearly a hundred bucks less. AMD\u2019s 8 core champion topples the 11900K in both gaming and content creation, only losing to team blue in purely synthetic single-core benchmarks.",
    "While AMD continues to release significantly faster processors year after year, the Intel Core i9-11900K shows just how far behind Intel is, and feels like a desperate attempt to hold on to relevance while the company works on its true next step. We just wish Intel skipped this generation and came back to deliver something truly valuable with its 12th-generation processors. Hopefully we don\u2019t have to wait long to see what it has to offer.",
