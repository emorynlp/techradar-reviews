  "summary": "A powerful, whisper-quiet sonic toothbrush let down by an awkward mobile app",
  "verdict": "The Oclean X Pro Elite is a thoughtfully designed electric toothbrush with a powerful motor that's whisper-quiet even on its highest settings. Its color touchscreen is responsive (even when used with wet hands), and makes it easy to pick your preferred mode and intensity. Despite being near silent when used with your mouth closed, it's a powerful performer, and cleans as thoroughly as a Sonicare brush thanks to its rapid vibrations and small brush head that easily reaches tricky-to-access areas. Unfortunately, it's let down by a mobile app that's unnecessarily complicated, and adds far more options than are practical for routine oral hygiene. There's no real-time brushing feedback either, despite the handle having an accelerometer to track its location. Overall, it's an excellent brush when used without your phone, but connecting it to the app detracts from the experience.",

    "The Oclean X Pro Elite is an excellent sonic electric toothbrush \u2013 well designed and astonishingly quiet. In fact, it\u2019s barely audible when used with your mouth closed, even on its highest power settings. The handle has a sleek design, and its touchscreen menus make choosing your preferred option a breeze, even with wet hands.",
    "It\u2019s affordable too \u2013 one of the cheapest smart toothbrushes you can buy today \u2013 and replacement heads are reasonably priced too (particularly when bundled with a sterilizing unit).",
    "It\u2019s a shame we can\u2019t heap the same praise on the Oclean app, which overwhelms the user with an abundance of options that over-complicate what should be a simple daily routine. The number of options is dizzying, the brushing instructions are excessively complicated, and the ability to create your own custom brushing plan (taking your pick from up to 32 intensity settings) just isn\u2019t necessary with all the presets available.",
    "Although the brush handle contains an accelerometer to track its position as you clean your teeth, the app doesn\u2019t present this data in real time, so you can\u2019t adapt your brushing technique on the fly as you can with a high-end Oral-B or Philips brush. This information is synced with the app once you\u2019ve finished brushing so you can act on it next time, but it\u2019s not as useful as seeing a map of your teeth that updates as you clean each quadrant.",
    "The Oclean X Pro Elite works extremely well by itself, and is easy to recommend as a premium electric toothbrush if you\u2019re not interested in the \u2018smart\u2019 features. If you\u2019re really interested in getting detailed feedback on your brushing, however, there are better options around.",
    "The Oclean X Pro Elite is usually priced at $99.99 / \u00a375 / AU$141, but at the time of writing is discounted to $79.99 / \u00a356 / AU$106, making it one of the cheapest smart electric toothbrushes around.",
    "That price will get you the brush, plus one head. Bundles with additional heads and a sterilizing unit are also available for only a little more, so it\u2019s well worth checking these out. Extra heads start at $9.99 / \u00a38 / AU$15 for two (down from $15.99 / \u00a38 / AU$23).",
    "Our review model also came with a carry case for the brush handle and two heads, which is sold separately for $12.99 / \u00a310 / AU$19 (down from $19.99 / \u00a315 / AU$29).",
    "The brush is available in one color: a tasteful light gray, with a slightly textured surface, which provides a little extra grip for wet hands. On the handle is a single button, which serves to turn the brush on and off, plus a large color touchscreen that allows you to switch between modes by swiping and tapping. The screen also shows a timer while you brush, though this can be tough to see while you\u2019re holding it, even in a mirror.",
    "The Oclean X Pro Elite\u2019s charging base is excellent. Most electric toothbrushes have a recess in the bottom, which fits onto a pronged base, and had a tendency to collect water and toothbrush residue unless you\u2019re utterly meticulous about drying your brush after each use. The bottom of the Oclean X Pro Elite brush handle is completely flat, with nowhere for gunk to build up, and the charger has a soft silicone cup that holds it securely in place, and can be easily removed for cleaning.",
    "Unfortunately, there\u2019s no cable or adapter for charging your brush from a bathroom shaver socket \u2013 only a USB connector. It seems like a strange omission considering how carefully the rest of the setup has been designed.",
    "The Oclean X Pro Elite also comes with a magnetic mount so you can attach your brush to your bathroom tiles. It\u2019s secured to the wall firmly with an adhesive pad, but won\u2019t keep your brush charged. It\u2019s just a way to keep it out of the way between charges if you\u2019ve no room for the base by your sink.",
    "Unlike most of the other electric toothbrushes we\u2019ve tested, the Oclean X Pro Elite doesn\u2019t come with a travel case, and if you buy one separately, it\u2019ll only be to protect the brush; the case doesn\u2019t serve as a power pack to keep the brush charged on the move like that of the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean 9000, or the Oral-B Genius X.",
    "The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the Oclean X Pro Elite is that it\u2019s quiet \u2013 even quieter than the Oral-B Series 9. In fact, it\u2019s barely audible with your mouth closed, which might lead you to believe that its action is less powerful than noisier brushes. That\u2019s not the case, though \u2013 the X Pro Elite is capable of vibrating up to 42,000 times per minute on its highest setting.",
    "This is a smart toothbrush with its own mobile app, but it works perfectly well by itself. There are four modes to choose from on the brush handle (clean, sensitive, massage, and white), and you can pick an intensity setting (from one to four) plus a duration. It\u2019s a simple system, and the brush\u2019s touchscreen makes it easy to pick your preferred options.",
    "In our tests, we preferred the \u2018white\u2019 mode on a moderate intensity, which gave a thorough clean \u2013 as proven by use of disclosing tablets after use. Even on this relatively high setting, the brush remains whisper quiet, so you won\u2019t disturb anyone in your household who\u2019s sleeping while you\u2019re in the bathroom.",
    "Overall, it\u2019s a well designed brush that\u2019s a pleasure to use. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t say the same for the smartphone app.",
    "The Oclean app is available for iOS and Android, and is simple to set up; just register an account and click the link in the confirmation email. Although it\u2019s not mentioned in the brush\u2019s manual, we found that we had to keep the brush in its charging base while it was pairing; otherwise the brush would turn off before the process had finished. After this, we had no further Bluetooth issues.",
    "Once your brush is paired, you\u2019ll find yourself presented with an app that\u2019s attractive, but overwhelming, and packed with unnecessary features (including the ability to pick a background wallpaper to match your bathroom).",
    "Whereas the brush handle offers a perfectly reasonable selection of brushing modes and intensities, the app complicates matters with dedicated \u2018plans\u2019 to suit different oral hygiene needs. There\u2019s a staggering array of 12 different presets to choose from, including standard cleaning, gentle teeth spa, newbie whitening, and braces cleaning.",
    "If you find all the options overwhelming (which is quite likely) tap \u2018Smart push\u2019 and you\u2019ll be prompted to enter some details about your teeth and lifestyle, which the app will use to recommend a particular setting. Our tea-drinking habit resulted in a recommendation of newbie whitening.",

Our tea-drinking habit resulted in a recommendation of newbie whitening.",
    "Now things get really complicated. These plans don\u2019t simply affect the intensity, duration, and type of vibrations produced by the brush \u2013 they also come with specific instructions to follow, advising you which surfaces to brush for how long. It\u2019s clear what \u2018right palate side\u2019 and \u2018left cheek side\u2019 mean, but \u2018your dedicated zone\u2019 is something of a mystery. These steps aren\u2019t shown on the app\u2019s screen as you brush, so you\u2019ll need to follow them on your phone\u2019s screen, changing to the next one each time the brush vibration changes.",
    "Still not satisfied with the options available? You can also create your own plan, choosing how long you want to spend cleaning each quadrant of your mouth, and taking your pick from 32 intensity settings.",
    "The brush handle includes an accelerometer that monitors its position in your mouth as you clean, but unlike smart toothbrushes from Philips and Oral-B, the Oclean app doesn\u2019t show this data in real time. Instead, the info syncs with the app after you\u2019ve finished, and presents you with a map of your brushing efforts, together with a score. Remember this info, and you should be able to achieve a better rating.",
    "This system is a little strange. Despite only achieving a score of \u2018middle\u2019 for both pressure and coverage area, with \u2018great\u2019 for duration, we were given an overall score of 89 and a rating of \u2018excellent\u2019. It\u2019s worth delving into your results though, because tapping the question mark icon beside \u2018coverage\u2019 shows you exactly which surfaces you reached, and which you missed (areas highlighted in red being insufficiently cleaned).",
    "The Oclean X Pro Elite seems to be more picky than Oral-B and Philips brushes when it comes to covering all your teeth surfaces, which may be beneficial if your dentist tells you that you often miss a particular spot.",
    "Overall, we preferred using the brush by itself, without the app. It\u2019s an excellent piece of hardware (its powerful but near-silent motor is superb), and gives you all the options you need on its touchscreen. It\u2019s certainly comprehensive, but we feel the app adds little extra value."
