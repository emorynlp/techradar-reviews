    "Scouted is one of the newer job sites on the scene, and any new site will need to have a different approach to stand out against the old hands and the recognized names.",
    "Happily, Scouted has thrown itself into a new role with gusto. This is one of the only job sites that doesn\u2019t focus on your resume when it comes to finding a new position \u2013 instead, this website tries to treat people\u2019s personalities and traits with just as much weight.",
    "The new approach is evident as soon as you load Scouted\u2019s website. It\u2019s got a modern design that doesn\u2019t rely on the search engine-style interfaces that you\u2019ll find elsewhere.",
    "Instead, you\u2019ve got to sign up for a free account and build a profile using a series of questions and evaluations. This takes longer than a sign-up on most job sites, but it\u2019s an in-depth process that builds the personality profile of each user.",
    "You start by answering questions about your job and education history, and you can upload your resume to the site so Scouted has a clear picture of your past. You tell the site why you\u2019re leaving your current job and what you\u2019re looking for in the future, and then the site diverges from the norm. You\u2019re given five questions about your life, personality and preferences, and you can record video answers and send them off to Scouted. It takes about ten minutes, and you don\u2019t have to complete them \u2013 but many of the jobs on Scouted require these virtual interview answers, and Scouted claims that people who answer these questions are 58% more likely to be successful in their job search.",
    "Your answers, videos and data are sent off, and Scouted uses AI data analysis to learn about each user and present them with relevant job openings.",
    "It\u2019s a smart system that tries to place equal weight on personality and potential instead of just focusing on the resume. And while this new site doesn\u2019t have the sheer number of job listings as most rivals, its approach makes it worthwhile if you want to explore every avenue during your job search \u2013 especially as it\u2019s free for job seekers. Also bear in mind that the site\u2019s litany of questions and its virtual interview requirements mean that it takes longer to get going with Scouted than on most other job boards.",
    "It\u2019s a very slick site, too. The user interface is notably more modern and cleaner than most other job-seeking sites, which makes it easy to get going once you\u2019ve completed the setup process. You can filter results by experience level, industry, role and location, and you can opt in or out of listings that require virtual interview answers.",
    "Open your profile and you\u2019ll find an attractive, modern design that allows you to see which parts you still need to complete, and you can add optional information like extra personality notes and photos, your skills, and what sort of salary you need. You can specify different industry and work culture preferences, and Scouted has a dashboard that instantly shows the progress of your applications. The site\u2019s final strand is an advice portal that\u2019s packed with articles.",
    "Scouted is one of the most intriguing job sites on the market today, and it offers a markedly different experience than all of its big-name rivals.",
    "There\u2019s an awful lot to like here. Scouted\u2019s approach does a tremendous job of combining your resume, personality and potential in order to deliver job listings and opportunities that you won\u2019t get elsewhere \u2013 and those openings will be better suited to you, too.",
    "Scouted\u2019s unique approach does mean there are some downsides. You won\u2019t find as many job listings here as you\u2019ll see elsewhere, and it does take a little bit of time and trust in the process to get results.",
    "It\u2019s a smart system, though, and the concentration on personality traits means that it\u2019s especially useful for college graduates or people who want to change careers \u2013 anyone who doesn\u2019t have the benefit of a packed resume in their chosen field."
