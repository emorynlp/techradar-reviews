    "The Samsung AU9000 will betray its price-point every now and then \u2013 you\u2019ll be struck by a lack of out-and-out brightness, or some especially vague sound, or some visible difficulties when upscaling low-resolution content. But most of the time, you\u2019ll just sit and revel in the brilliantly accomplished images issuing from a screen far more slender than you might have been anticipating.",
    "Samsung has been a major player in the mainstream TV market for ages now, yet the AU9000 still seems like a remarkable achievement at the money. It\u2019s a remarkably slender device, is operated using one of the leading smart TV interfaces, is generously specified and delivers outstanding pictures.",
    "Obviously it\u2019s not perfect at such a low price: sound is the very definition of \u2018dull\u2019 and it can act up when asked to do a big upscaling job. But that\u2019s to miss the point of what Samsung has done \u2013 serve up a TV that looks, both physically and in terms of its picture quality, considerably more expensive than it actually is.",
    "The Samsung AU9000 is on sale now in 43-inch, 50-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes.",
    "The 50-inch model reviewed here is currently priced at \u00a3699 in the UK \u2013 although if our experience of Samsung\u2019s previous high-volume models is anything to go by, that price will become more attractive sooner rather than later.",
    "In the United States, you should expect to pay around $969. That\u2019s based purely on exchange rates, of course, because Samsung is the sort of company that likes to alter model numbers for different territories \u2013 and as yet we\u2019re unable to confirm what this TV might be called in America.",
    "The same calculation gives an Australian price of AU$1259. It\u2019s not uncommon for Australian consumers to find European products disproportionately expensive but, equally, Korean brands like Samsung are able to keep Australian prices competitive. If and when Samsung confirms this television\u2019s model number for the Australian market, we\u2019ll be able to update this information.",
    "By now, we\u2019re all used to expecting a certain degree of sophistication from Samsung\u2019s television designs, even when the television in question is a midrange, mainstream volume seller. And sure enough, the 50AU9000 is an elegant and understated looker \u2013 and, when viewed in profile, looks quite remarkably slender.",
    "It\u2019s the final figure in the Samsung\u2019s 1119 x 645 x 26mm (h x w x d) measurements that\u2019s the most arresting. That depth is consistent, too \u2013 so if you decide to wall-mount your TV, it\u2019ll sit almost flush. Samsung, with no apparent sense of hyperbole, calls this design language \u2018AirSlim\u2019.",
    "If you\u2019d rather put it on a shelf or table-top, though, it\u2019s supplied with a couple of unremarkable push-and-click feet. They have a little cable management in their rear portions, too, which is useful as long as your cables aren\u2019t too expensive and chunky.",
    "From the front, the AU9000 looks clean enough. The bezel is minimal around the top and sides \u2013 and even if the bottom portion is both a bit heftier and doesn\u2019t join the main frame seamlessly at either end, that\u2019s the sort of thing you notice while installing the screen and then never give another thought to. The plastics feel nice enough, even on the rear panel, and as is usual with Samsung there\u2019s an impression of quality construction.",
    "At the rear of the screen there are three HDMI inputs (one of which is eARC-enabled, and all three of which cover the ALLM and FreeSync aspects of HDMI 2.1 specification). Further physical connectivity is present in the form of an Ethernet socket, a couple of USB 2.0 inputs, a CI slot and an aerial post for the terrestrial TV tuner. There\u2019s a digital optical output too, for use with legacy soundbars and so on. Wireless connectivity is present in the shape of dual-band wi-fi and Bluetooth 5.2.",
    "For quite a while, Samsung\u2019s Tizen smart TV interface was obviously and unarguably the best around. In fact, it\u2019s a measure of just how good it is that it remains one of the best interfaces currently available, despite everyone from LG to Hisense upping their smart TV game in response. The Tizen interface incorporated into the AU9000 is clean, logical, comprehensive and a straightforward pleasure to use.",
    "The available content is extensive, with all the worthwhile apps (and plenty that aren\u2019t quite so worthwhile, too) on board. There\u2019s no Freeview Play, admittedly, but every UK broadcaster\u2019s catch-up service is available, alongside the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Apple TV \u2013 so whether you subscribe to streaming services or not, you shouldn\u2019t be short of content to watch. And thanks to that Tizen interface, you shouldn\u2019t struggle to find it, either.",
    "Set-up menus are similarly logical, and strike a nice balance between brevity and comprehensiveness. Achieving a picture that scrolls smoothly, defines edges confidently, and is decently bright and detailed, shouldn\u2019t take long. Getting a colour balance you\u2019re convinced by may take just a little longer.",
    "Both remote control handsets are eminently usable. The full-function wand is rather more prosaic in the way it looks and feels, admittedly, and some buttons feel a bit too compact. The stripped-back \u2018major functions\u2019 alternative is nicer to hold and use, and will likely be the default choice for most.",
    "That\u2019s unless you want to use Samsung\u2019s Smart Things control app, at least. It\u2019s a clean interface, and performs stably \u2013 but it\u2019s quite nosy. Short of inside leg measurement, there\u2019s very little it doesn\u2019t want to know about you, which some folks are guaranteed to find off-putting.",
    "Voice-control is available too. Unsurprisingly Siri isn\u2019t available, but Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant both are. For the deeply obtuse (or for Samsung employees), Bixby voice assistance is available too.",
    "If you\u2019re intending to see the AU9000 perform at its best, then you\u2019ll need to serve it some native 4K content with HDR10+ augmentation \u2013 because, as is always the case (and as is always galling) with Samsung, there\u2019s no Dolby Vision dynamic metadata HDR standard on the spec-sheet.",
    "Still, a 4K HDR10+ disc of the impeccable remaster of Kubrick\u2019s The Shining turns out to be the right stuff \u2013 and when given the best chance, this Samsung proves an absorbing and accomplished watch.",
    "When written down, edge-lit backlighting and peak brightness of less than 350 nits doesn\u2019t look all that promising in terms of contrast or visual dynamism \u2013 but the Samsung outperforms that on-paper specification quite comfortably. There\u2019s decent depth to black tones, and they\u2019re very acceptably detailed at the same time \u2013 but what\u2019s even more impressive is the variation and smooth gradation of black shades. Backlighting control is confident too, and even the darkest scenes with minimal lighting resist significant blooming or haloing. And while white tones hardly pop from the screen, they\u2019re clean and equally detailed \u2013 so while contrasts are far from the widest you\u2019ve ever seen (even at this unremarkable price-point), they\u2019re convincing nevertheless.",
    "The colour palette, too, is naturalistic and wide-ranging. Skin-tones are convincing, with more than enough fine detail carried over to make the subtleties of a complexion obvious. Kubrick\u2019s trademark primary tones, such as the bright red of the Gold Room lavatories in the Overlook Hotel, are dynamic without being in any way over-driven, while the less glaring tones in the reception area are muted without being dull.",
    "The AU9000 draws a nice smooth edge, keeping a lid on shimmering or doubling of images even when the on-screen motion gets properly testing. One of the trickiest moments of all, right at the start of the film (an airborne camera follows a car up a mountain road from way overhead, while slim blue text scrolls from the bottom to the top of the screen) is handled with real competence \u2013 there\u2019s not quite the buttery smoothness that some of Samsung\u2019s pricier televisions will treat you to, but it\u2019s not as if the AU9000 will have you howling with frustration.",
    "Thanks to its Crystal Processor 4K, the Samsung\u2019s also a very adept upscaler of lower-resolution content. Certainly the endless colours and textures of the BBC\u2019s The Great British Sewing Bee enjoy worthwhile variation, and contrasts stay clean and obvious too. There\u2019s a little hesitancy when it comes to edge definition and motion control, but it\u2019s minor enough to be easily ignored. Step down in source quality from there, though, and the results are predictable \u2013 softness of image, hesitancy of motion, significant lack of detail. Any 4K TV would struggle with a daytime TV repeat of Murder, She Wrote and the 50AU9000 is no exception.",
    "As far as gaming goes, the news is at least partially good. Each of the Samsung\u2019s three HDMI inputs can cope with the Auto Low Latency Mode and FreeSync aspects of a next-gen console\u2019s specification \u2013 latency is down below 10m/s at worst and sub-6.0m/s at best. Add in some complicated processing that intends to mimic a 4K/120Hz refresh rate, and the ability to accommodate the 32:9 aspect ratio some PC games are so enamoured of, and the AU9000 isn\u2019t a bad gaming companion at all.",
    "It\u2019s not uncommon for a mainstream TV to betray its price-point more readily with the sound it makes than with the images it produces. And so it proves with the AU9000.",
    "Samsung\u2019s not very forthcoming about the size and composition of the two drivers fitted to the lower apportion of the screen. It\u2019s prepared to admit they enjoy a total of 20 watts of power, though. And it\u2019s happy to suggest its \u2018Object Tracking Lite\u2019 algorithms can coax a meaningful impression of height out of the audio presentation too.",
    "It\u2019s fair to say this last part is a red herring. The point-source of sound from the Samsung is hazy, certainly, but that\u2019s not the same as delivering an impression of height \u2013 not at all. And as far as tonality goes, the 50AU9000 sounds tentative and rather flat. It\u2019s game, certainly \u2013 wind the volume upwards and it resists hardening or coarsening quite commendably. But really, it\u2019s as far removed from the standard of the images the Samsung produces as these things ever are.",
    "So not for the first time, we find ourselves strongly pushing the idea of a soundbar to bring your sonic presentation up to snuff. Given that the AU9000 is ready to contribute to a \u2018Q Symphony\u2019 arrangement with an appropriate Samsung soundbar \u2013 that\u2019s when the TV\u2019s speakers join in with, rather than are muted by, an attached soundbar, we\u2019d particularly suggest looking into that option. But in any event, try and keep a little of your budget aside \u2013 an inexpensive soundbar is the least these images deserve."
