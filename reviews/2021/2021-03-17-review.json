    "Five years on and Sling TV is still going strong \u2013 according to DISH, the service reached a record-high 2.4 million subscribers at the end of 2018, making it the most popular live TV streaming service in America.",
    "Since 2014, Sling TV has been sticking a wooden stake into traditional cable operators' ice-cold hearts by offering the same channels without the costly bill at the end of the month, not to mention the expensive equipment cluttering up the space underneath your TV.",
    "Sling isn't the only live TV streaming game in town \u2013 there's Hulu with Live TV, AT&T has its TV replacement called DirecTV Now and YouTube has YouTube TV \u2013 but of them all, if cost of cable is what made you cut the cord, Sling's $35 per month package is still the best way to watch TV on the go.",
    "Said simply, Sling TV is live TV streaming whenever and wherever. No contracts, no equipment and no costly statement. It's a great value if you like the channel offerings and provided you have a strong internet connection where you live.",
    "For example, if you want to watch CNN, Comedy Central, TBS, The Travel Channel and History, and you have a decent internet package, then Sling Blue is an unbeatable value. Sling Orange is good for watching ESPN and The Disney Channel, and again requires a strong internet connection to really shine.",
    "If you're not seeing channels in that lineup that appeal to you \u2013 or you don't feel like your internet speeds are fast enough for streaming \u2013 then Sling TV is probably not going to be the best option out there for you. Maybe traditional cable, an HD antenna or a streaming stick with Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video is better, or another live TV service like YouTube TV could work instead.",
    "Whether it's a shameless way to encourage people to try out the service or a genuinely benevolent act, Sling TV has over 5,000 films and TV shows that you can watch for free whenever you want.",
    "OK, so there isn't much available that will change your life. But from time-to-time they throw episodes of quality programming such as Rick and Morty and American Gods on there. And there are so many films available that's likely to be something on there to suit your needs \u2013 especially if you're after some thought-free comfort watching or, on the opposite side of the spectrum, spooky horror films.",
    "There's no credit card or registration required, you just head to the Sling website and start watching,",
    "Create an account on DISH's website and use that info to login to the app on iOS, Android, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick, Xbox One, Chromecast via the Sling TV app, any Android TV system and nearly every Roku device.",
    "DISH and LG have a partnership that brings the live TV streaming service to any of the Korean manufacturer's webOS smart TVs and it's also available on Roku TVs, Vizio SmartCast TVs and select Samsung smart TVs.",
    "Want to watch it directly on your laptop? For awhile Sling TV offered a desktop app that you could download to watch the streaming service \u2013 but, starting in August, you can now view it directly in-browser thanks to its new Google Chrome beta for PC and Mac.",
    "A complete list of supported products can be found on Sling's website.",
    "The system is more eloquent than apps like TWC TV or Xfinity, and while the latter is almost universally available, trying to remember whose name and email you use to login can ruin a session before it even starts.",
    "It's also worth noting that Sling TV has partnered up with T-Mobile to offer subscribers unlimited streaming video on their T-Mobile smartphones and tablets without eating into their LTE data.",
    "Channel packages can be a bit confusing, but it helps if you imagine them like a cafeteria lunch line. First things first: you're going to need an entree to get started. Your two options are Sling Orange and Sling Blue. If you're the only person who plans on watching Sling TV in the house, you want Orange. If you plan on sharing it with the whole family, you're going to want to go Blue.",
    "So far, channels on the basic, $35-per-month plan (now called Sling Orange) include ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, TNT, TBS, HGTV, DIY Network, Food Network, Travel Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, ABC Family, Disney Channel, AMC, IFC and, most recently, A&E, History, H2, Lifetime, Bloomberg, Newsy, Flama, a music entertainment channel called AXS TV and, most recently, a tech channel called Cheddar that you can only find on Sling TV.",
    "Sling Blue shares many of the same channels, but allows more than one person to be watching at a time and costs $35 per month. It also should be noted that Sling Blue doesn\u2019t have any of the Disney-owned channels, and instead has channels from the Fox, NBC and Viacom families, including CSN.",
    "Once you've selected your basic package, it's time to look at the dessert options.",
    "If you're looking to tack on some of the premium channels, Sling TV offers both HBO and Cinemax for $15 and $10 a month, respectively, however they require a subscription to the \"Best of Live TV\" package. Not to be left out, STARZ has also joined the premium pay-TV group by offering its channels, STARZ and STARZ Encore, for an extra $9 per month. And now, completing the premium offerings, SHOWTIME has also signed to Sling and will offer a streaming version of its channel for $10 extra per month.",
    "In addition to the two base subscriptions and the premium options listed above, 11 add-on packages are available for an additional $5 apiece each month:",
    "These channel line-ups excel at offering additional niche programming for a few extra bucks per month. Not seeing something you like? Sling TV often adds to this channel line-up and creates totally new packages every few months.",
    "Now, remember when you asked about Slingbox? Well, it's true, Sling TV and Slingbox share a few similarities beyond the first syllable.",
    "Sling TV allows you to pause, rewind and fast-forward live TV on some channels (note the word \"some\" there), and grants you the ability to watch shows a few days after they've aired.",
    "Also similar to Slingbox, Sling TV lets you watch its service on most mobile devices anywhere in the world. That is, as long as you can establish and maintain a bitrate of about 1.5 Mbps for high-quality streams, 0.8Mbps for medium resolution, and 0.5 Mbps for low-quality.",
    "That all said, where Sling TV runs into a bit of trouble is when you take streams from a smaller screen and put it on a bigger one. We found that Sling TV performed the better on an iPhone \u2013 the stream was crisp and clear, and audio came through perfectly \u2013 and a PC browser than some other platforms we tried.",
    "Throw it from a mobile device onto the big screen via Chromecast, however, and everything goes awry \u2013 quality dips in and out, while audio goes from pristine cable quality to a crackly garbled mess.",
    "One function that I felt was a huge weak point on every platform, however, was the ability to search for the show you want to watch \u2013 search exists on every platform, but it's not complete and often returns results that don't make sense.",
    "Try searching \"Game of Thrones\", for example, and Sling TV spits out dozens of results \u2013 random news shows that featured a Game of Thrones segment, a behind the scenes look at the making of Game of Thrones, everything but the show itself.",
    "While searching is somewhat of a headache, Sling TV does offer a cloud DVR service similar to what we've seen on PlayStation Vue. The feature, called First Look, allows you to save up to 50 hours of content to your account that you can watch at a later date \u2013 think on-demand, but you get to pick the shows.",
    "The program costs $5 per month extra, and is currently only available on Roku devices, Roku TVs, Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, and Amazon tablets.",
    "While Sling TV really excelled on iOS (which we'll get to in a minute), it also played just fine on Roku's OS. In fact, by and large, the experience on Roku was everything I've come to love about a cable box: simple functionality, clean layout and crisp picture.",
    "Coming from the home screen, Sling TV's interface loads up In a matter of seconds. The time it takes to get from home screen to live TV is astonishing \u2013 it's leagues faster than the time it takes my DirecTV cable box to boot up.",
    "Once loaded, the stream was crisp and clear. (This obviously is a YMMV situation, as my home setup isn't identical - or even necessarily in the same ballpark - as everyone else.) A quick test of my network showed I was pulling around 26Mbps over Wi-Fi, which worked fairly well at high-quality 1080p 99% of the time.",
    "The only stark contrast to traditional cable, at this point at least, is the amount of content available on Sling TV.",
    "Comparatively, the 40-or-so channels offered on Sling TV are just a drop in the bucket compared to the over-800 I have available on DirecTV. And because you aren't able to record a show like you can on TiVo, you're limited to watching whatever's on or whatever's been on in the past few days.",
    "Sling TV on iOS is a vastly different experience. Not only are you trading down to a smaller screen size, but you're also losing connection stability and clean interface of the set-top app.",
    "Using an iPhone for testing, I took Sling TV with me for a gauntlet of daily errands. As you might expect, over LTE the stream was nearly flawless. (We've yet to try it on a 5G phone, but we're expecting similar results.)",
    "Problematically, when you return home, continuing what you were watching on your phone isn't as simple as starting up your Roku. You'll need to go into the menu, find the show you were watching and rewind it manually.",
    "Trying to use both a phone and a Roku at the same time won't work either (unless you subscribe to Sling Blue). DISH is clearly (and rightfully) afraid of the account-sharing trap that has befallen HBO and Netflix, and doesn't allow two devices using the same account to run the service simultaneously.",
    "Overall, I found the iOS experience less enjoyable than the set-top app, but still impressive. Being able to take TV figuratively anywhere is an appealing, practical proposition for morning commuters or long-distance travelers.",
    "The interface on Amazon Fire TV looks almost identical to the service on Roku, which is to say clean and convenient. Pressing the \"list\" button on Fire TV remotes brings up a channel listing while the three media control buttons do their things on playback-enabled channels.",
    "The service looks a little clearer than it did on Roku - Sling probably set the highest visual quality as a default on Amazon devices - but it does seem to hit a few more snags. The system was stuck in buffering for such a long time at one point that it completely shutoff. Whether this was a one-time fluke or a persistent problem remains to be seen...",
    "If you've used the service on any of the set-top boxes so far, you'll probably know what to expect here.",
    "The channel interface is brought up with a flick of the stick in any direction, while the menu button (formerly known as start) opens up a menu for video-on-demand movies. Last but not least is the share button (again, formerly known as back) that brings up a menu that filters channels by category.",
    "One major change worth noting is that Sling - unlike some apps on Xbox One - actually utilizes the Kinect to take in voice commands and allows you to pin both video-on-demand and specific channels to your home screen.",
    "During testing I noticed a fair bit of latency (38ms compared to 30 on my tablet), which caused the service to stop and stutter multiple times. This occurred with a 4.24Mbps download speed and could be a worrying sign for potential Xbox One users.",
    "Overall the service looks great and is functionally stable on Xbox One, but its performance - as users have noted in the comments - will definitely vary depending on your connection speed.",
    "Sling TV is a great solution for users of a certain lifestyle, like restaurant owners who only use ESPN and CNN, or cord-cutters who know exactly the channels that they like. Additional packages like HBO, Cinemax and NFL Network offer additional channel options that have made the service even more compelling.",
    "If you don't fall into those groups and don't find any of the additional packages all that appealing, you're not out of luck. The service is always evolving, and with more content added monthly. If you don't see your favorite channel right now, don't completely write Sling off forever. Your favorite set of channels may be just a few months out.",
    "Curmudgeons, however, could easily quote Shakespeare's famous line in Romeo and Juliet: \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,\" and feel somewhat justified here. Sling TV isn't that far away from cable \u2013 it's not a 100% free service and you're not allowed to build a tailor-fitted package. At some point you have to get what you're given and pay the monthly fee. Sling TV isn't free from customer service issues (just read the comments section below), and because it's dependent on your connection and the devices you choose to stream it on, performance can vary from person-to-person.",
    "But there's still a lot of good here: What Sling TV offers that's different from cable is the ability to go anywhere. You can watch your subscription anywhere in the country from any number of your favorite devices. Better, Sling Blue means that you could theoretically split the cost between a friend or two just like Netflix. Finally, if nothing else, you're getting out of the atrociously high equipment rental fee that most cable companies slip onto your bill every month."
