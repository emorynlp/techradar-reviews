  "summary": "Fantastic sound (most of the time)",
  "verdict": "With the Gemini active noise-cancelling true wireless in-ear headphones, Devialet gets more right than it gets wrong. Mind you, when it goes wrong it really goes wrong. These true wireless earbuds offer a long battery life and sound great \u2013 but once you turn the active noise cancellation off, that excellent audio performance is all but lost.",
  "pros": [
    "Can sound poised and informative",
    "Nice charging case (which holds plenty of power)",
    "Some interesting technologies"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Performance with ANC switched off is poor",
    "Sound isn\u2019t very expansive",
    "Touch controls could be better"

    "Devialet\u2019s first active noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds aren\u2019t going to give the market leaders any sleepless nights \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re charmless. If you enjoy taking the road less travelled, you might find them to be just the ticket.",
    "Build quality and finish are well up to par. No, there\u2019s no room here for any of Devialet\u2019s signature design flourishes, but the Gemini manage to look reasonably distinctive nevertheless. Battery life is competitive \u2013 it\u2019s certainly superior to Sony\u2019s new (and all-conquering) WF-1000XM4. And while the control app doesn\u2019t do enough, and the touch controls don\u2019t do what you want with any consistency, the Devialet have plenty going for them when it comes to sound. They\u2019re a rapid, well organized, clean and punchy listen.",
    "That\u2019s always assuming you\u2019ve left active noise-cancelling switched on, though. As noise-cancelling circuitry goes, it\u2019s pretty effective \u2013 but more importantly, if you switch it off the sound of the Gemini goes sideways. And not in a good way.",
    "Just how oddball do you like your active noise-cancelling true wireless in-ear headphones? That\u2019s the real question.",
    "The Devialet Gemini active noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds are on sale now for $299 / \u00a3279. That works out at around AU$390, with Australian pricing still to be confirmed.",
    "That\u2019s pretty much on par with other true wireless in-ears from specialist brands (such as Bose, Grado, Sony or Sennheiser) are concerned. We\u2019re not used to Devialet products being so competitively priced\u2026 Its recent Phantom I speaker costs $3,200 / \u00a32,790 / AU$5,490, for example.",
    "The problem with a small product like this for a company like Devialet is how little scope there is for luxurious design. If you look at the Devialet\u2019s previous products, it\u2019s always gone to town just as much with looks and finish as with performance. But true wireless in-ear headphones just don\u2019t lend themselves to this sort of indulgence. They\u2019re a deeply functional item.",
    "And though you can almost hear the company gritting its teeth, Devialet has done the sensible thing and delivered a pair of true wireless earbuds that are utterly functional. Oh, they look nice and they feel good, but apart from the stylized \u2018D\u2019 on each capacitive touch-surface, there\u2019s nothing here to indicate they\u2019re the product of a company with an abiding reputation for design flair. So deep is Devialet\u2019s need to display just a little of its individuality, it\u2019s fitted the Gemini charging case with an unusual sliding lid.",
    "And there\u2019s equally little opportunity for Devialet to indulge itself where specification is concerned. It\u2019s managed to cram in a few original technologies (which we\u2019ll discuss shortly), but broadly speaking, you\u2019re getting exactly what you\u2019d expect from a pair of wireless earbuds.",
    "The Gemini feature Bluetooth 5 wireless connectivity, with support for AAC, aptX and SBC codecs. The earbuds themselves hold six hours-worth of power (which isn\u2019t bad) and the charging case holds another four full charges (which is pretty good) so an all-in total of 30 hours between visits to a power outlet is achievable. When it comes to it, charging is via the case\u2019s USB-C input or on any Qi-certified charging pad.",
    "The earbuds themselves are supplied with four different sizes of silicone eartip, and at 6g and 15 x 18 x 33mm each, they\u2019re quite compact and comfortable. The case itself, at 58 x 74 x 31mm and 74g, isn\u2019t too big to slip inside a pocket.",
    "On the inside, the earbuds feature a bespoke \u2013 and big (10mm, in fact) \u2013 full-range transducer, with a claimed frequency response of 5Hz to 20kHz.",
    "The Gemini can be controlled using the Devialet Gemini control app, using Google Assistant or Siri voice control, or via the capacitive touch-surface on each earbud. There are feed-forward and feed-back mics in each earbud, and where voice assistance is concerned, they prove perceptive and responsive.",
    "This is in rather stark contrast to the touch-controls, which are more of the \u2018hit and miss\u2019 variety. You can assign their function using the app \u2013 \u2018play/pause\u2019, \u2018skip forwards/backwards\u2019, \u2018answer/end/reject call\u2019 and \u2018noise-cancelling on/off/transparency\u2019 are all included, while the app will let you ditch \u2018skip forwards/backwards\u2019 in favor of \u2018summon voice assistant\u2019. You\u2019ll notice that \u2018volume up/down\u2019 is not an option, and it\u2019s an annoying omission that makes you fish your music player out of your pocket in order to change volume level.",
    "The app also lets you select the level of noise-cancellation \u2013 choose between \u2018low\u2019, \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018plane\u2019 \u2013 or switch it off altogether. You can also fiddle with the degree of \u2018transparency\u2019 (\u2018low\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019), switch \u2018auto-pause\u2019 on or off, check for software updates and adjust left/right balance.",
    "As already mentioned, though, Devialet is going to take the opportunity to go full Devialet if it can \u2013 and with the Gemini, that opportunity arises where active noise-cancellation is concerned. The company has deployed three important-sounding technologies in an effort to reduce external noise intrusion by (it claims) 40dB \u2013 they\u2019re Internal Delay Compensation, Pressure Balance Architecture and Ear Active Matching.",
    "IDM is an algorithm that intends to cancel noise in the especially problematic upper end of the frequency range. PBA is a physical series of vents that allow static air trapped by the earbud to escape the wearer\u2019s ear canal. Finally, EAM measures acoustic leakage caused by the position of the earbud in the wearer\u2019s ear and adjusts equalization to compensate.",
    "aptX Bluetooth is more than good enough for getting some nice high-resolution audio files on board the Devialet, so why not? With an MQA-powered Tidal Masters file of Sons of Kemet\u2019s Pick Up Your Burning Cross on board, some things the Gemini can do is pretty impressive. Some, though, aren\u2019t quite so impressive.",
    "The \u2018positives\u2019 column is probably a bit longer, so it seems the fairest place to start. This is a pretty hectic, multi-layered recording apparently performed by musicians who are all actively competing with each other \u2013 but the Gemini show real control and resolution. They describe the \u2018start\u2019 and \u2018stop\u2019 of individual notes with proper confidence, and manage to give each musician a bit of room on what\u2019s a fairly crowded and all-action stage. Despite allowing each element of the recording its own area, though, the Devialet still manage to serve up a sense of unforced integration. It\u2019s all the more impressive when you consider the Gemini don\u2019t describe the largest soundstage by any means.",
    "The top of the frequency range has more than enough bite and attack to make the percussive sounds (as well as the willful honks and squawks of brass instruments) sound substantial and purposeful, but there\u2019s a pleasant lack of hardness or grittiness to these treble sounds. At the opposite end, bass is deep and textured, with no overhang and nice straight edges into and out of notes and hits. In between, the midrange is equally detailed, equally well organized and every bit as convincing.",
    "The same tune allows the Gemini to showcase quite impressive dynamic potency, both where the \u2018quiet/loud/louder still\u2019 aspects are concerned and with the more nuanced harmonic dynamics that jazz recordings tend to be awash with. They\u2019re proficient with rhythms, too, and when a recording becomes spare and quiet they take unwanted sounds out of the equation.",
    "There\u2019s not a massive amount of difference between the three settings of active noise-cancellation \u2013 but no matter which one you\u2019ve selected, external sounds are minimized. Like every other pair of active noise-cancelling true wireless headphones, though, the Devialet must bow to the mighty Bose QuietComfort Earbuds where noise-cancellation is concerned.",
    "Switch the noise-cancellation circuitry off, though (it\u2019s indicated as \u2018neutral\u2019 in the app) and the entire story changes \u2013 we can honestly say we\u2019ve never heard the sonic characteristics of a product alter so fundamentally simply by changing one of its settings.",
    "With noise-cancellation on, the Gemini are robust \u2013 with it off, they become bony and insubstantial. It\u2019s almost as if all the EQ levels have been changed at once, and it transforms the Devialet from being quite an enjoyable listen to something much less engaging.",
    "And while we\u2019re bemoaning the effect of circuitry on the sound, \u2018transparency\u2019 is altogether too keen to get involved too. Leave it off and all is well \u2013 set it to \u2018low\u2019 and the midrange hogs the stage; set it to \u2018high\u2019 and bass gains a whole load of undeserved confidence. Mind you, at least \u2018transparency\u2019 does increase the amount of external sound you can hear."
