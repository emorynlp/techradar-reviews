    "Quick \u2018n Easy is a unique website builder that allows you to learn about coding, which means you\u2019ll have room to grow. The interface is easy to explore, and there\u2019s over 100 pre-designed templates you can choose from.",
    "The design features make it easy to personalize your website. You can add various navigation or animation features, and change design blocks as needed. Another unique aspect is the payment plan, since it\u2019s more of a single purchase. After browsing around the application, it\u2019s easy to see how Quick \u2018n Easy has more room for advanced website builders. However, there\u2019s pre-designed templates and blocks for those new to the web-building world.",
    "Quick \u2018n Easy organizes plans differently from other website builders. Click the \u201cpurchase\u201d option and you\u2019ll see how you can buy a copy of Quick \u2018n Easy instead of a subscription. Right now, you can purchase the eighth version, the latest one available (it works with Mac, Linux, and Windows).",
    "The nice thing about a one-time purchase is you won\u2019t constantly be paying month after month. However, if the software updates in the future, you will still have the version you purchased.",
    "There\u2019s a 30 day free trial so you can see if the purchase is right for you. Once you activate the software after your purchase, it\u2019s too late for a refund. That\u2019s why Quick \u2018n Easy encourages everyone to use the free trial before making the purchase.",
    "There are lots of payment options to choose from. You can use a credit card, or if you have a Mac, you can purchase through the Apple App Store. There\u2019s also an option to use My Commerce for payment.",
    "While it\u2019s easy to navigate your way around the interface, the Quick \u2018n Easy website itself isn\u2019t very creative. Everything on the website is very straightforward, which doesn\u2019t serve as the best example if you want to know what the templates are like. One great aspect is you can easily browse over 100 templates before purchasing Quick \u2018n Easy. All you need to do is select the template tab, and then choose to browse template options. You can scroll through pages of templates to see if there\u2019s anything that stands out.",
    "There\u2019s also a forum you can visit with frequently asked questions, information about Quick \u2018n Easy, along with a space to share feedback. In reality, this platform looks more techie than most website builders, almost like somewhere you\u2019d chat with other web experts about the ins and outs of coding and HTML.",
    "Lots of the Quick \u2018n Easy features revolve around design options. You can personalize your website with your own fonts. Another great feature is how you can add animations to your website. If there\u2019s one that stands out to you, simply choose from 150 pre-designed animations so you can save time creating your website. However, Quick \u2018n Easy also allows you to create your own animation using the tools they provide. Whether you use Mac, Windows, or Linux, downloading Quick \u2018n Easy lives up to its name.",
    "Similarly to the pre-designed animations, there\u2019s also 150 pre-made website blocks to choose from. These blocks help you build pieces of your website similar to a template. All you need to do is fill in the information. Sounds simple enough, right? The good news is that you can add extensions to the Quick \u2018n Easy software if you want more specific features when you add videos or content that\u2019s more complex.",
    "There\u2019s also a \u201cnavigation\u201d feature which allows you to add drop-down menus or links when needed. Of course, using the pre-made blocks will help organize things automatically, but if there\u2019s a specific change or navigation feature you\u2019d like to add you can easily create it.",
    "With so many website builders out there (SiteBuilder, Duda, and Homestead, to name a few), you might be wondering what\u2019s so special about Quick \u2018n Easy. The features for advanced users is something that\u2019s different from many web builders.",
    "There\u2019s password protection, and you can add your own HTML coding using the tools provided. If you want to try a shot with JavaScript, there\u2019s room to experiment with many different animations such as moving objects, images that move on a timer, and logos that fly across the page. Quick \u2018n Easy is simple to use if you just want to get started, but it also includes tools that will allow you to grow. If you\u2019re already more advanced in website building, then there\u2019s tools available for creating personalized designs.",
    "Quick \u2018n Easy is different from many website builders: there\u2019s a one-time payment rather than a monthly plan. It\u2019s easy to find the features that are available, and unlike some web builders, there\u2019s plenty of room to grow and learn HTML and JavaScript if you\u2019re interested. While this might be great for someone who\u2019s built a website before, it makes it more difficult for beginners. However, you can always test out the software for free for 30 days to see if Quick \u2018n Easy is right for you.",
