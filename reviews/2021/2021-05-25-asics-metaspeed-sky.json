  "summary": "A speedy shoe for race day to go toe-to-toe with Adidas and Nike's super shoes",
  "verdict": "The Asics Metaspeed Sky is made to keep you quick over short and long distances, and is does deliver on that front. It feels like one to reserve for when PBs are at stake \u2013 a lightweight racing shoe that offers a great cushioned feel and can make going quickly feel pretty effortless at times. It\u2019s not cheap, but if you\u2019re looking for a great alternative to what Nike and Adidas currently have to offer in the performance shoe realms, don\u2019t rule out the Metaspeed Sky.",

    "Speedy and cushioned on long runs",

    "The Metaspeed Sky sees Asics lay down the gauntlet to Nike and Adidas and prove that it can make a running shoe that\u2019s built for going fast and helping maintain that speed over the course of your run or race.",
    "Announced alongside the Metaspeed Edge and the Ride shoes, the Sky has been shaped by research from Asics that suggests when some runners run fast, they increase their stride length. The Sky is the shoe for that particular type of runner, and help extend that stride and get you to the finish line quicker.",
    "It sees the debut of Asics\u2019 new FF Blast Turbo midsole foam that\u2019s combined with a full length carbon plate to create a soft, durable cushioned ride, while still giving that feeling of being propelled forward.",
    "Asics keeps things light too thanks to a thin mesh upper, minimal padding in the heel collar and a skinny tongue to match that light, midsole foam. It\u2019s spacious too, making it a good fit for wider fit, though we weren\u2019t a huge fan of the braided-style laces and we\u2019d have opted for an upper that offered a more locked down fit.",
    "It\u2019s a shoe that feels best running at speed where you can really reap the benefits of the nicely responsive cushioning and the spring forward you get from the carbon plate and the curved sole design. It doesn't feel as enjoyable when you ease off the pace and pretty much rules this out as one to put in some easy miles with.",
    "The rubber outsole won\u2019t let you down though and feels great on dry and wet flat roads and pavements. Though the noticeably exposed foam near the heel means it\u2019s one you wouldn\u2019t want to do all of your sessions in.",
    "The Metaspeed Sky certainly isn\u2019t cheap and comes in pricier than the Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 and the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro. If you\u2019re after a shoe, which feels light to run in, spacious and enjoyable going fast, then you\u2019ll have a lot of time for the Metaspeed Sky.",
    "The Asics Metaspeed Sky was launched in March 2021 and costs $250 / \u00a3225 / AU$330 from Asics.",
    "The Metaspeed Sky comes just in the one colourway and sees Asics continuing the sunrise red theme it introduced on the Metaracer, which certainly makes this shoe stand out for the right reasons.",
    "The first thing you\u2019ll notice when you whip these out of the box is that they really don\u2019t weigh a lot. The men\u2019s shoe weighs 210g and the women\u2019s comes in at 180g, putting it around the Vaporfly Next% 2 in weight terms.",
    "It\u2019s a clear sign this shoe is designed for racing, as Asics has sought to shave off weight wherever it feels it can \u2013 from the braid-style laces and the short tongue to keeping padding in the heel to a minimum. The engineered mesh upper is made from 100% recycled polyester, which gives it quite a coarse feel to touch, but keeps things breathable and cool and offer some protection when the rain comes calling.",
    "For those key shoe specs, there\u2019s a 5mm heel-to-toe drop, a 33mm stack height in the heel and 28mm in the forefoot. That's not quite as stacked as the Vaporfly 2 or the Adizero, giving you a slightly more 'close to the ground' feel than those rival shoes.",
    "The big talking point here is the new FF Blast Turbo midsole. The cushioning technology is made up from a nylon-based foam designed to be light, which compresses at foot strike then quickly jumps back into shape to make it a responsive shoe to run in.",
    "That\u2019s joined by a full length carbon fiber plate, which is a departure from the one placed in the midsole only on the Metaracer. Combined with the overall curved look of the Sky, it\u2019s made to offer a more controlled and stable feel as it seeks to propel you forward.",
    "Underfoot, you\u2019ve got an AsicsGrip rubber outsole, which spreads that rubber a little more densely at the forefoot clearly with a view of efficiently adding that rubber in the most effective places and keeping the overall weight of the shoe down.",
    "We ran a variety of different sessions in the Metaspeed Sky. Short 5k runs, interval track sessions, tempo runs. We managed a 10k race in them and put them to the long training run test too. Our overall feeling about them is that they feel best when you want to run your quickest.",
    "It\u2019s almost as if as soon as you up the pace, everything just seems to click into gear. The midsole foam does exactly what Asics promises it\u2019ll do. It\u2019s soft, but not overly so, and springs back into shape to keep you running consistently quick in quite an effortless way. That full length carbon plate gives you that nice push forward, but you always feel in control.",
    "It felt best on longer runs closer to our marathon pace, where you can almost feel like you\u2019re coasting at that quicker pace, and it just didn\u2019t feel taxing on the legs as we expected it to be. It worked for those interval track sessions too, and we put in a decent 40-minute 10k race in them.",
    "When you ease off the pace though, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re disengaging everything that makes this shoe special to run and it can start to feel a bit clunky as soon as you do that. This isn\u2019t a shoe that feels built for easy miles.",
    "The upper is an interesting one for us. It\u2019s not the best upper we\u2019ve tried on a shoe, but it\u2019s not an uncomfortable one either. We\u2019d prefer more of a tongue and the laces just don\u2019t feel like great quality either.",
    "Where you can\u2019t fault it is that it's particularly spacious up front and in the toe box, so if you have wide feet, you\u2019re in luck here. For our narrow feet, we\u2019d have preferred something that fitted a little closer, but that space makes it a good fit for long distance runs and marathons.",
    "As with the the Metaracer, Asics doesn\u2019t disappoint in the outsole department. We mainly pounded dry pavements and roads and had to tackle some rainy runs too and the shoe gripped well in both those running conditions.",
    "We\u2019ve mentioned that the rubber isn\u2019t spread evenly across that outsole leaving some of the foam exposed nearer the heel area. That\u2019s immediately a concern from a durability point of view, and there are already signs of wear. It\u2019s one you want to save for races and when you want to run your quickest.",
    "Overall though, it\u2019s a shoe that feels great to run quickly in and while we don\u2019t absolutely love the upper, you can\u2019t fault it from a comfort point of view. Asics promised us a super shoe and it\u2019s certainly delivered that with the Metaspeed Sky."
