    "The Razer Blade 13 is the latest of Razer\u2019s gaming laptops, which consistently delivers quality: from the Razer Blade 15 to the Razer Blade Pro and even to the Razer Blade 15 Studio.",
    "The late 2019 Razer Blade 13 improves on the original, which Razer dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s first gaming Ultrabook.\u201d But, everything including the compact design, system specs and feature set means this Ultrabook was designed for games that don\u2019t demand high system requirements.",
    "Where the Razer Blade Stealth 13 shines, is with esports titles and productivity - like video and photo editing. Just don\u2019t expect to engage hardware demanding games and a battery life that\u2019s up to Ultrabook standards.",
    "The Razer Blade Stealth 13 starts at $1,599 (around \u00a31,175, AU$2,000) and tops out at $1,999 (\u00a3TK, AU$TK). Price differences really depend on the type of display you\u2019re looking for.",
    "The entry-level Razer Blade Stealth is equipped with a 13inch, 60Hz screen. From there, price increases depend on higher refresh rate, resolution and touch capability. At the highest $1,999 (around \u00a31,500, AU$2,600) price point, users will get a 60Hz OLED Full HD touch display. For $100 less, the Razer Blade Stealth 13 comes in a 4K touch option. Though, you might want to stay away from the 4K touch option, which we\u2019ll explain later.",
    "The $1,699.99 model we got for review features a Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) at 120Hz display which is phenomenal for an Ultrabook. This is something similarly priced and specced 13-inch portables like the Macbook Pro or Surface Book. Both lack the same compact design, customizability options and ability to game with competitive refresh-rates.",
    "Packed within the 3.11 lb (1.41 kg) Razer Blade Stealth 13\u2019s unibody frame is a 2.80GHz Intel i7 quad-core processor with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650. 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD and a beautiful 13-inch screen delivering a 120Hz refresh rate makes this Ultrabook ready for competition.",
    "The Razer Blade Stealth 13 is an attractive piece of hardware thanks to the all-black aluminum design, featuring Razer\u2019s signature green accents on its USB-A ports. The clean lines on this Ultrabook are simply beautiful. Plus, It\u2019s light enough to hold in one hand and thinner than a dime when closed.",
    "Besides housing one pair of USB-A and Thunderbolt 4 ports on each side, a singular 3.5 mm headphone/mic combo jack sits on the left. That should be just enough to use a mouse and headset. It\u2019s just too bad there isn\u2019t an SD card slot, considering Razer uses Lightroom in one of the promotional photos.",
    "Though serious gamers will opt for a standalone mouse for gaming, the touchpad on the Blade Stealth 13 is smooth to the touch during general use. Pressing the touchpad in feels good \u2013 though you\u2019ll likely still want to grab a mouse during serious gaming sessions.",
    "For a small Ultrabook keyboard wedged between two speakers, the keys are nicely spaced and it\u2019s tactile enough that you won\u2019t feel the need to grab a gaming keyboard Some may be disappointed that the RGB lighting doesn\u2019t extend to individual keys, but there is still some lighting customization through Razer Synapse.",
    "The Razer Blade Stealth 13 is rocking a 13-inch 120Hz display that hits 100% of the sRGB spectrum \u2013 and it\u2019s gorgeous despite the bottom bezel featuring the Razer logo, which feels a bit distracting. Colors on the screen are rich with phenomenal detail from gaming to tasks like video editing or photo editing. Adding the high refresh rate makes games pop and definitely provides a competitive edge where it matters. There is a 4K 60Hz touch display option available for a couple of hundred dollars more, but considering the system specs are the same, 4K gaming is a no-go.",
    "The 720p webcam performs well enough in an adequately lit room. Users who want to live stream games or attend Zoom meetings shouldn\u2019t have much to complain about. It\u2019s not the best webcam in the world, but at least the Blade Stealth 13 supports Windows Hello facial recognition \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t work as well as other Ultrabooks like the Asus ZenBook 13.",
    "The Razer Blade Stealth 13 can run competition spec requirements of popular esports games like Fortnite and League of Legends \u2013 which is perfect for the 120Hz display. Considering most esports games don\u2019t go beyond 100GB \u2013 unless you\u2019re playing Call of Duty or NBA2K21 \u2013 the low storage isn\u2019t really a problem either.",
    "To reach that 120 fps frame limit, you\u2019re going to have to mess with the graphics settings, though. So, if you\u2019re looking to turn on all the eye candy or play beyond 1080p, you may want to opt for something bigger and more powerful. Running Total War: Three Kingdoms and Metro Exodus on ultra settings at 1080p yield average frame-rates in the low 20s. Even at the lowest settings, you\u2019re still scraping by with around 80 fps \u2013 but at least that\u2019s still playable.",
    "Due to the weaker GTX GPU, advanced features like DLSS and Ray-tracing aren\u2019t available. This means demanding AAA games like Death Stranding, Cyberpunk 2077 or Control aren\u2019t going to impress on the Razer Blade 13. If you have the expendable cash, you can purchase the $299 (\u20ac299.99, AU$579) Razer Core X to push it further, but then you\u2019ll also need to buy one of the better graphics cards \u2013 which can cost hundreds of dollars, so it\u2019s probably best to just get a more powerful laptop.",
    "An Ultrabook\u2019s biggest test is its battery life.Though improvements have been made, battery life is still merely average. In the PCMark 10 battery life test, it lasted nearly 10 hours and our local video playback test was around the same with almost 9 hours of life. Attempts to play games like Metro Exodus and the Razer Blade Stealth 13 will only last about an hour and a half. If you\u2019re travelling across the country, you should be able to breath easily, just as long as you\u2019re not trying to play games. Luckily, it also charges quickly with the USB-C charger that Razer includes.",
    "There are also a handful of performance settings through Razer Synapse. Plugged in settings are split between \u201cBalanced,\u201d Battery Saver\u201d prioritizing battery life and \u201cGaming\u201d which prioritizes graphics processing power. Fan speed can be adjusted as well from 2500 RPMs to 5600 RPMS. Even at its highest setting, the ultrabook is still relatively quiet. Prolong usage doesn\u2019t leave an uncomfortable hot lap feeling either. Software and features",
    "Through Synapse, there are several ways to personalize your experience outside of RGB lighting. Each individual key on the keyboard can be fully customized with macros and you can even set keys to launch programs. Users can even adjust RGB lighting profiles for when the Blade Stealth 13 is plugged in or not. Of course, if you want to take your RGB customization experience to another level, you can utilize Razer\u2019s Chroma Studio.",
    "The Blade Stealth 13 is packaged with THX Spatial Audio for both the external speakers and headphone output. This is perfect for using gaming headsets in games that require positional audio and communication. The four speakers and smart amplifier sound crisp and clear, just don\u2019t expect much in the volume or bass department. In a moderately loud room, a lot of the fine detail in the audio dissipates easily. There\u2019s also a separate Spatial Audio application to further refine one\u2019s audio experience between pre-EQed settings like gaming, audio and film alongside custom EQ settings. It doesn\u2019t match Razer\u2019s own THX Spatial Audio, though."
