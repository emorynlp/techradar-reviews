  "summary": "Why go Pro when the Air is this good?",
  "verdict": "The iPad Air for 2020 is a phenomenally well-made tablet that improves upon the last-gen version in a variety of ways, solving issues with that tablet\u2019s dated design and accessories. The jump in price will make this a tougher sell for some, but the iPad Air for 2020 is so impressive that you may have trouble choosing between it and the iPad Pro.",
  "pros": [
    "All-screen design",
    "Lots of power",
    "Adventurous color choices"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "64GB storage is limited",
    "Higher price than last-gen",
    "Selfie camera could be better"

  "article": [
    "The iPad Air 4 (2020) doesn\u2019t bring anything revolutionary to Apple\u2019s tablet range, but a lot of the features that were previously exclusive to the iPad Pro have trickled down to this far more affordable, and therefore more attractive, device,",
    "While this is a tablet that\u2019s unlikely to tempt power-hungry users away from the iPad Pro, it brings a lot of what makes that series of tablets great to a cheaper device, albeit one that isn\u2019t as cheap as the standard iPad. Finally, the iPad Air 4 (2020) is the middle choice between both extremes of Apple's tablet lineup.",
    "Starting with the obvious bad news, Apple has increased the price of the iPad Air over the last generation by $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$120 to $599 / \u00a3579 / AU$899. But the extra spec you\u2019re getting here, as well as the improved design, make that an understandable move from the company, and it feels justified.",
    "Like the iPad Pro range the iPad Air 4 comes with an almost all-screen front, and supports the Apple Pencil (second generation); it also has the same squared-edge design.",
    "The iPad Air 4 is powered by Apple\u2019s new top-end A14 chipset, which is also at the heart of the iPhone 12 range. It offers unrivaled power, ensuring that the Air can comfortably perform any task you ask of it, from running demanding apps to streaming high-quality video.",
    "There are two powerful speakers (though there are four speaker grilles) that offer high-quality audio when you\u2019re watching videos or films, and the rear camera has been upgraded to a 12MP shooter.",
    "Everything feels a touch more refined on the iPad Air 4, so much so that it\u2019s now difficult to justify opting for an iPad Pro if you like this design but aren\u2019t desperate for a fast-refreshing 120Hz display.",
    "If you need more storage space or a slightly larger screen you\u2019ll probably want to consider the iPad Pro range; but the iPad Air 2020 is improved in almost every conceivable way, making it hard to overlook if you want a top-of-the line iPad without quite spending top dollar.",
    "Update: iPadOS 15 is coming to the iPad Air 4 in 'Fall' 2021 - September or October time. Changes include widgets that you can reposition, a quick-notes function if you have an Apple Pencil, and changes to multitasking.",
    "The iPad Air 4 release date is confirmed for October 23. You can pre-order the tablet now at Apple\u2019s website, and we expect to see other retailers offering it soon.",
    "The iPad Air 4 price starts at $599 / \u00a3579 / AU$899. That's quite a hike over its predecessor, but as we\u2019ve mentioned you\u2019re getting a big specs jump here that arguably justifies the increase.",
    "It\u2019s available in a variety of configurations, with either 64GB or 256GB of storage, and with LTE connectivity or just Wi-Fi \u2013 see below for a full list of spec and price options.",
    "For reference, the iPad Air 3 started at $499 / \u00a3479 / AU$779 for the Wi-Fi only model with 64GB storage, and $649 / \u00a3629 / AU$999 for 256GB.",
    "The design of the iPad Air has a lot in common with the iPad Pro range. The home button has been dropped in favor of an all-screen design to make it more in line with Apple\u2019s Pro products.",
    "And, indeed, the iPad Air 4 feels a lot more premium than the iPad Air 3. That slate was criticized for its dated-feeling design, and it looks like Apple took notice. We\u2019ve used this tablet alongside the new iPad 2020, which sports the more traditional iPad look, and it\u2019s remarkable how much the Air feels different to that tablet thanks to its straight edges and all-screen front.",
    "There are still thick bezels around the outside of the display, as there are on the iPad Pro, but overall it feels like a big step up compared to the design of last year\u2019s Air.",
    "The edges are more-squared, with sharper edges than on previous tablets from the company, and if you\u2019re upgrading from an older device that may take some getting used to, as those edges don\u2019t sit as comfortably in your palm.",
    "That said, we felt we had better grip thanks to this design, and it gives the tablet as a whole a distinct look and feel that\u2019s more in line with the new iPhone 12 family, and iPad Pro range.",
    "There are four speakers, two each on the top and bottom edges, and a lock button at the left of the top edge \u2013 this also houses the Touch ID scanner if you want to unlock your slate with your fingerprint.",
    "We found this to work well throughout our testing time \u2013 our thumb fell naturally on this spot, so little effort was required to reach the button. On the right-hand edge of the tablet are volume up and down buttons, and there\u2019s a magnetic connector below these to which you attach the Apple Pencil stylus for charging.",
    "There\u2019s a second Smart Connector on the rear side, and you can use this to connect Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard, as well as other products, to your slate. The iPad Air 4 features support for new accessories, including the second-gen Apple Pencil, which is another significant upgrade.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a tablet that you can use with a stylus or keyboard in certain scenarios, the iPad Air (2020) has you covered. We found the Smart Keyboard to be great for word processing, while the Apple Pencil is useful if you want to sketch on your tablet, take notes, or just sign documents in your own handwriting.",
    "The Wi-Fi-only version of the tablet weighs 458 grams, while the LTE-ready version is slightly heavier at 460 grams. The dimensions of both models are 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm.",
    "Perhaps the biggest change for the iPad Air 4 is the introduction of color options. Previously, you\u2019ve only been able to get most iPads in one shade, and you\u2019d have to get a case if you wanted to personalize your device, but for this generation Apple is offering a range of colors.",
    "You\u2019ve got the choice of Silver, Space Grey, Rose Gold, Green or Sky Blue \u2013 we\u2019re a little miffed that we only got to review the Silver edition of the tablet, as we\u2019re excited to see what the Sky Blue option looks like in real life.",
    "The iPad Air 4 comes in one size, with a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display \u2013 this feels like the optimum size for a tablet to us, as you\u2019re getting a large screen, but one that doesn\u2019t feel gargantuan when you\u2019re holding the device with both hands.",
    "The resolution is impressive at 2360 x 1640, which equates to 264 pixels per inch. We found the screen to be fantastic for watching video, with vibrant colors and a strong peak brightness, so you\u2019ll enjoy a premium viewing experience when watching Netflix or other streaming services.",
    "There are thick black borders around the outside of the display, which means it doesn\u2019t feel as premium as some Android tablets, notably the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus \u2013 however that tablet is also much more expensive than the iPad Air 4.",
    "It\u2019s a typical 60Hz display \u2013 you don\u2019t get the benefit of the higher 120Hz refresh rate that Apple has introduced to its top-end iPad Pro range, so scrolling through news articles or your apps won\u2019t feel as smooth as it would on the Pro.",
    "If you\u2019ve yet to use a 90Hz or 120Hz display you won\u2019t miss it here, but it would have been nice to see Apple include it on the iPad Air to make this tablet feel even more premium than it already does.",
    "That said, Apple had to keep some features exclusive to its top-of-the-line slate to justify the price premium \u2013 and the screen on the iPad Air 4 is a great size and fantastic quality, and you\u2019ll be happy with it whatever you use this slate for.",
    "The iPad Air 4 has some of the latest and best internals available in a tablet, and on paper it even beats the iPad Pro, with the latest A14 chipset powering the new Air product, where the newest Pro has the previous-gen A13 processor.",
    "We found the A14 Bionic chip to work phenomenally well, with the iPad Air (2020) opening apps in record times and easily handling multitasking and other complex tasks.",
    "We don\u2019t know how much RAM is inside the iPad Air 4 \u2013 that\u2019s not a stat that Apple reveals about its new products \u2013 but we hope to learn this when someone is able to do a full teardown of the tablet.",
    "On paper, the A14 chipset may sound better than the A12Z that you find in the iPad Pro, and for some tasks that will be the case; however, if you\u2019re multitasking, or need a lot of raw power, the A12Z is the more capable chip, as it has eight cores compared to the A14\u2019s four, and benchmarks show it\u2019s better at those more demanding tasks.",
    "But if you\u2019re not editing video or doing other similarly intensive tasks \u2013 or if you\u2019re willing to wait a little longer for your tablet to complete a process \u2013 then the iPad Air 4 will be more than adequate.",
    "Your storage options are 64GB or 256GB, and this will be an issue for those who need lots of space but can\u2019t stretch to the price of the more capacious model.",
    "64GB isn\u2019t enough space for most people on a tablet these days \u2013 and there\u2019s no microSD support here, so it\u2019s a tough ask to opt for this over a tablet that has 128GB of space or more.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that if you\u2019re more of a power user even 256GB may not be enough space; some iPad Pro products offer up to 1TB of space onboard, but it\u2019s not an option on the Air 4, and will be a deal-breaker for some.",
    "The company argues that you use its cloud based storage system to store large amounts of photos, video and other files, but if you expect that you\u2019ll be downloading a lot of apps we\u2019d encourage you to go for the larger option if you don\u2019t want to quickly fill your tablet up.",
    "On the rear of the iPad Air 4 is a 12MP shooter with an f/1.8 aperture which serves as your primary camera, and which also comes in useful when you\u2019re using features such as augmented reality.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be using this camera to take \u2018serious\u2019 photos, but it\u2019ll do you just fine if you\u2019re looking to take photos to upload to social media or other apps.",
    "On the front of the tablet is a 7MP selfie camera that we found to be satisfactory, but it isn\u2019t particularly impressive from Apple considering that a lot of Android tablets now offer better cameras for front-facing video.",
    "With many of us making much greater use of video-calling apps in 2020, it would have been a nice touch for Apple to improve the selfie camera here, but it\u2019s the same sensor the company has used in the past.",
    "A minor issue is that the video camera sits at the top of the tablet\u2019s display, and when you\u2019re conducting video calls in landscape orientation that can be an awkward position. We\u2019ve seen Samsung and Amazon address this on their slates by moving their front-facing cameras to the top of the slate when they\u2019re in landscape mode, and it\u2019s something we\u2019d like to see Apple consider doing in the future.",
    "The iPad Air (2020) is running Apple\u2019s latest iPadOS 14 software out of the box, and it\u2019s arguably the best software you\u2019ll find on a tablet \u2013 Android isn\u2019t as well-optimized for tablets as Apple\u2019s dedicated software.",
    "All major apps are optimized for the tablet\u2019s display, with just a few options, such as Instagram, not working as well as you\u2019d expect. iPadOS 14 also brings widgets and other new features to the tablet.",
    "If you\u2019ve got an iPhone then you\u2019ll find it easy enough to get your head around iPadOS, but there may be a slight learning curve if you\u2019re coming from an Android tablet.",
    "That said, every app we\u2019ve used in iPadOS software has worked well, and we didn\u2019t come across any issues. This is the most sophisticated, and the most useful, software Apple has created for its tablets, and it\u2019s really impressed us.",
    "We\u2019ve yet to learn how big the battery in the iPad Air 4 is \u2013 again, it\u2019s not a spec that Apple often shares \u2013 but battery performance seems as good as from previous iPads, and we found we could use the tablet for around 10 hours before having to reach for the charger.",
    "A single charge was good for around nine hours of using standard apps, web browsing and video playback, all over Wi-Fi, and if you\u2019re only using your tablet lightly we\u2019d expect it to last even longer.",
    "According to Apple, the tablet is designed to last for 10 hours of searching the web or video playback over Wi-Fi, and we\u2019d say that\u2019s a fair estimate based on our experience.",
    "If you opt for the LTE-ready version of the iPad Air 4 you\u2019ll likely find the battery drains slightly faster when you\u2019re connected to mobile networks, as using these can be more of a drain than using Wi-Fi.",
    "This isn\u2019t the best battery life we\u2019ve ever seen on a tablet, but it\u2019s still very good, and most users should be perfectly happy.",
    "You get a 20W charger in the box \u2013 Apple has stopped including chargers in the box with the iPhone 12 range, but has chosen not to do so here \u2013 and you\u2019ll find that can charge up your tablet quicker than an iPad Air 3. We found it was able to charge the tablet from zero to 27% in half an hour.",
