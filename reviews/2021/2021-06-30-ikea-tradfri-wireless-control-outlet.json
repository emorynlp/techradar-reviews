    "IKEA isn\u2019t a name that springs to mind when you think of smart home devices, but the Swedish furniture giant has offered a range of gadgets to automate your home since 2017. Starting with smart lighting, it has since expanded to include smart plugs, blinds that can be controlled wirelessly, and even a range of multi-room speakers that it developed in conjunction with Sonos.",
    "The IKEA Tradfri wireless control outlet is a single socket that can be plugged into a power source and controlled via the IKEA Home Smart app. However, unlike other smart plugs we\u2019ve reviewed \u2013 such as the Amazon Smart Plug and the TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Slim KP105 \u2013 the IKEA Tradfri wireless control outlet doesn\u2019t pair directly with your Wi-Fi network. Instead, it requires the Tradfri gateway that connects to your router, and a \u2018steering device\u2019, which essentially groups smart home devices together. As such, it could prove an expensive purchase if you only want to make one outlet smart.",
    "Using the IKEA Home Smart app, you can switch the outlet on or off manually, or set schedules for the smart plug to be activated automatically. The Tradfri wireless control outlet also offers interaction with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and HomeKit, so you control it using your voice, and even ensure it switches on or off at the same time as other smart devices in your home.",
    "If you\u2019ve already invested in Tradfri smart lights or other IKEA smart home products, or plan to, then this is the smartest option when it comes to choosing a smart plug.",
    "The IKEA Tradfri wireless control outlet is priced at $9.99 / \u00a39.99 / AU$20, which makes it one of the most affordable smart plugs around. However, you do need to purchase the IKEA Tradfri gateway, at a cost of $35 / \u00a322 / AU$49, along with a \u2018steering device\u2019, before you can use and control the smart plug.",
    "This is IKEA\u2019s term for the remote control, wireless dimmer or wireless motion sensor. Prices start from $6.99 / \u00a36 / AU$14.99 for the wireless dimmer and rise to $15.99 / \u00a315 / AU$24.99 for the remote control.",
    "As with most of the best smart plugs, the IKEA Tradfri wireless control outlet has a simple, white design. It measures 3.9 x 2.1 x 2.5 inches / 10 x 5.3 x 6.2cm (w x h x d), but unlike other smart plugs we\u2019ve tested, the outlet is offered in the same size across the US, UK, and Australia. However, in the US it has a horizontal orientation when inserted into a power outlet, while in the UK and Australia, it sits in a power outlet vertically.",
    "The front of the smart plug features a single socket and a white LED that illuminates when the plug is switched on. It flashes when the plug is in set-up mode. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no Wi-Fi indicator that alerts you to any connectivity issues, and there isn\u2019t a manual power button, either \u2013 something many other smart plugs such as Eve Energy offer.",
    "The IKEA Tradfri wireless control outlet proved fiddly to set up. In fact, it\u2019s the most complicated smart plug with which to get started we\u2019ve tested to date. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the outlet requires a gateway to work, which must first be connected to your router and then detected by the app. Next, a steering device must be paired with the gateway \u2013 and that\u2019s all before you can start to set up the smart plug itself \u2013 this involves unscrewing the back of the steering device and pressing the button inside to pair the outlet to the gateway.",
    "Once that\u2019s all been completed, you can rename it and manually control it. During testing, we found the plug switched on and off instantly when controlled via the app. The \u2018click\u2019 coupled with the LED illuminating when switching on and off was reassuring.",
    "We were able to group devices together, although the maximum number that can be connected to a steering device is 10. If you want to add more smart home devices to the gateway, you\u2019ll need to invest in another steering device.",
    "While we were able to set schedules for the smart plug to switch on and off at set times, we were disappointed to find there\u2019s no Away mode that switches the plug on or off at random times. Nor are there any energy monitoring features.",
    "The IKEA Home Smart app is extremely easy to navigate, with the different devices grouped in \u2018rooms\u2019 visible on opening the app. The clock icon in the top left-hand corner lets you easily set schedules, with as many or as few devices as you choose controlled at once. In the opposite corner, a cog provides quick access to settings for adding new devices and enabling integration with Alexa, Google Assistant, or HomeKit.",
    "However, as already mentioned, features such as Away mode and energy monitoring features are lacking.",
