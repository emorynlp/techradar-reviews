  "verdict": "The Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 is a top-of-the-range hair dryer that dries hair in no time at all. Using negative ions to speed up drying time, it also regulates the temperature of the air flow to prevent excessive heat build-up. It\u2019s bulky, and noisy \u2013 but if you want to dry your hair quickly, it does the job.",

    "Entering the market in 1937, Remington is a well-known name in hair care products. The brand offers a wide range of hair dryers to suit all budgets, and its top-of-the range devices include technology that will quickly blow-dry hair while retaining shine, ensuring your locks remain as healthy as possible.",
    "The Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 is a high-grade hair dryer with a powerful digital motor, which Remington claims provides airflow speeds of up to 80mph / 160kmph, drying hair 50% faster than its existing 2200W models. The hair dryer uses ionic technology, whereby negative ions attach to the hair\u2019s surface to speed up the evaporation of water molecules, while at the same time micro-conditioners are released to preserve the hair\u2019s moisture levels. In addition, a Hydracare Sensor regulates the temperature of airflow to prevent excessive heat build-up, which can damage your hair.",
    "Coming with a much wider-than-usual barrel, and a gold and cream design that bucks the trend for glossy black hair care appliances, the Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 certainly stands out from the crowd. It has three temperature settings and two speed levels, which are selected using sliders on the front of the unit. LED\u2019s indicate the setting that\u2019s been selected, and in the box you\u2019ll also find three attachments to help create sleek styles as well as soft waves.",
    "The Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 is an expensive hair dryer, although it still comes in far short of Dyson\u2019s rival hair dryer. It\u2019s quick, and for those who want some reassurance that their hair is being cared for, the HydraLuxe Pro is worth the investment.",
    "The Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001, which is known as the Remington Proluxe HydraCare in the US, is priced at $129.95 / \u00a3149.99 / AU$149.99. It\u2019s available now in the UK and Australia from Remington\u2019s website, and from other online retailers such as Amazon. It\u2019s listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d in the US.",
    "The Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 is a bulky hair dryer: the barrel has a 2.75-inch / 7cm diameter, making it one of the largest on the market. However, at just 6 inches / 15cm deep, it looks more like the Dyson Supersonic than a traditional hair dryer. It weighs in at 1.7lbs / 800g, which means it\u2019s one of the heavier hair dryers on the market \u2013 something our arms definitely became aware of while testing.",
    "Remington has bucked the trend of the usual glossy black palette for hair dryers, instead giving the Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 a cream, white and gold finish. Add to this a subtle turquoise access on the filter, and this hair care device certainly stands out.",
    "On the inside, the Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 has a digital motor, which combines the powerful airflow of salon hair dryers that use an AC (alternating current) motor with the lightweight DC (direct current) motors found in consumer hair dryers \u2013 offering the best of both worlds. There are three temperature settings and two speed levels, plus you\u2019ll find three attachments in the box \u2013 two sizes of concentrator nozzle and a diffuser.",
    "For those who don\u2019t have a mirror conveniently located next to a power outlet, the 9ft / 3m power cord provides plenty of flexibility.",
    "On the highest temperature settings, it took just 3 minutes and 47 seconds to fully dry our below-shoulder-length fine hair, making the Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 one of the fastest hair dryers we\u2019ve tested to date. On the medium temperature setting this time increased by 1 minute and 33 seconds.",
    "The lowest temperature setting measured just 22 degrees on our temperature probe, meaning it\u2019s more of a cool-shot function. We did attempt to dry hair on this setting, but after six minutes, hair wasn\u2019t even close to being dry. As such, it\u2019s probably best avoided for anything other than setting a style. On all settings hair was left smooth, with very few fly-away strands. However, the hair dryer didn\u2019t quite achieve the same level of shine as the Panasonic EH-NA65.",
    "As well as being one of the fastest hair dryers we\u2019ve tested, the Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 is also the noisiest, measuring 82db on it\u2019s fastest setting. This is equivalent to a diesel truck travelling down the road at 40mph. However, since this will only be for a few minutes at a time, it\u2019s unlikely to bother you too much.",
    "The Remington Hydraluxe Pro EC9001 felt balanced and comfortable to hold, in either hand (we switched hands, depending upon the side of the head being styled), but it was rather heavy, making our arms ache in just the short drying time. The removable filter is an added bonus, since it makes it easy to keep the hair dryer dust- and lint-free.",
