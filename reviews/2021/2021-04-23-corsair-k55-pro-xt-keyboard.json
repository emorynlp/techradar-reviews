  "updated": "2021-04-23T14:08:41Z",
  "author": "ural-garrett",
  "summary": "Great for gaming, better for budget streaming",
  "verdict": "The K55 Pro XT is a legitimately solid gaming keyboard aimed at streamers. However, users may find the base K55 Pro something to consider if per-key RGB lighting and effects aren\u2019t serious requirements.",
  "pros": [
    "Solid performance",
    "Dedicated macro keys",
    "iCue customization"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "$20 more than K55 Pro with only RGB specific enhancements",
    "Membrane switches"
  ],
  "article": [
    "The Corsair K55 Pro XT should be at the top of the list for budget-conscious folks who need a full sized gaming keyboard with a light focus on streaming. A $20 upgrade from the $49.99 priced K55 Pro, the higher tiered $69.99 (\u00a374.99, $99) variant features a handful of upgrades, including individually lit RGB keys and more than 10 static lighting colors. This is on top of an already impressive membrane switch keyboard offering IP42-rated resistance, media controls, six dedicated macro keys, Elgato Stream Deck software compatibility and detectable soft palm rest.",
    "If you are solely looking to upgrade from the K55 Pro and don\u2019t mind adding an extra dub to your budget, the XT tier makes sense. There aren\u2019t many quality, brand name full-sized keyboards catering to streamers at that price. Be mindful, those who don\u2019t need the extra macros or stream focused capabilities may want to look elsewhere.",
    "The Corsair K55 Pro XT doesn't appear much different than the cheaper variant on a surface level. Both feature a matte-black finish that feels better than plastic. It definitely feels good to hold and strong enough for all sorts of everyday bumps. Elevation level can be raised to a comfortable position due to latches underneath the keyboard.",
    "The soft palm rest also helps in providing wrist support for long typing and gaming sessions. When it comes to its RGB lighting, the individually lit keys look great in light or dark room scenarios. Include the added four plus static lighting colors and the Pro XT does an adequate job of personalizing the cosmetic experience.",
    "From general typing and gaming to streaming, the K55 Pro XT makes the best of its membrane switch keyboard. At its $20 higher price point, it may be better to get one with mechanical switches, though. Regardless, keystrokes fall in line with what competitors like Razer and Logitech offer around this price range. Media keys work well alongside the RGB brightness and Windows lock buttons.",
    "The 12-key selective roll-over with anti-ghosting and 1,000 Hz report rate means response times are good during usage. The Corsair K55 Pro XT feels great, whether using word processors, browsing the web or gaming went off. Plus, the extra macro-keys definitely help when playing competitive games like Call of Duty, League of Legends, World of Warcraft and others.",
    "Of course, various macros, keystroke augmentations and RGB lighting can be customized through Corsair\u2019s iCue app. It\u2019s easy to customize the keyboard through the software. Considering the Elgato Stream Deck software compatibility, those macros are put to better use there. That means that aspiring streamers don\u2019t have to buy that expensive Stream Deck to add effects or other streaming specific actions.",
    "Fans of Corsair\u2019s lower priced K55 looking for a small incremental upgrade may appreciate the Corsair K55 Pro XT. Those looking to host game streaming sessions will most definitely find the Elgato Stream Deck software compatibility and the six additional macro buttons to be extremely useful. The $70 price tag is hard to recommend compared to the cheaper K55 Pro that offers the exact same functionality sans improved RGB."
