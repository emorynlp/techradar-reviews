  "summary": "How does Arlo\u2019s latest 4K home security camera improve on the Arlo Ultra?",
  "verdict": "The Arlo Ultra 2 is one of the best home security cameras we\u2019ve tested, offering fantastically detailed color footage both during the day and at night thanks to its built-in spotlight. The weatherproof camera can be battery powered or wired in, and has plenty of AI-based features that can identify the cause of a motion alert and even track the subject so they\u2019re always in shot. However, it\u2019s eye-wateringly expensive \u2013 and you\u2019ll still need to pay for a subscription",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent image quality",
    "Integration with Alexa, Google Assistant and HomeKit",
    "Smart feature to reduce false alerts"

  "cons": [
    "Expensive",
    "No free video storage"

    "Arlo is one of the stalwarts of the home security market, having been among the first brands to launch a wireless camera aimed at the consumer in 2014, and since then it\u2019s made a name for itself by offering some of the best home security cameras you can buy. With each iteration, the resolution and quality of the footage has improved, while the addition of features such as customizable motion zones, and the use of AI to identify the source of an alert, has helped to reduce the number of unwanted alerts.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 is the brand\u2019s latest offering, but rather than being packed with new features it\u2019s more of an incremental upgrade to the Arlo Ultra, which was the first Arlo home security camera to record in 4K resolution. That said, it does an excellent job of keeping an eye on your home when you\u2019re not around and provides detailed footage of any intrusions or incidents.",
    "Just like other Arlo home security cameras, the Ultra 2, which is weatherproof and can be powered via the mains or with a rechargeable battery, will send a notification to your smartphone if it detects motion in its 180-degree field of view, so you can log in and view what\u2019s happening at your property in real time.",
    "As well as letting you view the incident in real time, the Ultra 2 also stores footage in a secure area online (providing you\u2019ve subscribed to an Arlo Smart plan), and these clips can be reviewed at any time for 30 days after being recorded.",
    "Arlo Smart is more than just a service for storing and accessing the Ultra 2\u2019s videos; it also offers access to a number of smart features. As well as providing the ability to create motion zones, so that you\u2019re only alerted about activity in specific areas, it can also identify whether motion was created by a person, animal, vehicle, or some other source.",
    "Rather than connecting directly to your home Wi-Fi network, the Arlo Ultra 2 uses a SmartHub that connects to your router, which provides internet access to the cameras. The SmartHub not only provides local storage for the camera\u2019s footage if you\u2019d rather not use online storage, but according to Arlo it also ensures that the connection to the cameras is secure, and less likely to be intercepted by unauthorized users.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 has a 12x zoom, so it\u2019s easy to pick out details like car license plates and clothing logos in the video. It also has the same built-in spotlight as the Arlo Ultra, which when activated ensures that footage recorded at night is in color rather than black and white. However, the new model builds on its predecessor with support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-F bands and an increased range, which should put an end to connectivity issues. It\u2019s also compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, and HomeKit.",
    "At $599.99 / \u00a3629.99 / AU$799 for the Ultra 2 two-camera kit, which includes two cameras and the smart hub, it\u2019s an expensive purchase. The kit comes with a free three-month trial of Arlo Smart, but once that expires you\u2019ll need to subscribe at a cost of $4.99 / \u00a33.99 / AU$7.49 per month if you want to continue storing footage in 4K and making use of the various smart features. It\u2019s a great choice for anyone who wants a high-resolution smart security camera, or those who struggle with connectivity issues, but it doesn\u2019t offer enough that\u2019s new to warrant upgrading from the Arlo Ultra.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 starts at $599.99 / \u00a3629.99 / AU$799 for a two-camera kit, and is available worldwide through Arlo\u2019s website and other online retailers including Amazon. There\u2019s also a three-camera kit priced at $899.99 / \u00a3809.99 / $1,049.99, while in the US and the UK there\u2019s a four-camera kit that costs $999.99 / \u00a3989.99. Single add-on cameras that don\u2019t include the smart hub are priced at $299.99 / \u00a3314.99 / AU$449.99",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, the kit comes with a three-month free trial of Arlo Smart, which enables you to securely store videos captured by the camera online and access features that help to reduce unwanted alerts. Once the trial expires, this will cost from $2.99 / \u00a32.49 / AU$4.49 per month \u2013 that price is for 2K recording, but if you want the videos stored in the cloud to be in 4K it\u2019ll cost you $4.99 / \u00a33.99 / AU$7.49 per month.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 has the same stylish monochrome design as previous iterations of Arlo\u2019s home security cameras. A glossy white casing, which can be removed in one piece, houses the swappable rechargeable battery, while the sleek black face houses the 180-degree lens and an LED spotlight. At 3.5 x 2 x 3 inches / 8.9 x 5.2 x 7.8cm (h x w x d), it's a relatively compact home security camera, and the cameras are weatherproof too.",
    "On the bottom of the camera are connector pins for a magnetic charging cable, if you\u2019d rather hard-wire the Ultra 2, as well as the button that enables you to remove the casing, while on the back is a connector for the screw mount if you want to wall-mount the camera. The Ultra 2 can also be positioned using a magnetic mount that\u2019s included in the box, but this is less secure than the screw mount, as the camera can be detached easily. The camera can also be used free-standing without any of the mounts.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, the Arlo Ultra 2 cameras use a SmartHub that connects to your router for internet access. This glossy white hub, which measures 6 x 4.7 x 2.1 inches / 15.2 x 12 x 5.3cm (h x w x d) is in keeping with the design of the Ultra 2 cameras, and offers local storage for the camera\u2019s footage through a microSD card slot if you\u2019d rather not subscribe to Arlo Smart. It features a power input and an Ethernet port, and you\u2019ll connect it to your Wi-Fi router during the set-up process.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 is relatively simple to set up. Once we\u2019d downloaded the Arlo app it walked us through all of the set-up steps, including connecting the SmartHub to our router, inserting the battery into the camera, and pairing the two.",
    "The Arlo Ultra 2 recorded extremely clear, detailed color footage both during the day, and at night, providing the spotlight is triggered when motion is detected. We found we were still able to see small details even when the sun was shining brightly, or dark shadows were being cast, thanks to the HDR support.",
    "We were also impressed with the 12x zoom, as this allowed us to zoom in to check small details when viewing the videos in the Arlo app, and the 180-degree field of view doesn\u2019t have the distorted fisheye effect that some other security cameras create.",
    "We found the Arlo Ultra 2 was extremely effective at identifying motion, and as we had the trial of Arlo Smart activated during testing, each notification highlighted whether the source of the motion was an animal, person or other source. There were some instances where the camera mistook washing hanging on the line for a person, but we found that setting up motion zones in the camera\u2019s field of view (another option offered through Arlo Smart) reduced the number of alerts we received.",
    "The camera can also be set to automatically zoom in when it detects motion, and track the subject (although this can be at a slightly lower resolution, because the image has been zoomed).",
    "As well as the built-in spotlight, which can be controlled manually or set to switch on automatically, there\u2019s also a siren, which likewise can be manually activated or set to auto. The Arlo Ultra 2 also has a two-way talk function, which we found clear thanks to the noise-cancellation tech that cuts out wind noise.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that while the SmartHub offers local storage, footage stored in this way can\u2019t be accessed through the app \u2013 you have to remove the SD card from the SmartHub and view the video clips on a computer or other device.",
    "We\u2019re big fans of the Arlo app thanks to its clear, easy-to-navigate interface and the fact that it offers as much or as little control over your home security cameras as you want.",
    "As soon as you open the app you\u2019re presented with a list of the Arlo security cameras installed in your home, with a snapshot of the most-recently recorded motion next to each one. There\u2019s quick access from here to the Settings menu for each camera, where you can do things such as set up geofencing, so that cameras turn on or off based on your location, which is shared with the camera via your smartphone. You can also adjust the speaker and microphone volume, change the name of the camera, and trigger the siren or the spotlight.",
    "If you want to see past footage in chronological order you select the Library tab from the bottom of the screen, while the Mode tab allows you to control how a camera behaves when you're home or away. There\u2019s also a more detailed Settings section.",
    "Integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and HomeKit means you can ask your preferred assistant to show footage from the camera on your TV, or on a compatible smart display, as well as use the camera in some home automations.",
    "As mentioned, video storage and AI features such as object detection require you to pay a monthly subscription for Arlo Smart \u2013 the camera comes with a three-month free trial, after which this costs from $2.99 / \u00a32.49 / AU$4.49 per month. This is a similar cost to security camera plans from the likes of Ring and Google.",
    "Arlo claims the battery in the Arlo Ultra 2 will last up to six months between charges. We\u2019re not able to confirm this based on \u2018typical use\u2019, as we\u2019ve put the camera through heavy testing in a short period of time for this review. However it\u2019s worth noting that the battery life you get will depend on how often motion is detected, how many times Live View is activated, whether the spotlight or siren are triggered and the number of times the two-way microphone and speaker are used.",
    "The batteries are swappable, so rather than having the camera out of action when the battery needs charging you can just insert another battery, providing you purchase additional ones. We found that it took around three and a half hours to recharge the battery using the bundled USB cable and power adapter.",
