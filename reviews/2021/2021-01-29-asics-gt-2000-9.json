    "The Asics GT-2000 9 is the latest addition to the company\u2019s line of mid-tier stability road running shoes. It\u2019s only a modest iteration from its predecessor, but that\u2019s no bad thing - it\u2019s a dependable option if you prefer a stiffer shoe, and has a reassuringly snug fit,",
    "The redesigned mesh upper is soft and breathable, but without sacrificing durability. This is a good shoe for distance training, and shows no sign of wear or cracking, even after racking up well over 50 miles.",
    "The sole is firm and well cushioned, for a supportive but not bouncy ride. Some may find the toe-box a little narrow, but if you\u2019ve found other Asics shoes comfortable then you\u2019re unlikely to face any problems.",
    "The Asics GT-2000 9 was released towards the end of 2020 for $120 / \u00a3120 / AU$220.",
    "The show available in seven colorways, including the Black/Directoire Blue tested here, which features a bright orange sole, but is otherwise pleasingly understated. Like all Asics shoes, they come in a wide range of sizes, with slight differences in the shoe\u2019s footbed for women\u2019s and men\u2019s versions. There\u2019s a 10mm heel drop, and the shoe weighs 281g for the men\u2019s model, and 221g for the women\u2019s.",
    "The GT-2000 9 is a relatively small iteration on the GT-2000 8, with the most obvious difference being a new all-in-one mesh upper, which is softer and slightly lighter. There has also been some reshaping around the back of the ankle, which is now slightly more rounded and hugs the foot securely yet comfortably.. The laces are flatter than those of the GT-2000 8 too, which allows for a fit with less give.",
    "The sole is cushioned with gel in the forefoot and heel, and Asics\u2019 FlyteFoam in the midsole, which is billed as 55% lighter than standard EVA midsole material. Together, they give a supportive but not bouncy ride.",
    "That stiff feel comes courtesy of the Guidance Trusstic System - a rigid resin plate that guides your foot so it rolls without twisting, helping reduce both underpronation and overpronation.",
    "We tested the GT-2000 9 back-to-back with the GT-2000 8, and found them to be of roughly equal stiffness. That has relaxed ever so slightly now that we\u2019ve put well over 50 miles into them, but the difference is minor. If you prefer a less rigid shoe then you\u2019d be better off with one of Asics\u2019 more neutral options, but for runners who like a strong guide, it\u2019s a good match.",
    "Shape-wise, it feels like little has changed since the last release - they are still comfortably snug around the mid-foot, with a comfortably sized toe-box. It\u2019s not as roomy as similarly priced shoes from Saucony, but is standard for Asics, and if the brand\u2019s other shoes work for you then we foresee no problems.",
    "We found our heel held securely in place by the internal clutching system, which resulted in no slipping or rubbing during runs, with comfortable cushioning at the heel.",
    "The upper feels more breathable than that of the GT-2000 8 thanks to the redesigned upper, making it a particularly comfortable shoe for warmer weather, or hitting the treadmill indoors.",
    "That doesn\u2019t seem to have come at the price of durability, though; there\u2019s so far no sign of any visible wear on either the upper or sole unit of our review pair."
