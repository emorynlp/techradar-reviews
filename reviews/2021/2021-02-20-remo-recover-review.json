    "Remo Recover is a data recovery tool from Remo Software that keeps your information protected even if you lose it. Even if there\u2019s data on your computer that you\u2019re not aware of, you can download the software and it will scan for files and data you think you lost.",
    "Some of the benefits to Remo Recover include a complete hard drive data recovery feature. This allows you to recover old information on your hard drive even if it\u2019s an MP3, MOV, or DOC file type. We\u2019ll share the details on pricing and features so you can decide if it\u2019s the right fit for you.",
    "There\u2019s lots of different plan options on Remo Software\u2019s website. For the purposes of this review, we will cover the plans available for hard drive recovery on Mac and Windows. Keep in mind that Remo also offers special plans specifically for video recovery and conversion tools.",
    "The Remo Recover plan for Windows costs $39.97 for the basic edition. This means you\u2019ll have complete recovery for Windows OS and can recover files only. (If you want to recover videos, photos, or audio files, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to the media edition which costs $49.97.)",
    "The Remo Recover plan for Mac costs $59.97 for the basic edition. Similar to the Windows plan, you\u2019ll only be able to recover files and documents under this edition. If you want to retrieve photos, videos, and audio files, then the cost is $69.97.",
    "What\u2019s great about Remo Recover is you can actually download it for free. This allows you to see what kinds of files you\u2019ll be able to recover before you have to make a purchase. There\u2019s also specific packages listed on the website for Word recovery, PowerPoint recovery, and a couple file erasing tools.",
    "The website interface is clean and easy to find your way around. If you have questions, want to find out if Remo Recover will work on your computer, or simply want to browse features, there\u2019s space for you to ask questions and find what you need.",
    "One great aspect is how easily you can find the free download to try (both for Mac and Windows). It\u2019s easy to download and analyze your recovery results. This allows you to see exactly what Remo Recover is able to recover for you before you make your purchase. If you like what you see, you can purchase the software and access the data.",
    "There\u2019s quite a few features that make Remo Recover stand out: the formatted hard drive recovery software, and the hard drive partition recovery feature. First, if you want to clean your computer from any past viruses, (whether through an email or something you picked up on the internet), then you need a tool that can both clean your hard drive, and leave viruses behind. The formatted hard drive recovery software pairs both those features together, so you won\u2019t have to worry about viruses sticking around.",
    "Another great feature is the hard drive partition recovery feature. Don\u2019t be thrown off by the long name. This feature allows you to recover data even when your hard drive is so far gone it\u2019s reached RAW partitions. Remo Recover is programmed to recognize over 300 different file types.",
    "Remo Software offers 24/7 customer assistance if you have any questions about what it can do, what computer it works on, a specific file type, or how long ago you lost your data. Right on the website there\u2019s a list of all file types Remo can recover, including music, photos, videos, files, other documents, and more. The website list should give you an idea of the kinds of info Remo can save.",
    "For what you would pay for Remo Recover, there are several other hard drive data recovery options available. EaseUS is one of our favorites, since it enables you to recover data from lost partitions and formatted drives. It\u2019s a little more expensive, with one-month subscriptions selling for $69.95, but the well-designed interface is a welcome relief after trying Remo Recover.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a cheaper alternative, Auslogics File Recovery costs just $25.46 per year. This software only works for Windows, and the scans aren\u2019t as effective as we\u2019d like, but it can scan multiple drives simultaneously and runs very quickly.",
    "Overall, Remo Recover is a great option for data recovery and the features are very detailed. If you want to make sure you recover all your files, then it\u2019s very likely Remo can do that for you. Plans can add up in price, especially since packages are sold separately. However, you can also choose to buy a specific kind of recovery that way and backup your files with a one-time purchase.",
