  "verdict": "If you know you want a new Apple Watch, the Watch SE is the one to go for: it\u2019s got all the useful features of the Watch 6, but it\u2019s much cheaper, and thus one of the best smartwatches around. The always-on display is sorely missing, but the fitness tracking \u2013 including motivating nudges to keep you active \u2013 is as good as ever, and will improve when Fitness Plus lands. However, the Watch SE comes with the same issues as the rest of the Apple Watch line: some features and apps are too lightweight, and the battery life is just too short to get the best out of the watch.",

    "Before you dive into this Apple Watch SE review, think about one thing: what do you actually want from a smartwatch? Because if it\u2019s just \u2018an Apple Watch\u2019, then the Apple Watch SE is an underrated hit in the making, the high-value smartwatch with all the best watchOS perks at a great price.",
    "However, it doesn\u2019t manage to address the flaws that remain in Apple\u2019s smartwatch line, despite some notable advantages and a starting price of just $279 / \u00a3269 / AU$429. It offers the best of what you'd expect without offering anything new, so you'll be waiting on the fabled Apple Watch SE 2 for any big changes \u2013 though without a possible release date, the Apple Watch SE is still a sure bet.",
    "The design of the Apple Watch SE is as familiar as you can get \u2013 the same curved edges, rounded aluminum chassis and Digital Crown on the side. If you\u2019ve had an Apple Watch before, or just admired the devices and aspired to owning one, there\u2019s nothing new here.",
    "Along with the Apple Watch 6 it\u2019s also a \u2018larger\u2019 Apple Watch, coming with a wider display and offered in 40mm and 44mm sizes, compared to the still-on-sale-from-2017 Apple Watch 3, which is 38mm and 42mm, and packs a smaller screen. The latter is the Apple Watch SE's real competition, and we'll see if more attractive perks are revealed in the upcoming Apple Watch 7.",
    "The display is also familiar, in terms of sharpness and resolution. Thanks to OLED technology it\u2019s clear, bright and easy to read in any situation \u2013 this is Apple at its best.",
    "However, some may be turned off by the lack of an always-on display \u2013 Apple has dropped it here to keep the price down, so as on older Watches you\u2019ll need to raise your wrist to see the time, how your workout is going, follow a map you\u2019re using\u2026 basically anything.",
    "While that\u2019s helpful in making it cheaper and saving battery, it\u2019s not ideal for a watch.",
    "Where the Apple Watch excels is that it\u2019s probably the best extension of a phone onto a wrist of any smartwatch out there. Alarms sync across flawlessly. Your data is shared between apps instantly. The integration into Apple\u2019s ecosystem is immense.",
    "But while many of the Watch SE features are smaller versions of those on the iPhone, when it comes to fitness the Apple Watch steps up well. The list of exercises that can be tracked in the default Workout app is growing all the time, and third-party apps like Strava work well \u2013 if a little simplistically \u2013 on the Watch too.",
    "Add in an Apple Music subscription and a pair of AirPods, and you can head out of the house without your phone and go running with a wealth of music \u2013 these seamless experiences are what will entice Apple Watch users, and while this can be done on any of the Apple Watch range, the combination of the SE\u2019s larger screen on which to track your workout and the lower-than-Watch-6 price make the Watch SE a compelling fitness companion.",
    "Update: watchOS 8 was announced at WWDC 2021, bringing more software and features when it fully launches later this year. Eager fans can get the developer preview now if they're part of the developer program, or join the public beta in July.",
    "However, when it comes to battery life Apple still has some hard yards to make up. Having a smartwatch that only lasts a day and a half isn\u2019t good enough in 2020, especially now that Apple has deployed sleep tracking on the Watch SE.",
    "When are you supposed to charge this thing? There\u2019s no point in the day where charging is a natural option, as charging overnight is, so you end up just doing little top ups here and there, or just forgetting to pick the Watch back up again and not having it on the wrist for hours on end.",
    "While the battery life is good in terms of the Apple Watch range (and thanks to the lack of an always-on display and an efficient chip at the heart, the best we\u2019ve seen from Apple) compared to the rest of the market, it\u2019s sorely lacking.",
    "If sleep tracking wasn\u2019t so basic, this would present you with more of a conundrum \u2013 you\u2019d have to decide whether to change your charging routine in order to take advantage of the feature, or just not use it very much. But all sleep tracking will do is tell you when you\u2019ve been asleep, and several longer-lasting and cheaper smartwatches on the market can give you much more data.",
    "If you\u2019re after a cutting-edge Apple Watch, but don\u2019t want to spend a huge amount of money, the Watch SE dispenses with \u2018luxury\u2019 features and just offers the things you need. It\u2019s somewhere between the Apple Watch 4 and Apple Watch 5 in terms of power and features, and if you can get the older Watch 4 on a deal, it\u2019s probably worth checking out.",
    "But if you want a new Apple Watch, we absolutely recommend this model \u2013 as long as you can live without the always-on display.",
    "The price of the Apple Watch SE will depend on whether you opt for the GPS-only version or the cellular edition, and whether you prefer the simple Solo Loop / Sport band, or the more elegant Braided Solo Loop.",
    "We were sent samples of the Solo Loop, but unfortunately they were a little too large for our wrists. However, there was something much more pleasing about just slipping them on, rather than having to fiddle with a buckle instead.",
    "The Apple Watch SE is available now from the Apple Store or online, having gone on sale September 18, 2020, in key territories worldwide.",
    "The first question you might be asking is: what does the Apple Watch SE actually replace? It doesn't have the always-on display of the Watch 5, but it has more power than the Watch 4, so if those two devices were still on sale we might well be calling it the Apple Watch 4.5.",
    "With that in mind, what upgrades, if you can call them that, does the SE bring over the Watch 4 (which as mentioned is no longer on sale)?",
    "The main change is to the chipset inside \u2013 we found that the battery life of the Apple Watch 5 improved markedly when the always-on display was turned off, and given that\u2019s not an issue with the Watch SE, we\u2019re expecting good battery life from this device \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in the first couple of days of having it strapped it to our wrist.",
    "There are still reams of useful features on the Apple Watch SE that those upgrading from the Apple Watch 3 would enjoy, and a lot of them are great for health tracking too \u2013 which is fast becoming the primary reason to buy this Watch.",
    "The decibel meter on board the Watch SE does a good job of alerting you when the sound around you is too high. The sleep tracking \u2013 which admittedly is available on any Watch capable of running the new WatchOS 7 these days \u2013 is useful, even if it\u2019s not as fully-featured as dedicated sleep monitors, with things like time spent in deep, restorative sleep not specified.",
    "The constantly-running altimeter is useful to let you know the true reflection of your elevation on a run \u2013 to the nearest foot according to Apple, although in side-by-side tests with the Apple Watch 6 on a workout we found that the height climbed and descended varied by 10-15 meters on a two-mile run.",
    "Not massive, but we wouldn\u2019t use the Watch SE to calculate our exact elevation stats on any workout.",
    "At the other end of the fitness scale, the Apple Watch SE does feel like a great option for an elderly relative whose health you might want to keep an eye on \u2013 being able to get fall detection alerts, or warnings of issues with heart rate, will really bring peace of mind to those worried.",
    "Combine that with the larger display on both the 40mm / 44mm size, courtesy of less bezel, and this is going to be a genuinely helpful device for the elderly.",
    "With the new Family Setup feature for the Watch range, which enables you to set up an Apple wearable for someone else from your iPhone, buying the Watch SE for someone who doesn\u2019t use an iPhone becomes a relatively straightforward proposition.",
    "The design of the Apple Watch SE isn't going to surprise anyone \u2013 the cheaper Watch isn't any different from any other Apple Watch that's been launched since the Apple Watch 4 in 2018.",
    "The same curved outline, which folds elegantly into the OLED display (more on that in a moment) is present and correct, packing the Digital Crown that rolls pleasantly under the finger when you're using it to scroll through a list on the Watch face.",
    "Below that resides the power / multitasking button, which you can use to flip through recently-opened apps to get back to the one you were just using.",
    "Despite this being a cheaper Apple Watch, there's no hint of cutting back in the design process.",
    "On the underside of the Watch SE you'll find the heart rate monitor, with the glowing green LEDs that check your pulse throughout the day, which bulge slightly outward but can't be felt on the wrist in normal use.",
    "2020 sees the launch of an all-new style of band, the Solo Loop, which looks like a really neat addition. It\u2019s a silicone (or braided silicon) loop that stretches over your hand, so you don't need to constantly buckle and unbuckle your Watch SE to put it on and take it off.",
    "But you\u2019ll need to make sure you get the right size for your wrist \u2013 Apple optimistically sent us the largest and third-largest sizes available, which turned our Apple Watch SE into a bangle.",
    "Usually, you'd go into an Apple Store and get fitted for one, but in today's Covid world people are likely to be less willing to do that; the alternative is to print out a paper sizing guide, and that just seems like a lot of stress.",
    "Luckily there are plenty of other bands to choose from, so you'll always find something to suit, although they are pricey, and it's not always simple to get them on and off \u2013 we wish Apple would come up with a design that enables you to change straps more easily.",
    "Unlike with the Apple Watch 6, there are no fancy new colors options for the Apple Watch SE \u2013 Cook's Crew is clearly keeping the red coloring for the flagship Watch to entice buyers to spend a little more if they want the (in our opinion) best-looking option on their wrist. That means you're stuck with gold, silver or space gray if you want the Watch SE.",
    "The Apple Watch SE display uses the same OLED display technology you\u2019ll see on the Watch range stretching right back to the first model. As we mentioned above, it\u2019s larger than the Apple Watch 3, thanks to coming in 40mm and 44mm sizes, and that\u2019s a really key reason why you\u2019d plump for the Watch SE over the Watch 3.",
    "For those who loved the idea of the always-on display of the Watch 5 or Watch 6, that\u2019s the big thing that\u2019s missing on the Watch SE. What\u2019s interesting is that the SE uses the same low temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) technology as those Apple Watches with the always-on display, but disappointingly, it doesn\u2019t seem like Apple will enable this technology in the future:",
    "However, we\u2019re coming around to the idea that you don\u2019t really need the always-on display, especially until Apple can get its act together and bring out a Watch that lasts three to four days on a single charge.",
    "Until that point, we\u2019re okay with flicking our wrist to see the time or check a notification \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel like that much of an imposition. Also, we\u2019re still waiting for developers to be allowed to add always-on functionality to their apps, as right now the display just shows a floating clock when the Watch 5 or Watch 6 goes to sleep.",
    "In short, we prefer the battery life and cost savings that come with not having the always-on display on the Watch SE. The outdoor brightness is comparable to that of the Watch 6, so there\u2019s no issue with trying to see the time when you\u2019re blinded by the rays of Helios, and it doesn\u2019t glow like a beacon at night, or when you\u2019re in a gloomy place and have forgotten to enable Theater Mode.",
    "The fitness capabilities of the Apple Watch SE are likely the key reason you'll be buying this device. Apple has been hard at work turning its wearables into serious fitness and wellness devices since the first Watch was first unveiled in 2015, and it's doing a better job with each iteration.",
    "Given that the Watch SE is broadly comparable to last year's Apple Watch 5, other than missing out on the always-on display, you know you're getting a strong health and fitness device for less money than 2019's model cost.",
    "The key features here are GPS and Glonass (another satellite the Watch SE can track to help improve location accuracy), 5 ATM water resistance, which means you can go swimming with this device down to 50 meters, and now on-board sleep tracking.",
    "With the launch of watchOS 7 you're also getting more ways to track your fitness in the Workouts app, with Dance and Cooldown added to running, walking, cycling, yoga and more \u2013 having these new options means your calorie burn is going to be more accurate, and you'll know when you've hit your fitness rings.",
    "Those rings are the key to how the Apple Watch SE can help you live a healthier, fitter life. Many will be familiar with the concept by now, but if you\u2019re not, these are colored, animated rings that fill up depending on how much you're exercising each day, how much movement you're managing, and if you're standing up from your desk often enough.",
    "It sounds simple, but the Watch can learn your general movement patterns, and towards the end of the day you'll get a notification telling you what the Watch SE thinks you need to do in order to hit your movement goals. These suggestions aren\u2019t always the smartest \u2013 being told to go for a walk at 11pm isn\u2019t particularly helpful \u2013 but they can encourage you to be more active at key times.",
    "It\u2019s certainly not perfect \u2013 we\u2019ve hit our \u2018move\u2019 goal when driving, and while writing this review we were notified that we\u2019d hit our \u2018stand\u2019 goal\u2026 while sitting. But overall, it helps nudge you in the right direction.",
    "In terms of the more granular fitness elements on the Apple Watch SE, however, it\u2019s clearly not designed for those who want to step their fitness up a level. Running is still more about convenience than improvement \u2013 there\u2019s no GPS lock at the start of the run, for instance, which means that sometimes you\u2019ll get a slightly inaccurate reading.",
    "We compared the Watch SE regularly to a high-end Garmin Forerunner 945, and found that, by and large, the results were the same \u2013 and there were especially impressive moments where the Watch SE proved capable of detecting that we\u2019d started a run, asked if we\u2019d like to log it, and returned results that were comparable to the Garmin\u2019s to within 0.03 miles.",
    "However, it\u2019s more prone to error when coverage becomes spotty in forested and built-up areas, highlighting the fact that if you really want to make improving your running or cycling goals a focus, you might be better off with a more dedicated fitness device.",
    "If, however, you just want something to help you try out new fitness regimes, track your calories-burned through an ever-widening range of supported workouts, or just give you the regular nudges and data you might want in order to help you get healthier, then the Watch SE is a fantastic option.",
    "One of the key benefits of the Watch SE is going to be the addition of the new Fitness Plus service from Apple, to which you can subscribe to get access to dozens of videos to help you achieve your fitness goals.",
    "Your heart rate and other data from your Watch will be displayed on whichever phone or TV screen you\u2019re using, be it iPhone, iPad or Apple TV, and will alter dynamically depending on what the pre-recorded coach is asking you to do. It\u2019s not cheap at $9.99 / \u00a39.99 / AU$14.99 per month or $79.99 / \u00a379.99 / AU$119.99 for a year, but new Watch buyers will get a three-month subscription with their purchase, while current Apple Watch owners can try out the service free for a month.",
    "It\u2019s a strong proposition, and one that\u2019s far more suited to the Watch SE than the Watch 6, thanks to the lower cost of the former device \u2013 your fitness data is sent to your workout no matter which Watch you\u2019re wearing (that\u2019s a fun phrase to say) so you can spend less on the Watch SE and get the same workout effect.",
    "If you want to get our full rundown of what\u2019s new with the latest Apple Watch operating system, check out our Apple Watch 6 review \u2013 we found the experience with the new features was identical in every way on the Watch 6 and the SE.",
    "One of the key benefits of the Apple Watch is the onboard music \u2013 if you\u2019ve got an Apple Music subscription then you can save offline music (or stream it over LTE if you\u2019ve got that version of the Watch).",
    "And, finally, Spotify is being upgraded to let you stream music without having to be connected to an iPhone (as long as you have the LTE version of the Watch SE), although there\u2019s still no offline support to let you download music from Spotify \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating, but perhaps that will be coming soon.",
    "But for those who just want to know the highlights, or how certain features performed on the Watch SE, here are the key things we enjoyed (or didn\u2019t enjoy) using.",
    "Sleep tracking",
    "Being able to track sleep on the Apple Watch SE is a nice feature to have \u2013 yes, it\u2019s coming to most Watches in the range with the upgrade to watchOS 7, but the longer-lasting battery on the SE is helpful here.",
    "We were easily able to get through to the morning to capture the sleep tracking, but, as we\u2019ve discussed, the battery life isn\u2019t useful enough to not be annoying. What you want is a watch that can last for multiple days\u2019 worth of sleep tracking, and then only need an hour\u2019s top-up once in a while, when you\u2019re at a desk.",
    "The results are a little dull too \u2013 no ideas on whether you\u2019ve slept well or not, just an update on how long you slept based on the accelerometer. There are better apps out there for more in-depth sleep tracking than Apple offers, and we expected a little more from the brand\u2019s first foray into monitoring your slumber.",
    "Hand washing",
    "Apple claims this feature wasn\u2019t added in response to the Covid pandemic, but it\u2019s mighty coincidental that it\u2019s appeared as the pandemic is gripping the globe.",
    "Initially, we felt like this was a redundant feature, taking too much time to activate and not giving us credit for washing our hands when we actually were.",
    "However, we began to learn to wash harder to make sure the effort was registered, and we soon found that we became better at washing for the right length of time, and with the right amount of force. Ordinarily it would be annoying that we needed to work this hard to make use of a Watch feature, but this actually felt worth it.",
    "Siri",
    "You can activate Siri simply by raising your watch to your lips, and for the most part it worked pretty well. There were a few occasions when it wouldn\u2019t fire, or couldn\u2019t connect to the internet, but that\u2019s Siri in a nutshell: great when it works, but often erratic in its performance.",
    "There were also accidental triggerings when the Watch thought we had said the \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 command, which were irritating. Then we get into the idea of controlling your smart home from your wrist - you can either press a button on the screen or, more conveniently, ask Siri to perform smart home actions for you. But, as ever with Apple\u2019s smart home control, there were times when the Watch couldn\u2019t turn lights on and off with a brief tap on the screen or fully complete the action with Siri - the expensive Watch not being able to act as a light switch as instructed is frustrating.",
    "The Apple Watch SE battery life is easy to review: it\u2019s longer than you\u2019d expect if you listened to Apple. The brand says you\u2019ll get around 18 hours, or \u2018all-day\u2019 battery life, but the reality is that you\u2019ll get much more than that.",
    "Thanks to the Watch SE display being turned off most of the time, we enjoyed 24-36 hours of use from a full charge during our testing \u2013 and that was with running nearly every day, so firing up the GPS for anything from 45 minutes to two hours.",
    "Despite packing the older S5 chipset inside, we found that the Watch SE still had excellent battery life compared to the other Apple Watch models \u2013 better than the Watch 5 at launch thanks to the display, again, as well as efficiency improvements in the operating system.",
    "The SE also lacks the advanced heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring of the Watch 6, which can be heavy drains on the battery.",
    "The Watch 6 performs better during GPS-tracked workouts, as well as when listening to on-device music, thanks to the more efficient S6 chipset inside, but in day-to-day use the Watch SE was absolutely fine in most situations.",
    "We say \u2018most\u2019, because there is still an issue with the new sleep tracking function in watchOS 7 (more on that in a moment).",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, 24 hours is a tricky battery life number if you want to track sleep. Charging the Watch SE to 100% from empty should take around two and a half hours (although we timed it at closer to two) \u2013 that\u2019s a tough time slot to find in the day if you don\u2019t want to charge the SE overnight.",
    "What that means is that you\u2019ll end up \u2018spot-charging\u2019 here and there to keep your Watch topped up \u2013 and unless you have a routine that makes it easy for you to do that at the same time each day, you\u2019ll quickly end up needing to charge it overnight every few days, and losing that sleep data.",
