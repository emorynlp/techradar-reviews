  "summary": "An espresso machine for those who want to become baristas at home",
  "verdict": "The Gaggia Classic is an expensive but easy-to-use espresso machine. Suitable for novices and those who\u2019d like to reach barista level, it comes with a range of filters and lets you customize the strength and volume of coffee, too. We found it brewed rich, intense espresso and with the steam wand it was easy to texturize milk, too.",

    "Manual control over brew",
    "Can pour two espressos at once",
    "Built-in steam wand"

    "Having started life in Italy in the 1930s, Gaggia is a brand that knows what it takes to produce smooth, rich espresso. And it has provided consumers with the ability to enjoy good coffee at home since the 1940s, when the company launched its first espresso machine.",
    "The Gaggia Classic is the brand\u2019s iconic espresso machine. First launched in 1991, it has remained largely unchanged. It was given an incremental update in 2019, that saw rocker switches, which were taken off in 2009, re-instated for greater control for making coffee, allowing you to brew with your desired level of water. This made it a contender for a spot in our best coffee makers list as it's one of the best espresso machines we've tested.",
    "It features three coffee filters that can brew single and double espresso from ground coffee or Easy Serving Espresso (ESE) pods \u2013 the flatter-style pods rather than the taller, doom-shaped pods associated with Nespresso. As well as a single and double espresso filter, there\u2019s also a crema perfetta filter that\u2019s designed to make coffee with body and a thick crema, without having to experiment with the coffee grind size.",
    "The Gaggia Classic has a 2.1-liter water tank and offers the ability to brew two cups of coffee at the same time. It includes a steam wand for texturizing milk, enabling you to make some of the most popular barista-style drinks such as cappuccino, latte or flat white, along with a plastic tamp and measuring spoon.",
    "At $449 / \u00a3459 / AU$899, this is one of the most expensive espresso machines we\u2019ve tested. However, for those who want premium build quality alongside the ability to make an intense, smooth espresso in as little time as possible, it\u2019s worth the investment. It will also suit those who\u2019d like to experiment when it comes to creating the perfect brew.",
    "The Gaggia Classic, which is known as the Gaggia Classic Pro in the US, will set you back $449 / \u00a3459 / AU$899, making it one of the most expensive espresso machines we\u2019ve tested, and is available from Gaggia.",
    "It\u2019s also available in a limited edition to celebrate 30 years of the Gaggia Classic, featuring a design by the Italian artist Pierpaolo Gaballo comprising three acrobats. However, only 3,000 Gaggia Classic 30 models have been made, at a price of $499 / \u00a3499.",
    "The Gaggia Classic is a stylish and well-built espresso machine, made primarily from stainless steel. Measuring 8 x 9.5 x 14.2 inches / 23 x 38 x 24cm, and weighing in at 16 lb / 7.27 kg, it\u2019s one of the bulkier coffee makers we\u2019ve tested, and it will take up a fair amount of kitchen countertop space.",
    "It\u2019s available in an array of colors including stainless steel, red, grey, black, blue and white, as well as a limited edition version featuring a design from Italian artist Pierpaolo Gaballo. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, this model is only available in the UK.",
    "The 2.2-quart / 2.1-liter water tank sits at the rear of the machine and is filled by removing the black plastic cover from the top of the espresso machine. On the front of the unit, you\u2019ll find three black rocker switches for power, dispensing water, and activating the steam wand, with a red LED above each that illuminates when the switch is in the \u201con\u201d position. The Gaggia Classic produces espressos using 15-bar pressure and comes with three filters: single and double espresso, as well as a crema perfetta filter that can produce coffee with a thick crema without having to experiment with grind size. It can be used with ground coffee or Easy Serving Espresso (ESE) pods, which are quicker, easier, and less messy than using ground coffee \u2013 but, arguably, these don\u2019t produce coffee as good as you\u2019ll get using freshly ground beans. The machine will accept cups up to 4.7 inches/ 12cm tall, plus also included is a steam wand that can be used to create velvety-smooth warm milk for longer, coffee-based drinks such as latte and cappuccino.",
    "The Gaggia Classic comes with a plastic tamp for creating a smooth finish to the ground coffee when it's in the filter and a measuring spoon; however, there\u2019s no jug included for texturizing milk.",
    "We found the Gaggia Classic simple to use. It proved super-easy to brew intense, smooth espressos with very little experimentation required.",
    "However, do note that how well the coffee is tamped (compacted) will affect the strength and how quickly or slowly the hot drink is brewed. If it\u2019s too compacted, the coffee will be very strong and will be dispensed slowly. Conversely, if the coffee isn\u2019t compressed enough then the drink will be poured quickly but will be weak when it comes to strength.",
    "On test, we found the espresso machine took 23 seconds to brew a single shot of espresso; however, since the rocker switch allows you to control the amount of water used, the volume of coffee the machine dispenses can easily be personalized to suit you. The temperature of the coffee was 165 F / 74 C and the crema was thick and reformed when a teaspoon of sugar was sprinkled on top.",
    "Twin spouts mean it\u2019s possible to pour two evenly sized drinks at once, and we found you could comfortably place two espresso cups side by side on the drip tray. Our decibel meter registered 62dB while the machine was pouring an espresso, around the normal sound level of a conversation, which is more than acceptable in our opinion.",
    "The steam wand took 60 seconds to produce a jug of hot, texturized milk with thick and velvety bubbles, and a temperature of around 133 F/ 56 C. We found the wand just as effective for texturizing oat milk, too.",
    "Our decibel meter hit 84db while the Gaggia Classic was steaming milk, which is equivalent to the sound made by a bedside alarm clock \u2013 it certainly wasn\u2019t one of the louder steam wands we\u2019ve tested. Overall, the Gaggia poured drinks neatly, without much splashing, but there is some dripping once the drink has poured. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the espresso machine can be used with ground coffee or ESE pods, which make far less mess than ground coffee.",
