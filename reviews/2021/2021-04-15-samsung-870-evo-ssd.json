  "summary": "SATA\u2019s last stand",
  "verdict": "The Samsung 870 Evo is a fantastic SATA SSD, but it\u2019s competing for a place on a computer budget that can be much better filled by PCIe SSDs that prove better in almost every way without even bumping up the price.",

    "The fastest yet",

    "The Samsung 870 Evo took its time coming to market. Even as Samsung followed up its successful 860 Evo with the affordable QLC-NAND-based 870 QVO, the 870 Evo was nowhere to be seen. And, now that it\u2019s here, it\u2019s starting to feel like there\u2019s a bit less reason for it to exist.",
    "At a starting price of $129 (\u00a3119, AU$201) for the 1TB model, this SATA SSD costs as much as its recent M.2 NVMe compatriot, the Samsung 980 SSD. Perhaps that\u2019s why everywhere we look, we see it discounted. And though there are a lot more unoccupied SATA slots to fill than there are empty M.2 slots, it\u2019s not a great position for a much slower technology to go head to head on price with its superiors. It even stays close in price to the Samsung 980 at its other capacities, which range down to 250GB, though it also comes in 2TB and 4TB capacities that Samsung 980 is not yet offering.",
    "There is some newness in store at least, as the Samsung 870 Evo features Samsung new 128-layer V-NAND TLC memory and a new controller. In every benchmark we run on the 2TB model, it does step out ahead of the older 860 Evo, at least. It even pushes the Team T-Force Delta Max aside with a lead in all of our benchmarks and close price competition.",
    "We see the most noticeable improvement over the 870 Evo\u2019s predecessor in its 10GB folder transfer test, where it trims more than 10 seconds off the transfer time. Curiously, the drive's performance in our benchmarks is almost identical to those of the 870 QVO. Though it\u2019s worth noting that the 870 Evo has a far greater write endurance (600 total drive writes) than the QVO model, which can only handle 360 total drive writes.",
    "But every little bit of lead the Samsung 870 Evo musters only brings it closer to the limitations of SATA. Even in Samsung\u2019s own stack of products, the Samsung 980 obliterates the 870 Evo with more than five times the speed in our synthetic benchmarks and file transfers that are three-times shorter. It\u2019s even doing that without DRAM, something the 870 Evo actually includes.",
    "Worse still, the Samsung 980 isn\u2019t even the drive we\u2019d recommend, because just as the 870 Evo held back by its SATA interface so too is the Samsung 980 held back by its PCIe 3.0 bandwidth.",
    "The SSD market is getting faster and faster, and some of the prices you can find a PCIe 4.0 SSD for are almost shocking, like the Silicon Power US70 and PNY XLR8. All of this is to say that the SATA interface is starting to become something of a relic. If you\u2019ve filled up all the M.2 slots in your computer, the Samsung 870 Evo won\u2019t be a bad choice for some extra SATA-based storage. But, if you\u2019re not limited to SATA, there\u2019s little reason to go for the Samsung 870 Evo. Heck, you can even use USB 3.2 Gen 2 enclosures to get better speeds."
