    "The Hisense U6G doesn't have all the fancy bells and whistles that you'd expect from more expensive options, but still offers superb image quality for a TV in its price range.",
    "Those features include support for both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ alongside other HDR options. The U6G also offers up to 600 nits of brightness, which is fine for most environments, and while panels on this TV may not be the most consistent, under normal viewing you'd be hard pressed to notice blooming or blotchy image quality.",
    "The Hisense U6G comes with Google\u2019s Android TV, which is only getting increasingly responsive as TVs get more powerful. It\u2019s a decent option here, and while you may still have to wait a second or two every now and then for it to catch up, such instances are few and far between.",
    "At a starting price of $500 (around \u00a3360 / AU$670) for the 50-inch model, the U6G is tough to beat in this price range, especially if you like Android TV or plan on using an external streaming device. Most competitors either don\u2019t offer local dimming, don\u2019t get as bright, or offer an inferior software experience.",
    "The Hisense H6G is the cheapest in the Hisense 2021 TV lineup. It starts at just $500 (around \u00a3360 / AU$670) for the 50-inch model, and ranges up to $1,100 (around \u00a3790 / AU$1,470) for the 75-inch model. You can buy it now from the Hisense website and Best Buy.",
    "Here are the complete model names and prices:",
    "The Hisense U6G may sit at the budget end of the company\u2019s revamped TV lineup, but it still offers a solid design. No, it\u2019s not as premium-looking as a much more expensive TV might be, but bezels are still relatively slim, legs are sleek and stylish, and in general, the TV looks good. The bezels, legs, and everything else, are made from black or dark gray materials, and it generally looks good.",
    "The legs themselves are made from plastic, unlike some other TVs in this price range; however, it\u2019s not a cheap plastic and should still be able to hold the TV up perfectly fine. It doesn\u2019t look cheap from a distance or at a glance, so guests won\u2019t be able to tell that there\u2019s plastic involved unless they get up close and personal.",
    "On the back of the TV, you\u2019ll get all your ports and connections. The TV offers a total of four HDMI ports, three of which are side-facing and one of which is back facing. You\u2019ll also get an optical output for audio, two USB ports for power, an Ethernet port, and AV in ports. It\u2019s a solid selection of ports, and more than enough for streaming devices, gaming consoles, and so on.",
    "The remote\u2019s design is perfectly fine, but it\u2019s a bit dated. In a world of stripped-back Apple TV and Google Chromecast remotes, the U6G\u2019s remote is a little intimidating. You\u2019ll get full channel controls, software controls, Google Assistant controls, quick-access buttons for six streaming services, volume controls, and so on.",
    "Generally speaking, the Hisense U6G and the remote offer a solid design. This is a budget TV and you won\u2019t get an overly premium design \u2013 but the design that is here will still look good in most homes.",
    "The Hisense U6G ships with Android TV, which integrates excellently with Google\u2019s ecosystem of products, and at this point in time, works pretty well. There were years when Android TV worked slowly and poorly on any but the highest-end TVs, but that has thankfully changed over the past year or so. Admittedly, streaming devices like the Apple TV 4K is still far more responsive, but you\u2019ll be able to make your way around Android TV relatively easily.",
    "The remote offers controls for your smart TV, but the way it controls your TV out of the box isn\u2019t all that smart. By default, it works through infrared, which means that it requires line-of-sight but to use some of the smart features, like Google Assistant, you\u2019ll be prompted to pair the remote through Bluetooth. It\u2019s a little weird that you have to pair the remote manually and it really should be paired out of the box.",
    "For the uninitiated, Android TV basically offers a row of apps at the top of the UI, along with rows of content for each app under that. It\u2019s a solidly designed interface, and if you\u2019ve never used it before, you\u2019ll get used to it.",
    "App support, similarly, is quite good. Android TV supports most major apps including Netflix, Hulu, HBO, YouTube and others and there's even recommendations based on shows and films you've previously watched.",
    "Hisense\u2019s ULED technology has been a hit \u2013 ULED TVs offer bright, vivid colors and deep black levels on a budget, and the Hisense U6G is no exception to that rule. The TV offers a 4K resolution, support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HLG, and 60 local dimming zones to ensure deeper, more natural black levels.",
    "The H6G is at the low end of Hisense\u2019s new TV lineup, but it still offer an excellent image quality for a TV in its price range.",
    "The TV offers a range of image modes for different viewing preferences. Out of the box you\u2019ll get seven HDR modes, including a game mode and a sport mode. Most of the time, I kept it on HDR Standard, which offered more than enough brightness for my usually-dark living room. If you feel comfortable doing so, we would recommend experimenting with the viewing modes to find the best for your situation.",
    "So what are the trade-offs for buying the lowest-end TV in Hisense\u2019s new range? Well, while 60 dimming zones is fine, it\u2019s not amazing \u2014 and you\u2019ll get more on Hisense\u2019s more expensive offerings. This should make for less blooming \u2014 on the U6G there was some blooming around bright objects, especially near the edges of the display. You\u2019ll get a more consistent experience. On the U6G there was some splotchiness, again especially near the edges.",
    "But the truth is that without an eagle-eye, and in regular viewing you\u2019re unlikely to really notice these issues, and given the price range, the TV still displayed beautifully bright, vivid, and contrast-y images.",
    "Now, the TV doesn\u2019t do much more than offer an excellent image quality. That\u2019s to say, shell out a little more and you can get the U7G, which has the 120Hz panel, HDMI 2.1, and VRR tech that might appeal to gamers. If you\u2019re looking for bells and whistles, the Hisense U6G isn\u2019t the TV for you \u2013 but if all you care about is a good viewing experience, you\u2019ll get it here.",
    "Watching HDR-supportive content like Apple TV+\u2019s Tiny World was an immersive, beautiful experience. Watching lower-resolution content is a decent experience too. The TV\u2019s upscaling tech is pretty good, and while not amazing, you\u2019ll definitely forget that you\u2019re not watching 4K content as long as the original source is 1,080p or so.",
    "The Hisense U6G is a visual powerhouse in the price range \u2013 but what about audio? Well, it does the job, but as is usually the case with budget TVs, if you afford to buy a pair of speakers or a soundbar, you should do so.",
    "Now, that\u2019s not to say that the audio quality here is terrible. It\u2019s now, and in fact, without having a previous-gen Hisense TV to compare the U6G to, it does seem like Hisense\u2019s budget TVs are getting better.",
    "The speakers in this TV can get super loud \u2013 so much so that I rarely went above the 15 level except for testing purposes. At higher volumes, you will run into some distortion, but under normal listening it\u2019s not bad. You won\u2019t get a lot of bass, nor will you get much detail in the high-end, but as mentioned, the speakers here will do the job in a pinch."
