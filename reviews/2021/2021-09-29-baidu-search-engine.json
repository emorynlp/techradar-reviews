    "Baidu is China\u2019s leading search engine \u2013 you can think of it as China\u2019s Google. And while Google has a global presence and can be accessed by Chinese users (to a degree), Baidu is the go-to search engine of choice there.",
    "For U.S. users and English speakers, know this: While Baidu will load in Mandarin at first, you can easily change its settings to navigate it in English.",
    "To make that change, it\u2019s best to use Google Chrome. Click the Three-Dot icon on the top right of the page, then choose Settings. Go to Advanced > Languages, and set the This Language is Used When Translating Pages option to English (or whatever language you prefer). Next, make sure the toggle next to Offer to Translate Pages That Aren\u2019t in a Language You Read is on. (The languages you\u2019ve told Chrome you read are listed in that section, right above Add Languages.)",
    "When you go to Baidu \u2013 or any site that isn\u2019t in a language you read \u2013 you should get a pop-up to translate it. If you don\u2019t, or if you accidentally dismiss it, click the Pages icon in the address bar. Clicking that will let you choose your language, which will translate the page.",
    "Baidu can be compared to Google in terms of its products, which extend past just search. Baidu has services like maps, multimedia, and a Wikipedia-like website, among many others.",
    "For advertisers, like brands that want to promote products or services to a Chinese audience, there\u2019s an ad platform similar to Google\u2019s. You can bid on keywords, which will trigger display ads. There\u2019s also the option to pay for higher placement in search results.",
    "Baidu\u2019s privacy policy is brief and easy to understand. The search engine does collect and use your personal information, particularly to customize your search experience, but does not disclose that info to third parties. Baidu uses tracking cookies, too. The website says you can reject tracking cookies, which you should be able to do in your browser.",
    "It looks like you need a login to get into the search engine\u2019s privacy settings to make any changes, and the login page doesn\u2019t seem to translate. Basically, you should be comfortable with the out-of-the-box privacy settings offered by Baidu and whatever you can do with your browser \u2013 that\u2019s likely the most assurance you\u2019ll get.",
    "Baidu\u2019s translation into English isn\u2019t perfect, and reading the results can feel a little clunky \u2013 but odds are you\u2019re not using Baidu as your primary search engine, and getting insight into China\u2019s top results is the real draw.",
    "Also, using Baidu and getting the most accurate search results takes some effort. Baidu is designed to work with Chinese, not English, so searching in English won\u2019t give you complete results. Instead, you have to search in Chinese.",
    "For example, searching for \u201cDisneyland\u201d in English returns almost 16 million results.",
    "But searching for \u201cDisneyland\u201d in Chinese (more on how to do that in a second) returns 100 million results, and they\u2019re more targeted to Shanghai Disney.",
    "This is important because if you\u2019re marketing to a Chinese audience, you need to know what they see when they search for a specific term in Chinese, not in English. To do this, you can keep the page translation set to English, but instead of typing your search term in English, go to Google Translate. Select English in the first box and Chinese (Simplified) from the drop-down in the second box. Translate your search text, then copy and paste the Chinese characters into the Baidu search field.",
    "Baidu can be accessed via Baidu.com, and it\u2019s best to use the search engine on Chrome for the translation tools.",
    "Don\u2019t be fooled by the \u201cBaidu in English\u201d website that will likely come up as a top result if you search for \u201cBaidu.\u201d While this search engine claims to return the same results as Baidu.com when you search in English, it also states that it\u2019s not affiliated with Baidu in any way.",
    "While Google is its biggest competitor globally, Baidu is the leading search engine in China (Google is highly blocked for Chinese users). Moreover, Baidu is focused on the country\u2019s market, while Google has a global reach. Also, Baidu does a better job than Google at understanding Chinese-language searches \u2013 it has a more complex search algorithm to match the complex native language.",
    "The regular internet user may not have any need for Baidu, but for brands or creators that want to reach a Chinese market, it\u2019s an unparalleled tool.",
    "Searching with Baidu and getting the best results possible takes some effort when it comes to translating text to and from Chinese. You have to set the home page and results pages to your language of choice (which won\u2019t always auto-populate, so you have to click to translate), but you should search in Chinese, which requires translating your search text from English.",
    "If you don\u2019t mind the somewhat long-winded approach, though, and you\u2019re either highly interested in Chinese culture, or you\u2019re trying to reach a Chinese audience, Baidu is the preeminent search engine to use. It also has a lot of products to experiment with, and while you may not need them on a daily basis, they can be helpful to further learn what a Chinese audience is interested in."
