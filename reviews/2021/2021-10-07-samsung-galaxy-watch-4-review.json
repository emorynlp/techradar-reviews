  "summary": "Samsung embraces Wear OS once again",
  "verdict": "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4\u2019s headline feature is a revamp of its software that combines the look and feel of Samsung\u2019s existing Tizen platform and the functionality of Wear OS. It has good fitness features, strong battery life and a comfortable design. There are some compatibility issues, which may frustrate some potential buyers, but largely the Galaxy Watch 4 is an interesting iteration of Samsung\u2019s top smartwatch formula.",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent performance",
    "Interesting new software",
    "Lightweight design"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Limited compatibility",
    "Lacks rotating bezel",
    "No exciting fitness upgrades"
  ],

    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite smartwatches ever, and it\u2019s the first time in a while that we\u2019ve seen the company embrace Wear OS software. It\u2019s not your typical Wear OS watch though; it\u2019s called One UI Watch 3, and it\u2019s been built by Samsung with Google\u2019s help.",
    "On paper, the overall upgrade is limited in software and hardware, but the Watch 4 is suitable for anyone who\u2019s looking for a top-end smartwatch that can track workouts, as well as offer a lot of other smart features that many alternative wrist companions can't.",
    "That said, the Galaxy Watch 4\u2019s compatibility is inexplicably worse than prior Samsung watches. If you own an iPhone, this won\u2019t work with it, and while it\u2019s compatible with all modern Android phones, you\u2019ll need to own a Samsung smartphone to access some features, such as blood pressure or ECG measurements.",
    "It's certainly disappointing given Samsung\u2019s previous smartwatches are some of the best in terms of compatibility. We\u2019d still say the Watch 4 is worth picking up even if you own a non-Samsung Android phone, but you should note that there are limitations.",
    "Given those caveats, there's plenty to like about the watch's design. There\u2019s a virtual rotating bezel \u2013 a returning feature from the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 \u2013 which, in conjunction with two buttons on the right-hand side allows for easy navigation around the smartwatch\u2019s menus. Some may miss the physical rotating bezel from the Galaxy Watch 3, but this is a good alternative.",
    "The fitness features here aren\u2019t hugely different to what we\u2019ve seen before, but there is a new body composition tool that gives you a rough idea of your body fat percentage. We\u2019ve found that GPS, heart rate monitoring and other fitness features are well thought out on the Galaxy Watch 4.",
    "Battery life isn\u2019t a huge concern on the Galaxy Watch 4, but it isn\u2019t the longest lasting smartwatch we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019ll last up to around two days with normal to intensive usage, and around three days if you\u2019re not working out or using features like GPS.",
    "Introduced alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, the Galaxy Watch 4 is joined by a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic \u2013 you should look at that smartwatch if you want a physical rotating bezel, which is the major difference between the two devices.",
    "As for the Galaxy Watch 4, this smartwatch is a great choice for anyone who owns a Galaxy smartphone. If you own a different Android phone, it\u2019s still a worthy choice for your next smartwatch, but there are caveats around the features mentioned above.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 will likely be reduced in the Black Friday deals, so it\u2019s worth looking at the best smartwatch Black Friday deals out there. We\u2019ll be conducting a re-review in the future. However, we\u2019ve updated references within our review to highlight new features that have emerged since our tests to give you a better idea of what you might be buying.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is available now in the US and UK where it went on sale on August 26, 2021. Those in Australia will get it on September 10.",
    "There are two sizes of the Galaxy Watch 4. The smaller 40mm version costs $249.99 / \u00a3249 / AU$399 for the Bluetooth version, while the LTE version costs $299.99 / \u00a3289 / AU$499.",
    "If you like a larger watch, the 44mm model costs $279.99 / \u00a3269 (about AU$500) in its Bluetooth form and $329.99 / \u00a3309 (about AU$580) for the 4G variant. This is far cheaper than the Galaxy Watch 3, but that\u2019s because this device is largely a replacement for the Galaxy Watch Active 2.",
    "If you want a larger smartwatch with a physical rotating bezel, you\u2019ll want to opt for the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. That\u2019s a separate product line this year, although a lot of the specs are similar between that device and this one.",
    "The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 42mm costs $349 / \u00a3349 / AU$549 for the Bluetooth model and $399 / \u00a3389 / AU$649 for the LTE model. The 46mm model comes in a Bluetooth version for $379 / \u00a3369 / AU$599, or an LTE variant at $429 / \u00a3409 / AU$699.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is a slimline smartwatch with a design that sits comfortably on your wrist. If you\u2019re looking for something a touch chunkier, or you\u2019d like a rotating bezel, you should opt for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.",
    "For those looking for a slimmer design, the Galaxy Watch 4 offers that, with two buttons on the right-hand edge and little else to detract from its sleek looks. It comes in two models, one with a 40mm watch face and another with a 44mm body.",
    "Both models are made of aluminum. The dimensions of the 40mm model are 40.4 x 39.3 x 9.8mm with a weight of 25.9g, while the 44mm is 44.4 x 43.3 x 9.8mm and weighs 30.3g.",
    "We\u2019ve worn both models, and we found both to be a comfortable fit without weighing down our wrist.",
    "We\u2019ve used the 44mm model for a longer period than the smaller model, and we found that to be a suitable size (note that this writer is an adult man). It\u2019s comfortable to wear throughout the day, although it may not be the best fit to wear at night for sleep tracking.",
    "The screens on both Galaxy Watch 4 models look bright, and we found them easy to read. The resolution is also impressive, with the 40mm watch featuring a 396 x 396 resolution and the 44mm model taking that up to 450 x 450. That\u2019s 330 pixels per inch for both models.",
    "One unique feature of the Galaxy Watch 4 compared to other smartwatches is its \u2018virtual\u2019 rotating bezel feature. There\u2019s no physical rotating bezel here \u2013 go for the Watch 4 Classic if that\u2019s a feature you want \u2013 but you can run your finger around the black bezel of the screen to rotate through menus and access different features.",
    "Each model is also IP68 water- and dust-resistant, which means you can take them into water up to five meters deep. A word about the supplied watch band though \u2013 it\u2019s made of a new material that may not handle intense workouts well, as we found it left something of a rash on our wrist.",
    "You may want to invest in a band made from different material if you regularly wear your watch to the gym.",
    "Color options vary between models, too. The 40mm Watch 4 comes in black, gold and silver, while the 44mm model comes in black, green and silver. All of these are relatively muted colors, so you may want to buy another strap if you want a bolder shade on your wrist.",
    "The Watch 4 features Samsung\u2019s own Exynos W920 chipset and 1.5GB of RAM. Throughout our testing time we\u2019ve found this to be enough power to run a variety of apps smoothly without any slowdown. This is one of the fastest smartwatches we\u2019ve ever used.",
    "This speed isn\u2019t as noticeable as it might be on a smartphone or a laptop, but it is noticeable when compared to other smartwatches, and it allows you to use a variety of apps while the GPS features are running, for example.",
    "There\u2019s 16GB of storage on both models of the Galaxy Watch 4. We found that about 8GB of this was taken up with the OS and preloaded apps, which leaves you with the same again for your own apps and music.",
    "Its software is where the Galaxy Watch 4 shines. Samsung isn\u2019t using its own Tizen wearables software here, and is instead re-embracing Google\u2019s Wear OS, although with its own spin.",
    "You\u2019d be forgiven for being confused here. Tizen has been the focus of Samsung\u2019s software efforts in recent years, and the software running on the Galaxy Watch 4 looks similar to it.",
    "Instead, this is Wear OS 3 but with Samsung\u2019s own skin, called One UI Watch 3, on top. It includes a variety of Samsung apps that you\u2019ll be used to if you\u2019ve had a Galaxy Watch before, but this is primarily Wear OS. That means you\u2019ve got access to the Google Play Store, and while Wear OS isn\u2019t the best-supported platform apps-wise, you\u2019ve got more/a lot more/whatever options than you have on Tizen. The design, meanwhile, still feels distinctly Samsung.",
    "The software on the Galaxy Watch 4 looks good and works smoothly, plus you\u2019ll find all of the apps available on the Google Play Store are ready and waiting. This is a better solution than Tizen, but it keeps all the benefits that made Tizen software great.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 comes with a whole host of health and fitness features, including GPS for tracking runs, an optical heart rate sensor, and ECG support.",
    "The big fitness changes come in the form of a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor that enables the watch to monitor heart rate, blood oxygen levels and body composition. The last in that list is the only new feature, but this is the first time the sensors have been combined.",
    "Samsung says its body composition measurement tools enable you to see key fitness metrics such as skeletal muscle mass and body fat percentage. These scans are easy to run, although you\u2019ll need to stay still in order for them to work.",
    "The stats you\u2019ll get include a body fat percentage score, skeletal muscle, fat mass, body water and BMI. It\u2019ll also give you a rough idea of the healthy range for your sex, weight and height.",
    "It\u2019s hard to tell how accurate these various metrics are, but we found it useful to have at least a rough idea of them, and you\u2019ll be able to track these over a period of time to see if you can improve the results.",
    "The heart rate monitor proved accurate, with our results tallying with measurements taken using other devices. The heart rate monitor worked best within Samsung\u2019s own apps, but you can also apply these features to third-party Wear OS tools like Strava and Nike Running Club.",
    "We also found the GPS features worked well when we took the watch running with accurate positioning when compared to other devices.",
    "One important thing to note is the limited compatibility of some fitness features. The ECG and blood pressure monitoring tools are only available when you connect the Galaxy Watch 4 to a Samsung smartphone.",
    "This is a frustrating element, and it means this watch may not be the best choice for you if you don\u2019t own a Samsung phone. Alternative devices from brands such as Garmin offer similar features, but across any phone.",
    "The 44mm Galaxy Watch 4, which is the model we reviewed, is powered by a 361mAh battery, and battery life proved strong during our testing time - we found the smartwatch would last at least two days from a single charge even with intensive use, and if you\u2019re not regularly using fitness features, you can expect the watch to last for a full three days.",
    "The 40mm version comes with a smaller 247mAh cell, and we\u2019ve yet to be able to test how well this performs. Our experience with previous Samsung smartwatches has seen a slight difference in battery life between the smaller and larger model, but you shouldn\u2019t expect the 40mm variant to be dramatically different.",
    "There\u2019s a charging pad included in the box, which is a bit of a surprise as Samsung has dropped these from its smartphones in recent years. That said, you\u2019ll just get the cable here so you\u2019ll have to find a charging block or plug it directly into a USB compatible device.",
