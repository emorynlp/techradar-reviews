  "summary": "A decent mid-ranger with a better sibling",
  "verdict": "The Xiaomi 11T Pro comes at a very competitive price, with a camera array, chipset and charging speed that are impressive for a mid-range phone, and it would be easy to recommend if it wasn\u2019t for a few minor issues. The device gets hot easily, is quite big, picks up fingerprints readily on the rear, has a few too many software bugs. It\u2019s still a worthy addition to the Mi 11 lineup, though the standard 11T is more.",
  "pros": [
    "Smooth and responsive to use",
    "Cameras perform well",
    "Incredibly fast to charge"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Rear is a fingerprint magnet",
    "Fingerprint scanner is hard to reach",
    "Overheating issues"

    "While the main numbered range of Xiaomi phones is where the company debuts its flashy new tech and features, the T line is often where the real action is.",
    "Launching roughly six months after the Xiaomi Mi 11, the 11T Pro offers lots of the features of that premium phone in a device that\u2019s more modestly priced, though with a few corners cut here and there to keep that price low.",
    "That\u2019s the whole point of the Mi T family, but while the Mi 10T Pro was an intriguing counterpoint to the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro, the 11T Pro is an impressive device that will easily tempt buyers away from the \u2018standard\u2019 Mi 11.",
    "The Xiaomi 11T Pro \u2013 note the lack of the \u2018Mi\u2019, as Xiaomi has stopped using the duplicate Mi branding that we used to see in handsets from the company \u2013 is a flagship phone in the areas where it counts.",
    "It has almost exactly the same camera array, the same chipset, a bigger battery and faster charging than the Mi 11. Sure, its screen is a tiny bit smaller, but due to the display having flat edges (not curved, as in the Mi 11) the viewable area is basically the same size.",
    "That fast charging we mentioned is definitely the biggest new feature, as it\u2019s a startling 120W using the in-box charger. That\u2019s over twice as fast as the 55W charging of the Mi 11, and zooms past the Samsung Galaxy S21\u2019s 25W or the iPhone 12\u2019s 15W. It takes just over 15 minutes \u2013 that\u2019s not a typo: fifteen \u2013 to power the phone to full at that speed.",
    "Many other features here were expected in the Mi 11, but are impressive here due to the lower price. The Snapdragon 888 chipset, for example, is most commonly found in premium phones, though some cheaper handsets have it too, and it provides oodles of processing power for gaming or other tasks.",
    "Well, in theory it does\u2026 but the 888\u2019s oft-reported overheating issue rears its head here. The chipset has been known to overheat when pushed, which can in turn reduce its performance until it cools down, so if you use the phone heavily you might run into this issue.",
    "That\u2019s not the only minor annoyance the Xiaomi 11T Pro presents \u2013 another is that the material used for its rear easily picks up fingerprints. Within a few minutes of starting to use the device, our review unit looked as much like an impressionist painting as a smartphone.",
    "Oh, and people with smaller hands might struggle to reach the side buttons on the phone, as it\u2019s a pretty chunky device.",
    "Overall, though, we were impressed with the Xiaomi 11T Pro during our testing. It\u2019s just a shame it won\u2019t be the stand-out member of the Mi 11T line, as the non-Pro version is cheaper with relatively few downgrades.",
    "The Xiaomi 11T Pro release date is October 1, with pre-orders beginning the week before. That\u2019s slightly earlier than the non-Pro\u2019s release date on October 7.",
    "The price is \u00a3599 (roughly $830, AU$1,130) - that\u2019s for 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, and that goes up to \u00a3699 (about $970, AU$1,320) for double the storage. Right now we only have UK prices, but it\u2019s likely the phone will also go on sale in Australia.",
    "For context the Xiaomi Mi 11 cost \u00a3749 / AU$1,099 (roughly $1,040) for the former storage size and \u00a3799 / AU$1,139 (around $1,110) for the latter making this a more affordable device, at least in regions we have prices for.",
    "The real competition here is the Xiaomi 11T, as its main downgrades from the standard phone are slower charging and a slightly weaker chipset. However starting at just \u00a3499 (about $690, AU$940) the lower price more than makes up for the reduced specs.",
    "The Xiaomi 11T Pro isn\u2019t the most visually distinct smartphone in the world, but that\u2019s the company\u2019s T line for you.",
    "It\u2019s a big phone \u2013 maybe too big for some people to comfortably use, as it was a stretch for us and we\u2019ve got fairly average-sized mitts \u2013 but that\u2019s because you\u2019ve got so much screen space.",
    "On the right edge of the phone is a fingerprint scanner, which was just within reach for us but might be a struggle for some to hit. It\u2019s an impressively responsive scanner, and we never had trouble unlocking our phone just with a tap of our thumb.",
    "In fact, we sometimes found the sensor a little too sensitive \u2013 when we were holding the device in our hand while walking or on a run, even a slight brush of our thumb over the scanner would unlock the phone, meaning that we often unlocked the device when we didn\u2019t want to. We can\u2019t really mark a phone down for having a feature that\u2019s too good, but it\u2019s something worth noting.",
    "Just above the fingerprint scanner is the volume rocker. The handset has a USB-C port but no 3.5mm headphone jack, so fans of wired audio will need an adaptor if they want to plug their cans in.",
    "A nice improvement over the Mi 10T Pro here is the camera bump on the back, which stuck out like a mountain range on the 2020 phone, but on the 11T Pro is much less imposing. The rear of the phone isn\u2019t without its issues though, as it\u2019s a fingerprint magnet \u2013 holding and using the device for any length of time will turn the smooth plastic, which comes in a choice of white, blue, or gray, into a patchwork of smudges and marks.",
    "On paper, the Xiaomi 11T Pro\u2019s screen is arguably one of its biggest downgrades from the Mi 11; that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad, but the Mi 11\u2019s display was one of its key selling points, whereas it seems that Xiaomi is focusing on cameras for the 11T Pro. The screen here is absolutely fit for purpose, though.",
    "It\u2019s a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel, which is a little smaller than the 6.81-inch display on the Mi 11, but unlike on that phone the 11T Pro\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t curve at the edges, and the punch-hole for the front-facing camera is at the top-center of the screen, rather than the top-left.",
    "The resolution is 2400 x 1080, which is the standard for most phones at any price, though the Mi 11 phones hit 3200 x 1440. 1080p is fine for most tasks though, as your streaming services and games will generally only reach that resolution, and we never found ourselves wishing for more pixels.",
    "The handset also has a fast 120Hz refresh rate, which matches the Mi 11 but actually falls short of the 144Hz on the Mi 10T series \u2013 although that\u2019s an easy downgrade to overlook when you consider that so few apps can make the most of 144Hz screens. That\u2019s the theme of the Mi 11T Pro\u2019s display \u2013 downgrades you can live with.",
    "If you know the Xiaomi Mi 11\u2019s cameras, you\u2019ll find the 11T Pro\u2019s array fairly familiar: it has the same 108MP main and 5MP telemacro snappers, but its ultra-wide and selfie cameras are lower-res at 8MP and 16MP respectively.",
    "We found the f/1.75 108MP main camera performed similarly to the one on the Mi 11 \u2013 it takes great-looking shots in well-lit conditions, with good contrast, bold colors and lots of detail. By default this camera uses \u2018pixel binning\u2019, a process by which the pixels, or photosites, on the sensor are combined to create fewer, but larger, pixels (which are better for \u2018seeing\u2019 light), which means pictures taken are 27MP.",
    "If you want, you can switch to a high-res mode that uses the sensor\u2019s full 108MP \u2013 photos captured in this mode are super-high-res, which gives you more latitude for subsequent editing, but you\u2019re not capturing as much color and brightness information per pixel.",
    "In low-light conditions, the 11T Pro shows its rougher edges, as there\u2019s some noise in pictures, but the pixel binning goes some way to mitigate that.",
    "Next up is the ultra-wide camera, with an f/2.2 aperture and 8MP resolution \u2013 because of this relatively low-res sensor pictures can look a bit grainy in areas, but it\u2019s not too noticeable unless you look for it. Colors looked similar to those in photos taken with the main camera, but we occasionally noticed overexposure issues.",
    "As in the standard Mi 11, the f/2.4 5MP telemacro camera is a star here, as it\u2019s fantastic for taking macro or close-up pictures \u2013 no other phone maker has a macro snapper that quite rivals the one Xiaomi has included in a few members of its Mi 11 family.",
    "The camera is quick to focus and easy to use, and it enables you to capture the little details and textures in small subjects that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise see. We had fun capturing close-up snaps of plants and food \u2013 even though we were doing this exact thing six months earlier with the Mi 11.",
    "Moving round to the front, we were happy with selfies taken on the Xiaomi 11T Pro; the fact that the snapper is lower-res than many rivals doesn\u2019t matter, since 16MP is more than enough.",
    "Portraits had eye-catching contrast, and it seems to us that shadows and highlights are tweaked on these snaps to make the subject stand out more. In these photos, the background blur or \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect generally did a good job of separating subjects from their backdrops,, although sometimes it could blur edges of the body too.",
    "While selfie portraits look good, images taken using the main camera\u2019s Portrait mode look great \u2013 the tweaks applied to images are subtle and hard to notice (unless you compare Portrait and Photo-mode snaps side-by-side), but they make the subject stand out from the background that little bit more.",
    "Judging by Xiaomi\u2019s marketing, videography is an important aspect of the 11T Pro\u2019s camera capabilities. Video goes up to 8K resolution or 60fps (though not both at the same time) and a range of extra modes like letterboxing, macro video, object tracking and audio zoom give you handy extra tools for your movie-making.",
    "Xiaomi has differentiated itself from the competition with a range of fun extra camera tools in its phones, for both stills and video, and that\u2019s the case again here: there\u2019s sky editing mode that lets you change the appearance of the sky background of a photo; Vlog mode, which automatically edits several-second-long video clips together; clone, which shows a mirror image for a photo or video; movie effects which basically add a color filter to videos, and more.",
    "Unlike with most new Xiaomi phones, we couldn\u2019t find any new modes introduced with the 11T Pro, but software updates frequently bring new tools to devices from the company.",
    "The Xiaomi 11T Pro runs on the Snapdragon 888 chipset \u2013 that\u2019s not quite the top-end Android chipset available, with a Plus version released shortly before this phone was, but it\u2019s still a super-powerful processor that should, in theory, make the phone snappy to use and great for gaming.",
    "As we say, that\u2019s in theory; however when we put the handset through the Geekbench 5 benchmark test, it returned a bizarrely spread-out range of multi-core scores, ranging from a low of 2787 to a high of 3058. Generally we see results within a range of less than 100, not closer to 300, as here.",
    "For context, the 888-toting Mi 11 and Mi 11 Ultra both consistently hit over 3500, and the 11T Pro\u2019s results are lower than those of any other Snapdragon 888 phone we\u2019ve tested. In fact, many phones with older chipsets, like the Snapdragon 865-toting Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and the OnePlus 8 Pro, both beat it.",
    "We\u2019d speculate that the aforementioned heating problems are a big issue here. One of the biggest complaints users have made regarding the Snapdragon 888 is the overheating problem: when it\u2019s running an intensive task, it can heat up rather easily compared to previous versions or rival chips, something that was noticeable when gaming on the Xiaomi 11T Pro.",
    "When we ran the Geekbench tests straight after one another, the scores seemed to consistently dip, although even when cool the phone returned low scores. We\u2019d speculate that the phone\u2019s heat was reducing its performance, an issue we also faced with the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, and it really feels like the company needs to improve the cooling systems in its phones.",
    "That said, gaming felt fairly snappy on the Xiaomi 11T Pro \u2013 even a Geekbench score of 3000 bodes fairly well for gaming \u2013 and when we tested a diverse range of titles we found that the phone could handle maximum graphics settings with ease. It\u2019s possible that really long gaming bouts could trigger the overheating issue, and potentially impact performance, but we didn\u2019t encounter this in gaming sessions of up to an hour.",
    "Like all Xiaomi phones, the 11T Pro runs Android with the company\u2019s own fork, called MIUI. The device comes running Android 11 out of the box, and it\u2019ll likely get a few years of updates.",
    "MIUI is divisive, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. It comes with lots of pre-installed apps like eBay, LinkedIn and AliExpress; it can be fairly buggy (we encountered an issue in which it switched our wallpaper, and always-on display, from our selection back to the defaults); and its security feature, which scans new apps, will always bring up a huge overlay whenever a new app is installed.",
    "If you can look past these issues \u2013 and you\u2019ll have to squint to look past some of them \u2013 MIUI has quite a few positives which make up for the negatives.",
    "The user interface has an iOS-style control center which you can toggle on. This means that instead of swiping down to see the options icons and your notification list, like on other Android phones, you can pull down from the top-left to see notifications or top-right to see options like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and mobile data. Once you get used to something like this, it\u2019s hard to go back to the standard one-list option on other devices.",
    "MIUI\u2019s pre-packaged wallpapers all look great, especially the live ones, and it offers lots of options for customizing the always-on display. MIUI also provides loads of customization options to make the home screen feel truly yours, more so than some other Android forks.",
    "It feels like MIUI does some things way better than other Android overlays, and other things way worse; using the Xiaomi 11T Pro makes this abundantly clear, and while we managed to overlook the annoyances, we can\u2019t be certain that everyone will.",
    "While the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro\u2019s battery life was one of its best features, clearly the 11T Pro has taken after the Mi 11 instead of its year-older cousin, because the battery life isn\u2019t amazing.",
    "That\u2019s a surprise given the 5,000mAh power pack, which is fairly big for a phone. It\u2019s likely that a combination of the big display, high refresh rate, power-hungry chipset and 5G modem all eat away at the battery \u2013 you can turn off some of those if you like, though.",
    "We found that, if we limited our use, we could get the phone to last a day between charges \u2013 by \u2018limiting our use\u2019 we mean questioning \u2018do I really play that next level of a game\u2019, \u2018do I need to check Instagram on the loo\u2019 and \u2018maybe I don\u2019t need to take a photo of dinner\u2019\u2026 things some people would automatically answer \u2018no\u2019 to.",
    "Less intensive phone users should get a comfortable day between charges, then, but if you use your device a lot, you might find the battery life limiting.",
    "All the better, then, that the Xiaomi 11T Pro supports incredibly quick wired charging, at 120W (if you use the in-box charger). Not including a few devices which have only launched in select regions, this is the fastest powering we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone.",
    "Xiaomi states that it takes 17 minutes to power the phone up from empty to full using the in-box charger, and based on our testing, we\u2019d concur. That\u2019s impressively fast \u2013 you can get a whole morning of use in the time your pre-work coffee takes to brew (unless you use instant, of course) \u2013 and it goes a long way in offsetting the poor battery life.",
    "There\u2019s no wireless or reverse wireless charging here, so you\u2019ll have to use cables to power up the phone, but that\u2019s likely a result of the phone\u2019s lower price."
