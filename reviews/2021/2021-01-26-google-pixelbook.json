    "Google has recently announced the Google Pixelbook Go, which will be the successor to the Pixelbook. Find out more about this new device, its features and its release date.",
    "There\u2019s no Chromebook quite like Google Pixelbook. Its horsepower and versatility overshadow most of the competitors in its class like the Chromebook Pixel, and make it among the best Chromebooks and the best 2-in-1 laptops out there.",
    "Google Pixelbook is also more than just about form and function. Sharing a design philosophy with Google\u2019s Pixel Slate, this Google Chromebook packs a lot of style as well. Alongside 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors, it\u2019s also fitted with a stunning 2,400 x 1,600 display and support for Pixelbook Pen, which unfortunately doesn\u2019t come included in the box.",
    "With the inclusion of Android, without losing any of Chrome OS\u2019s features, Google Pixelbook has actually helped raise the profile of premium Chromebooks and what they\u2019re capable of as worthy adversaries to Windows 10 laptops.",
    "With specs similar to Apple\u2019s offerings, the relatively affordable Pixelbook is a premium experience that easily rivals any of its competitors. And, while Google Pixelbook Go is a cheaper option for budget-minded shoppers, the Google Pixelbook is still more enticing for those wanting a premium experience.",
    "There\u2019s no denying it \u2013 the Google Pixelbook is an expensive Chromebook. Starting at $999 or \u00a3999 and capping out at $1,649 or \u00a31,699 \u2013 even without including the $99 (\u00a399, about AU$130) Pixelbook Pen, though Google is generously throwing in a pen loop for those in need of a place to secure the pen.",
    "For that premium price, however, you\u2019re also getting 7th generation Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 processors on both the entry-level 128GB configuration and $1,199 (\u00a31,199, about AU$1,555) mid-range 256GB configuration, each paired with 8GB of memory. On the other hand, the top-end 512GB option comes packing a Core i7 processor with 16GB of memory. All of these processor options are Intel\u2019s low-power, low-heat Y series chips, which means all of the Pixelbook models are fanless.",
    "Unfortunately, for our friends Down Under, this beauty hasn\u2019t made in Australia. That means they\u2019ll either have to settle for the competition or import it from the US, in which case they might have to shell out more for shipping.",
    "Now, let\u2019s talk about how this holds up against 2017\u2019s Samsung Chromebook Pro and the Asus Chromebook Flip, both of which were designed in close conjunction with Google to jumpstart the company\u2019s Android app push on Chrome OS. Both of these 2-in-1s are considerably more affordable, with Samsung and Asus currently selling for $599 (about \u00a3468, AU$869) and $469 (\u00a3366, about AU$680), respectively.",
    "However, they\u2019re both noticeably less powerful as well, only fitted with the same 6th-generation Intel Core m3 processor. On the upside, this processor produces low heat, which lets it take advantage of fanless chassis designs. That said, they\u2019re both beautiful Chromebooks in their own right, even if they offer significantly less memory and local storage.",
    "At the end of the day, these two Chromebooks are a better bargain for what the Chrome OS platform currently offers. However, the Google Pixelbook is a future-facing device. The Pixelbook is to the Chromebook what Microsoft\u2019s Surface was to the Windows 10 2-in-1 laptops that succeeded.",
    "The Google Pixelbook is the result of years of incredible work on Google\u2019s part in refining a unified design across its hardware offerings. But, the Pixelbook could also be seen as a sort of coming of age for Google\u2019s design philosophy.",
    "It\u2019s easy to say that this is the most stunning and remarkably designed computing device from Google yet. From the brushed aluminum frame with flush edges to the rubberized palm rest and underside, every design element has achieved style and substance in equal measure.",
    "However, if you haven\u2019t purchased a laptop in the last few years, you might have a hard time accepting the lack of ports. Still, the Google Pixelbook is at least future proof. Which reminds us \u2013 the webcam is just as suitable for an increasingly video-centric future with a 720p resolution and 60 frames per second capture rate.",
    "The same can\u2019t be said of the audio, however. This has become normal in thin and light notebooks: Google has crammed the speakers beneath the keyboard, and the result is tinny sound. Fortunately, a 3.5mm audio jack is there to let you use the best headphones with the Pixelbook.",
    "On the upside, the glass trackpad is a pleasure to use as it tracks smoothly and precisely, both in single- and-multi-touch gestures. However, we found that the trackpad doesn\u2019t like us resting our thumb on it to click while tracking with our index finger \u2013 a common use case, but not this editor\u2019s personal preference.",
    "Likewise, the Pixelbook keyboard is among the best we\u2019ve ever used. The backlit keyboard\u2019s keys are well-spaced, and its 0.8mm travel is a delight with forceful feedback. We also love the subtle, deeply satisfying clicking sound the keys make \u2013 it\u2019s different from every laptop keyboard we\u2019ve tested, and now we\u2019re going to expect it everywhere.",
    "The Pixelbook earns the \u2018pixel\u2019 when it comes to the 3:2 display. At 235 ppi with accurate color reproduction, the Pixelbook display rivals some of the best around, Chromebook or otherwise. It\u2019s in the same class as the 227 ppi 13-inch MacBook Pro and the 267 ppi Surface Pro 6.",
    "The panel works stunningly for movies and photos, as well as photo editing. The 400 nits of brightness help hugely with this. It is still a glossy screen however, and as such doesn\u2019t stand up to direct sunlight all that well. At any rate, the display is also extremely accurate to the touch, especially when underneath the Pixelbook Pen.",
    "First off, we\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s a damn shame that the Pixelbook Pen is excluded in the price of the Pixelbook, as it\u2019s arguably crucial to the experience. However, we\u2019re not about the say that the stylus isn\u2019t worth the price of admission, because it 100% is worth it \u2013 if you can spare it.",
    "The Pixelbook Pen works beautifully as a stylus, offering plenty of pressure response as well as tilt support, which makes drawing on the display a pleasure. The display\u2019s snappy response helps the digital ink follow close enough behind the pen that any delay is indiscernible.",
    "On the Pixelbook Pen sits a single button, which is essentially a Google Assistant button, but also seems to incorporate some of the new Google Lens technology found in smartphones, like the Google Pixel 2. Pressing the button while inking turns that ink into a thick blue, but doesn\u2019t actually draw anything.",
    "Instead, anything captured inside this blue ink is sent to Google Assistant for analysis, which in turn presents anything and everything Google\u2019s servers can gather about whatever you encircled. Circle a picture of a hippopotamus, and Google Assistant will hit you with a Wikipedia page on the animal. In fact, Google\u2019s knowledge graph runs so deep that we circled a picture of Office Space\u2019s Ron Livingston, and Google Assistant spat back his character\u2019s name \u2013 Peter Gibbons \u2013 before telling us more about the actor.",
    "This will be an incredibly useful tool for students, particularly, but users in general will benefit.",
    "Another advantage regarding the Pixelbook Pen is that it\u2019s opened up Google Keep to support pen input, even from the lock screen, making note-taking that much easier. There are even apps that can convert the Pixelbook Pen\u2019s scrawlings into traditional text.",
    "However, one huge flaw in the Pixelbook Pen is that it doesn\u2019t attach to the laptop in any way, not even via magnets, like the Surface Pro. This oversight makes it that much easier to lose this stylus that cost you so much money. Plus, it runs on AAAA batteries, whereas a rechargeable solution would\u2019ve been much more worthy of the price tag.",
    "As for Google Assistant, the service can be activated either using a dedicated keyboard button or via your voice, if you don\u2019t invest in the Pixelbook Pen. However, the latter only works when the laptop is logged into \u2013 waking the Pixelbook with a \u2018Hey, Google\u2019 voice command is in the works, we\u2019re told.",
    "In general, Google Assistant is just as helpful as it is on smartphones and executes in the exact same way, with an OS-level chat record as well as a voice response.",
