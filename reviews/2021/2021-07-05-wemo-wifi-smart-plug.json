    "Belkin is a name more familiar with smartphone and computing peripherals, even though it\u2019s been manufacturing some of the best smart home devices under the Wemo brand since 2012. The Wemo WiFi smart plug is the brand\u2019s latest launch in the smart home space, and has recently been extended to the UK and Europe, after initially only being available in the US. The Wemo WiFi smart plug is a single socket that can be plugged into a power outlet and controlled using Wemo\u2019s own app, Apple\u2019s Home app or Siri \u2013 although those in the US also benefit from Alexa and Google Assistant support.",
    "As well as switching the socket on and off from the app, you can set schedules so it turns on or off automatically, or engage the Away mode \u2013 which randomizes the times at which the smart plug switches on and off \u2013 to simulate occupancy.",
    "It can also be used in home automations that see several smart home devices controlled at once, although in the UK \u2013 or in the US, if you\u2019re using HomeKit \u2013 to control the smart plug when you\u2019re not at home, you\u2019ll need a HomePod Mini or Apple TV 4K to act as a smart home hub.",
    "For those deeply tied into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, or starting to use HomeKit to power their smart home, the Wemo WiFi is the most affordable smart plug on the market right now.",
    "The Wemo WiFi smart plug is priced at $24.99 / \u00a324.99 and is available in the US and UK from Belkin. In the UK, you can also pick it up from the Apple Store. In the US, it\u2019s available from Amazon.",
    "The Wemo WiFi smart plug is similar to the majority of smart plugs on the market looks-wise: it sports a simple, inoffensive all-white design. In the US, the smart plug has a horizontal design that measures 1.81 x 2.05 x 1.34 inches / 3 x 5.2 x 3.4cm, while the UK variant is a compact square shape, measuring 2.4 x 2.4 x 2.8 inches / 6 x 6 x 7cm.",
    "The front of the smart plug has a single socket, with a manual power button and an LED that illuminates white when the plug is switched on, or alternates between white and orange when the plug is in set-up mode.",
    "The Wemo WiFi smart plug is easy to set up, whether through HomeKit or Wemo\u2019s own app \u2013 although scanning the QR code to set up the device using the former is slightly quicker than using Wemo\u2019s own app.",
    "Once the smart plug is connected to a Wi-Fi network, it can be assigned to a particular room or group of devices. On test, we found the plug switched on and off instantly through the app or Siri, sounding a reassuring click in the process.",
    "However, if you\u2019re using the smart plug with HomeKit, as mentioned already, you\u2019ll need an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini in order to instruct the smart plug while you\u2019re out.",
    "Both Apple\u2019s Home app and Wemo\u2019s app are easy to use, which makes controlling the smart home plug a doddle, no matter the app you choose.",
    "As soon as you launch the Wemo app, you\u2019ll be presented with a list of Wemo devices installed in your home. These devices can instantly be switched on or off using the Power button icon on the right. However, in Apple\u2019s Home app, if you assign the smart plug to a particular room, it will be displayed on this tab. Otherwise, you\u2019ll find it on the main home screen \u2013 again, you simply tap to turn it on or off.",
    "The Wemo app has a Rules tab where you can set a schedule or activate Away mode, while the Apple Home app has an Automations tab where you can set schedules \u2013 but, unfortunately, you can\u2019t activate the Away mode.",
    "In the US, the smart plug also integrates with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.",
