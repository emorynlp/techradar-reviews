  "verdict": "The Xiaomi Mi watch undercuts its Fitbit rivals with an affordable price tag, and boasts an expansive suite of features, including over 100 fitness-tracking modes, along with built-in GPS, something many smartwatches at this price point lack. We did find, however, that some of the health tracking aspects felt a touch inaccurate, especially stress, sleep and energy monitoring, and a few features of this watch take some getting used to.",

    "While most popular smartphone brands also have global wearable arms \u2013 Samsung, Huawei and Oppo all sell smartwatches and fitness trackers in western markets, for example \u2013 it took Xiaomi until late 2020 to follow suit and expand its wearables operation beyond China, with its Mi Watch unveiled in September 2020, and only launched in early 2021.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch, launched alongside the Xiaomi Mi Watch Lite with a reduced fitness list at half the non-Lite version\u2019s price, is a fairly low-cost smartwatch with a huge number of fitness modes, a fair range of health features, and a few core lifestyle functions too.",
    "It\u2019s easy to view the Xiaomi Mi Watch as a competitor to Fitbit\u2019s Versa range \u2013 like those devices it\u2019s a mid-priced wearable with a solid core of features, but without the in-depth high-end health and workout tracking of a more premium device. However, while Fitbit has an ecosystem of products and software to make the Versa range a tempting buy, Xiaomi has opted to offer its device at a much lower price.",
    "This is a fine smartwatch, but one with a few issues \u2013 if we had to sum up the Mi Watch\u2019s foibles in one statement, it would be this: the watch has a huge breadth of features, but not so much in the way of depth.",
    "You can track the ebbs and flows of your heart rate, your energy level, your stress, your sleep, your steps, and more \u2013 except the numbers aren\u2019t always right. We frequently found that sleep tracking wasn\u2019t smart enough to distinguish between \u2018sleeping\u2019 and \u2018lounging in bed\u2019, for example, while the stress tracker tended to conflate \u2018highly stressed\u2019 with \u2018just had a nice hot cup of coffee\u2019. That\u2019s not to say all these modes are straight-up wrong, and we often found them useful, but the discrepancies stood out.",
    "There are over 100 fitness-racking modes, which vary in depth and complexity, but they\u2019re often pretty useful, and the built-in GPS comes in handy for lots of them. When you go for a run, lots of metrics are tracked to provide detailed analysis of your exertions, though you need to use the Xiaomi Wear app to get all the feedback.",
    "Sure, some of the workout modes aren\u2019t as in-depth as running, which is arguably the most popular one, but then factors like altitude or location aren\u2019t especially useful for sports like Tai Chi. And we did find lots of the information was fairly accurate, although distance sometimes felt a tiny bit off.",
    "An imperfect experience is to be expected given the Xiaomi Mi Watch\u2019s affordable price tag, but to its credit it has a long-lasting battery and lightweight, easy-to-forget-about, design, so you\u2019re not going to spend time idly fiddling with it or constantly putting it on charge. Being able to forget about a smartwatch when you\u2019re not using it is a big tick in its favor.",
    "This smartwatch, then, is perfect for those who want to keep an eye on their health and fitness, without needing nuanced and detailed breakdowns of their wellness. For that audience, it\u2019s pretty good, though it falls short of being great.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch costs \u00a3119 (around $165, AU$210). While we may see it come to Australia, Xiaomi doesn\u2019t release its products in the US.",
    "That price makes it twice as expensive as the Mi Watch Lite, its close sibling and contemporary, while it undercuts a close competitor, the Fitbit Versa 3, which costs \u00a3199 / $229 / AU$399.",
    "As with almost all smartwatches, the Xiaomi Mi Watch comprises a body and two detachable straps.",
    "The straps are long, made of thermoplastic polyurethane (which feels like a mix between rubber and plastic), and have plenty of holes for the strap, which also helps with breathability. There are two keepers to hold the excess strap in place, and overall the straps feel nice and secure.",
    "The watch face is circular, with two crowns: one is used to navigate to the app menu, and the other the workouts list. There aren\u2019t any embellishments \u2013 this is a pretty plain device. It\u2019s very lightweight, weighing in at just under 40g, and so it\u2019s very easy to ignore the watch when it\u2019s on your wrist.",
    "We found that dust built up a little bit between the lugs and the ends of the straps, but this was easy to clean off if we removed the straps.",
    "You can buy the Xiaomi Mi Watch in black, blue or beige, with both the body and the straps coming in the color of your choice.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch display is 1.39 inches across, and it\u2019s fairly bright, making it easy to see in direct sunlight. It uses AMOLED tech, so it\u2019s super-colorful, which is useful as it makes it easy to see info when you glance at it while working out.",
    "We were surprised by how fluid motion on the screen felt, for example when scrolling through menus or post-workout breakdowns, and Xiaomi hasn\u2019t revealed the display refresh rate we\u2019d guess it\u2019s higher than on most smartwatches. A responsive-feeling screen like this can be a joy to use, especially if you haven\u2019t experienced it before.",
    "There are just four watch faces to choose from on the device out of the box, but on the app you can find a huge selection of others to download. There\u2019s no option to use your own photo as the background, though, something a few other watches offer, and there\u2019s also no always-on display.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch runs on Xiaomi\u2019s own smartwatch operating system, which is apparently based on its smartphone OS, MIUI.",
    "From the main watch face, you can swipe left or right to see a heart rate graph, your energy level, your last night\u2019s sleep score, the current weather and air quality, your stress level, a button to check your blood oxygen level, music controls, and your activity stats for the day (steps, calories burned and active hours).",
    "Press the top crown and you get the app list; however, none of the icons have titles, so it\u2019s initially incredibly confusing to find the feature you\u2019re looking for. Stopwatch, timer and alarm all have clock icons, for example, so you\u2019ll have to get used to this app list.",
    "Once we got used to the Mi Watch\u2019s confusing menu, we found the interface a little more intuitive \u2013 you never have to swipe or tap through too many menus to get to whichever tool or feature you\u2019re looking for, and everything is sensibly laid out.",
    "There\u2019s notification handling here, so you can see messages from your phone from certain apps, although you can\u2019t respond from the watch. You also have to set up your phone just right from the app, by enabling the right permissions and settings, otherwise notifications won\u2019t get pulled through \u2013 we can see less-tech-savvy people having issues with this.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch uses the Xiaomi Wear app on your phone, mainly for setting up the device and permissions, but it also lets you access more in-depth fitness information than you can see on the watch. It\u2019s not exactly a comprehensive app, not compared to Fitbit or Huawei\u2019s alternatives, but it\u2019s fine.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch probably isn\u2019t one to buy if you think you might switch smartphones while using it, though, as switching devices is a rigmarole that\u2019s not worth enduring. To cut a long story short, you have to unpair the watch from the app, totally reset the smartwatch, then set the device up anew. You won\u2019t lose any data saved to the app, but it\u2019ll take time and effort.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Watch has 117 sports modes \u2013 that\u2019s more than Wear OS or Huawei LiteOS smartwatches, and it includes popular modes like running and cycling, as well as more niche ones like rock climbing, ballet and hula-hooping.",
    "That number might be inflated by the inclusion of multiple modes that are essentially the same, though. It\u2019s not clear how walking, trekking and hiking are different, for example \u2013 the metrics tracked for all three are identical, as are the resulting stats \u2013 yet they\u2019re available as different modes.",
    "We found traveling activities provided the most post-workout tracking \u2013 after a run, for example, you can see distance, time, calories burned, steps, cadence, pace, speed, heart rate, the effect of your training, recovery time, your energy consumed (based on the energy meter and your V02 max). Cadence, pace and heart rate are all shown on graphs too.",
    "You can get more information via the Xiaomi Wear app, such as a plot of your route on a map, as well as kilometer-by-kilometer breakdowns, and you\u2019ll need to make good use of the app to get the most out of the Xiaomi Mi Watch.",
    "We generally found the metrics tracked by the watch to be accurate, with the exception of distance, despite the fact the watch has built-in GPS. The distances were a little inconsistent \u2013 on our regular 8km run we regularly saw results that were up to 500m either side of that.",
    "The fact that this watch has built-in GPS is noteworthy though, as not all low-cost smartwatches have the feature. This means you can go on a trip without your smartphone, and still have location data tracked.",
    "If the fitness modes were okay, the health features were rather more suspect. There\u2019s \u2018energy\u2019, which tells you how much energy you have at any given moment based on your sleep and workouts; sleep tracking, which gives you a breakdown of your different types of sleep; and stress monitoring, which gives you a level of how stressed you are.",
    "We had issues with all three. The stress-tracking info seemed to bear no relation to how stressed we actually felt, and frequently over- or underestimated how stressed we were to a comical degree (and it quickly became a bit of a joke). Similarly, energy was based only on what the watch tracked, so if we woke up feeling drained or ate a sugary snack, the watch didn\u2019t know this, so the energy level wasn\u2019t affected. Therefore, it had little relation to how much energy we actually had.",
    "Sleep tracking seemed to conflate \u2018being still\u2019 with \u2018asleep\u2019 so if we read in bed before sleeping, or played on our phone immediately after waking up (bad, we know!) the watch still thought we were asleep. On one occasion, we took the watch off in the middle of the night and the watch thought we\u2019d woken up, throwing the energy level reading for the next day into disarray.",
    "Weirdly, there\u2019s some discrepancy between various health modes too, which suggests some of the modes aren\u2019t working in tandem very well. When we went for a long run, the fitness report afterwards told us we\u2019d been \u2018overreaching\u2019 and needed to recover for 96 hours, yet the energy tracker function called it a \u2018light workout\u2019. If 10 miles is light, we\u2019d hate to see what heavy is.",
    "Let\u2019s not forget the idleness reminder \u2013 a feature many smartwatches have \u2013 which is supposed to encourage you to get up and stretch your legs if you\u2019ve been sedentary for too long. The Mi Watch sometimes thought we were being lazy when we actually weren\u2019t wearing the watch, and on occasion it told us to get active when we already were.",
    "We\u2019ve seen energy, sleep and stress tracking done better on various wearables \u2013 Huawei and Fitbit devices most notably, so if you\u2019re interested in these features you could do better elsewhere.",
    "According to Xiaomi the Mi Watch has a 16-day battery life, although based on our testing we\u2019d mark that down to roughly 12-14 days \u2013 but that\u2019s still pretty great, given that your Apple Watches or Fitbit Watches will only go a day or two before you need to power them up.",
    "It\u2019s certainly plausible that you could make it to 16 days with light use, especially if you don\u2019t do much GPS fitness tracking, but two weeks is a more likely average if you do go on regular runs.",
    "Another inaccurate claim from Xiaomi is that the wearable takes two hours to power to full \u2013 but in this case its figure is actually an overestimate. We found the Mi Watch powered up from empty to full in a little over an hour, which is pretty good going for a two-week watch."
