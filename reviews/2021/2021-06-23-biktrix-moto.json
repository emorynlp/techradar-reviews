  "summary": "The Biktrix Moto e-bike eats up the miles in style",
  "verdict": "We\u2019re a little torn with the Biktrix Moto. We initially loved the unusual styling, but living with an e-bike like this proves to be challenging, especially seeing as in day-to-day use it\u2019s more of an electric scooter than a cycle. Pedalling any distance is largely pointless given the design style and riding position, so you\u2019re forced into using the power most of the time. It\u2019ll therefore give you an easy ride, but there\u2019s little in the way of exercise involved, save for when you have to manhandle the heavyweight bike into a storage location for example. It\u2019s fun, and funky, but if you enjoy real cycling the Biktrix Moto may disappoint. Though if you just want to get from A to B with little in the way of effort this e-bike will be a delight. Just go easy on all that power.",

    "The Biktrix Moto is less of an e-bike and more of an e-scooter, which is good news if you\u2019re looking for a two-wheeler that can do the bulk of the hard work, while you simply sit back, twist the thumb throttle and enjoy the ride.",
    "What\u2019s less clear is where it sits in the bike-buying landscape. The Biktrix Moto is categorized as a class two e-bike for the US market, which means it comes with an official limitation of 20mph, but by featuring a throttle control it can essentially bypass pedaling duties altogether.",
    "That\u2019s also good news because the design of the Biktkrix Moto makes it ill-suited to pedalling any real distances, especially without powered assistance. This is a very heavy bike and the wide, non-adjustable seat isn\u2019t conducive to regular-style cycling. However, given the rather muddy picture on how and where e-bikes like this can be ridden the Biktrix Moto could put buyers off with its current setup.",
    "It\u2019s not lacking appeal though, with a 750W Bafang hub motor, single-speed drivetrain and the capability of going around 100 miles on a charge from the optional dual 48V 21Ah battery combo.",
    "While the styling is urban funky, with frame colours that include Charcoal, Electric Blue, Lava Orange, Sandstone and White, the Biktrix Moto also packs fat tyres that allow you to hit trails and trickier terrain when needed.",
    "The Biktrix Moto is available now for $2,299 (about \u00a31,670 / AU$2,976) direct from Biktrix for the single battery edition, while the dual battery model adds $599 to the asking price and costs $2,898 (about \u00a32,103 / AU$3,751).",
    "Images of the Biktkrix Moto certainly capture the imagination, but it\u2019s not until the e-bike turns up on your doorstep that you realise how much of a mini monster this thing is. It arrives in a chunky box, which is extremely heavy and made more so if you\u2019ve opted for the dual battery package. Biktrix supplies everything needed, but you\u2019ll spend some time getting all of the add-on components put together.",
    "Buyers are pointed in the direction of online guides but, as with the previous Biktrix Juggernaut Classic e-bike we tested, these aren\u2019t particularly helpful. Attaching the enormous front headlight, for example, proved tricky and we\u2019re still not sure if it\u2019s been done correctly.",
    "Nevertheless, the quirky design is eye-catching and even more so if you pick one of the more vibrant frame colours. The design perches you up on top of the bike, with high-rise handlebars and that moped-style bench seat creating a slightly peculiar riding position.",
    "The wide seat also makes pedalling unappealing plus there\u2019s no adjustment on offer, so you\u2019ve got to be sure you pick the right frame size when you order. The smaller frame is aimed at 4\u2019 8\u201d to 5\u2019 5\u201d riders and boasts chunky 20-inch tyres while the larger variant suits 5\u2019 3\u201d to 6\u2019 2\u201d riders and comes with bigger 24-inch rubber. Thankfully there are fenders included because in the water that gets propelled off the knobbly tires would soak you otherwise.",
    "The Moto also has other practical design features, such as a chain guard and there\u2019s a 25kg max cargo rack on the back too, while those lights front and rear come as part of the package. The tail illumination also works as a brake light, with the stopping power coming from sizeable Tektro discs and levers that are much needed when you discover the power potential of this e-bike.",
    "Meanwhile, Biktrix does a decent job of producing bikes with colourful designs, but as we\u2019ve seen before, some elements can look a little like add-ons. The bulky battery pack, for example, sits on top of the frame rather than forming an aesthetically pleasing part of the overall design.",
    "Controls for unleashing the power are attached to the handlebars, with a thumb throttle on the right and power mode options on the left. A display in the centre gives you all of the corresponding information. However, these components also seem a little like accessories rather than delivering a look that\u2019s cohesive. The Biktrix Moto does work as a design, but it\u2019s lacking a little refinement shall we say. It\u2019s not exactly cheap either, so some future improvements to the design might be something Biktrix wants to consider.",
    "Getting on to the Biktrix Moto for the first time is a little different to sitting on a regular bike. The first thing you notice is the seat, which replaces a conventional saddle. For us it changes the whole way you ride the bike because you feel more like a passenger, which is emphasized even more by the way the pedals are more of a supplement, rather than being the main way you move the bike forward. You\u2019re basically left feeling like you\u2019re on a battery powered moped, which presumably is what Biktrix planned when it was designing the Moto.",
    "The other thing you notice as you take off down the road is those small wheels, which thankfully provide a decent bit of cushioning to the ride quality. The suspension built in to the front forks didn\u2019t seem to make much difference either. While the smaller wheels do soak up some of the bumps in the road, their limited diameter means there\u2019s a slightly different way of riding too, with the effect being more akin to riding something like a Brompton bike.",
    "Another noticeable aspect of the Biktrix Moto is its weight, so while it sits nicely planted on the road it\u2019s not the sort of e-bike that you want to have to move around much without powered assistance. With the power on and the mode selected from the handlebar-mounted computer display the bike can go from being stationary right up to about 20mph, just by using the thumb-operated throttle on the right side of the handlebars. It\u2019s very pokey too, so you have to be careful that you don\u2019t tweak it in the wrong location, where space might be tight.",
    "There\u2019s a tendency for the bike to feel like it\u2019s running away from you, which thankfully can be tamed by a quick squeeze of the brakes. Our test model had a European-style configuration, with the front brake assigned to the left lever and back brake to the right one. That\u2019s another thing you\u2019ve got to watch out for. There\u2019s no doubt the Biktrix Moto moves on down the road though, and that long seat lets you take someone on the back too, although there\u2019s nowhere for them to rest their feet.",
    "The more we used the Biktrix Moto the better it got, though it does seem to be afflicted with a slightly erratic delivery of its electric power. We had a similar experience when we tried the Biktrix Juggernaut Classic, which appears to use the same components. Considering the power of the battery and motor, we\u2019d like to see a slightly smoother and more dynamic injection of assistance as you control the throttle.",
    "Some might love the rather unpredictable excitement factor on offer, but considering this is a heavy e-bike a more efficient distribution of power might be wiser and safer. The Biktrix Moto is also great if you head off the beaten track, and although its weight and dinky wheels makes it a non-starter for any real off-road terrain the bike is quite nifty on dirt tracks.",
    "Overall though, while it goes well, the Biktrix Moto doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of a bona fide cycling experience and purists will probably feel it\u2019s a little bit of a Frankenstein creation. Lazy riders with a penchant for power will love it however.",
