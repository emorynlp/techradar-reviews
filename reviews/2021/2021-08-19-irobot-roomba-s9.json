  "summary": "Could the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus be the future of robot vacuums?",
  "verdict": "The Roomba S9+ sweeps away a host of bugbears that have plagued robot vacuums: emptying itself, capturing allergens, conquering corners and providing truly customisable vacuuming from an app on your phone. Its price tag might be steep but if you value spotlessly clean floors with minimal mess and effort on your part, the cost could be worth it.",
  "pros": [
    "Accurate room mapping system",
    "Easy to operate",
    "Efficient corner cleaning"

  "cons": [
    "Expensive",
    "Better on hard floors than carpet"

    "It\u2019s been almost 20 years since the original Roomba robot vacuum launched and now robot vacuums are ten-a-penny, and a staple in many households.",
    "iRobot\u2019s latest incarnation, the Roomba S9 Plus, might operate on similar principles, but thanks to a host of high-tech features, it\u2019s a very different beast from the first iteration, and one of the best robot vacuums we've tested to date.",
    "Most noticeably, it\u2019ll empty itself, meaning that rather than shaking out a dust box every few days, it\u2019ll whisk out the contents from the vacuum into a bag in the charging station. As the capacity of the bag is 14.9oz / 440ml, which equates to around 30 cleans, this turns a daily job into a monthly one \u2013 great for those who are time-poor or dislike emptying the dust box. There\u2019s also a filter for allergy sufferers that captures 99 percent of mould, pollen, and dust mite allergens.",
    "Another feature that sets the Roomba S9 Plus apart is an advanced mapping system. Rather than being gimmicky, this has a practical purpose, meaning that the vacuum knows where it\u2019s been, and where it still needs to clean, eliminating long running times that still end up with missed patches. It\u2019s known as vSLAM navigation technology, where the robot gathers over 230,400 data points each second \u2013 resulting in a better clean and more control over which areas are vacuumed and when. While the mapping can initially seem like a chore, once it\u2019s up and running, this provides cleaning flexibility and efficiency that budget models can\u2019t replicate.",
    "A final advantage is that the Roomba S9 Plus is compatible with the iRobot\u2019s Braava jet m6 robot mop. The two robots can \u2018talk\u2019 to each other, automatically vacuuming and then mopping without any additional commands, leaving hygienic floors behind \u2013 great for busy households, families, and properties with large areas to clean.",
    "In addition, the Roomba S9 Plus promises a powerful cleaning system alongside its advanced features, which include a 3D sensor, wider brushes, and a corner brush.",
    "There\u2019s no denying this is an expensive appliance but its cleaning ability, certainly on hard floors, means we think it really is worth it - making it ideal for those that want to outsource the vacuuming completely.",
    "The iRobot Roomba S9 Plus, which is called the Roomba S9 Plus Robot Vacuum in Australia, is priced at $1,099.99 / \u00a31,499.99 / AU$2,899. It\u2019s available to buy now worldwide from the iRobot's website as well as Amazon.",
    "It can be bundled with the Braava jet m6 Robot Mop for $1,349.99/ \u00a31,999.99/ U$3,698. In the US, it also comes in a bundle with the Braava jet m6 Robot Mop and iRobot H1 Handheld Vacuum for $1,474.98.",
    "Compared to similar models, the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus is pricey but in return, it promises the brand\u2019s deepest cleaning yet (up to 40 times the suction of previous generation Roomba vacuums), and a more accurate room mapping system so it won\u2019t waste time going over the same areas.",
    "Replacement dirt disposal bags cost $19.99 / \u00a321.95 / AU$59 for three.",
    "While the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus doesn\u2019t look dissimilar to previous Roomba models \u2013 its rose-gold lid hiding the bin being one of the more noticeable differences \u2013 it\u2019s host to many improvements. These include wider Dual Rubber Brushes (compared to the Roomba 600 series) and a brush with five angled arms to really get into corners and along walls. On top there are just three buttons \u2013 one to start and stop it cleaning, one for spot cleaning and one to send it home \u2013 all of which are useful if you don\u2019t have your device to hand.",
    "Compared to some, it\u2019s a fairly weighty machine to carry from room to room at 8.15lb / 3.7kg, but not too large. Its height of 3.5 inches / 9cm isn\u2019t too tall to tuck under most beds although it may be too tall to fit underneath some sofas. The Roomba S9+ is an average 12.25 inches / 31cm wide but it\u2019s the charging station you may struggle to find room for. At 19 inches / 48cm tall and 12.2 inches / 31cm wide it takes up a decent amount of space against a wall, especially when allowing for the suggested clearance of 1.5ft / 50cm either side on top.",
    "Set-up was fairly simple as it\u2019s all done via the app (see below) but it can be frustrating waiting for it to map your home as a non-negotiable first task. There\u2019s an extra filter and corner brush included in the box, plus a couple of dirt disposal bags. It might be a small thing but even the bags make sure you won\u2019t ever have to come into contact with the dust from your floors \u2013 each one seals up as it\u2019s removed from the charging station.",
    "The iRobot Roomba S9 Plus sucked up all the fine dust, biscuit crumbs, and oats we sprinkled on hard floors but it did leave some fine dust behind on our medium-pile carpet, both on the Quiet clean setting and the more powerful Detailed clean. That said, even our usual vacuum cleaner struggled to pick up the fine flour afterwards, suggesting that it was fairly embedded in the pile after being rolled over a few times.",
    "Overall, we were impressed by the cleaning efficiency of the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus \u2013 while it can still get caught on rugs, it reached the edges of rooms to whisk away dust and navigated furniture well. The Power Boost feature automatically increased the suction when it detected carpets, too.",
    "It is fairly noisy compared to other robot vacuums registering 61db on carpet and 64db on a hard floor on our decibel meter when using the Detailed Clean mode, which is equivalent to the sound of conversation in an office. While this level is acceptable, the automatic emptying averaged 77.5db - the same level of noise experienced when 25 ft away from a vehicle traveling at 65mph, so it might be best to keep the charging station out of a social area.",
    "Clean-up after vacuuming was effortless as the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus empties into the charging station, although the dust bag needs replacing after it\u2019s been emptied into around 30 times (making for a monthly or bi-monthly empty). It\u2019s actually the filter that needs more maintenance with a suggested weekly shake to clean (or twice a week if you have pets). It\u2019s located within the robot\u2019s dust box, so you will have to get a little messy to remove it, but it\u2019s worth doing to maintain the filter\u2019s anti-allergen properties.",
    "Connecting the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus to WiFi using the app was relatively straightforward although we had to move location a couple of times before it worked. The app itself isn\u2019t complicated \u2013 there\u2019s a history of previous cleans, the ability to save one as your favorite, details of the room map (with the ability to name each space and divide it as you see fit) plus a section for schedules. One thoughtful touch is that you can name your vacuum cleaner \u2013 handy if you have two on different floors.",
    "It took some time for us to work out how to change the suction level - an option that is stuck in the settings rather than being on the initial launch screen. Voice integration (available for Alexa and Google Home) is also not especially obvious \u2013 it\u2019s hidden within a section labeled Smart Home. However, once linked, you can ask for it to start vacuuming, clean a specific room, or return to its dock.",
    "One feature we did like is the ability to find your Roomba by tapping the app so the vacuum makes a noise. This came in handy when the robot vacuum became stuck under a bed.",
    "iRobot doesn\u2019t make claims about how long the Roomba S9 Plus\u2019s battery lasts between charges \u2013 perhaps this is because it\u2019ll happily return to its charging station if it\u2019s running low, and recharge just enough to finish the job.",
    "Our ground floor clean took just under an hour, and on the app, the battery level looked about half-full, although we\u2019d have preferred if the indicator showed a percentage rather than us having to guess how much charge was left. It took three hours to fully recharge the S9+.",
