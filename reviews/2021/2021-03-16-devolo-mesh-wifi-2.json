  "verdict": "It\u2019s expensive, and Devolo\u2019s app and documentation could be more helpful for beginners. However, the Mesh WiFi 2 includes both mesh Wi-Fi features and versatile powerline connectivity that can extend your network right through brick walls into the furthest corners of your home.",

    "Devolo specializes in powerline adaptors and Wi-Fi range extenders, but now, it's throwing its hat in the best mesh Wi-Fi router ring. Its new top-of-the-range Mesh WiFi 2 products go even further by combining powerline connectivity with far-reaching mesh Wi-Fi that can penetrate brick walls and cover your entire home.",
    "That versatility comes at a price though, and the Multiroom Kit that we review here includes three separate adaptors that cost a hefty \u00a3299.99 (around $420, AU$540).",
    "However, there\u2019s also a two-piece Starter Kit for smaller homes available for \u00a3199.99 (around $280, AU$360). Those prices put the Mesh WiFi 2 alongside many high-end mesh networking systems. But, to be fair, the Mesh WiFi 2 also provides powerline connectivity that will be a life-saver for homes or buildings that have thick walls or ceilings between floors that can block your Wi-Fi signal.",
    "The chunky Mesh WiFi 2 adaptors look virtually identical to other Devolo products, such as the Magic 2 WiFi, that we have reviewed in the past. They\u2019re designed to plug directly into a mains power socket so that their 2400Mbps powerline connectivity can send data to other rooms over your mains electrical wiring. And, like the Magic 2 WiFi adaptors, they also include a pass-through socket so that you can still use that power socket for other devices as well.",
    "Unfortunately, Devolo\u2019s documentation is often rather vague - to the point of being quite confusing at times. For instance, Devolo claims that the Mesh WiFi 2 provides \u2018tri-band\u2019 connectivity - which most people would assume to mean \u2018tri-band Wi-Fi\u2019. In fact, the Mesh WiFi 2 adaptors only provide dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi on the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands, with the powerline wired connection being counted as the \u2018third band\u2019.",
    "It\u2019s not the fastest Wi-Fi either, providing a relatively modest speed of 1200Mbps. Even so, that\u2019s still fast enough for most home broadband services, and each adaptor also includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports for devices such as a games console - or our iMac in our hard-to-reach back office - that might work better with a wired connection.",
    "Other features include \u2018bandsteering\u2019, which merges the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands into a single network, and automatically switches your devices to use the closest adaptor and the fastest frequency band as you move from room to room.",
    "However, you do have the option of separating the two bands and creating two separate networks. You can also create a schedule to turn off Wi-Fi access at certain times, and a guest network for visitors.",
    "We did have one or two problems getting started. As you\u2019d expect, you have to plug one of the adaptors into a mains power socket close to your router, and then use one of its Ethernet ports to connect it to the router in order to use the router\u2019s existing broadband connection.",
    "However, the Quickstart manual provided with the Mesh WiFi 2 kit tells you that all three adaptors need to be in the same room as the router during the initial set-up process. We didn\u2019t have three power sockets spare, so we had to hunt around the house to find a multi-socket power strip to plug all the adaptors into.",
    "Devolo\u2019s Home Network app for Android and iOS devices doesn\u2019t provide much help either. It seems to assume that you know what you\u2019re doing and just leaves you to get on with it, so we found ourselves randomly pressing buttons to try and get the three adaptors to talk to each other.",
    "Some features, such as the app\u2019s parental controls, also require some technical know-how, such as knowledge of MAC addresses to block access for individual devices. However, more experienced users will be pleased to find that there\u2019s another app, called Devolo Cockpit, for Windows, Mac and even Ubuntu, that provides advanced controls via a web browser interface.",
    "And, once the Mesh WiFi 2 kit was set up, we were pleased to see that it does perform very well. Devices in the same room as the first adaptor that was connected to our router were able to squeeze maximum speed out of our broadband connection, with both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands registering speeds of 110Mbps, and Steam downloads at 12.5MB/s.",
    "The Wi-Fi speeds held up well even in our back office - where we normally rely just on powerline for a wired connection - with both bands holding steady at 110Mbps.",
    "The 2.4GHz band did dip a little with our Steam test in that office, falling slightly to 9.5MB/s, but that\u2019s still far better than the speeds we normally get from our old router, and the 5GHz band didn\u2019t pause at all, breezing along at 12.5MB/s throughout.",
    "Devolo definitely needs to clarify its documentation and provide more help for beginners, and not all homes will require powerline connectivity either. But, for homes where thick walls and other obstacles can affect your Wi-Fi signal, the combination of powerline connectivity and wide-ranging mesh Wi-Fi could be the ideal solution."
