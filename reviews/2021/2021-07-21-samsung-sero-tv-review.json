    "It's hard to deny the uniqueness of the Samsung Sero TV \u2013 and if you\u2019re in its extremely niche target demographic, it might just be the perfect television. For anyone else, though, it\u2019s likely to be just a hassle.",
    "We got our first sneak peek of the Sero TV at IFA 2019, where it caught our attention with its rotating functionality and eye-catching design. The Sero is unlike any other new Samsung TV, and it\u2019s to Samsung\u2019s credit that they brought the concept to market at all.",
    "The Sero is aimed at heavy social media users, and this rotating TV is able to present both landscape and portrait content, meaning you can be watching a Netflix movie one minute and scrolling through Twitter or TikTok the next.",
    "At the press of a button it will turn 90 degrees, and only takes 2-3 seconds to do so. If you want a TV for social media, it\u2019s a bold \u2013 if imperfect \u2013 realization of that dream, and isn\u2019t like anything else on the market.",
    "60W speakers ensure you\u2019re not craning to hear voices or soundtracks, too, and all in all it\u2019s certainly an upgrade over the audio-visual output on a standard smartphone. You\u2019re also getting Samsung\u2019s excellent Tizen smart TV platform to boot.",
    "That said, using the Sero as a smartphone monitor has its problems. Social media apps aren\u2019t natively supported on Tizen, meaning you\u2019re having to switch your gaze between the TV and the phone you\u2019re casting from, and there\u2019s no way to use the TV remote to navigate your scrolling feeds and timelines.",
    "The Sero feels like a solution in search of a problem, and basically unnecessary whether you\u2019re big on social media (a flagship smartphone might be better), or not (in which case you don\u2019t need the Sero at all).",
    "Some issues rotating with AirPlay 2, too, means this is a set best suited to Android (particularly Samsung) smartphone owners, rather than anyone with an iPhone.",
    "The Samsung Sero retails for $1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$1,995, putting it in the same ballpark as the 55-inch Samsung The Frame TV, though the Sero only comes in a 43-inch size. It\u2019s currently on sale.",
    "The Samsung Sero is an eye-catching television, especially because you\u2019ll generally be using it in portrait. It looks like a massive mounted smartphone, which is suitable given it was designed for casting from smartphone apps.",
    "The screen comes with a rather hefty bezel, and is mounted on a skateboard-shaped kickstand, with a fabric-covered speaker sitting underneath the display. The whole kit is colored in a rather fetching navy / midnight blue, too. As a statement television, it could prove an eyesore or a revelation, depending on the decor around it, but it\u2019s a TV that\u2019s difficult to ignore when it\u2019s in the room.",
    "The set itself is around four feet tall, and it\u2019s quite heavy at 33.3kg, though it\u2019s better suited to placing on the floor rather than an elevated counter \u2013 given the speaker stand already places the screen around eye level height.",
    "Because of this, the ports can be hard to access, and we resorted to lying on the floor to reach around the back and plug in our HDMI cables. You\u2019ll find three HDMI 2.0 ports, two USB ports, and support for CI, terrestrial, and eARC (for connecting a soundbar). There\u2019s no ethernet port, oddly, meaning you\u2019re forced to connect over Wi-Fi \u2013 much like you would with a smartphone, we guess?",
    "You can throw in a set of wheels for just $49 / \u00a369 / AU$70 to make it easier to move around the room, which feels like a smart decision if you don\u2019t want it taking up floor space the entire time. Again, though, this means it isn\u2019t the best choice for tethering permanently to gaming consoles or AV receiver setups. There\u2019s no OneConnect box, either, and cabling can quickly get messy if the TV is placed on the floor.",
    "As ever with Samsung\u2019s fancier QLED screens, you\u2019ll get a pair of remotes: one standard button-full affair, and another slimmed-down version with a minimum number of inputs.",
    "Unlike other Samsung TV remotes, though, this one comes with a \u2018rotate\u2019 button on the upper-right, which promptly switches the TV between portrait and landscape \u2013 and is a good half-second faster than controlling it through the Samsung SmartThings app.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that the Sero defaults to portrait (vertical) whenever you turn it off. That\u2019s handy if you\u2019re mainly using it for Instagram, but it\u2019s a real pain when resuming regular television. Thankfully, you can amend this by heading to Settings > General > System Manager, which ensures it stays locked in landscape when powered down.",
    "The Samsung Sero TV uses the same Tizen smart TV platform as the best Samsung TVs, with a well-designed overlay to access and organize streaming apps and the like.",
    "The main difference is the inclusion of a Portrait Mode icon on the far left of the screen, though it generally makes more sense using the remote, for speed. You\u2019ll also get access to Ambient Mode, which has a host of screensavers and images for enhancing the vibe of your living room \u2013 naturally with vertical options \u2013 and it\u2019s ripe for putting up your latest selfie if you like, too.",
    "The icons on the home screen overlay are a lot harder to read in Portrait Mode, and we would have appreciated a zoomed-in view to adjust for this.",
    "In terms of apps, you\u2019ll get access to the likes of Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV Plus, Rakuten TV, YouTube, iPlayer, Britbox, All4, My 5, and more \u2013 you won\u2019t fall shot of apps to keep you busy. Not every app will auto-rotate the TV when selected, so while Netflix and Amazon can do this for you, Disney Plus leaves you to rotate it yourself.",
    "Scrolling down on the home screen shows you Samsung TV Plus, which feels less well curated, but does include plenty of free content, from Top Gear and Taskmaster to classic sitcoms like Red Dwarf, as well as kids TV and esports videos.",
    "You\u2019ll find built-in support for both Alexa and Bixby, with compatibility with Google Assistant speakers as well. Alexa will prove a more reliable AI servant than Samsung\u2019s in-house Bixby, but the latter will also suffice if you\u2019d rather stay out of the Amazon ecosystem.",
    "You are, however, forced to use the Samsung SmartThings app to make the most of the Sero\u2019s smart features, and there are a couple of irritating features. The Sero was optimized for Samsung phones in particular, and while you can cast painlessly from an Android mobile device, you can\u2019t cast to the TV in portrait mode over AirPlay 2 (only in landscape). iPhone owners can still use the TV as intended through the SmartThings app, but it\u2019s significantly more of a hassle to get going.",
    "Galaxy devices \u201crunning Android 8.1 or higher\u201d will also be able to make use of Tap View, to cast by tapping the phone against the TV \u2013 while turning a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 smartphone (and successive flagships) 90 degrees will rotate the TV automatically too.",
    "Considering the design-first focus of many designer Samsung TVs, the picture is surprisingly impressive here \u2013 even if it comes with a few caveats.",
    "Samsung is market-leading at upscaling from low-res video sources. That\u2019s especially apparent on its 8K screens, like the Q800T or Q950TS, but even on the 4K Sero you can see that HD content still looks crisp and detailed.",
    "Watching BlacKkKlansman on Netflix in HD/SDR, we were impressed by the color recreation, which looked rich and nuanced despite the lack of a wider dynamic range. The 70s era jackets and shirts, down to individual threads, came across as highly detailed, with a sense of texture and physicality beyond what we might have expected.",
    "There was an element of black crushing, with black and near-black tones being collapsed into uniformity, but keeping the Sero on a Standard picture setting, rather than the dimmer Movie preset, seemed to help. We do advise against Filmmaker Mode on the Sero, too, given how much it drops the brightness in order to avoid washing out the colors \u2018as intended\u2019 by content creators.",
    "As an edge-lit set, you\u2019re not getting market-leading brightness here, either. While the brightness is consistent, without the light banding that can plague cheaper 4K TVs, we did see evidence of backlight flickering, especially when the set was trying to illuminate bright light sources \u2013 when watching Halt and Catch Fire on Amazon Prime Video, we found fluorescent bulbs in office scenes would flicker incessantly, and sometimes this even extended to lighter icons simply when browsing the Prime Video library.",
    "This was especially apparent when turning off Intelligent Mode \u2013 which, among other things, auto-calibrates brightness depending on your room lighting conditions \u2013 and we recommend leaving it on for the best output on this particular set, given it largely keeps brightness at a high enough level that the flicker isn\u2019t noticeable.",
    "As a smartphone-minded television, the Sero needs to be able to cope with daytime levels of light outside of evening TV watching \u2013 and it largely does, as long as you\u2019re not using light-restrictive picture settings like Filmmaker Mode. You\u2019ll get the best viewing experience in a dim room, certainly, but some midday casting from your smartphone won\u2019t ruin the image you\u2019re trying to look at on a larger screen.",
    "But this is a 4K HDR screen, and you\u2019re getting most of the HDR formats desirable these days: HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG being among them. You don\u2019t get Dolby Vision, though \u2013 which, like HDR10+, offers scene-by-scene metadata to enhance the HDR output of select films and shows.",
    "The Sero features the Quantum Processor 4K found on most new Samsung TVs these days, and it\u2019s fully able to handle fast motion \u2013 something we saw in action with Netflix\u2019s The Old Guard. There was no screen judder around the film\u2019s slick fight choreography, and it\u2019s hard to find many visual flaws here at all. HDR isn\u2019t a revelation here, though, which we expect is due at least partially to the edge-lighting \u2013 and we didn\u2019t see a huge uptick in color intensity over SDR. The Sero does support HDR10+, thankfully, but as usual on Samsung TVs, Dolby Vision is nowhere to be found.",
    "It is worth noting that the screen isn\u2019t quite symmetrically-placed in landscape mode, meaning it hangs a little further on the right side, but only a centimeter or two. The 16:9 aspect ratio also means you\u2019re still watching most TV and movies in its intended format, though it does mean Portrait Mode tends to crop some of the smartphone screen you\u2019re casting from.",
    "We\u2019ve written about the capable speakers of the Sero before, and it\u2019s notable you\u2019re getting a full 60W output instead of the standard 10-20W found in most new 4K TVs.",
    "The Sero features a 4.1 channel output, rather than 5.1, but it\u2019s still a good sight better than we\u2019d have expected for this set. The \u20181\u2019 refers to the woofer at the rear of the speaker stand, with four tweeters coming out of the front. It\u2019s only halfway to a truly decent audio setup, but certainly a massive upgrade over your phone\u2019s tinny speakers.",
    "The optional \u2018amplify\u2019 sound mode will emphasize voices and dialogue, which could be useful both for your weekly soaps and ensuring clarity in all those TikTok videos, and works in tandem with Samsung\u2019s \u2018dialog enhancement\u2019 technology.",
    "It\u2019s also very simple to connect to the Samsung Sero over Bluetooth, and we naturally found ourselves using it as a Bluetooth speaker throughout the day. The soft synths and delicate vocals of Taylor Swift\u2019s album folklore are aptly carried, and there\u2019s a hefty amount of bass for audio that needs it.",
    "When watching Netflix\u2019s The Old Guard, too, the Sero is more than capable of separating the sounds of rattling military vehicles and chirping cicadas, with the excellent Frank Ocean-featuring soundtrack coming across with plenty of impact.",
    "There\u2019s no Dolby Atmos support here, though, so don\u2019t expect a full surround sound effect.",
    "Of course, the main angle of the Sero is social media \u2013 and the question of whether to buy it comes down to its ability to display smartphone apps well. For Twitter, TikTok, or Instagram, the Sero is pretty unique in being suited to scrolling mindlessly through your timeline, or watching longer IGTV videos without squinting down at your handset.",
    "It\u2019s certainly a great way to increase the size of smartphone content, and we can see its use in casting content for several people, without having to crowd around the phone. The capable picture and audio means that even jazzy TikTok dances will look their best here, too.",
    "The Sero does, however, have an input problem. When casting from your phone, you\u2019re having to swipe and select on your phone screen, which means you inevitably end up looking back and forth between them to navigate your chosen app. The remote isn\u2019t able to navigate for you, either.",
    "Most smartphones these days have a longer aspect ratio than 16:9, too, meaning that you won\u2019t be able to see quite as much of your timeline at once as on a standard iPhone, even if you do get to see most of it on a significantly larger screen \u2013 which, it\u2019s worth noting, will mean you take longer to take in a single tweet or photo, making \u2018doomscrolling\u2019 through your timeline possibly even more arduous an activity.",
    "This input issue extends to mobile games, too. Our best gaming experience on the Sero was actually casting Monument Valley from our mobile. The Sero\u2019s high-contrast screen gave me a new appreciation for the vivid visuals of the 3D puzzle game Monument Valley, but controlling the game was far more difficult when technically having to use two screens."
