  "summary": "It's light, but not especially 'super'",
  "verdict": "It's a pretty mouse to look at, but the Trust GXT 960 Graphin can\u2019t win us over on looks alone. While it\u2019s incredibly light, the thick cable and disappointing functionality mean it\u2019s not a great choice for the types of games it\u2019s been designed for.",
  "pros": [
    "Modern Honeycomb design",
    "Very lightweight",
    "RGB lighting is always a nice touch"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "The mouse cord is unwieldy",
    "Very little functionality",
    "Fragile build"

    "We're a sucker for anything that lights up \u2013 if you can shove RGBs into it and smother it with programmable effects then you\u2019ve got our attention. Sadly, when testing the Trust GXT 960 Graphin gaming mouse we were reminded that fancy lighting isn\u2019t actually everything. The Trust GXT 960 Graphin is available in the UK priced at \u00a329.99. It would appear that currently, you can only purchase the GXT 960 Graphin in the UK and Europe, and Trust hasn\u2019t confirmed whether it will go on sale in the US or Australia, but that UK price works out to around $40 or AU$55.",
    "The mouse itself is fairly small, likely due to Trust looking to keep the weight down, but this does mean it's not particularly suitable for larger hands. Size aside, the only two side buttons on the GXT 960 Graphin feel oddly placed, and reaching them requires some less-than-intuitive hand placement \u2013 and you have to bear in mind that super-lightweight mice such as this one are designed with quick reactions in mind. Their placement also means the GXT 960 Graphin is only suitable for right-handed users, so lefties will need to look elsewhere.",
    "This wasn\u2019t the only poor design choice made by Trust, with the main mouse buttons being too flimsy and close together. This resulted in frequent miss-clicks and grinding that made playing games like Apex Legends or Valorant a complete nightmare. With players of first-person-shooter titles being the common genre targeted by lightweight gaming mice, it\u2019s a little frustrating that this product would actually serve as more of a hindrance than any help.",
    "In fact, \u2018frustrating\u2019 is likely the best description we have for the Trust GXT 960 Graphin. If you\u2019re desperate for something with pretty rainbow lights and an attractive design then it\u2019ll sit very nicely on your desk, but it struggles at the basics of moving well and clicking. There are other incredible gaming mice on the market worth buying on a tight budget, but if you have a little extra cash to burn then investing in something like the Razer Viper will save you a lot of stress",
    "The Trust GXT 960 Graphin certainly ticks our box for having nice lighting effects, and the honeycomb design, being a fairly recent trend, gives it a modern look. Other gaming mice notable for having this hexagonal design are the SteelSeries Aerox 3 and the Cooler Master MM710 (if you\u2019re enticed by the styling, but not the results of our review). The overall aesthetic is rather lovely, and the RGBs can be programmed in the downloadable software, which you also use to assign hotkeys. It looked right at home amongst our dragon\u2019s hoard of black RGB gaming peripherals and accessories. True to the description on the box, the GXT 960 Graphin is extremely light, weighing in at just 74g / 2.6oz so it's unlikely you\u2019ll be giving yourself hand strain from long hours in a fast-paced game. It has the maxiumum 10,000 DPI expected of most gaming mice too, so you won\u2019t need to fling your arm across your desk in order to make trick shots. The Trust management software doesn\u2019t have many bells and whistles, but that's a refreshing change to the sometimes complicated programs used by other brands. You can change the light sequence, allocate gaming profiles and adjust the DPI sequence with very little fuss. There\u2019s only one DPI button on the mouse itself, so creating your own sequence to scroll through will help those who change it up during game matches.",
    "Unfortunately, the effort that Trust has put into making the GXT 960 Graphin super-light is undermined by design decisions elsewhere. While the mouse itself is a dainty little thing, the corded cable is extremely unwieldy, and it\u2019s not much use having a lightweight mouse if you're having to expend serious energy coaxing the cable into the required direction. Not only is it heavy, it\u2019s incredibly stiff, and no amount of time spent \u2018massaging\u2019 the cord helped to improve its softness or flexibility.",
    "There have also been a few design sacrifices made in the name of keeping the weight down. The plastic shell of the GXT 960 Graphin is necessarily very thin, but the overall feeling is just\u2026 flimsy. When you flip the mouse over, the near-opaque plastic shell housing the guts of the mouse and the lighting hasn\u2019t been extended, leaving an exposed view into the housing. Again, this is likely due to the need to eliminate unnecessary weight, but the resulting look isn\u2019t pleasant.",
    "The functionality of the GXT 960 Graphin also suffers as a result of these compromises, with the main buttons feeling brittle and sometimes grinding against each other due to having no spacing between them. As mentioned, there are only two side buttons that you can program with your required hotkeys, and these remained stiff even after we\u2019d been using the mouse for a few days. The Teflon pads on the underside do make for a smooth action when you\u2019re dragging the mouse across both fabric and hard mousepads though, and the scroll wheel on the mouse has a rubber grip, and offers good resistance for precision zooming or page scrolling.",
    "When we used the GXT 960 Graphin for gaming, the resistance from the cord coupled with the uncomfortable buttons made for a very disappointing experience. We weren't always focused on what we were playing, as we were often wrestling with the buttons and cursing under our breath.",
    "We also found that we could barely hit the buttons with our fingers, let alone use them effectively. We\u2019ll admit to feeling a sense of relief when we put the GXT 960 Graphin back in its box and could go back to just enjoying games with the distractions.",
    "If you\u2019re happy to \u2018wear in\u2019 the monstrous cable and aren\u2019t bothered by products that feel plasticky then you may find the Trust GXT 960 Graphin to be a suitable gaming mouse; otherwise, save up a few extra pennies and look elsewhere."
