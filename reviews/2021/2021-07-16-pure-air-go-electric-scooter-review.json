  "verdict": "The Pure Air Go is a solid entry-level electric scooter. It\u2019s sturdy and doesn\u2019t cost too much, but some might find its weak motor and limited range too big an encumbrance. If you can splash out on the non-Go variant, we\u2019d recommend it as it greatly improves the features, but this is still a worthy vehicle that\u2019ll treat you well.",

    "Pure Electric put out the best entry-level electric scooter in 2020 with its Pure Air (2020), a fantastic vehicle with a low price, solid build and sleek design. The company\u2019s 2021 range of electric scooters has an upgraded Air model, but also the Pure Air Go, a new vehicle that\u2019s even more expressly designed for first-time buyers.",
    "The Pure Air Go is the cheapest electric scooter Pure Electric has released, out of the two 2020 and three 2021 models (the Go is joined by the mid-range Air and the top-end Air Pro (2021)). It\u2019s designed for people who aren\u2019t sure if such a new form of vehicle is really for them, and who want a low-power low-cost option.",
    "As such, this isn\u2019t a powerful electric scooter. It has a 350W motor, like the 2020 models but unlike its 500W-motor-toting 2021 siblings. The battery isn\u2019t huge, with a 20km maximum range, and it misses out on some premium features like a USB charging port or easily openable folding latch.",
    "That\u2019s not to say this is a severe downgrade from other electric scooters. The maximum speed is 25kmph \u2013 that\u2019s the scooter speed limit in the UK, where Pure Electric is based \u2013 and lots of the trappings of other Pure scooters, like sturdy waterproofing and loads of lights and reflectors to keep you safe.",
    "In fact, if you\u2019ve never driven an electric scooter before, or have only tested them briefly in ride-hiring schemes but want your own, we can hesitantly recommend the Pure Air Go.",
    "That hesitation is because of the range, which is one of the lowest we\u2019ve seen on an electric scooter. That short distance makes sense if you want your first scooter for short trips now and then, but if you want the Go for a commuter device, it might not be enough.",
    "You see, a 20km range can only be reached if you\u2019re driving in the scooter\u2019s lowest-speed mode, at about 15kmph, but if you bump up to the higher-speed settings you\u2019re going to travel as far. We regularly managed to ride for about 7km before running out of charge.",
    "The scooter also struggled on steeper hills in our testing thanks to the weaker motor, though of course, not everyone needs a scooter that can power up inclines. We\u2019re just highlighting it for the people who don\u2019t live in flat areas.",
    "Our biggest reason against buying the Pure Air Go would be if the Pure Air looks more appealing to you. It has a better range, more powerful motor and a price which isn\u2019t that much higher. Check your budget, and the kind of environment and distance you\u2019d be riding the scooter, to decide which is better for you.",
    "The Pure Air Go can be bought from the Pure Electric website here, as well as from the company\u2019s various physical shops around the UK. If you live near one, we\u2019d recommend heading into a shop, so you can see the scooter first-hand and speak to a professional about your needs.",
    "The scooter costs \u00a3349 (about $480 / AU$650), so it\u2019s the cheapest of its range, including its predecessors. Those 2020 models aren\u2019t on sale now, but the chart below will show you how all five Pure scooters stack up against each other (and their prices).",
    "The Pure Air Go doesn\u2019t exactly shake up the electric scooter design formula very much \u2013 something we imagine most first-time buyers will be glad of. In fact, the design is almost exactly identical to the Pure Air (2021) with a few tweaks here and there.",
    "The foam-grip handlebars at the top have a bell on the left side, an accelerator button on the right, and a central-mounted display that tells you your speed, battery level and light status. There\u2019s a rubber button here that you can use to toggle the lights or change your speed mode.",
    "Looking down the 119cm-high stem \u2013 which comes in black or gray \u2013 you'll see a latch that you can use to fold up the scooter. Unlike in the Pro models, this isn't a clamp, so you have to unscrew and unfasten the latch when you want to fold, or unfold, the scooter. This is a little more time-consuming than the Pro\u2019s easy catch, but it still only takes a minute or so out of your day.",
    "The scooter\u2019s deck has dimensions of 116 x 50cm, similar to most other scooters, and it\u2019s easy to get a good balance on. There\u2019s good grip too, thanks to the texture underfoot.",
    "Underneath the deck is a stand that you can kick out to keep the scooter standing unassisted; we found this easy enough to use and to support the scooter. There's also the charging port.",
    "Like Pure\u2019s other scooters, the Air Go is rated IP65, which means good resistance against water and dust. We frequently rode the vehicle in rain and through puddles, without it giving up on us. The innards are also easily replaceable too in case something does break, though if you\u2019re considering buying an entry-level scooter we\u2019d definitely recommend getting a professional to fix things if they go wrong.",
    "If you\u2019re worried about your visibility when riding, you\u2019ll be glad to know that the Pure Air Go is well lit. There\u2019s a front and back light, on the handlebars and rear wheel respectively, and the front wheel also has reflectors.",
    "The wheels have a diameter of 10 inches, which is fairly big for a scooter, and are filled with air and puncture prevention fluid. We drove over some tough terrain and obstacles and the tires weren\u2019t damaged, much to our surprise.",
    "Using the aforementioned latch, you can fold down the Pure Air Go and carry it around. The scooter weighs 16kg, so it\u2019s not exactly as light as air, but it\u2019s not as hefty as some of Pure\u2019s other vehicles either.",
    "A ring near the handlebars, and a hook on the rear wheel\u2019s mudguard, connect together to keep the scooter folded, and they felt solid when in place, so we weren\u2019t scared of them breaking when we were carrying the vehicle around.",
    "There\u2019s no way of bolting up the Pure Air Go, with no convenient place on the scooter to put a bike lock or similar, and while you can use the app to secure the scooter, it can\u2019t do much to stop someone picking the thing up and walking away with it. So it\u2019s best to store the Go indoors if possible.",
    "The Pure Air Pro is designed as an entry-level feature-light scooter, so the main issue we came across during our testing was the vehicle\u2019s limited battery life, or range.",
    "The quoted range is 20km, but you\u2019ll only get that if you\u2019re riding in the slowest speed mode at 15kmph. Bump that up to the middle 20kmph mode, or the fastest 25kmph (which, let\u2019s face it, you probably will be using, since even that\u2019s a little slow for some roads), and the range will drop significantly.",
    "Our normal commute is just over 7km. If we were lucky, we\u2019d just about have two battery bars left on the display \u2013 usually it was just one bar left, and on multiple occasions, the battery icon was totally depleted, and flashing to tell us to hurry up. Through many weeks of testing, we never once totally ran out before reaching our destination though.",
    "This did necessitate lots of charging though. Pure quotes a 3.5-hour powering time to get the vehicle from empty to full, which we\u2019d concur with, and that\u2019s pretty quick compared to some other electric scooters.",
    "Riding on the Pure Air Go felt safe, and the scooter was sturdy on roads and reliable in terms of controls. That\u2019s the case with all Pure scooters.",
    "There are three riding modes, with each one increasing the speed but also the battery drain. The lowest takes you at 15kmph, the medium one maxes out at 20kmph, and the final one lets you travel at the scooter\u2019s max speed of 25kmph.",
    "Acceleration on the Pure Air Go is a little slow, at least compared to other electric scooters on the market, but as an entry-level vehicle that\u2019s actually a good thing - it helps you keep in control as you increase your speed. You don\u2019t have to kick off too much to get the scooter moving, either.",
    "As with all Pure scooters, riding the Air Go feels like a safe experience - there\u2019s solid suspension, the construction is robust so nothing shakes when you\u2019re riding, and the brakes are responsive so you can stop in a pinch.",
    "On steeper hills, the Pure Air Go\u2019s speed did drop off quite a bit. That\u2019s because of its 350W motor, which doesn\u2019t handle inclines like the 500W motor of the scooter\u2019s siblings.",
    "One thing that some riders may find troubling \u2013 which is again a trait of Pure scooters \u2013 is that the central display button can\u2019t be reached unless you remove your hand from the handlebars, so if you want to change your speed, or toggle the lights, it\u2019s much safer to do so when stopped.",
    "In addition \u2013 and this is a problem with most electric scooters, but something we should highlight since this product is for people who aren\u2019t familiar with the vehicle \u2013 is that there\u2019s only one accelerator and brake. If you want to indicate to turn by holding out your hand, you can\u2019t also brake to reduce your speed or accelerate to increase it, depending on which way you\u2019re turning. This can make turning a little tricky at times.",
    "The alternatives, though, are to add multiple brakes and accelerators, which would increase the price of the scooter, or introduce cruise control, which is a feature only top-end scooters have, and it's rife with its own dangers. As it stands, it\u2019s not a deal-breaker for the Go by any means, but you have to learn the knack to turning.",
    "The Pure Electric app on your iOS or Android smartphone can connect via Bluetooth to the Pure Air Go, giving you a little extra functionality. The app is far from mandatory for riding the scooter, which is definitely a good thing in our books since apps can sometimes be temperamental.",
    "You can see the current charge and range of the vehicle in the Pure app. This is quite a rough guess, since your speed dictates the range so much \u2013 as well as the current speed of the scooter, which only applies if you\u2019re moving.",
    "You can also toggle the scooter\u2019s headlights on the app, or lock the vehicle so people can\u2019t ride off on it. We wouldn\u2019t rely on this as a way to secure it though, since simply picking it up and ignoring the alarm can bypass this lock.",
    "Annoyingly, you can\u2019t use lots of these functions unless the Pure Air Go is turned on and is near the phone, so you can\u2019t check the charge from afar \u2013 and since the scooter itself can tell you charge and speed, and toggle the lights, we didn\u2019t find the app too useful most of the time.",
