  "verdict": "There\u2019s only so much you can get out of a SATA SSD, and the T-Force Delta Max actually delivers it with RGB lighting as the cherry on top. But, aesthetics aside, it\u2019s value falls flat next to even modest PCIe NVMe drives.",

    "The Team T-Force Delta Max is a SATA SSD joins the expansive ranks of fellow SATA SSDs with an RGB twist. At a price of $120 (about \u00a390, AU$155) for a 1TB drive, it\u2019s not making a name for itself in terms of value, but it\u2019s certainly not the most expensive drive out there. It even manages to land near the $129 Samsung 870 QVO.",
    "What Team T-Force is offering with the Delta Max at this price is what helps it stand out. For one, the Delta Max is an SSD with TLC NAND rather than the QLC found in many budget drives. This TLC NAND tends to offer better endurance than competing QLC-based storage. That said, the 1TB T-Force Delta Max is offering an endurance rating of 360TBW (terabytes written), which isn\u2019t higher than the QLC-based Samsung 870 QVO, though it is higher than the Intel 660p PCIe SSD.",
    "The T-Force Delta Max also has RGB, which usually comes with a premium, so it's a pleasure to see it remain reasonably priced compared to similar SATA SSDs. The RGB layer on the top of the Delta Max adds a little thickness, but it essentially adds a cluster of LEDs that create a glowing rectangle. The RGBs take power either from a USB cable or a 5V 3-pin aRGB header, both of which can connect to the drive\u2019s micro USB port. The drive will display a color swirl by default, but connecting to an aRGB header allows for syncing with a wide variety of motherboard RGB software. Even with the lighting off, the drive has a rather pleasing mirror finish.",
    "The RGB lights are part of this drive\u2019s gamer aesthetic but it\u2019s nice to see that performance doesn\u2019t take a back seat to style. Recent SATA drives push the limits of what the interface can even allow, and with sequential read speeds of 563MB/s, the Team T-Force Delta Max edges out the Samsung 860 Pro. Write speeds are a little slower, but the Delta Max makes up for that with random read and write speeds (the drive\u2019s real worth in regular workloads) that beat the 860 Pro by close to 20MB/s and the 860 Evo by more than 100MB/s.",
    "The problem is that we\u2019re not all limited to SATA drives. PCIe drives have come down in price considerably, enough to compete with SATA drives, and they almost unerringly offer higher speeds across the board. The Corsair MP400 is one of the stronger value PCIe SSDs, even tying the Delta Max for cost-per-gigabyte, and decimates Team\u2019s offering in speed tests. It\u2019s easily over four times as fast and more often closer to six times as fast. Never mind that PCIe 4.0 SSDs are also coming down in price with still higher speeds.",
    "Most of us probably have more SATA ports available inside our computers than we do PCIe NVMe slots, so there\u2019s still good enough reason to pick up a SATA drive. We wouldn\u2019t recommend the Delta Max over the Corsair MP400 or SK Hynix Gold P31 if you have the choice between PCIe and SATA SSDs. But, if you\u2019re looking specifically for SATA, the Delta Max offers strong performance at a fair enough price and does it in style.",
    "You\u2019re all about that RGB Sometimes having RGB alone is enough reason to buy one gadget over another. When building a computer with aesthetics in mind, having choice over lighting can be key, and the T-Force Delta Max can sync up with your computer\u2019s lighting scheme using an ARGB header."
