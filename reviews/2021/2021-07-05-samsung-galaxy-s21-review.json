  "summary": "Not the best of the best, but Samsung's S21 is fantastically put together",
  "verdict": "The Galaxy S21 isn\u2019t the star of Samsung\u2019s S series in 2021, like we\u2019ve been used to for most of the past decade, but it\u2019s a solid smartphone choice with an impressive camera, powerful internals and great battery life. If you want the best of the best, look to the Galaxy S21 Ultra; but if you want a handset that\u2019s cheaper than the Galaxy S20 was at launch, with a whole load of premium features, the Galaxy S21 is a delight to use, and will do you proud.",
  "pros": [
    "Fantastic, versatile camera",
    "Cheaper than the Galaxy S20",
    "Powerful and capable phone"

  "cons": [
    "No microSD support",
    "Screen isn\u2019t the best",
    "No charger in the box"

    "The Samsung Galaxy S21 is an odd handset on paper, but having spent a week using it we\u2019ve found it to be a highly capable phone that's a pleasure to use, despite a couple of specs being dropped from previous handsets, notably the Galaxy S20 from 2020.",
    "Why does the Samsung Galaxy S21 have lesser specs than the Galaxy S20? Two reasons. The first is that Samsung wanted to drop the price of its handset \u2013 the S21 launched with a starting price of $799 / \u00a3769 / AU$1,249 compared to the Galaxy S20 5G\u2019s $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,499.",
    "The second is that the company is also putting a bigger focus on its Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra \u2013 and unlike the Galaxy S20 Ultra in 2020, it\u2019s a handset we\u2019d readily recommend to those who are desperate to try the company\u2019s latest innovations, and happy to pay for them.",
    "That makes the S21 a significantly less exciting Galaxy S phone than we\u2019re used to seeing, but make no mistake: the Galaxy S21 is still a fantastic handset choice, albeit with a few tweaked specs compared to the Galaxy S20 \u2013 and that price drop is likely to attract a lot more people to the S series.",
    "If you want a larger screen but similar specs, there's also the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. That is a remarkably similar phone to this, and the big differences are the phone's size, its battery capacity and that it has a slightly more premium glass back.",
    "Back to the S21, and the chipset is powerful, the camera software has improved over recent models, and the battery life is strong, giving you a solid day of use from a full charge, alongside effective fast-charging and wireless charging options.",
    "Samsung has opted for a lower-spec screen than the one on the S20, with a Full HD+ 6.2-inch display, but it offers a 120Hz refresh rate for super-smooth scrolling and graphics, plus fantastic colors, and strong brightness levels \u2013 and we didn\u2019t notice the lower resolution in most of our testing.",
    "The chipset \u2013 we\u2019ve tested the Exynos 2100 version of the phone \u2013 is also powerful, delivering some fantastic results in real-world use as well as in benchmarking software.",
    "If you already own a Samsung Galaxy S20, or if you can find that handset for a significant discount, you won\u2019t want to opt for the Galaxy S21 \u2013 while the new phone gains in some areas it loses in others, and overall there\u2019s not much between the two phones \u2013 certainly not enough to justify paying a couple of hundred dollars or pounds more.",
    "Rumours are already swirling about the Samsung Galaxy S22 as well, although there\u2019s no confirmation of a release date just yet.",
    "Conversely, if you\u2019re after the top-end tech that Samsung is selling this year then you\u2019ll want to check out the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. But if you\u2019re after a (much) cheaper alternative to that phone, that shares a lot of the same design language and features, and which works fantastically well for everyday tasks, the Galaxy S21 is just that.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S21 will likely be reduced in the Black Friday deals so it\u2019s worth looking at the best phone Black Friday deals out there. We\u2019ll be conducting a re-review in the future. However, we\u2019ve updated references within our review to highlight new features that have emerged since our tests to give you a better idea of what you might be buying.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S21 release date was Friday, January 29, 2021 for most of the world, including the US, UK and Australia. That means you can readily buy the smartphone now from a variety of retailers, carriers and networks in all three of those countries.",
    "The Samsung S21 was officially unveiled on January 14, 2021 which was the earliest in a year we've seen the company introduce its new smartphone technology.",
    "Its price is remarkably lower than that of the S20 at launch, with Samsung trimming a few specs, including reducing the maximum display resolution and dropping microSD support, in order to make this possible.",
    "The Galaxy S21 price starts at $799 / \u00a3649 / AU$1,249 for a version with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. There\u2019s also a 256GB and 8GB RAM variant, and that costs $849 / \u00a3819 / AU$1,349.",
    "However, while those were the launch prices, some stores now sell the Samsung Galaxy S21 for less.",
    "The Galaxy S20 5G price started at $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,499, so the new phone was quite a bit cheaper at launch, even without price drops. If you want the very top-end specs, you\u2019ll be looking for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which sports perks like a QHD+ display and expandable storage, but which comes with a much higher price tag.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that all of Samsung\u2019s S21 phones are 5G-compatible in 2021, so you won\u2019t be able to buy a 4G-only variant. Instead, Samsung had made its 5G-compatible smartphones more competitively priced, so you\u2019ll be getting a future-proofed option even if you don\u2019t intend to use next-gen connectivity in the near future.",
    "Looking for a slightly higher spec Samsung Galaxy S21 handset? The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus starts at $999 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,549 with the Galaxy S21 Ultra taking the honor of the series' most expensive phone at $1,199 / \u00a31,149 / AU$1,849.",
    "Those again are launch prices though - shop around and you're likely to find any of these phones for less than that (though still expect to pay more than for the standard Galaxy S21).",
    "The design is where Samsung has made the most obviously noticeable changes over the S20 (which we crowned 2020\u2019s best smartphone), overhauling the materials used, the colors, and the overall look of the device.",
    "There\u2019s a 6.2-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display on this handset, which we\u2019ll dive into more in the display section below. This phone is the smallest member of the Galaxy S21 family, and while it may not be as trim as the iPhone 12 mini, those with smaller hands shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble using it.",
    "If you want a larger phone, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus comes with a larger screen and the Galaxy S21 Ultra has the largest screen of the whole series. Both of these handsets are more expensive though.",
    "Samsung has switched from a full glass rear on the Galaxy S20 \u2013 a design that wasn\u2019t too exciting in the flesh \u2013 to a \u2018Glasstic\u2019 rear that comes with a matte finish and incorporates a new camera block design.",
    "Glasstic is the company\u2019s own name for the material, which as the name suggests is somewhere between plastic and glass. It doesn\u2019t feel as premium as a glass rear, but the matte finish also means it doesn\u2019t feel like cheap plastic either.",
    "Samsung used the same material on the Galaxy Note 20, but the matte finish feels more suitable here and it\u2019s much less shiny than the glass rear on the Galaxy S20, which means it\u2019s less of a fingerprint magnet. The metal edges around the outside of the device add a touch of premium polish.",
    "You\u2019ve got four color choices at launch: Phantom Gray, Phantom White, Phantom Pink, and Phantom Violet (the shade you see pictured throughout this review) \u2013 we think Violet is the standout color here.",
    "The company has made the camera array on the S21 phones look different to any other on the market .Samsung is calling this its Contour Cut Camera, and it\u2019s a divisive design to say the least \u2013 although we think it looks bold, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve grown used to during our time testing the phone. The gold camera array on the Phantom Violet variant is particularly good-looking, and it feels slimmer than on the Galaxy S20, so it doesn\u2019t jutt out from the rear of the phone so much.",
    "There\u2019s very little to break up the sleek edges of the phone: the bottom edge features the SIM tray, a USB-C port and a speaker grille, while on the right side are the power button and volume rocker; however, the Bixby button found on other handsets from the company hasn\u2019t made a return here. Instead you can launch Samsung\u2019s assistant by long pressing the power button.",
    "One negative for some is the switch to a completely flat screen on the Galaxy S21. Samsung has used screens that curve attractively into the body at the left and right edges for a number of generations now, but this has been dropped for the Galaxy S21.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely to be something you\u2019ll notice unless you\u2019re used to those curved edges, but it\u2019s worth noting if you\u2019re someone who particularly likes that design feature \u2013 and as is the case with other dropped features, Samsung has retained the curved-edge screen for the premium S21 Ultra.",
    "All in all, the Samsung Galaxy S21 feels like a premium device, although it\u2019s unlikely to feel as top-end as the Samsung Galaxy S20 if you own that handset, or the Galaxy S21 Ultra.",
    "The downgrade to the display is perhaps the most controversial change Samsung has made for the Galaxy S21, with the company switching to a lower-res Full HD+ screen than the Quad HD display available on 2020\u2019s Galaxy S20.",
    "As mentioned, Samsung has done this to help keep the price of the new phone down, and unless you\u2019ve used a phone with a QHD resolution we don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be able to easily tell the difference \u2013 we found that all the videos we watched on the S21 looked suitably high-quality on the Full HD+ panel.",
    "If you already own a Samsung Galaxy S20, though you likely won\u2019t be impressed by this decision, and if you\u2019re looking for the very best Samsung screen tech then you\u2019ll want to opt for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which keeps the QHD screen.",
    "Has Samsung made the right decision here? Largely, we think, yes. It won\u2019t be popular with everyone, but crucially it\u2019s allowed Samsung to cut the price of its Galaxy S21 series, and it won\u2019t be hugely detrimental to most people\u2019s everyday experience with the phone.",
    "The Galaxy S21 display features a 120Hz maximum refresh rate, which is on by default and works in an adaptive capacity \u2013 so if you\u2019re playing a mobile game, for example, the screen will stick with 120Hz, while if you\u2019re reading an audiobook it\u2019ll reduce the refresh rate in order to save battery.",
    "Samsung has also made significant improvements to the fingerprint scanner on the S21 phones over previous handsets. The sensor itself is 70% larger, so it\u2019s easier to hit, and it\u2019s notably faster too; it isn\u2019t as quick as the physical fingerprint scanners you\u2019ll find on other phones, but this is one of the best in-screen scanners we\u2019ve used.",
    "The Galaxy S21 camera hardware hasn\u2019t changed from last year\u2019s phone, as Samsung\u2019s big sensor upgrade happened between the Galaxy S10 and S20 generation. This year it\u2019s all about the software, and Samsung finding a way to slim down the camera module.",
    "It\u2019s the same triple-lens rear array then: 12MP main camera, 12MP ultra-wide, and 64MP telephoto capable of a 3x hybrid optical zoom. As on the Galaxy S20, all three of these are capable of taking some excellent photos, and the Galaxy S21 gets some software upgrades to improve things further.",
    "If you\u2019ve got a Galaxy S20 you\u2019re unlikely to see any major improvement to your photography, but those coming from the Galaxy S10 and before will see big improvements.",
    "Single Take \u2013 Samsung\u2019s camera mode that enables you to capture a variety of photos and videos, using all three cameras, with a single press of the shutter button \u2013 is better than ever thanks to the addition of a new slow-mo option, and it remains one of the highlights of Samsung phones.",
    "For example, if you\u2019re taking photos of unpredictable pets or fast-moving children you\u2019re likely to find that Single Take maximizes your chances of getting some usable shots and/or clips.",
    "The telephoto camera here is impressive too, offering 3x hybrid zoom and up to 30x digital zoom. The results aren\u2019t going to compare to what you\u2019ll get from the two telephoto cameras on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but this is still a fun feature to play around with.",
    "We found photos of far away objects taken at 10x and below were of decent quality and perfectly usable. Anything higher than that becomes very grainy, and the quality deteriorates quickly.",
    "The 10MP selfie camera on the front of the phone is less headline-grabbing, but it proved capable enough during our testing. With the world increasingly staying in touch via video calls in this era of lockdowns, you\u2019ll find this camera is up to the task, and we found it gave us some great selfie results too.",
    "Another new feature for the Galaxy S21 is a Director\u2019s View mode, which enables you to shoot with the front and rear cameras at the same time. The idea here is vloggers and other content creators can capture reaction shots of themselves, which they can splice in alongside their main footage.",
    "We found the feature to work well, and it\u2019s similar to the option we\u2019ve seen on HMD Global\u2019s Nokia phones in recent years. We\u2019re not sure how many people other than vloggers will actually use this feature, but it\u2019s another fun upgrade that encourages you to experiment.",
    "For video, you\u2019ve got the option of 8K at 24 frames per second, which offers maximum quality and detail, but which we found to be a touch too cropped for our liking. More usefully there\u2019s also 4K at 30 and 60 frames per second, as well as Full HD at 30, 60 and 240fps.",
    "The Galaxy S21 phones were the first devices to use either Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 888 (US) or Samsung\u2019s own Exynos 2100 (just about everywhere else). Those were the latest generation of top-end chipsets when the S21 range launched, and the Exynos is still top of its range as of July 2021, but there's now a Snapdragon 888 Plus.",
    "We\u2019ve only had the chance to test the Exynos 2100 version of the S21, and it seems like a major improvement over previous generations of Samsung\u2019s chipset. In the past, the Exynos variant tended to lag behind the Qualcomm-powered phones in some areas but this year the gap seems to have narrowed.",
    "In Geekbench 5, the Samsung Galaxy S21 returned a multi-core score of 3367. That's notably better than the Galaxy S20 (the one featuring the Exynos 990 chipset) that returned a score of 2699.",
    "Benchmarking doesn't show everything, but we've found everyday tasks on the phone have been faster than previously with the handset more than capable at handling gaming, multi-tasking and having multiple apps open in split-screen view too.",
    "We\u2019ve yet to test the Samsung Galaxy S21 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset inside, but the Galaxy S21 Ultra performed well with this chipset inside so we\u2019d expect similar results on that S21 handset.",
    "Overall, the Exynos 2100 variant of the handset is a step above what we've seen from Samsung previously and this offers one of the best experiences when it comes to performance on an Android phone right now. We hope to have a full verdict on the Qualcomm chipset toting version in the near future.",
    "In the S21 both chips are paired with 8GB of RAM \u2013 if you want more than that on a new Samsung device, you\u2019ll want to opt for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which comes with either 12GB or 16GB.",
    "Along with that 8GB of RAM you\u2019ve got the choice of either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The big news here is that Samsung has dropped microSD support from the S21, so you can\u2019t expand on the built-in storage.",
    "The company is instead just offering internal storage, and again this seems to be a cost-saving measure from Samsung, but it\u2019s likely to disappoint anyone who wants the most affordable handset but needs a lot of storage.",
    "The S21 runs Android 11 with Samsung\u2019s One UI 3.0 skin, which is among our favorite software interfaces. Just know that it may be nearly a year before you see Android 12 on this phone, even if Google releases the update in August, as Samsung can be a little slow to roll out new versions of Android.",
    "The software available on this phone works well, and you've got access to a whole host of extra Samsung services on top of the normal Android apps you expect from a modern smartphone.",
    "Samsung has fully embraced 5G in 2021 too, and all variants of the Galaxy S21 are 5G-compatible. Even if you\u2019re not in a 5G-ready area, it essentially means you\u2019re futureproofed ready for when 5G connectivity is more widely available.",
    "Battery life on the Samsung Galaxy S21 is solid, although it\u2019s not a game-changing improvement over the S20, as the company may have led some to believe with its new Exynos 2100 chipset.",
    "We generally found that the phone would comfortably last a full day, but on one occasion, when we were making more use of the phone\u2019s GPS signal and other power-hungry features we found the device ran out of steam by around 10pm.",
    "Recharging the S21 is easy, using the company\u2019s 25W fast-charging tech via the phone\u2019s USB-C port. It\u2019s also compatible with Qi wireless charging, and we found that worked well during our testing.",
    "Reverse wireless charging is also supported, so you can use your phone\u2019s power to top up devices such as Qi-compatible wireless headphones, but we found that to be slow, and it\u2019s a feature you\u2019d likely only want to use in emergencies.",
    "One thing missing this year is compatibility with Samsung\u2019s 45W chargers that worked with the S20 series. Samsung told TechRadar that it\u2019s made optimizations to the 25W charging capabilities of its new phones, so 45W charging wasn\u2019t that significant a benefit.",
    "The other thing to note here is that the Galaxy S21 doesn\u2019t come with a charger in the box. Samsung has followed in Apple\u2019s footsteps by not bundling a charger with its new phones as it seeks to cut down on e-waste.",
    "The thinking is that, if you\u2019re buying a new Samsung phone, you likely already have a compatible USB-C charger that will work just fine. If you do need a charger you\u2019ll have to buy one, but while Samsung has dropped the price of its charger to $19 in the US, in other markets they\u2019re still pretty expensive, so it\u2019s something to be aware of.",
