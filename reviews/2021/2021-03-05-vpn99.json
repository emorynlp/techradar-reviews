  "summary": "A budget-friendly and fast VPN, but it has a few problems",
  "verdict": "VPN99 isn\u2019t just super affordable, but also delivers amazing speeds and can unblock some geo-restricted content. Additionally, it gives you a chance to see how capable it is for yourself before you make a commitment. However, its low price does come at a few costs; the no-logging policy is almost non-existent, there are no desktop apps or torrenting support, the mobile apps are very basic, the knowledge base scanty, and so is its server network. We also couldn\u2019t get it to work on a desktop device.",

    "Budget-friendly",
    "Excellent download speeds",
    "Can unblock Netflix US",
    "24-hour no-questions-asked money-back guarantee"

    "VPN99 is a small provider of VPN services that has a few positive qualities, but falls down in certain crucial areas. Its basic service does what it\u2019s supposed to, though, at least in terms of download speeds and unblocking geo-restricted VOD platforms.",
    "The provider\u2019s cheapest pricing option is the very affordable three-year plan at only $0.60/month (billed $21.90 every three years). Its other subscriptions are incredibly cheap as well; the typically pricey one-month subscription only costs $1.99, when some rivals charge you up to $15 for this plan length.",
    "Accepted payment methods include credit/debit cards, internet wallets, and cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, PayPal is not supported.",
    "Under one subscription, you can establish a VPN connection on up to 2 devices simultaneously.",
    "If you purchased your subscription via the website, you\u2019ll have the right to a full refund within 24 hours, which is a decent alternative to a free trial. If you\u2019ve done so via the app, then this period extends to 3 days. And that\u2019s not all - you even get a 30-day money-back guarantee if the platform doesn\u2019t live up to your expectations.",
    "What VPN99 lacks, the best services on the market deliver in abundance. If you\u2019re seeking a VPN provider with a detailed no-logging policy and an independent audit to confirm it, then you can choose between ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, or CyberGhost. They might cost more, but they don\u2019t attempt to hide any details and will provide you with advanced apps for all the major devices (and then some), along with peerless download speeds and unblocking capabilities.",
    "Many users decide to sign up for a VPN service because it can help them bypass geographical blocks that some popular streaming platforms impose on their content.",
    "From our tests (and as confirmed by the provider), we discovered that VPN99 can certainly unblock Netflix US. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t say the same for BBC iPlayer, which continued to see through our attempts to cloak our IP address with a British one.",
    "The company running this VPN is registered in Cyprus and provides access to an undisclosed number of servers in 15 countries, including Indonesia, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Mexico, Vietnam, and others.",
    "When you establish a VPN connection via this service, your data is encapsulated with a 2048-bit encryption algorithm. The provider uses OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, and PPTP connection protocols.",
    "If you were hoping that VPN99 is a good solution for anonymous torrenting, then you\u2019ll be disappointed. The provider doesn\u2019t block any type of traffic except, you guessed it, torrenting.",
    "Also, the mobile apps are exceptionally basic and we\u2019ve seen no sign of a kill switch or any other privacy-enhancing features you might find elsewhere.",
    "The Privacy Policy expresses the provider\u2019s dedication to its users\u2019 online anonymity but only in terms of accessing its website and during payments, not in terms of using its services. There\u2019s no mention of a no-logs policy in this area, but in the FAQ section we are told that \u201cVPN99 has a strict no-logging policy\u201d. Since there are no details or any sort of a third-party audit, it\u2019s impossible to know for certain just how secure your private data actually is with this provider.",
    "VPN99 only has apps for Android and iOS. As for other platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and routers, it can be manually enabled through third-party software like TunnelBlick and OpenVPN GUI, or through your device\u2019s own settings.",
    "At the time of writing, the provider\u2019s Android app had a score of 3.9 stars (out of 5) as rated by 600 users. It has been installed over half a million times and was updated only one month prior to our review.",
    "The iOS app had an even better rating - 4.5 stars - but has only been rated by 81 users. Apple doesn\u2019t show how many times an app was downloaded, but in its version history we could see that it is updated very regularly.",
    "There are also browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. At the time of writing this review, the Chrome extension had an average rating of 3.5 stars as rated by 47 users and has been downloaded by over 6,000 users. The Firefox add-on had only 2.8 stars as rated by 17 people (out of 304 who downloaded it). The extensions seem to be updated less often than the mobile apps.",
    "VPN99\u2019s customer support can be reached via email, by submitting a contact request, or by pressing the green Feedback button in the lower right corner of the website. We tried the Feedback button route and got our response via email in less than 15 minutes.",
    "Before reaching out to customer support though, you may find the answers you\u2019re seeking in the provider\u2019s modest help center, which contains manual installation instructions for all supported platforms, information on available VPN locations, as well as answers to frequently asked questions. All the instructions manuals are accompanied by screenshots.",
    "For some reason, the manual installation instructions for OpenVPN setup on Windows were in Russian. However, thanks to the good ole\u2019 Google Translate we managed to get around quite easily.",
    "The process isn\u2019t very beginner-friendly, at least not on Windows and Mac, as you need to download and install third-party software, as well as the desired servers, move them into the OpenVPN config folder, and type in your VPN credentials when you\u2019re connecting to a server option for the first time. Therefore, beginners might prefer the much simpler mobile apps.",
    "We preferred them as well, because when we tried to connect on Windows, the servers wouldn\u2019t accept our login credentials. The Android app, on the other hand, worked like a charm, so this is where we chose to test the provider\u2019s download speeds.",
    "Our testing connection\u2019s speed was 39Mbps and we tested a number of different VPN locations to see how much speed loss we\u2019d experience. The first victim of our tests was a server in Germany, which performed marvelously, delivering a high download speed of 26.6Mbps. We then easily switched to a UK server which was slightly slower but still impressive with 20.5Mbps.",
    "Then it was time for a bigger challenge - the USA - but VPN99 still delivered a strong 16.3Mbps. Finally, wanting to see how a server on the other side of the planet would fare, so connected to a site in Vietnam. This time around, the download speed reached only 1.37Mbps, but is to be expected from such an exotic location.",
    "VPN99 might not be one of the rulers of the VPN space, but it does have some good points. It won\u2019t cost you an arm and a leg, its speeds are commendable, and it can unblock the coveted US Netflix content. On top of that, it even allows you to take its platform for a test run for 24 hours and then ask for a refund, which you'll get with no questions asked.",
    "That said, we found its lack of no-logs policy concerning and so far there have been no external audits. Also, torrenting is forbidden, there are no desktop apps to make things easier for beginners (and even the manual installation didn\u2019t work for us), and its mobile apps are far from feature-rich."
