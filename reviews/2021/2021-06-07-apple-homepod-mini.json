  "summary": "Apple's 'cheap' speaker offers amazing sound",
  "verdict": "For anyone looking to enter the Apple smart ecosystem, or who has an Apple Music subscription, the HomePod mini is the speaker to go for. It's far cheaper than some might expect, packing mighty sounds and an elegant design for under $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150. However, Siri and the smart home experience still need some work, even years after launch.",
  "pros": [
    "Incredible sound",
    "Sleek design",
    "Useful functionality"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Needs Apple Music for full function",
    "Siri and the smart home features need work"
  ],
  "article": [
    "The Apple HomePod mini is the tech giant's smaller, cheaper version of its flagship smart speaker, the Apple HomePod (which Apple has now confirmed will be discontinued).",
    "It's one of the cheapest devices Apple has ever put out: at $99 / \u00a399 / AU$149, it's almost affordable for most, although it's going head to head with devices that can cost a fifth of that price at times, with the Amazon Echo Dot or Google Nest Mini being seen as its chief rivals.",
    "However, Apple believes that a combination of its Siri voice assistant and excellent sound quality will win the day \u2013 and there are a number of impressive things about this tiny speaker.",
    "The first of these is the set-up process \u2013 you'll need an iPhone or iPad to use the HomePod mini, and you can simply hold your device near the new HomePod mini and the connection is instant.",
    "All Wi-Fi passwords and accounts are synced, and if you're setting up two speakers together they'll automatically pair (after you've confirmed that's what you want to do). It takes practically seconds to get up and running.",
    "This a very inoffensive-looking speaker too, with a small spherical design that takes up far less space than the original HomePod.",
    "The latticed fabric housing blends nicely into the background, and the top glows with a pleasing light \u2013 although we do wish there was an option to dim it or turn it off at night, for when you're listening to calming music as you're drifting off to sleep.",
    "For us, the audio performance is the key reason to buy the HomePod mini. It's excellent for a speaker that's so small, and it really feels like the right mix of value for money and sound quality. The bass isn't too heavy, vocals aren't lost in the mix, and when you pair two minis, the stereo experience is really immersive.",
    "However, if you don\u2019t have an Apple Music account, you\u2019re rather limited when it comes to music streaming. You can't ask the HomePod mini to play anything through Spotify \u2013 that can only be enabled through AirPlay, and requires using your phone rather than the simpler method of asking Siri to play tunes with your voice. Essentially, you'll need a subscription in order to make full use of your HomePod mini.",
    "One of the biggest issues we encountered was when using the HomePod as a smart voice assistant. It works best if your family is set up with multiple Apple devices, but controlling your smart home devices with your voice is still hit and miss.",
    "We experienced multiple occasions when lights would turn on and off on command, only for a lamp or plug socket to randomly stay on, requiring us to issue a second command in order to get it to switch off. If your voice commands don\u2019t work flawlessly every time, using a smart speaker instantly becomes a frustrating experience.",
    "However, if you like using Siri and you've got an Apple Music subscription, buying a couple of HomePod minis should be an easy choice. The sound quality is exceptional for the size, and the interconnection with Apple's smart home is largely strong, in spite of some issues.",
    "[Update: You can now use the Apple HomePod mini as a speaker for the Apple TV 4K.",
    "The feature, which was once only available on the now discontinued HomePod, was announced during the company's annual WWDC keynote, alongside iOS 15, new upgrades for the AirPods, and watchOS 8.",
    "Both the HomePod and HomePod Mini are still receiving updates. The latest of which being the addition of Spatial and Lossless audio options in the current beta build. While not everyone has access to this beta update as of yet, it's a good indication that Spatial and Lossless audio will roll out to all users soon.]",
    "The HomePod mini launched on November 16, 2020, and costs $99 / \u00a399 / AU$149.",
    "That's far cheaper than the original Apple HomePod, which cost $349 / \u00a3319 / AU$499 when it launched in 2018.",
    "That pricing also puts the HomePod mini in direct competition with the new Amazon Echo (2020), which costs $99.99 / \u00a389.99 / AU$149 \u2013 and it also shares a fairly similar spherical design.",
    "It's not like Apple to price its products at the more affordable end of the spectrum, so perhaps the company is anticipating that people will buy more than one unit \u2013 as mentioned, you can pair two to get stereo sound.",
    "The Apple HomePod mini set-up process is incredibly simple \u2013 it's easily the best we've seen for any smart speaker, especially if you've not owned a smart speaker before and are worried that setting one up would be a complicated business.",
    "Once you\u2019ve taken it out of the box and plugged it in, you'll be greeted with a small light that glows at the top of the speaker. Hold your iPhone near to the HomePod mini and you'll get a notification that asks if you'd like to connect \u2013 tapping this will activate the camera, which you can use to find the swirling light on top.",
    "Once it\u2019s been located, it's then a few simple taps to transfer key information to the device \u2013 things like the Wi-Fi network are crucial, as that's how the HomePod mini communicates with the world around it, and it's great to not have to dig out your Wi-Fi password again.",
    "You'll also have your Apple ID synced across, as well as the choice of whether you want to enable it to just log information for you, or allow personalized info for other people in your (pre-defined) household.",
    "All of this is handled through the Home app on your iPhone, and this is also where you'll be asked to assign your mini to a room (so you can say things like 'play music in the bedroom'), as well as pair with another speaker if you've happened to buy an even number of HomePod minis \u2013 once again, these will be auto-detected by your iPhone, and you'll be presented with the pairing option.",
    "The HomePod mini design is \u2013 and we hate to describe it in this way \u2013 so very Apple. It's understated, minimal, and attractive without being overbearing \u2013 it looks like what we imagine most people would have drawn if you'd said \"sketch a small speaker from Apple\".",
    "Perhaps the only thing they'd get wrong is that it's spherical, which allows it to pump out 360-degree sound. This is a move that Amazon's made with the new Echo 2020, so it's clearly in fashion, but the sheer size (or lack thereof) of the HomePod mini is what impresses, especially when you consider the sound quality it offers, which we'll get onto (and laud) in a moment.",
    "The small sphere sits on a flat bottom, and while it's weighty enough to not get easily knocked around, it's got nowhere near the heft of the original HomePod. That lack of weight also means you won't need to worry about it marking the surface it sits on, as could be the case with the larger HomePod.",
    "The speaker is covered with a gray or white mesh, depending on your choice, and the power lead plugs into a USB-C charging block (which, thankfully, is included in the box, which isn't the case with the recent iPhone 12 range).",
    "Actually, given that this charging block retails for $19 / \u00a319 / AU$29 there's actually something of a saving to be had here, as you can use it to fast-charge an iPhone too \u2013 although you'll have to unplug the HomePod mini while you're doing that.",
    "It's a shame that Apple didn't make the HomePod mini portable, with a small battery inside like the Sonos Move \u2013 but that would have increased the size, and taken away from how impressively compact this little speaker is. It's easy to slot in discreetly around the home, but equally it looks fine placed on top of a bedroom cabinet or prominently displayed on a shelf.",
    "If there\u2019s a single reason to buy the HomePod mini, it\u2019s the sound quality. We\u2019re not used to saying this about many Apple products, but for the price you\u2019re getting excellent value for money in this respect.",
    "We noted above that the HomePod mini design is similar to the new Amazon Echo 2020 in being spherical, but that speaker doesn\u2019t have 360-degree sound, which Apple has packed into the new HomePod.",
    "The sound is guided from the internal driver down to the base of the HomePod, where it's fired outwards to create a more immersive sound.",
    "Inside the HomePod mini is the new S5 chipset, which enables \u2018computational audio\u2019 according to Apple \u2013 in other words, the HomePod will analyze the song that\u2019s playing and alter the response of the speaker accordingly.",
    "The ability to tweak the audio output on the fly to improve the sound quality in real time, plus the use of a full-range driver and two passive radiators, makes for very impressive performance indeed \u2013 and the results speak for themselves.",
    "We tested it with a variety of different musical genres, and while it\u2019s not got the same oomph as the larger HomePod, it\u2019s not that far off \u2013 and that device is far larger and more expensive.",
    "The treble frequencies and vocals are really clear in every song, punching through bassy tracks with ease \u2013 everything we tested had a good balance, and even though the bass was often strong, it wasn\u2019t overpowering for any genre.",
    "The midtones were smooth, especially in pop songs, and cranking the sound levels didn\u2019t introduce distortion \u2013 if anything, the room-filling experience was enhanced at maximum volume.",
    "We had one instance where, when using two HomePod minis paired together, they fell slightly out of sync, but a restart fixed this. It used to happen more regularly with the larger HomePod a year or so ago, so we\u2019re wary of it, but we only encountered it once.",
    "Single instruments, such as the twanging guitar on Fleetwood Mac\u2019s The Chain, or a single instrument in Mozart\u2019s Jupiter, carried a real resonance \u2013 perhaps the only criticism we could have was that classical music could see instruments getting a little lost in the wider orchestral movements, but it was a minor, and arguably fairly subjective, issue.",
    "While the HomePod mini won\u2019t dazzle audiophiles with its quality, for the price and size it\u2019s a very strong and capable speaker \u2013 Apple is banking on the fact that good audio quality is going to sell here, and for the \u2018average\u2019 music listener you\u2019ll find little to fault, especially when two devices are paired.",
    "Music handoff is a new feature that you won't find on the bigger HomePod, as it uses the Ultra Wideband chip, the same one as those inside the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12, to know when one of those phones is being pointed at it.",
    "Get close, point your music-playing phone at the HomePod mini, and a little rumble will tell you the music is now playing on the speaker. To 'steal it back', simply repeat the procedure and it'll come off the small HomePod and onto the phone again.",
    "It's a really neat process, and one that will delight those who want to just pass music like it's magic (or can't be bothered fumbling around looking for the AirPlay icon to play their music on a speaker).",
    "There is one thing we do wish Apple would give us the option to control: the light on the top of the HomePod mini is illuminated when it's playing music, and that makes sense \u2013 but if you\u2019re using the speaker to help you get to sleep (by playing rain sounds, or mimicking the ocean and so on) it\u2019s rather bright.",
    "Apple sorely needs a \u2018night mode\u2019 for its speakers \u2013 as you want to be able to say \u2018Hey Siri, goodnight\u2019 and not have the HomePod scream back \u2018OK, THE SCENE IS SET GOODNIGHT\u2019, waking up half the household and lighting up the room, when you want to keep listening to music.",
    "For some people the key reason to buy the new HomePod mini isn\u2019t the audio quality, impressive as it is for the price, but the ability to connect your smart home to the world with minimal fuss.",
    "In that respect, the HomePod mini is a useful tool. When it was announced alongside the iPhone 12, Apple went to great lengths to talk about how Siri is such an intuitive assistant, one that could easily help you on your phone, in your car, and when you're wandering around your home.",
    "Wake up in the morning and ask it to play the news, and it\u2019ll give you an update on what\u2019s been happening from a local radio station. Ask it to alter your smart lights or control smart plugs (as long as they\u2019re connected to your home network) and it\u2019ll instantly switch them on and off as requested.",
    "These are all things that the HomePod was capable of doing when we first reviewed it nearly three years ago, and Siri hasn\u2019t progressed massively as a smart assistant in that time.",
    "There are some more useful features on hand, but it depends on how integrated you are with onboard Apple apps. You\u2019ll need to be using the default calendar app to ask what appointments are coming up, and having Apple Maps set up to learn about traffic on your commute.",
    "Things like asking \u2018Hey Siri, what\u2019s my update today?\u2019 will give you weather, appointments and the latest news as a short podcast, but we didn\u2019t use this functionality all that much.",
    "Many of these are things that you\u2019d mostly do on your phone anyway, rather than have audio firing out of your speaker and possibly waking up others in the household if you like your updates first thing in the morning.",
    "Interacting with Siri is pleasant enough, with the cadence of its voice improved to be more natural-sounding in recent months \u2013 this is something Google and Amazon are trying to do with their assistants too, and it makes a big difference.",
    "One thing that still needs improving is Apple\u2019s smart home integration. Getting devices to pair with your smart setup isn\u2019t too hard (although there are a few steps to go through), but so often we were met with the equivalent of a virtual shrug when trying to turn our smart devices on and off.",
    "The amount of times we heard \u2018Hmmm, that device doesn\u2019t seem to be responding\u2019 when asking Siri to turn off a set of lamps was annoying, especially so when we asked again and eventually found that it managed to comply.",
    "Perhaps it\u2019s a congested Wi-Fi network or just Siri timing out, but it made us lose faith in the system and just resort to turning things on or off manually at times \u2013 the HomePod mini needs to be faster to act when it works, and more consistent in its functionality.",
    "Also new with the HomePod mini is the Intercom feature, which enables you to tell Siri via your phone or HomePod to make announcements that are played on other HomePod speakers in your home.",
    "It\u2019s a little cumbersome to use, as we found ourselves constantly rehearsing our lines to make sure it worked correctly. \u2018Hey Siri, announce in the living room I\u2019m sorry for noise, I just fell down the stairs\u2019 was an awkward thing to say (for a number of reasons) but trying to remember how to phrase the announcement precisely took some getting used to.",
    "This feature is going to be expanded in the months to come \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to make announcements on all devices connected to a household, be it iPhone or AirPods, so you\u2019ll be able to announce things to your family from afar and know that everyone heard.",
    "This could be an issue \u2013 if someone is having a conversation in a room and you just butt in with an intercom message, it might be a little intrusive. We understand why Apple built this feature in, but we rarely used it except for novelty value during our testing."
