  "summary": "Amazon\u2019s middle-sized tablet gets an upgrade",
  "verdict": "The Amazon Fire HD 8 is a tablet designed for people who are dedicated users of the company\u2019s entertainment offerings, with the tablet working well as a portable media system. However, it\u2019s not a huge upgrade from its 2018 predecessor, with only a few tweaks, so unless you think you\u2019ll make the most of the extra storage and faster charging on offer here, you may not need this newer model.",
  "pros": [
    "Super-low price",
    "Great front camera placement",
    "Headphone jack and USB-C"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Poor screen quality",
    "Locked to Amazon\u2019s ecosystem",
    "Feels cheap in the hand"

    "It was about time the Amazon Fire HD 8 got an upgrade, given that tablets from the company tend to be updated roughly every other year, and in mid-2020 it was the turn of the medium-sized tablet from the company, which previously got an upgrade in 2018.",
    "Launched alongside the Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus variant (with wireless charging and more RAM) and a Kids\u2019 Edition (with a protective cover), the Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020) isn\u2019t exactly a huge redesign of the Fire HD 8 (2018) \u2013 in fact it\u2019s not a redesign at all, since the slates look virtually identical. Instead, the new tablet gets a few tweaks to help it stay up to date with other 2020 tablets.",
    "It\u2019s clear that Amazon wants its new Fire HD 8 to hit the same \u2018cheap tablet\u2019 market it always does, with a low price achieved thanks to relatively slow processing power, unimaginative design, and compulsory use of Amazon\u2019s Android \u2018fork\u2019, which locks you into its content ecosystem.",
    "Upgrades to the 2020 model include USB-C connectivity (which brings with it faster charging), more storage, and a longer-lasting battery. These don\u2019t exactly redefine the experience of using the tablet, but they\u2019re all welcome improvements.",
    "Those small tweaks don\u2019t fix some of the issues we\u2019ve had with Amazon\u2019s tablets in the past: the screen quality isn\u2019t fantastic, for example, which can be an issue if you\u2019re looking for a portable entertainment system, although it\u2019s understandable given the price. Similarly, the cheap-feeling build, primarily due to the plastic used for the rear, is just a symptom of the price point.",
    "The bigger issue here is Fire OS, the Android fork that all of Amazon\u2019s tablets use, as it\u2019s quite a limiting ecosystem, especially if you\u2019re not already entrenched in Amazon\u2019s services, like Amazon Prime Video, Kindle and Amazon Music. There are only a few non-Amazon apps available to download, and you certainly don\u2019t get the freedom of customization you would with any other tablet using \u2018stock\u2019 Android or a forked version.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive and portable entertainment system, and don\u2019t mind being tethered to Amazon\u2019s apps and a few select games, then perhaps the Amazon Fire HD 8 is right for you, but there are other tablets available at this price point that offer better software.",
    "The Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020) went on sale, alongside the Plus and Kids\u2019 Edition tablets, on June 3, 2020. The 32GB storage option costs $104 / \u00a389 (roughly AU$160, though Amazon\u2019s tablets don\u2019t typically get released in Australia), which goes up to $134 / \u00a3119 (roughly AU$210) for the 64GB model.",
    "If you tend to download content that you watch, you may need the higher-storage version, but if you\u2019ll be using your tablet to stream content straight from the internet you should be fine with 32GB. It\u2019s worth pointing out that, because Amazon keeps its older tablets on sale for a while at a reduced price, you need to make sure you\u2019re looking at the right model: this is the ninth-generation build.",
    "For context, the Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus costs $20 / \u00a320 (about AU$30) more than the non-Plus model for each storage version, and if wireless charging is a big deal to you then perhaps it\u2019s worth the extra.",
    "The Amazon FIre HD 8 (2020) doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table design-wise \u2013 it\u2019s a big rectangle with a screen. This particular rectangle has dimensions of 202 x 137 x 9.7mm and a weight of 355g \u2013 that\u2019s fairly average for such a tablet, although the device is lighter than many competitors.",
    "Unlike on most tablets, the front-facing camera here is halfway down on the left side when you\u2019re holding the slate in portrait orientation, not on the top \u2013 this actually means it\u2019s in a great position for video calling, as you can look at the screen while also appearing to look at the camera.",
    "In this orientation, the USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, power button and volume rocker are all on the top edge of the tablet. The inclusion of a 3.5mm port will impress people who like their wired headphones, while the USB-C port ensures fast charging; however, we had an issue with the volume rocker.",
    "When the Amazon Fire HD 8 is in portrait, the right half of the volume rocker turns the volume up, and the left half lowers it \u2013 sounds simple, right? Well, when you flip the tablet to landscape, these functions are actually reversed. This took us quite a while to get used to, and it was especially confusing early on before we became aware of the problem.",
    "The back of the tablet is bare save for Amazon\u2019s smile-tick logo and the rear camera. The material here is plastic, which is another symptom of the low price, but it does make the slate feel a little cheap.",
    "The Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020) has an 8-inch screen, denoted by the 8 in its name. It\u2019s an LCD screen with a 800 x 1280 resolution, which is rather low-res given most cheap phones, which have screens smaller than 8 inches, have similar resolutions.",
    "As a result, the slate isn\u2019t perfect for all types of media \u2013 we found that games looked especially pixelated, and TV shows and movies didn\u2019t look fantastic. However, if you use the Kindle e-reader or Amazon Music functions you won\u2019t care as much \u2013 not everyone needs a top-end screen, and if that\u2019s you, you won\u2019t mind the Fire HD 8 display.",
    "One benefit of LCD panels is that they\u2019re easier to view outdoors in direct sunlight, so this is a tablet that should serve you well if you want to use it outside.",
    "The Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020) has a MediaTek MT8168 chipset, which is a processor designed for inexpensive tablets and e-readers, so it\u2019s right at home here. Suffice to say the tablet isn\u2019t exactly snappy to use, but with only 2GB RAM on board it was never going to be a powerhouse.",
    "There\u2019s a slight delay when you\u2019re navigating the tablet or opening apps, as you\u2019d expect from an inexpensive tablet with a weak chipset, but we encountered the most problems when playing games. There are very few demanding games available in Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, but PUBG Mobile is one, and we experienced issues with lag and crashes when playing it. Even Hearthstone \u2013 a card game \u2013 was prone to frequent crashing.",
    "If you\u2019re just using the Amazon Fire tablet to listen to music or watch movies, though, you won\u2019t suffer the wrath of this weak chipset, and since those are the main functions of this tablet we can give the processor problems a pass.",
    "We should also point out that we found the tablet had a little more trouble connecting to the internet than other devices, and we had to be closer to the router to get a reliable network connection. This only really became an issue when playing online games, although it also meant TV shows sometimes took a little while to buffer.",
    "Amazon doesn\u2019t announce the battery capacities of its tablets, but there\u2019s supposedly a 12-hour battery here, according to the company, up from the 10-hour estimated life of the previous version. It\u2019s unclear what kind of use that estimate is based on \u2013 watching content, listening to music, gaming, or a mix, but from our experience with the tablet we\u2019re inclined to suggest it\u2019s mainly watching content.",
    "By that we mean you\u2019ll probably be able to watch about 12 hours of content before having to charge the tablet; if you\u2019re listening to music or reading books the slate will last longer, but if you play games a lot it won\u2019t last you as long.",
    "Charging isn\u2019t exactly snappy, although it\u2019s faster here than via the older microUSB port. We\u2019d estimate it takes roughly an hour and a half to fully charge the device from empty.",
    "There\u2019s a 2MP camera on both the front and back of the Fire HD 8 (2020), although it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be using the rear snapper, as nearly all smartphones have better capabilities. As mentioned, the front camera is at the top when you\u2019re holding the slate landscape, as you likely will be for video calls, which we appreciated since it made it easier to look at the camera and screen at the same time.",
    "When you\u2019re using the Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020), or any Amazon Fire tablet, you\u2019re locked to FireOS, Amazon\u2019s Android fork. Although your mileage may vary, we\u2019d say this isn\u2019t a great operating system.",
    "Fire OS has no home screen customization options \u2013 instead, your interface looks more like an online storefront. You can switch between Home, Books, Video, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible and Newstand, and you can probably tell from that list nearly all those content options are ones Amazon has its fingers in.",
    "If you go to Video, for example, you\u2019re presented with Amazon Prime Video, and if you\u2019re a Prime subscriber you\u2019ll find shows and movies here you can watch for free, and more which you\u2019ll have to pay to access; non-Prime users will only find a list of things they have to pay to watch. It\u2019s generally the same with all the options on the aforementioned list.",
    "Only \u2018Games & Apps\u2019 gives you non-Amazon options, although the collection of apps you can download is far more limited than in the standard Google Play Store. There are some social media apps like Facebook and TikTok, some Amazon rival services like Spotify, Netflix and Disney Plus (so at least Amazon can\u2019t be accused of stifling competition), and a few popular games like PUBG Mobile, Crossy Road, Roblox, Hearthstone, Clash of Clans and Minecraft.",
    "The games list is very limited, and other than those big titles you\u2019re not going to be able to play many of the popular Android games. Unless the selection here ticks off all the games you like to play, you might find your phone or a different tablet better for mobile gaming; most of the other titles available on this Amazon tablet seem lacklustre."
