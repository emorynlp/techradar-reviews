    "\u201cMini but mighty\u201d is the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i\u2019s catchphrase, which is fairly accurate. Lenovo has certainly mastered the art of making capable yet affordable Computers, and this mini PC is more proof.",
    "By \u201cmighty\u201d though, we\u2019re not talking about Apple Mac mini M1-level performance. Apple\u2019s offering can play graphically intensive games on high settings and handle Final Cut Pro workloads like a pro. Meanwhile, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i is best for office and home use where a typical user would utilize it for sending emails, typing up documents, doing research, and streaming movies or shows.",
    "Still, for those, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i is certainly up to task, giving users on a budget a compelling option with very few sacrifices. In fact, it comes with a lot of ports and storage for the price, which makes it more than worth your money.",
    "At $509 and $629 for its low-end and mid-range configurations in the US, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i definitely sits in the budget market. However, there\u2019s plenty of value to be had here.",
    "The basic configuration, for example, gives you a 10th-gen Intel Core i3, Intel UHD Graphics 630, and 8GB RAM with 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD storage for just a little over $500. Meanwhile, something like the HP EliteDesk 805 G6 Desktop Mini will set you back $817 for an AMD Ryzen 3 PRO 4350G, integrated Radeon graphics, half the RAM, and much less storage space.",
    "And, although the Apple Mac mini\u2019s base configuration is much more powerful with an M1 chip and 8GB RAM, you\u2019re also paying a lot more at $699. Upgrade to a 1TB SSD storage, and you\u2019re already paying a whopping $1,099.",
    "The Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, therefore, is the most economical choice, especially if you won\u2019t fully utilize all the power that Apple\u2019s M1 chip delivers.",
    "None of the US configurations are available in the UK at the time of writing, however. UK customers do have a 10th-gen Intel Core i3, Intel UHD Graphics 630, 8GB RAM configuration on hand for \u00a3359. However, they\u2019re only getting 512GB SSD storage. Sadly, this mini PC isn\u2019t available in Australia.",
    "Slightly smaller, thicker and heavier than the Apple Mac mini, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i is just the ticket if you\u2019re looking for something that won\u2019t take up your whole desk space or if you need a PC you can take anywhere with you \u2013 though if it\u2019s the latter, you should probably just invest in a budget laptop.",
    "With a plastic gray chassis speckled in white and topped with a Mineral Grey textile panel, this mini PC boasts a business casual look that makes it just as fitting in an office setting as it is in someone\u2019s home. This top panel pops off easily to reveal a metal panel that hides the innards, some of which may be upgraded for future-proofing.",
    "There are a lot of ports on hand here \u2013 namely, a USB-C, five USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an HDMI port, and a DisplayPort, as well as a headphone/mic jack and a RJ45 Ethernet jack. And, this should give you a whole bunch of options to connect accessories and peripherals, just as all desktop computers should.",
    "Finally, there\u2019s an air intake underneath as well as an exhaust on the back of the PC for circulation and keeping those components inside nice and cool.",
    "The Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i is a very capable mini PC. Our review configuration boasts an Intel Core i5-10400T, an Intel UHD Graphics 630, and 8GB of memory. That will see you through most common productivity tasks, from browsing and sending emails to streaming your favorite movies and shows. You can even get some light gaming done \u2013 titles like Sayonara Wild Hearts play fairly smoothly, despite occasional choppy gameplay.",
    "Multi-tasking is a breeze on this mini PC as well, even when you have 20 or more browser tabs open at the same time. We\u2019ve done work on this computer with not just one but three streaming services running at the same time, and we haven\u2019t really experienced any glaring slowdowns that might affect productivity.",
    "Nor have we experienced the fan inside being overly loud. In a quiet room, you\u2019ll hear it working but not to the point of distraction. In a noisy room, you\u2019ll hardly notice it at all.",
    "The Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i might not knock it out of the park, yielding only a score of 451 in Time Spy, 2,416 points in Cinebench R20, and 4,585 in GeekBench, which means it\u2019s never going to see you through complicated workloads like video editing and gaming. However, it should be more than enough for most tasks, and it does so without burning a PC-shaped hole in your pocket."
