  "verdict": "The Dyson Micro 1.5kg is the brand\u2019s lightest and most compact cordless vacuum cleaner to date yet it\u2019s almost as powerful as more expensive Dyson models, and delivers excellent results on hard floors. However, while it\u2019s the most affordable Dyson to date, its smaller-than-average dust canister, short run time and lack of swappable battery mean it\u2019s not for everyone.",

    "Dyson has been keen to prove that it\u2019s still king of the cordless vacuums this year, putting all its cards on the table with the launch of the Dyson V15 Detect, the brand\u2019s most powerful and high-tech vacuum cleaner to date, which currently tops our list of the best vacuum cleaners. The floorcare stalwart quickly followed that model with the Dyson Omni-glide \u2013 a new style of cordless vacuum that can lie flat on the floor, making it easy to maneuver under furniture with low clearance.",
    "And now the company is launching its third cordless vacuum in as many months: the Dyson Micro 1.5kg, designed for hard floors, its the lightest and most compact Dyson cordless vacuum cleaner to date. At just 8.1 inches / 20.7cm wide, the cleaning head is 45% smaller than on other Dyson cordless vacuums, making it ideal for cleaning tight spaces.",
    "While it's not quite as flexible as the Omni-glide \u2013 it can\u2019t lie completely flat on the floor because of the design of its handle, it\u2019s still easy to maneuver, and can be converted into a handheld cleaner and used with the two tools it comes bundled with. It\u2019s powered by a rechargeable battery, which Dyson says will last up to 20 minutes between charges.",
    "The Dyson Micro 1.5kg is the brand\u2019s most affordable vacuum to date, but it\u2019s still got a hefty price tag. For those with limited storage space who want a compact cordless vacuum that doesn\u2019t compromise on suction power, it\u2019s worth considering, and it\u2019s certainly a strong contender if you want a vacuum that\u2019s great for tight spaces.",
    "The Dyson Micro 1.5kg is priced at $399.99 / \u00a3299.99, making it Dyson\u2019s most affordable cordless vacuum in the UK, and the same price as the Dyson Omni-glide in the US. Currently, it\u2019s not available in Australia.",
    "While you can currently pick up the Dyson V8 Animal, the brand\u2019s flagship cordless cleaner from 2016 for around the same price, it's considerably more expensive than similar models from rival manufacturers.",
    "At first glance, the Dyson Micro 1.5kg has the look you\u2019d expect from a Dyson cordless vacuum. A large handle is attached to the motor, which generates the suction, and the eight cyclones, which generate 96,000g of centrifugal force to ensure that microscopic dust particles remain in the canister, sit below the handle, with the 0.05-gallon / 0.02-liter dust canister below them.",
    "However, rather than the traditional-style trigger for switching the vacuum on and off, there are two buttons on the front of the motor housing, as on the Dyson Omni-glide, one of which activates the regular-power Eco mode, while the other boosts the suction to maximum.",
    "The Dyson Micro 1.5kg is designed for hard floors, and it ships with just one cleaning head, which is fitted with a brush bar covered in soft nylon to capture large particles without damaging flooring, while anti-static carbon fiber filaments collect fine dust at the same time.",
    "Weighing in at 3.3lb / 1.5kg, it\u2019s the lightest vacuum Dyson has made to date. Like other Dyson cordless vacuums, the Micro 1.5kg can be converted into a handheld cleaner by removing the main wand and attaching either the included mini motorized tool or combination tool directly to the dust canister.",
    "Dyson says the battery lasts up to 20 minutes between charges when the cleaner is used on Eco mode, or five minutes when used on the Max power setting. A charging cable and a docking station, which enable you to stow the Micro 1.5kg upright, are also included.",
    "While the Dyson Micro 1.5kg is compact and lightweight, it\u2019s certainly not lacking when it comes to suction power, effectively sucking up fine dust, cookie crumbs, and even cereal with one slow pass, on Eco mode as well as Max mode.",
    "We found the cordless vacuum glided easily on hard floors, and thanks to the articulating neck and smaller-than-usual cleaning head it was easy to maneuver into nooks and crannies.",
    "Like all Dyson vacuums, it\u2019s simple to convert the Micro 1.5kg into a handheld cleaner by removing the wand and cleaner head, and attaching either of the two tools it ships with. It also has the same \u2018point and shoot\u2019 mechanism found on all Dyson\u2019s recent models, which makes emptying the dust canister a breeze by ejecting the dust and debris from the canister into a bin in one swift move.",
    "The Dyson Micro 1.5kg is fairly loud in use, registering 74db on our decibel meter when used in Eco Mode and an ear-splitting 81db when we switched to the maximum suction, making it one of loudest cordless vacuums we\u2019ve tested.",
    "During testing we found Dyson\u2019s claim that the Micro 1.5kg battery would last up to 20 minute in Eco mode to be accurate, although we were disappointed to find that on maximum power the battery lasted a measly five minutes.",
    "Without an LCD screen, which the Dyson V15 Detect and Dyson V11 offer, the Micro 1.5kg suffers from the same issue as the Omni-glide \u2013 there\u2019s no battery level indicator to let you know when you\u2019re running low on power. The battery isn\u2019t swappable either, unlike in the Dyson Omni-glide, so if the vacuum runs out of power you\u2019ll have to cut short your cleaning dressing and wait the 3.5 hours it takes to fully recharge before you can continue.",
