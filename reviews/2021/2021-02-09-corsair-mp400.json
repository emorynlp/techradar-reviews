  "verdict": "The Corsair MP400 isn\u2019t your average PCIe SSD. It\u2019s fast for an SSD on the PCIe 3.0 interface, and yet it\u2019s priced more like an affordable SATA drive. It seems the only trade off is the QLC NAND, which slightly limits its endurance.",

    "Fast M.2 PCIe SSDs are becoming a bit more mainstream as high-speed flash memory becomes more affordable, and that commoditization leads to gems like the Corsair MP400. This SSD delivers some serious speed and capacity at relatively compelling prices. We tested the $254 (\u00a3240, AU$419) 2TB model, though there are also 1TB, 4TB and even 8TB models.",
    "The Corsair MP400 we tested verges on the pricing of SATA SSDs. This drive is barely more expensive than the $249 (\u00a3189, AU$279) 2TB Samsung 870 QVO SSD, but it doesn\u2019t have the speed limit of the SATA interface.",
    "What helps the Corsair MP400 offer such an affordable price is the QLC NAND flash memory. QLC drives are cheaper than those featuring TLC at the same capacities, because QLC can store more bits per cell. This price and cost advantage comes at the cost of durability. QLC NAND models often can\u2019t be written to as many times before the warranty expires. For example, the Samsung 860 Evo is rated for 1,200 TBW (terabytes written). Meanwhile, the Corsair MP400 is only rated to hold up to 400 TBW.",
    "400 TBW isn\u2019t much of a shortcoming for general use, though you may not want to use it as a scratch disk for 8K video workflows or anything taxing like that. It\u2019s almost too bad, because one thing this drive has going for it is speed. That said, this would make an excellent drive to fit inside a gaming rig as capacious and fast storage for a game library, since that entails far more reading from the drive than it does writing to it.",
    "Though this is an affordable PCIe drive, it competes with some of the best in the business. In our testing, the Corsair MP400 delivers sequential read and write speeds as fast as or faster than just about any other PCIe 3.0 SSD we\u2019ve tested, including the Samsung 970 Pro and Evo Plus and WD Black SN750. It\u2019s random speeds are also thoroughly impressive, hitting 1,541MB/s in random reads and a simply absurd 2,487MB/s in random writes \u2013 that\u2019s verging on the write speeds we\u2019ve seen on PCIe 4.0 SSDs.",
    "If storage and value are your priorities, you can\u2019t do much better than this drive. As long as you\u2019ve got a PCIe slot for it, the slight price increase of this drive over a SATA drive is more than justified by the huge speed increase.",
    "SK Hynix\u2019s Gold P31 drive offers some competition (at least when it\u2019s on sale), as it offers all-around higher speeds at a lower price per gigabyte. But, it only comes in 500GB and 1TB capacities. Since the 1TB drive has recently been just $134 (about \u00a3100, AU$175), it offers better value, but that isn\u2019t the case if the drive reverts to its original price of $224 (about \u00a3165, AU$295)"
