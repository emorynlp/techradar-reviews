  "verdict": "It\u2019s pricey, but the portable Sonos Move justifies every penny with its smart connectivity and living-room worthy sound. It\u2019s just a shame it can\u2019t be used in a surround sound system.",
  "pros": [
    "Can integrate with a home Sonos speaker network",

    "Sonos truly has a smart speaker for every occasion. There\u2019s the Beam soundbar and Playbase speaker and TV stand rolled into one both designed to enhance your viewing experience. Then there\u2019s the fantastic-sounding Play:5, which packs a punch and the One, a top smart speaker option.",
    "The brand even boasts bookshelves and lamps now, thanks to its recent collaboration with Ikea. But, for years, Sonos lacked an outdoor speaker.",
    "That changed with the Sonos Move, the company's first foray into portable Bluetooth speakers that launched in 2019. Since launch, it's topped our list of the best Bluetooth speaker and is perfectly suited for both indoor and outdoor listening.",
    "The Sonos Move offers on-the-go Bluetooth play, as well as integrating with a multi-room networked speaker system over Wi-Fi. In this way, it\u2019s got most of the functionality of a regular Sonos, along with the very appealing ability to untether it from a power supply, thanks to an internal battery.",
    "It's larger and more powerful than the newly announced Sonos Roam that's expected to be released on April 20 2021 for $169 / \u00a3159 / AU$279, but it's also more expensive, too.",
    "Since launch, we've seen a new and improved Sonos Move that brings improved battery life with an extra hour of charge to ensure those trips to the beach \u2013 or just out of reaching distance of a plug socket \u2013 are packed with quality sound as long as possible. Plus there's a new Lunar White version of the Sonos Move gives a white/silver new look to the portable speaker, and should provide more variety.",
    "Can't decide if the Sonos Move is right for you? Read on for our full review or check out our specific Sonos Move vs Sonos Roam guide to see the differences between the larger Sonos Move and smaller Sonos Roam.",
    "[Update: Sonos speakers, including the Sonos Move, can finally handle wireless Hi-Res Audio streaming, with Qobuz beating competitors like Tidal and Amazon Music HD to become the first Hi-Res streaming service to be supported by the multi-room ecosystem.",
    "Available with the S2 app, Qobuz is bringing 24-bit wireless streaming to Sonos customers, who will be able to listen to \"studio-quality music\", which preserves \"all the details and color of the original recordings,\" according to the French streaming service.]",
    "The Sonos Move went on sale on September 24, 2019 costing $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649.",
    "That\u2019s pricey for a portable speaker \u2013 but this isn\u2019t your average Bluetooth boombox, making it difficult to place alongside any direct competition. Few portable speakers, even those with smart assistants built-in, have as rich a feature-list as the Sonos Move, so that higher price tag is more easily justified.",
    "Sonos products command a high price tag, and the Sonos Move is no different \u2013 but it\u2019s been engineered to within an inch of its life in order to justify the claim on your hard earned cash.",
    "It\u2019s very much in the style of previous Sonos models. You\u2019ve a black speaker with a metal front grille, with capacitive playback control buttons along the top alongside an array of four far field mics. Around the rear you'll find a power button, a Bluetooth / Wi-Fi toggle button and a multi-room pairing button.",
    "In terms of audio guts, the Sonos Move makes use of two Class-D digital amplifiers, one downward-firing tweeter for highs and one mid-woofer integrated into the cabinet for mid-ranges and bass. Sonos has built the enclosure cutaway to be resonant and balanced from all angles \u2013 the outside world knows no boundaries, after all.",
    "As a portable product, it\u2019s been vigorously tested for durability. Sonos also claims that it can withstand extremes of cold and heat \u2013 so whether your party is in the desert or the middle of a snowstorm, the Sonos Move should have you covered. It\u2019s IP56 rated, meaning it\u2019ll withstand a coating with sand or dust, as well as a drop into a swimming pool. There\u2019s even run-off channels within the casing for water to drain out through, while Sonos claims that during drop tests a concrete slab broke before the speaker even took a dent.",
    "That\u2019ll be down to its weight, we\u2019d imagine. Standing 240 x 160 x 126 mm, it\u2019s portable, but it\u2019s not small. At close to 3kg, you can lift the Sonos Move with ease, but you wouldn\u2019t want to carry it around for too long. That\u2019s a necessity of the large driver magnets in place here, and it\u2019s a fair trade to make for the audio quality that\u2019s delivered. To ease the load, the casing has a concave handle gap on the rear to make carrying it around a little easier.",
    "Based on our testing, battery life should be good for the quoted 10 hours, and will fully charge in around 2.5 hours. The speaker can charge over USB-C, but you\u2019ll likely use the included docking base ring, which charges the speaker any time it\u2019s left to rest in it. The Sonos Move also uses a standby-like mode to save power when it notices it hasn\u2019t been used for 30 minutes or so \u2013 this lets it conserve power for up to 5 days without a charge, but also gives it enough juice to let it be woken from its slumber wirelessly.",
    "There are laudable eco-credentials here too. Sonos predicts, on average usage, battery degradation to occur after about 900 charge cycles, or roughly three years of day-to-day use. Rather than expecting you to throw your premium speaker away, it\u2019ll instead (for an as-yet-undisclosed fee) offer up a replacement battery which you can easily install into the base of the speaker yourself.",
    "Sonos has a long heritage in connected and wireless audio, and just because this is its first attempt at going portable, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s dropping any of that connectivity. Like other Sonos speakers, the Move can be made to work in a stereo pairing, or also as part of a multi-room group. If you want the Move to play in the garden the same tunes as are playing elsewhere in your home over a Sonos system, it\u2019ll do so without missing a beat.",
    "The Sonos Move will work with all manner of connected audio sources, online or stored on a local network. If you want to fire up a playlist on Spotify using Spotify Connect, that\u2019s just as simple in-app as playing something you\u2019ve ripped to a networked storage device yourself. Just fire up the Sonos app, and once set up and connected to the internet all your sources appear over Wi-Fi.",
    "Move out of range of a Wi-Fi connection, and you\u2019ve Bluetooth to fall back on. It\u2019s the 4.2 version of the connectivity standard, rather than the newer 5.0, but Sonos claims its experience with the 4.2 version of Bluetooth has let it eke more power saving and range capabilities out of 4.2 than ever before. While it\u2019s not quoting range for either its Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections, it\u2019s simply stating that \u201cif you can hear it, you can control it\u201d. Four Wi-Fi antennas sit dotted around the base of the Move, with the Bluetooth module situated on top to give the best coverage possible. AirPlay 2 is also supported, for the Apple-device contingent out there.",
    "That top-mounted array of mics serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it gives you access to a choice of either Amazon Alexa of Google Assistant voice assistants \u2013 each AI helper is fully compatible with the Sonos Move, giving you the option as to which you want to use to set reminders, control smart home devices, access calendar and act as a voice-powered jukebox.",
    "The mics and smart assistant pairing works superbly here. Even across a chatty office and with the speaker playing a song by The National, it was able to pick up our requests \u2013 even if the responses weren't always quite what we were after. But that's on Amazon and Google's AI helpers, not Sonos's engineers.",
    "Secondly, those mics are also the heart of the \u2018Trueplay\u2019 audio-tweaking system. They analyse the output from the Sonos Move and how its surroundings are affecting it, and automatically adjust it to bring it closer to the intended studio sound. What\u2019s really clever is that it knows when the Sonos Move has, err, moved \u2013 there\u2019s an accelerometer onboard that triggers the TruePlay system\u2019s tweaks when it detects movement.",
    "Pretty much the only thing the Move won\u2019t support, however, is being used as part of a home cinema system\u2019s 5.1 rear channels, as some other Sonos devices can be. Sonos states that this is due to sync issues, and the problematic potential for a directional soundtrack to lose its focus if a speaker can be misplaced in a room. But it\u2019s a shame given the wire-free surround sound potential that could have been delivered here.",
    "The Sonos Move doesn\u2019t sound like a portable speaker. If you\u2019re familiar with the Sonos range for the home, this would sit somewhere between the Sonos One and the Play:5, not just in terms of volume, but also fidelity. The mid-range driver offers forceful and space-filling low end, even when competing with the acoustics of a wide open space, while there\u2019s no drop off in vocal clarity that can often occur with lesser portable speakers. The Sonos Move is very much a match for the Sonos home range, but let loose thanks to its battery.",
    "We put the Sonos Move through its paces with a menagerie of songs, musical styles, and in a variety of different locations.",
    "Kelis's electro pop banger 'Acapella' shows the Sonos Move managing what few other Bluetooth speakers can \u2013 tight and punchy bass, shimmering highs and a lilting vocal that cuts through it all with direct clarity.",
    "'Orange Crush' from R.E.M's album Green was a good test of the Sonos app's EQ options, letting you dial up and down treble and bass settings. The lo-fi track naturally favours a sharper top-end, but dialling up the bass in the EQ convincingly gives the track a little more warmth than its neutral recorded sound offers.",
    "Michael Kiwanuka's 'Bones', with its exposed vocals, swinging guitars and jazzy band accompaniment offered a surprisingly adept soundstage from the portable speaker. Kiwanuka's voice and guitar sits notably in front of a sashaying brushed drumkit, twinkling piano lines and stabs or clean electric guitar all around him. It's almost like being in the same room as the group.",
    "Treated to a few cuts from Tame Impala\u2019s Currents album and Vampire Weekend\u2019s Father of the Bride record, the Sonos Move again blew us away. The Aussie rocker\u2019s psych-filled waves drifted effortlessly and crisply from the Sonos Move, without losing the snap and rhythm of the \u2018Let it Happen\u2019 bass line \u2013 and at a neighbour-bothering volume level, too, distortion free. Likewise, the bouncy vocal of Ezra Koenig, twanging lead and wobbly bass of Vampire Weekend\u2019s \u2018This Life\u2019 had all the jaunty space it needed, with the soundstage sounding surprisingly wide in the multiple environments we heard the Sonos Move.",
    "With the speaker expected to be moved around (and outside) the house, in areas with differing acoustics, the TruePlay system kicks into gear. And it\u2019s incredibly effective at reworking the audio output to suit different environments.",
    "At the Sonos Move launch event this was demonstrated to great effect when a Sonos team member popped on Billie Eilish\u2019s \u2018bad guy\u2019.",
    "First, they had the song playing up on top of a TV stand \u2013 sounding great. Then, without stopping the song, they put the speaker in a half open drawer. Initially, it didn\u2019t sound too good \u2013 there was an overpowering boom to the bass, showing none of the song\u2019s production subtlety, and some drop-off in the clarity of the vocals. But, after about 20 seconds, the Trueplay system had assessed its surroundings using the onboard mic, dialled back the bass a touch, and everything sounded much more enjoyable again. It was an impressive showcase of the system\u2019s capabilities.",
    "The speaker more than holds its own in the great outdoors too. The TechRadar test team turned some heads when blasting out ABBA tracks (a not-so-guilty pleasure) in a local park, at impressive volume levels. Again, it's clarity and low-end punch was not lost, even as cars and sirens passed. It's hard to imagine an owner often taking the Sonos Move far beyond the boundaries of their own garden given its size, but you've enough power here to comfortably fill a (modest) field.",
    "Having waited this long for a Sonos portable speaker, the company had to pull something special out of the bag, and it has. There\u2019s flexibility here with the Sonos Move in terms of how it can be used, from on-the-go portable playback to being part of an in-the-home multi room set-up. It\u2019s disappointing that the potential to use the Sonos Move as part of a home-cinema surround sound set-up isn\u2019t here, but overall, color us impressed.",
    "With its powerful driver and full access to the Sonos software ecosystem, what you're really getting here is a full-blown Sonos home speaker, which just so happens to be portable. Not that the portability is an afterthought \u2013 battery life, carrying handles and durability account for that \u2013 but it's the fact that the Sonos Move can hold its own with powered home speakers (smart assistants and all) and not lose out that impresses the most. That price tag is going to sting initially, but what the Sonos Move offers more than makes up for it."
