  "summary": "Instant\u2019s most versatile air fryer yet",
  "verdict": "Instant\u2019s most expensive air fryer to date does an excellent job of air-frying everything from chips to chicken wings. Its 6-quart / 5.7-liter capacity, and the fact that it can now grill and dehydrate as well as bake, roast and reheat, justify the hefty price tag \u2013 you won\u2019t know how you coped without it.",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent crisp, evenly browned results",
    "Easy to clean",
    "Handy presets"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Bulky and takes up a lot of countertop space",
    "Basket isn\u2019t dishwasher-safe",
    "Reheat function can\u2019t replace a microwave"

    "Instant is known for its kitchen appliances that offer several methods of cooking in one device, such as the Instant Pot range, and its latest addition is the Vortex Plus 6-in-1 Air Fryer (it's called the Vortex Plus 6 Quart in the US). It looks slightly more stylish than Instant Pot\u2019s current air fryer, with a brushed stainless steel rather than a black plastic exterior, but it\u2019s not only its design that\u2019s been upgraded.",
    "As well as air-fry, roast, bake and reheat, it can also grill and dehydrate, making it even more versatile than its smaller sibling, the Instant Vortex. The Vortex Plus has a 6-quart / 5.7-liter capacity, which Instant claims is large enough to hold a 4lb / 1.8kg chicken, or 2.2lb / 1kg of fries.",
    "The best air fryers circulate hot air around the food in the frying basket so it cooks quicker than traditional methods, but is crisp too and the Vortex Plus is no exception. Air fryers use considerably less oil when crisping food \u2013 Instant claims you need 95% less oil \u2013 so they offer a healthier way to enjoy foods that would usually be deep fried, without compromising on the taste.",
    "There are six presets that offer default lengths and temperatures, although you can adjust the defaults as you see fit using the dial on the front of the air fryer\u2019s control panel. Once you\u2019ve adjusted the time and temperature on these presets to achieve the results you want, you can then save the changes to the memory to create your own custom presets, so there\u2019s no need to adjust the program every time.",
    "The Instant Vortex Plus is priced at $119.95 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$269, and is available worldwide from Instant\u2019s website; it\u2019s also available through Amazon in the US and Australia.",
    "This is $30 / \u00a320 / AU$40 more expensive than Instant Pot\u2019s original air fryer, the Instant Vortex. However, as we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Vortex Plus offers an extra two cooking methods so the price hike is understandable.",
    "The Instant Vortex Plus is by no means a compact air fryer, measuring 12.83 x 14.92 x 12.36 inches / 32.6 x 37.9 x 31.4 cm (h x w x d). However, its large footprint means an equally large capacity of 6 quarts / 5.7 liters, and thanks to its multitude of cooking methods \u2013 as we\u2019ve mentioned it can now grill and dehydrate as well as air-fry, roast, bake, and reheat \u2013 you should be able to consign a few of your other kitchen gadgets to the cupboard, so countertop space shouldn\u2019t be an issue.",
    "The Vortex Plus retains the square shape of the Instant Vortex Air Fryer, including the square basket and dishwasher-safe crisper tray, but builds on this with a brushed stainless steel finish, although it\u2019s not as fingerprint-resistant as you might hope.",
    "It has the same touchscreen too, but with six presets rather than four. There are also buttons for time and temperature, alongside a stainless steel dial, all of which are easy to clean, as they can be wiped with a damp cloth. The air fryer can reach a maximum temperature of 400F / 205C and can cook for up to one hour, that ensuring you\u2019ll be able to prepare a huge variety of dishes.",
    "The air fryer doesn\u2019t come with a recipe booklet \u2013 instead you\u2019ll need to go online, or use the Instant app for your smartphone or tablet, for inspiration. However, when we searched for recipes, it took us some time to find those that were designed for the air fryer rather than for Instant\u2019s other kitchen gadgets such as its Instant Pot multi-cookers. We\u2019d have liked to see an included booklet that gave us instant access to a handful of dedicated air fryer recipes.",
    "We were impressed with the Instant Vortex Plus\u2019s cooking capabilities. Both home-made fries, which needed just 2tsp of oil for a 1.1lb / 500g batch, and chicken wings came out evenly browned in under 20 minutes. The fries had crisp exteriors that offered a satisfying crunch when bitten, with fluffy, soft potato inside. Similarly, the chicken wings had crisp skin, but the meat remained succulent. We used the suggested temperature and timings from the Instant Pot app, and in our opinion that wasn\u2019t any need to tweak them, as the results were on point.",
    "Like other air fryers, the Instant Vortex Plus really does speed up cooking times, with the chicken wings taking almost half the time they would take in a conventional oven. We also cooked 1.1lb / 500g of frozen steak-cut fries in the air fryer, and while they weren\u2019t as crisp as the homemade fries, they were evenly browned and ready within 15 minutes, just under half the recommended cooking time for a conventional oven.",
    "The air fryer provides an audible and visual alert once it\u2019s pre-heated and it\u2019s time to put the food in the basket, and another alert at the half-way point, so that you can turn or shake food as required to ensure it's evenly browned.",
    "As expected, the Instant Vortex Plus makes an extractor-fan like noise during cooking; however this only measured 64db on our decibel meter, which is similar to the noise a dishwasher makes mid-cycle. The sound does only run for the length of cooking time, and for most dishes that\u2019s around 20 to 30 minutes, and we think it\u2019s an acceptable level to deal with in this short time period. The casing remained cool to the touch during use too."
