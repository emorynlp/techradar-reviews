  "verdict": "The Breville Super Q does have a commercial look that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in your local caf\u00e9, but it has enough design features to look just as much at home in your own kitchen. It has a large capacity jug and is easy to use with all the features we\u2019d expect. It isn\u2019t designed for very small quantities though, and couldn\u2019t make a small mayo recipe until we doubled the ingredients. It\u2019s ideal for households that want to blend large quantities and don\u2019t mind its big size.",

    "The Super Q is the top-of-the-range blender from Breville that has a powerful 1800W motor (the UK and Australia model is 2400W) with a blade speed of 186mph/ 300kph for real no-nonsense blending power. Its power and ability to smoothly and even blitz fruit and vegetables earned it a spot in our best blenders round-up.",
    "The Super Q has the distinctive Breville styling that coordinates well with all other Breville products, but also doesn\u2019t look out of place next to other brands.",
    "It also has all the blending features you\u2019d expect, including 12-speed levels for ultimate blending control and. In addition to the large jug, it comes with one personal blending cup, including a travel lid and blade system for making smoothies to-go. The intelligent base recognizes whether the jug or personal blending cup is attached and optimizes performance accordingly. The Super Q did struggle with smaller quantities, however, so this blender isn\u2019t a great option for those that want to make small portions.",
    "In the US and Australia, this machine is called Breville the Super Q and is available from the Breville website. In the UK, it\u2019s called Sage the Super Q and is available from the Sage appliances website.",
    "This is a pricey blender and is the top-of-the-range model from this premium appliance brand.",
    "Breville describes the Super Q as a commercial-grade blender designed for the home, and that\u2019s exactly how it looks and feels. The large capacity jug and brushed stainless steel construction definitely give it a sturdy commercial feel.",
    "There are seven color options which are mostly muted and metallic tones, although in the UK and Australia it\u2019s only available in a brushed stainless-steel finish. The model we tested had a stainless steel finish and we found it marked really easily with fingerprints and needs regular buffing to look its best.",
    "The Super Q measures 8.2 x 10.6 x 18.1 inches/ 26.8 x 20.8 x 46cm which means it\u2019s very tall and might not fit on the counter underneath wall-mounted cabinets. However, it weighs in at 11 lbs/ 5 kg which is not ideal for moving around too much.",
    "It comes with a handy personal blending cup and travel lid for easy smoothies to-go and additional cups are available to purchase separately. There\u2019s also a tamper, for moving ingredients around during blending as well as a useful scraper to scrape down the sides of the jug.",
    "The Super Q offers a high level of control with 12 speed settings shown on the LCD screen. There are also five one-touch programs: smoothie, green smoothie, frozen dessert, soup, and ice crush as well as a pulse function. Cleaning is made easy with the clean program, just add warm water and dish soap and the clean program will do the rest. Alternatively, all accessories including the blades are dishwasher-safe.",
    "When it comes to serious high-power blending, this blender\u2019s got you covered. The ice crush setting pulverized our ice cubes to a very fine crushed texture in seconds, with a noise level of 85dB.",
    "We tried to chop hazelnuts on the \u2018mill\u2019 speed in the main blending jug, but instead of a larger chopped texture, the nuts were ground to a powder. That said, most blenders we tried struggled with this task. If you want ground nuts though, it did a pretty good job with only a few slightly larger pieces that hadn\u2019t ground down. There was no leakage from anywhere in the jug when we filled it to max capacity with water and blended it at maximum speed.",
    "We made a smoothie in the personal blender cup and found the blade system required quite a bit of force to screw fully into position on the cup. We tested the one-touch programs, starting with the \u2018smoothie\u2019 program, we found it did a great job at liquidizing banana, pineapple, and most of the spinach into yogurt and apple juice, but there were a few tiny specs of spinach leaf still visible. So we tried the same smoothie on the \u2018green smoothie\u2019 program and this time everything was completely pulverized with no trace of spinach leaf or fibrous pineapple. The travel lid has a large hole that is easy to drink from and it didn\u2019t leak when turned upside down and given a good shake. Both smoothie programs had a noise level of 85dB.",
    "This blender really is designed for large quantities and as such, it wasn\u2019t able to make a small quantity of mayonnaise because the blades don\u2019t sit low enough to mix two egg yolks with some vinegar. However, we were successful when doubling the recipe, the blades managed to mix the four egg yolks and the blender produced a nicely emulsified mayo. It\u2019s worth noting that when pouring oil into the blender via the inner cap in the center of the lid, it did spit a lot back up through the hole, so much so that we had to clean mayo droplets off the kitchen wall afterward.",
    "The scraper was useful for removing most of the mayo from the jug and the clean function effectively removed the worst of the oily mayo residues, so that minimal cleaning was required after use.",
