  "verdict": "The HP Spectre x360 (2021) presents a brilliant update on an already excellent laptop, bringing the latest Intel hardware to a stunningly designed 2-in-1 device. It can get a bit loud, and it's expensive \u2013 but it looks beautiful, and offers brilliant battery life as well.",

    "The HP Spectre x360 (2021) took an already great laptop and made it better. Performance and portability were combined in last year\u2019s HP Spectre x360 model for one of the best laptops we\u2019ve ever seen. And, with the 2021 model, the bar has been raised now that it bears the seal of Intel\u2019s Evo certification.",
    "For the certification, the 2021 version of the Spectre has to meet certain standards, the end result being better performance as well as design. This model comes with fantastic battery life, lasting almost 13 hours in our PCMark 10 battery life test, showing that a Windows laptop can last just as long as Chromebooks and MacBooks here. It can also do some casual gaming and boots up very quickly \u2013 anyone outside of a hardcore gamer will be impressed.",
    "That\u2019s not to say the HP Spectre x360 is perfect. While you can use it in tablet mode thanks to that 360-degree hinge, it\u2019s a bit too bulky and clumsy to function well as a tablet. It\u2019s not unusable but if this feature is a priority for you and you want a laptop that will spend as much time in tablet mode as it does in laptop mode, then we suggest looking at something like the Surface Pro 7 or iPad, which are thin and light tablets that can be used with keyboards.",
    "Our other issue is that the fans become quite loud when you\u2019re using the laptop \u2013 and, on occasion, even when you\u2019re not. A few times we heard the fans kick even when the HP Spectre x360 (2021) was closed. It\u2019s the one area of the design of the HP Spectre x360 (2021) that doesn't feel completely premium.",
    "Aside from those issues, this is a supremely accomplished laptop that\u2019s great for day-to-day use, including work. However, with starting prices of $1,349/\u00a31,199/AU$3,339 (various markets have different starting configurations), it's pricey. If you have the budget for it, though, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
    "The HP Spectre x360 (2021) is available in a variety of configurations and prices. Prices start at $1,149.99 in the US, for a model with an Intel Core i5 -1135G7 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.",
    "In the UK, the base model costs \u00a31,199.99 and comes with an Intel Core i5 -1135G7 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.",
    "Then there\u2019s a version with an Intel Core i7 -1165G7 processor, 16GB of R AM and a 512GB SSD, which is the version on review here. It costs $1,349.99/\u00a31,399.99.",
    "There's also a model with the same CPU and RAM, but with a 1TB SSD and a 4K OLED screen for \u00a31,699.99.",
    "In addition, the HP Spectre x360 (2021) comes with various screen sizes: 13 inches (the version we\u2019re testing), 15 inches, and 13.5 inches (which has a taller 16:10 aspect ratio).",
    "In Australia, you can get the 13-inch model with an Intel Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for AU$3,399. It's also available with the Core i7, 16GB of RAM, a 4K OLED screen and a 2TB SSD for AU$4,599.",
    "Like models in the UK and US, there are numerous configurations available, including models with 14-inch and 15-inch screen sizes.",
    "So, as you can see, there's plenty of choice available for those in the market for a new HP Spectre x360 \u2013 but we'd hesitate to say there's a model for every budget. Even the cost of the base models exceed those of many other laptops. This is a seriously premium laptop \u2013 which means it needs to work hard to justify its high price.",
    "With a premium price you expect a premium design, and HP certainly delivers with the HP Spectre x360 (2021). To be honest, we never had any doubt that it would; the previous model was one of the nicest-looking laptops we've had the pleasure of reviewing.",
    "So, it comes as little surprise that the new model is yet another gorgeous laptop from HP. Design-wise, the HP Spectre x360 (2021) is basically identical to the previous model \u2013 which is no bad thing, considering how impressed we were with its looks.",
    "The HP Spectre x360 (2021) arrives with a brushed-metal design that's available in several color combinations. The 360-degree hinge, which allows the screen to flip back completely, turning the HP Spectre x360 (2021) into a tablet-like device, feels solid and reliable. The right-hand side is engraved with the word \u2018Spectre\u2019 \u2013 a nice touch that further cements the HP Spectre x360 (2021)\u2019s overall premium feel.",
    "In terms of connections, you get an audio-in jack and full-size USB port on the right (the inclusion of a full-size USB port is a nice touch for such a thin and light laptop), plus two USB-C ports, a microSD port and a physical webcam kill switch on the left.",
    "The latter allows you to turn off the webcam when it isn't in use; it's a great feature for people concerned about their privacy. It\u2019s definitely a big selling point, and that \u2013 along with the full-size USB port and microSD slot \u2013 show that it is possible for a thin and light laptop to incorporate multiple connections without compromising design. It certainly puts the two USB-C ports of the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) and MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) to shame.",
    "Open up the HP Spectre x360 (2021) and you\u2019re presented with a bright and vibrant screen, surrounded by extremely thin bezels. This gives the device a modern look, while keeping the overall size of the laptop down. It\u2019s another case of a Windows 10 laptop looking more stylish than an Apple MacBook \u2013 something both HP and Intel will be pleased to learn, and is yet another reason for Apple to consider updating its MacBook designs.",
    "The keyboard is large and enjoyable to use, with the keys offering decent travel. They\u2019re also backlit, so you can comfortably use them in the dark.",
    "The touchpad is nice and responsive. It's wider than you\u2019d expect on a 13-inch laptop, providing a bit more room to move your fingers. There\u2019s also a fingerprint scanner to the right of the touchpad for logging into Windows 10.",
    "Similar to HP's provision of ports, the company has found a way of cramming a large keyboard and trackpad into a small body. It\u2019s a seriously impressive design feat, and means the HP Spectre x360 (2021) doesn\u2019t only look good, it feels good to use as well.",
    "Flipping the screen entirely back, using the HP Spectre x360 (2021) as a tablet-like device, the large touchscreen works well. However, while this is a thin and light laptop, compared to tablets such as the iPad, the HP Spectre x360 (2021) actually feels heavy and bulky. Having the option to use the laptop in this way is certainly welcome, but it isn't an ideal replacement for a standard tablet. The HP Spectre x360 (2021) is far more successful as a laptop.",
    "The biggest upgrade on the HP Spectre x360 (2021) over the previous model are its components and performance, with the laptop being a showcase for Intel\u2019s latest mobile processors.",
    "The review unit we were sent in for review features an Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor. This is a quad-core unit that can achieve boost speeds of up to 4.70GHz, which marks a decent leap over the Intel Core i7-1065G7 (the previous generation CPU) included in last year\u2019s model.",
    "As you can see in our Cinebench and Geekbench results, the new HP Spectre x360 (2021) delivers a lift in performance compared to last year\u2019s model, with a single-core score of 1,317 compared to the previous model\u2019s 1,259. It isn't a huge leap, but it\u2019s an increase nonetheless. The Intel Core i7-1065G7 was a pretty great mobile processor anyway, so it\u2019s good that Intel has built on its solid foundation.",
    "Overall, as a result of the new CPU, along with a hefty 16GB of RAM, the HP Spectre x360 (2021) is a great little performer, with Windows 10 feeling fast and responsive. Multi-tasking, with numerous apps open at once, alongside plenty of Edge tabs too, didn\u2019t really serve to slow down the HP Spectre x360 (2021)\u2019s performance, either.",
    "For day-to-day use, then, the HP Spectre x360 (2021) delivers the sort of performance you'd expect of a premium laptop at this price point. You certainly won\u2019t be disappointed.",
    "However, one of the biggest upgrades to come alongside the new Tiger Lake CPUs such as the Intel Core i7-1165G7 is the inclusion of Intel Iris Xe graphics. This is an integrated GPU that promises to offer vastly improved performance compared to previous integrated graphics, and could even rival some discrete GPUs.",
    "While the HP Spectre x360 (2021) certainly isn't a gaming laptop, it could feasibly run some PC games that other thin and light laptops would struggle to run. While Cyberpunk 2077 at full graphical settings isn't on that list, Intel has claimed it could play GTA 5 at over 60fps, while esports games such as Rocket League, League of Legends and CS:GO \u2013 which are less graphically demanding, but require fast performance \u2013 could be playable.",
    "So, of course, we attempted to play a few games on the HP Spectre x360 (2021). As we've mentioned, this definitely isn't a gaming laptop, but we wanted to see if it would be possible to play games at the end of the day, when you want to unwind after a hard day at work.",
    "The answer is: sort of. Total War: Three Kingdoms managed only 30fps on low settings. Anything more demanding was unplayable. We also fired up Ori and the Will of the Wisps \u2013 a visually stunning 2D platform game, which despite looking great, is less taxing than a lot of other modern games. Unfortunately, we had to drop graphical settings to low, and scale down the resolution, to achieve smooth gameplay. As such, while it was possible to play modern games such as Ori and the Will of the Wisps, it was only with big sacrifices to graphical fidelity. So, don\u2019t give up the day job, HP Spectre x360 (2021).",
    "One thing to note, is that even while performing relatively low-powered tasks, such as downloading an app, the fans of the HP Spectre x360 (2021) will kick in. In a way, it\u2019s understandable, since this is a super-thin laptop that needs to keep its components cool. However, it proved annoying, and was in sharp contrast to the silent operation of the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), which has a fanless design.",
    "One of the biggest quality of life improvements Intel is pushing with its Intel Evo platform is long battery life, and the HP Spectre x360 (2021) doesn\u2019t disappoint here. It lasted an excellent 11 hours and 22 minutes in our own battery life test, which loops a 1080p video file at 50% brightness until the battery dies.",
    "The previous HP Spectre x360 also performed well in this test, scoring 10 hours and 55 minutes. Nevertheless, the extra half an hour is welcome, and it means the more powerful components haven\u2019t come at the cost of battery life.",
    "We also ran the intensive PCMark 10 battery life test on the laptop, which replicates day-to-day use such as web browsing and video calling. Here, the HP Spectre x360 (2021) managed almost 13 hours \u2013 again, a very impressive achievement and a big leap over the previous model\u2019s four-hour result (on PCMark 8).",
    "As such, the HP Spectre x360 (2021)'s battery is nice and balanced; it's able to last equally well in both light- and medium-use cases. You\u2019ll easily get through a full work day on this laptop, which makes it an excellent tool for business users who are looking for a device that offers superb performance, fantastic looks, and won\u2019t need to be plugged in until they return home.",
