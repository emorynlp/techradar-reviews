    "Brave has both a browser and a search engine, and you can use them together or independently of one another. When using the browser, you have the option to search with Brave or use your preferred search engine. If you want to stick with the browser you\u2019re used to, you can use Brave Search from the dedicated search page.",
    "What\u2019s most important to know about Brave Search is that it\u2019s still in beta. You may choose to use it because you like its safe-browsing promises, but know that the results it returns may not be as thorough or refined as those you\u2019ll find elsewhere. If you\u2019d like to help Brave build an independent and safe browser for the future, though, you can use it to search and then give feedback to help it improve.",
    "The main Brave Search page is as basic as it gets \u2013 there\u2019s just the Brave logo, a search bar, and a link to a settings menu.",
    "If you click that Settings menu on the top-right of the search page (the three horizontal lines), you\u2019ll pull up the settings sidebar. You can make a couple of tweaks here, like changing to a dark theme and opting to open links in a new tab.",
    "By clicking \"See All Settings\" on the top-left of that sidebar, you\u2019ll open up the full settings page. Here, you can set your preferred units of measure and opt-in to getting anonymous local results and sharing anonymous usage metrics. If you want to learn more about how that information is kept anonymous, Brave has explainers here.",
    "The results page has everything you\u2019d expect:",
    "Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t have too much going on. While the Brave browser has a couple of niceties like Brave Awards, which grant you tokens for viewing ads, and a built-in Playlist for iOS users, Brave Search is still barebones. According to their FAQ section, how (and if) they\u2019ll handle ads remains to be seen, too.",
    "Brave Search doesn\u2019t track what you search for or click on, whether you\u2019re on a desktop or mobile device. And since Brave doesn\u2019t collect your data, that means it doesn\u2019t share or sell it, either.",
    "Here\u2019s are Brave Search\u2019s privacy features:",
    "When it comes to that independent search index, here\u2019s a recap of how Brave explains it. Most search engines rely on third-party indexes instead of building and using their own. Brave is building its own search index \u2026 but sometimes, it anonymously checks search results against third-party results, then mixes those results into its results page. \u201cThis mixing is a means-to-an-end toward 100% independence,\u201d Brave says. By clicking the \"Info\" link toward the top of the results page, you can see how many results came from third parties.",
    "Note that if you want the most privacy that Brave can offer, you need to pair its search functionality with the Brave browser.",
    "Brave Search functions as any search engine should. When you use the search page, you\u2019ll enter your query in the search box, and suggested searches will auto-populate. If you\u2019re using the Brave browser, you can search right from the address bar.",
    "Above you can see what a results page looks like, and it will look the same whether you\u2019re using the search page or the Brave browser.",
    "The biggest drawback of Brave Search is that it\u2019s still in beta, which means it doesn\u2019t have highly refined results for certain languages, queries, or regions. There\u2019s a feedback link on every results page, so you can tell Brave Search whether they got it right or wrong, which can help move it out of beta.",
    "Brave Search can be used via the dedicated website at search.brave.com, or it can be used with the Brave browser. If you opt to use the Brave browser, you don\u2019t have to use Brave Search \u2013 there are six other search engines that you can choose from to set as the default.",
    "Brave Search\u2019s biggest competitor is, of course, Google. Unlike Google, Brave Search doesn\u2019t track what you do or sell your information to trackers.",
    "While DuckDuckGo, another top Brave Search competitor, also has anonymous search, it doesn\u2019t use an independent search index like Brave does.",
    "How Brave manages to return relevant results without algorithms or data-tracking is a little unclear, but the way they explain it is, \u201cWe rely on anonymous community contributions to refine results and community-created alternative ranking models to ensure diversity.\u201d",
    "Brave is striving to do what other browsers won\u2019t (or can\u2019t): Make an independent search engine with reliable results, all while keeping your data totally safe. It\u2019s going to take some time, but if Brave is able to pull it off, it could end up being a contender in both the browser and search engine rings.",
    "For now, though, Brave Search is at its most basic. If you like where it\u2019s going, using it can help it get there. But we don\u2019t suggest completely replacing your go-to search engine quite yet, especially if you like having as many options as possible when it comes to query results."
