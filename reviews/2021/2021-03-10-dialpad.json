    "Dialpad is one of the world\u2019s largest VoIP service providers, with more than 70,000 customers and 11 office locations across the world. If you're shopping around for a VoIP business phone system it's worth considering, could Dialpad's VoIP services right for your team?",
    "In the following review, we take a close look at every aspect of this company, including its customer service, plans and pricing, main features, and more to help you decide whether it's the best VoIP service available for your business.",
    "Dialpad offer multiple subscription options, including VoIP-based business phone system plans, contact center solutions, video conferencing, and a sales dialer system.",
    "Most businesses will be looking for something like Dialpad\u2019s VoIP business phone systems. Prices start from $15 per user per month (with a minimum of one license) for a Standard plan. This includes unlimited calling, various call control tools, voicemail transcription, a fax add-on (for an extra cost), streamlined integrations with Google G Suite and Microsoft Office, and more.",
    "Upgrading to the Pro plan (from $25 per user per month) adds a Salesforce integration, API and webhook functionality, local number support in more than 50 countries, and more.",
    "Custom Enterprise plans are also available for large businesses, but you will have to request a quote to find out more about these.",
    "Alongside the business phone systems, there are two separate video conferencing plans (free and $15 per user per month), a sales dialer plan that costs $95 per agent per month, and a contact center plan starting from $75 per user per month.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that a 14-day free trial is available for all bar the Enterprise and video conferencing plans, enabling you to try before you buy.",
    "Dialpad provides an excellent VoIP for business service that\u2019s backed by numerous advanced features. We\u2019ve outlined a few of the most notable below.",
    "Based on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Dialpad\u2019s built-in voice intelligence features are excellent. They are designed to provide automatic call notes and transcripts, assist customer service agents in real time, and more.",
    "If you need to go above and beyond standard VoIP voice calling, Dialpad has you covered. It includes impressive audio and video conference-calling features, such as screen sharing, conference on-hold music, various user controls, and more.",
    "Finally, Dialpad enables virtual faxing directly from your desktop dashboard. You will have to purchase a fax add-on for this, but this shouldn\u2019t be too expensive\u2014although the price will vary depending on what plan you\u2019re using.",
    "To start a free trial with Dialpad, simply work through a short sign-up process. Here, you can choose a phone number, select the plan you want to use after the free trial has finished, and confirm your personal details.",
    "Note that at this stage you will have to add payment information and set up automatic billing, although this can be cancelled at any time during your trial without penalty.",
    "Download the desktop app (Windows and Mac versions available) and/or mobile app (Android and iOS) and log in to your account to get started.",
    "We trialled the Dialpad VoIP Windows desktop and web apps, and we were very impressed.",
    "For starters, the web app is simple and intuitive, if a little basic. It lets you make calls, send messages, listen to voicemail and recorded calls, and manage your contacts. The Windows app is similar, but with even more features.",
    "And finally, the web dashboard lets you view analytics, manage the program\u2019s settings, and set up your business phone system with many more features included.",
    "When you\u2019re setting up your Dialpad account, there\u2019s every chance that you will run into some sort of problems or need advice on something. If so, you can speak with the customer service team via phone, live chat, or online ticket submission. There\u2019s also an online forum where you can ask questions and browse previous conversations.",
    "On top of this, Dialpad has a comprehensive help center containing hundreds of articles, guides, video tutorials, and other self-help resources. Use the search bar at the top of the screen to find relevant information or simply browse by category.",
    "It\u2019s always nice to see transparency and openness surrounding a company\u2019s security measures, and Dialpad excels here. It provides clear information about the tools it uses to ensure your personal information and any sensitive data is kept safe at all times, and it does this well.",
    "At the simple end of the spectrum, it includes tools to enable you to define clear user permissions and access controls, manage which users have access to which integrations and features, and ensure things are being run the way they should be.",
    "In addition, all communications are fully encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) technology and AES 256-bit security. And what\u2019s more, all data is encrypted while at rest, greatly reducing the risk of hacks or data breaches.",
    "All things considered, Dialpad\u2019s security features are excellent.",
    "Dialpad provides excellent business VoIP service across the board, but there are plenty of other providers worth considering.",
    "For example, the 8x8 X Series is an excellent option for those on a tight budget. At $12 per user per month, it\u2019s only slightly cheaper than Dialpad, but even its most basic plan comes with a great range of features targeted at small business users.",
    "Another decent option is Aircall, which focuses on providing high-quality VoIP services coupled with CRM integrations. It is a little expensive, with prices starting from $30 per user per month for fairly basic service, but it still offers a lot to like.",
    "Dialpad impressed as soon as we landed on its website for the first time, and nothing changed during our review. Its included features are excellent, its services are backed by powerful security integrations, and there are versatile subscription options for businesses of all shapes and sizes.",
    "What\u2019s more, its prices are quite competitive, and most plans come with a 14-day free trial. Ultimately, we\u2019d recommend signing up for the trial and testing the platform if you\u2019re looking for a reliable, feature-rich VoIP service provider."
