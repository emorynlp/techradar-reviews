    "Voted Best OLED TV at the TechRadar Choice Awards 2021",
    "Sony certainly hasn\u2019t held back in pricing its new A90J 4K HDR OLED TV \u2013 but this 55-inch version most certainly has the performance to justify the price.",
    "Picture quality, from any source, is about as good as it currently gets from 4K screens. In every meaningful department \u2013 motion control, contrast, edge definition, detail levels, you name it \u2013 the XR-55A90J puts in a memorably accomplished shift. And for those moments when you\u2019re reduced to watching sub-4K content, it\u2019s a really adept upscaler too.",
    "The Sony A90J OLED is more than a few steps ahead when it comes to sound quality, too. Using the entire surface of the screen as a speaker is still novel and effective, and backing it up with two conventional bass drivers means the XR-55A90J sounds fuller, more direct and just, well, better than any alternative that doesn\u2019t feature an off-board sound system.",
    "Add in a smart new Google TV interface, the usual Sony standard of build and finish, feet that change position to accommodate a soundbar, an exclusive movie streaming service, and an authentically well-designed remote control \u2013 ignoring the inexplicable lack of UK TV catch-up services \u2013 and the XR-55A90J looks like the complete package. And complete packages seldom come cheap.",
    "The Sony XR-A90J range of OLED TVs is on sale now. It\u2019s available in 65-inch ($3,799 / \u00a33,499 / AU$4,999) and whopping 83-inch ($7,999 / \u00a36,999) versions, while the 55-inch version we\u2019re testing here will set you back $2,799 / \u00a32,699.",
    "This is, no two ways about it, a premium price when you consider (for instance) the LG C1 we called \u201cthe current king of TVs\u201d will set you back $1,799 / \u00a31,699 / AU$3,499 for the 55-inch model. Only the 65-inch pricing is confirmed in Australia for now.",
    "Viewed head-on, the Sony A90J OLED is exactly what you want and expect from an expensive new TV: next-to-no bezel intrusion and an awful lot of screen.",
    "The Sony A90J is an interesting case, because as well as being wall-mountable it also features feet that work in a couple of positions. They can either leave the bottom of the screen near-flush against the surface it\u2019s standing on (although it\u2019ll need to be a wide surface, as in the instance the feet are actually beyond the edges of the frame), or they can lift the screen high enough to fit a soundbar beneath it.",
    "From the side, it\u2019s OLED business as usual \u2013 which means the Sony is an impressively slim 6mm deep, but only for a little while. The rest of the time it\u2019s a touch over 4cm, because it has to keep its electronics, its speaker drivers and what-have-you somewhere. It\u2019s hardly a bloater, and will look good on the wall \u2013 but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that both LG (with its \u2018Gallery\u2019 series of OLED TVs) and Samsung (with its equally new Neo QLED MiniLED alternative) will sell you a screen that sits far flusher against a wall.",
    "On the inside, the Sony is specified to justify that price-tag. Certainly you get your money\u2019s-worth in terms of inputs and outputs: four HDMI inputs (two of which feature quite a lot of HDMI 2.1 compatibility), three USBs, an Ethernet socket, binding posts for two TV tuners and even composite video inputs should be enough to satisfy even the most demanding user. Naturally enough there\u2019s Wi-Fi connectivity too.",
    "The two most talented HDMI inputs are 4K/120Hz, ALLM and 48Gbps-enabled, and one of them can handle eARC too. There\u2019s no support for VRR as yet, though. Sony\u2019s PS5 games console doesn\u2019t support VRR as yet, either, but the competing Xbox Series X console most certainly does. It seems likely any serious Xbox gamers will gravitate towards LG\u2019s range of OLED TVs, where complete HDMI 2.1 compatibility has been the norm for quite a while now.",
    "Sony is not alone among TV manufacturers in refusing to offer every major HDR standard, though admittedly we feel the lack of HDR10+ here less than we feel the lack of Dolby Vision on some new Samsung TVs. (Philips and Panasonic, of course, don\u2019t make you choose.)",
    "The picture is handled by Sony\u2019s new XR processor, which takes the AI capability of the outgoing X1 processor and adds in something Sony calls \u201ccognitive intelligence\u201d. So (in theory, at least) you get machine-learning algorithms that enhance picture performance, plus more in-depth scene analysis across multiple zones based on the contrast, color, detail, depth of images and all of the other image components. The idea, of course, is to serve up the most lifelike and convincing images possible.",
    "On the audio side, Sony is persevering with its Acoustic Surface Audio+ arrangement. Backed up by two rear-firing low-frequency drivers, this technology uses actuators to turn the entire surface of the screen into a speaker. It\u2019s an impressive setup \u2013 and Sony\u2019s so keen on the whole concept the A90J actually features speaker connections on its rear panel in case you want to use your TV as the centre channel of a surround-sound set-up.",
    "Will anyone really lament Sony\u2019s decision to ditch Android TV in favour of Google TV as its smart interface? Certainly Google TV\u2019s implementation on the A90J makes for a more responsive and logical experience \u2013 it\u2019s altogether friendlier and more useful.",
    "As well as the obligatory Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Apple TV streaming service apps (and quite a few others), Sony\u2019s also incorporated its Bravia Core movie-streaming service into the Google TV interface. It\u2019s a genuinely worthwhile feature, with a stack of available content and the ability to stream in very high quality if your broadband is up to it \u2013 there\u2019s even some IMAX Enhanced content on there.",
    "It\u2019s just a pity that selecting an IMAX Enhanced movie doesn\u2019t automatically select the TV\u2019s \u2018IMAX Enhanced\u2019 picture mode. The Sony\u2019s set-up menus are a model of clarity, but there should really be no need to delve into them for reasons like this.",
    "UK customers will be perturbed to find no sign of iPlayer, All4, ITV Hub or any other catch-up TV service here. Sony is promising a fix that will add them \u2018later\u2019 in 2021 \u2013 but we were disappointed that LG left out these services on its 2020 screens, and we\u2019re disappointed to see the same here, even temporarily, given there\u2019s no firm date or reassurance it\u2019ll be relatively soon after launch.",
    "Navigating the Google TV interface, set-up menus and all the rest is done using a redesigned remote control handset. It feels good in the hand, isn\u2019t overburdened with buttons and even has some (very welcome) backlighting to aid visibility.",
    "It seems only polite to start the test with some content from Sony\u2019s Bravia Core streaming service \u2013 and while broadband speeds around here aren't always enough to guarantee the highest-quality \u2018Pure Stream\u2019, Ridley Scott\u2019s All the Money in the World, with its IMAX Enhanced certification, looks little short of superb.",
    "There just isn\u2019t an aspect of picture-making at which the A90J doesn\u2019t excel. It\u2019s remarkably bright by the standards of OLED TVs (LG has managed to pull off a similar trick with its \u2018evo\u2019 OLED panel \u2013 and as we all know, LG supplies raw OLED panels to every other TV brand that wants them). The Sony A90J is staggeringly detailed in any and all circumstances. The color palette from which it draws is wide, nuanced and unquestionably natural. The black tones it creates are deep and lustrous in the classic OLED manner, but they\u2019re also simply loaded with detail \u2013 allied to the crisp and equally detailed white tones the A90J serves up, contrasts are about as wide and convincing as you\u2019ll see from an OLED screen.",
    "Management of even the most testing scenes is cast-iron. Christopher Plummer\u2019s J. Paul Getty wears a classic hunting tweed during the first third of this movie, and the A90J keeps an absolute grip of the tight, high-contrast pattern \u2013 even when it\u2019s moving.",
    "In fact, the Sony proves outstanding at handling on-screen motion of any and every kind. Slow pans, fast movement, whatever \u2013 the Sony controls it and describes it without shimmer, or hesitation, or ghosting, or any of the other vices less capable TVs can indulge in.",
    "This is particularly evident when catching up with some Euro 2020 football on BBC One HD (not iPlayer, with its 4K UHD streams, sadly), where the A90J upscales the HD broadcast in a natural manner, maintaining smooth motion for the movement of the ball \u2013 even if it\u2019s moving in the opposite direction to the way the camera is panning. Huge swathes of uniform color (or \u2018the pitch\u2019, as it\u2019s sometimes called) present no problems, and even though it\u2019s doing a mighty amount of upscaling the Sony makes skin-tones and textures look life-like and detailed.",
    "If there\u2019s a more accomplished TV than this currently available at anything like this price, well, we\u2019ve yet to see it.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve been impressed by Sony\u2019s Acoustic Surface Audio+ and it seems unlikely to be the last. It\u2019s one of the very best sound systems incorporated into a television - by which we mean it\u2019s about the most convincing, most articulate and most believable-sounding television you can buy.",
    "A lot of this is down to the fact that the entire screen is contributing \u2013 it means images and sounds are married far more closely than with other systems. Where dialogue in particular is concerned, the direct nature of the audio delivery helps the cinematic feel of the presentation no end.",
    "By the standards of television audio systems, the A90J is a notably punchy and genuinely dynamic performer. It can generate actual low-frequency impact, thanks to that pair of rear-firing drivers, and is difficult for even the most explosion-happy blockbuster to fluster.",
    "But it almost goes without saying the Sony A90J\u2019s audio quality (impressive though it is by prevailing standards) doesn\u2019t really hold a candle to its picture quality. So where we normally say a good TV requires a half-decent soundbar, the Sony A90J OLED deserves a really decent one."
