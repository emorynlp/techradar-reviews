    "Resident Evil 4 VR is, simply put, the best horror game available on the Oculus Quest 2.",
    "The classic game from Capcom has been marvelously remade in virtual reality. Fans of the original will feel right at home and will adore the chance to finally explore the game\u2019s iconic locations in first-person \u2013 while newcomers to the game will be impressed by the updated graphics and textures that make you forget you\u2019re playing a game that's over a decade old.",
    "If you come to VR to be immersed, the gameplay of Resident Evil 4 VR will deliver exactly the experience you desire \u2013 the immersive item management straps essential tools to your body so you can slickly swap between and reload weapons as you battle hordes of infected brutes.",
    "And even if you\u2019re inexperienced in VR you can Resident Evil 4 out, as its comfort options are absolutely fantastic. Even over many hour-long play sessions, we didn\u2019t feel any motion sickness with the comfort options we chose.",
    "If you can handle a fright, Resident Evil 4 VR is a must-play game on the Oculus Quest 2 platform.",
    "The story of Resident Evil 4 in VR is identical to what players first experienced back in 2005 when the GameCube version of the game was released. Leon S. Kennedy \u2013 one of the protagonists from Resident Evil 2 \u2013 has been sent out on a mission to Spain in order to rescue the US President\u2019s kidnapped daughter.",
    "While searching for Ashley, Leon discovers a strange village filled with violent villagers and terrifying monsters who are being manipulated by a parasite known as Las Plagas. While on his quest Leon is injected with Las Plagas himself, turning his adventure into a race against time as the parasite fights for control of his body.",
    "The VR port doesn\u2019t just keep the story of the original game, but the core survival-horror aspects as well. You\u2019ll enter the game armed with a few basic items, a handgun, and some bullets but these won\u2019t last you long. To survive you\u2019ll have to explore areas thoroughly and be efficient with your ammo if you don\u2019t want to fall prey to the game's enemies: Los Iluminados.",
    "However, Resident Evil 4 VR does mix up the formula too, this time bringing you into an immersive first-person view. Using the touch controllers you\u2019ll be able to interact with objects in the environment like levers and doors, and you\u2019ll have to manually reload weapons as brutes are staring you down.",
    "If you want to really feel like Leon, you can play with various weapons and items attached to your body. Your handgun is at your hip, knife on your chest, and healing spray on your shoulder, giving you easy access to them as you fight for your life. The feeling is absolutely amazing, truly putting you in the shoes of this expert fighter.",
    "The only issue we faced with the gameplay was that picking up loot dropped by enemies can be clunky. Around 50% of the time, we end up grabbing a pistol magazine instead, forcing us to reload our weapon fully before it can be fired again \u2013 and in battles against overwhelming forces you really don\u2019t want to be in this situation.",
    "That really was the only issue, as the biggest bugbear players had with Resident Evil 4 \u2013 the frustrating AI companion Ashley \u2013 when it first came out has been fixed in this VR installment.",
    "Thankfully the VR remake of Resident Evil 4 gives her some much-needed buffs. Enemies now preferentially target Leon, and if they do deal damage to Ashley it\u2019s significantly less than what Leon would take. Ashley\u2019s behavior has also been changed, giving the players an easier time during segments of the game she features in.",
    "Resident Evil 4 VR is one of the most immersive yet comfortable VR games we\u2019ve played on the Oculus Quest 2.",
    "When you first boot it up you\u2019ll be given a variety of options about how you want to experience the game, starting with whether you\u2019ll be playing in a seated or standing position.",
    "Next up you\u2019ll choose your preferred style of movement. We opted for Comfort Mode which allows you to move through the world via teleportation; this choice didn\u2019t impact our immersion at all and let us tell you there is nothing scarier than teleporting around a corner straight in front of an enemy.",
    "Alternatively, VR aficionados (or those who don\u2019t get motion sick easily) might want to opt for Full Motion. This fluid experience uses analog sticks and will match up with the kind of movement players will recognize from the original Resident Evil 4 game.",
    "If you select Full Motion you\u2019ll subsequently be given the chance to alter the Tunneling, Turn Angle and Turn Style to tweak the settings to best suit your needs and reduce the effects of motion sickness.",
    "It doesn\u2019t stop there though, when you come up to the Del Lago Lake Monster fight you\u2019ll again be given different comfort options to make sure this iconic battle leaves you feeling epic rather than seasick.",
    "Last but not least we want to commend Resident Evil 4 for how it tackles its cutscenes and more acrobatic moments \u2013 like when Leon dives through a window or kicks foes. At these times the game swiftly yet smoothly transitions into a cutscene that plays in third-person then reverts back to first-person.",
    "This could have very easily felt jarring, but works incredibly well and doesn\u2019t take you out of the experience at all. To help keep you involved some of these moments \u2013 including when Leon is grabbed by an enemy or is running from a boulder \u2013 require you to move the controllers to keep you engaged with what\u2019s happening in front of you.",
    "Resident Evil 4 is an absolutely superb experience that any horror fan with an Oculus Quest 2 should add to their library as soon as they can.",
    "Everything that was great about the original game has been kept, but minor tweaks to Ashley and the new first-person perspective help to make this experience a good mix of fresh and familiar.",
    "Capcom and Oculus have also managed to perfectly blend immersion with comfort. Thanks to the care taken you can focus on feeling like an undead-slaying machine instead of feeling queasy.",
    "Whether you've been a long-time Resident Evil fan who has played everything the series has to offer (including the most recent Resident Evil Village) or you've never touched the series before, this VR entry makes for an excellent jumping-in point."
