    "Owned and operated by Seattle-based PeopleConnect, Intelius is a people search service that you can use to perform general background checks and various reverse searches. The company claims to sweep more than 20 billion records during its searches, using information from public and private sources.",
    "Besides that extensive database, Intelius is notable for its intuitive interface. Despite some slightly confusing billing practices, we consider this to be one of the best background check services. Find out more about the platform\u2019s products - which include identity theft protection and reverse phone lookup -in this Intelius evaluation.",
    "Intelius offers seven unique background search products, ranging from phone directory lookups to full-scale background checks. No matter which of these you want to use, you\u2019ll need to sign up for a long-term membership to access them.",
    "Confusingly, each plan comes with a similar monthly subscription cost, but initial trial period prices vary wildly. This means that - in some cases - you may be able to save cash by paying for a trial period, carrying out a single search, and then immediately canceling your membership.",
    "For example, if you want to perform a reverse phone search, you could pay $1.99 for a five-day trial and then cancel your membership before you are charged $29.63 for the following month. However, if you do stay subscribed to Intelius, you\u2019ll be able to perform an unlimited number of searches.",
    "Unlimited general background searches cost $22.86 per month or $19.43 per month if you sign up for two months at a time. Subscription costs are the same if you request a straightforward criminal record check.",
    "Be warned, many past customers of the company have reported that Intelius overcharges for their services. During our review, we found numerous reports stating that the platform ignored membership cancellation requests or continued to charge even after an account had been terminated.",
    "Intelius compiles data from public and private sources, including business records, FBI databases, and phone directories. Most of this information is available online, in many cases for free, but accessing it can be a real headache. The main reason people turn to Intelius is that the company can trawl through these sources of information far faster than you could independently.",
    "To start a search, enter a name and area of residence into the search field on the Intelius homepage. After that, Intelius will begin scanning through its records for your search subject. In some cases, the platform will ask you for additional information before displaying a list of potential candidates that match your query.",
    "Prior to letting you open a report on your search subject, Intelius will display a series of loading screens and prompts about potentially graphic content. However, these appear to be automatically generated and don\u2019t necessarily tell you anything about the information contained in the report.",
    "Intelius attempts to differentiate itself from other background check services through extra features and custom database sweeps. This means you shouldn\u2019t be left with a basic check that doesn\u2019t tell you what you want to know.",
    "To help you find lost family members or better understand the social network of anyone you\u2019re searching for, Intelius offers a detailed People Search report. This includes an interactive grid that shows you how a particular circle of contacts is connected.",
    "When you perform a criminal record search using Intelius, the platform will alert you to federal or state offenses associated with the subject\u2019s relatives. If you want, you can add these records to your report.",
    "A key Intelius feature is the platform\u2019s proprietary data trawling service, which it calls Premiere Search. This is essentially a database of information compiled from different public and private records. Using multiple sources ensures that your final report is as accurate as possible.",
    "Unfortunately, there\u2019s not a lot of support information available through the Intelius website. Instead of searching for an FAQ page, if you have any issues with the platform, you should get directly in touch with the company\u2019s support team over the phone or through email. Members of staff are on hand during PST working hours from Monday to Friday, so your query should be dealt with quickly.",
    "A downside to the Intelius search service is that you can\u2019t use the product to perform employment background checks. If that\u2019s the reason that you\u2019re looking for a background check service in the first place, consider using People Trail instead. Unlike Intelius, People Trail is an accredited employment screening service.",
    "Another downside of Intelius is that the service requires a monthly membership, and it isn\u2019t possible to pay for a one-time background search. A competitor service worth considering that does employ a straightforward pricing scheme is Sterling.",
    "Check out Truthfinder as well.",
    "Unique features, such as a social network viewer and alerts for offenses committed by relatives, help Intelius to stand out in the crowded background check sector. However, overall, this platform could do much better when it comes to being more transparent about pricing and making it easier for customers to cancel their memberships. Intelius also loses points for its artificial loading screens and the misleading prompts that users are subjected to when searching."
