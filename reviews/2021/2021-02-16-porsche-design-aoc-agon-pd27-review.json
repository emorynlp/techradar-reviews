    "We must give credit to monitors like the Porsche Design AOC Agon PD27 that try their best to get away from the same old angular red-on-black trope that most gaming monitors seem to abide by. In fact, partnering with Porsche \u2013 yes, that Porsche \u2013 AOC has taken it to another level, adapting elements you would find in a racing car and incorporating them in a monitor that\u2019s inherently built for speed.",
    "Not that the type of speed the Porsche Design AOC Agon PD27 delivers would require a racing roll cage, but the attempt at symbolism here is valiant \u2013 even if the design itself is probably not going to be the right fuel in everyone\u2019s tank. At the very least, it\u2019s a refreshing take on a gaming aesthetic that frankly has long needed an update.",
    "Coupled with its impressive specs and performance, the Porsche Design AOC Agon PD27 is a breathtaking gaming monitor that might just deserve a place among the best.",
    "Of course, as it almost always is with non-homogeneous releases, this 1440p display does come with a hefty price tag \u2013 though not as hefty as you might think. At $799 (\u00a3719/AU$1,101), it\u2019s actually in the mid-range, considering that many non-4K curved monitors with fast refresh rates will set you back $1,000/\u00a31,000 or more. Taking into account its specs, features, design, and performance, it\u2019s certainly a price we\u2019d be willing to pay.",
    "But back to its design\u2026 The Porsche Design AOC Agon PD27 is a 27-inch VA panel that is bigger than most gaming monitors of its size. It has a bigger footprint, yes, which shouldn\u2019t bother you unless you have a small desk, but it also feels larger than life at unboxing and perhaps a couple of days after set up.",
    "Both are mostly due to its racing roll cage-inspired stand that juts out in the back and spreads out at the bottom. That stand doesn\u2019t make it look clunky, however. AOC did a great job of keeping things sleek and classy while also sturdy and solid, much like a Porsche. It\u2019s stable enough, in fact, that it stays in place when you\u2019re swiveling and tilting it. So, it\u2019s kind of disappointing that it can only swivel 15 degrees in either direction, tilt down 4 degrees, and tilt up 21.5 degrees.",
    "Something that might also disappoint some folks is the RGB lighting. Personally, we think it\u2019s artfully done. It certainly keeps with the elegant aesthetic, illuminating the area under the monitor from the underside of the display as well as the back of the display from the top section of the stand. It\u2019s attractive and customizable via the Light FX option in the OSD menu that offers 14 different modes, 4 different patterns, and 3 different light strengths. Plus, there\u2019s also a light projecting downward that can be toggled to display either the \u201cPD\u201d logo or the name \u201cAgon.\u201d Still, it might not be immersive enough for RGB fanatics.",
    "There\u2019s a joystick on the back panel for the OSD menu, but to make the monitor\u2019s operation more seamless, or at least easier, AOC has included a sleek wireless keypad that\u2019s battery-powered. It allows access to the monitor\u2019s control panel as well as shortcuts to settings like gaming modes. It\u2019s a nice touch that certainly helps. However, it could have been designed better \u2013 the back panel is curved near the top so the keypad tilts forward whenever you\u2019re pressing those buttons.",
    "The monitor has a decently powerful set of lungs: two 5W speakers with DTS support, and they sound great enough that you might not even want separate speakers unless you\u2019re particular with your audio experience. Another great feature to mention are the several input options \u2013 two HDMI 2.0 ports and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports give users a chance to connect several devices for a seamless multi-device setup. That\u2019s on top of the USB hub for attaching accessories.",
    "With VA panels, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed great color reproduction and a higher brightness level, and the Porsche Design AOC Agon PD27 doesn\u2019t disappoint with 119% SRGB coverage, 550 nits of brightness, and a dynamic contrast ratio of 80,000,000:1. It\u2019s not DCI-P3, but unless you plan on doing some hardcore color grading and photo editing, it\u2019s more than enough for gaming and most computing tasks.",
    "Same can be said about its 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution. While we are indeed fast heading towards a world of 4K viewing, and many are already future-proofing their rigs with 4K monitors, it\u2019s not exactly necessary for gaming. So, unless you\u2019ve got all the 4K trimmings inside a souped up PC that you want to take full advantage of, 1440p is more than sharp enough for your gaming experience.",
    "Sadly, we\u2019re really only getting Vesa Certified DisplayHDR 400, which is essentially the base level for HDR certification, but it\u2019s something at least.",
    "The Porsche Design AOC Agon PD27 proves that slow VA panels with poor viewing angles are a thing of the past. Besides its 240Hz refresh rate, this monitor also boasts a 0.5ms MPRT response time and a viewing angle of 178/178. Naturally, it\u2019s also taking advantage of that VA panel to go for the curve with an impressively deep 1000R \u2013 something that only officially came out in 2020 \u2013 that works really well with this monitor\u2019s 27-inch size.",
    "These excellent specs are well-reflected in its performance. Red Dead Redemption 2 is incredibly smooth and has no glaring issues of latency or stuttering, even at Ultra settings. Better yet, the whole game looks glorious on it, with great colors and sharp image quality. That 1000R curvature is incredibly effective at making the gaming experience immersive \u2013 it draws you in, making everything else around you just fade away, which really helps you focus on the game. Same is true when playing with Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and that\u2019s also with everything turned all the way up.",
    "There may be tiny stuttering here and there (though hardly noticeable especially when you\u2019re focused on your game), but when its FreeSync Premium Pro support is turned on, it does an awesome job of eliminating those as well.",
    "This being a fast monitor, we naturally tested it with our favorite fast-paced game, Rocket League. It comes as no surprise that on it, the game is smooth as butter, clean and crisp without any signs of ghosting despite all the fast and erratic movements that are intrinsic to the gameplay. And, the colors are just as vibrant and stunning, making it an ideal monitor to play this game on."
