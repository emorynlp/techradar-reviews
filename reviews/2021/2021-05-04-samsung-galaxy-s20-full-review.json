  "summary": "5G, a 120Hz display and more debut on the Galaxy S20",
  "verdict": "The Samsung Galaxy S20 isn\u2019t the most cutting-edge of Samsung\u2019s S20 lineup \u2013 that honor goes to the Galaxy S20 Ultra \u2013 but it\u2019s still a powerful phone with an ergonomic and attractive design, and the introduction of new features like 5G, the 120Hz display and upgraded rear cameras make it an outstanding handset in its own right.",
  "pros": [
    "A truly fantastic display",
    "Strong camera performance",
    "Lots of power and 5G-ready"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Price is higher, especially for 5G",
    "Erratic fingerprint scanner",
    "Doesn\u2019t support all 5G networks"

    "The Samsung Galaxy S20 has us asking 'what happened to the Galaxy S11?' Samsung skipped a few numbers for the Galaxy S20, which took over the flagship mantle from 2019\u2019s Galaxy S10. While it may be a confusing jump, there\u2019s good reason for it, as Samsung has packed a lot in: it's a massive upgrade, especially if you\u2019re keen to get your first 5G phone.",
    "The Galaxy S20 is cheaper, and easier to handle, than its siblings the Galaxy S20 Plus and gargantuan Galaxy S20 Ultra, but that doesn\u2019t mean this is a cheap or low-spec device. To the contrary, it's got most of the top-tier flagship elements of its pricier and larger siblings but at the lowest price \u2013 until you get to the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (Fan Edition), which makes even more compromises.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S20 is no longer the newest Galaxy S flagship from the company though, as the Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra have now been launched and are all available to buy. We've put all three of the latest phones through full reviews and they're both top phones, as you'd expect.",
    "Rumours are already swirling about the Samsung Galaxy S22 as well meaning this phone could feel even older soon, although there\u2019s no confirmation of a release date just yet.",
    "Not only that, but the Samsung Galaxy S21 actually has a lower launch price than the Samsung Galaxy S20 did - so you might want to consider the newer phone instead. Of course, you'll be able to pick the S20 up at a discount now, and the older phone is actually better in some ways. In any case, it's worth checking out our Samsung Galaxy S21 review before buying either.",
    "As for the Samsung Galaxy S20, you get the following: a 6.2-inch screen with a fast 120Hz refresh rate, 5G download speeds (where available), high-spec cameras on both sides of the phone, and a big battery to boot.",
    "This is the phone to get if you want to try out the 2020 tech that Samsung has to offer, but you don\u2019t want a large phone, or a large dent in your wallet. You could go for the Ultra if you want more storage or a 108MP camera, and can stretch to the price tag, but for day-to-day use the S20 is going to be the best choice in the range for most people.",
    "Under the hood is a powerful chipset, either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 or Exynos 990 (where you live will determine which you\u2019ll get) as well as either 8GB or 12GB of RAM, depending on whether you buy the 4G or 5G phone. And some people will only be able to buy the 5G phone \u2013 you can read on below to find out which versions are available in your region.",
    "The camera is another highlight of the Galaxy S20, with Samsung boosting a lot of specs on the rear array. All three main cameras have been improved (including increased pixel sizes to improve night time photography by allowing more light in), and there are also a few software tweaks to improve the overall experience.",
    "The telephoto lens is even better than the one on the Galaxy S10 too, allowing you to shoot high-quality 3x optical zoom shots or stretch all the way to a 30x digital zoom. The Galaxy S20 Ultra has higher camera specs overall, but most people will be more than satisfied with the shooter on this phone.",
    "Another highlight of the Galaxy S20 is its 4,000mAh battery. It\u2019s larger than the cell in the S10, and we\u2019ve found the battery life to be strong with typical use \u2013 this phone isn\u2019t going to last you much longer than one day of normal use, but what smartphone does?",
    "The expanded capacity has had one negative consequence: it\u2019s squeezed out the headphone jack. It's the same story with the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra, and it's the first time Samsung has dropped the feature from its S range.",
    "The Galaxy S20 is missing some of the top-end features that the Galaxy S20 Ultra is showing off, let alone the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but it\u2019s more affordable, and easier to hold or store in your pocket, and while it may not be the most impressive device from Samsung in 2020, or as up to date as Samsung's 2021 phones, it\u2019s a powerful handset that will more than satisfy most who buy it.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S20 will likely be reduced in the Black Friday deals so it\u2019s worth looking at the best phone Black Friday deals out there. We\u2019ll be conducting a re-review in the future. However, we\u2019ve updated references within our review to highlight new features that have emerged since our tests to give you a better idea of what you might be buying.",
    "Brace yourself: you\u2019re going to pay more for the Galaxy S20 than the Galaxy S10 due to its 5G upgrade, improved cameras and larger 6.2-inch 120Hz display.",
    "In the US, UK and Australia the Galaxy S20 5G price at launch was $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,499 for the version with 128GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. You can add extra storage with a microSD card up to 1TB, but if you want 256GB or 512GB of internal storage you\u2019ll have to buy the S20 Ultra.",
    "The phone is also available in a 4G version in some markets, including the UK, Australia and UAE, priced at \u00a3799 / AU$1,349 / AED 3,199 for 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.",
    "If you live in the US, you'll only be able to get a 5G variant unless you're willing to import the device. We've used the 5G variant for the purpose of this review, but if you wanted to opt for the cheaper 4G version (if it's available where you live) the specs are largely the same aside from connectivity.",
    "That 4G phone aside, the addition of 5G means you're paying more for2020's base model than for the base-model S10. In the US at least, the flagship inherits the Galaxy S10 Plus launch price \u2013 $100 more than the base-model S10. It also matches the $999 iPhone 11 Pro launch cost in the US, although Apple\u2019s phone has a smaller 5.8-inch display, and that price gets you just 64GB of storage.",
    "All phones go down in price over time though, and the Samsung Galaxy S20 is no exception - while Samsung still charges full price, other retailers often sell it at a discount.",
    "It's likely to start dropping a lot more soon too, as the Samsung Galaxy S21 has now gone on sale. Though interestingly that new phone actually has a lower launch price (of $799 / \u00a3769 / AU$1,249) than the Galaxy S20, and is in some ways a spec downgrade.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S20 is a little trickier to track down now the Galaxy S21 is out there with Samsung no longer stocking it directly. Many retailers are also focusing on the S21 now meaning refurbished hardware may be your only option.",
    "That makes the choice of which to buy more confusing than usual - we'd be inclined to say that it's no longer worth paying full price for the Samsung Galaxy S20, but at even slightly less than the Galaxy S21 costs it could be worth considering.",
    "The Samsung S20 has a 6.2-inch display, offering exactly 0.1-inch more screen real estate than 2019\u2019s 6.1-inch S10. It doesn\u2019t dramatically change the overall size of the phone, and its max resolution remains the same as that of recent Samsung Galaxy S models at WQHD+ (3040 x 1440).",
    "Samsung is still offering a default resolution of Full HD+ (2220 x 1080), which looks more than sharp enough for most tasks, and saves battery; you\u2019ll need to head into the settings to switch to the higher resolution. A big upgrade for the Galaxy S20 is the maximum 120Hz refresh-rate display. This is double the rate at which the display refreshes on most phones, including previous Samsung devices, and what it means in practice is smoother scrolling and animations.",
    "This is particularly pertinent when you\u2019re mobile gaming as it allows for a more immersive experience and could even give you the edge over an opponent, but it makes everyday things like scrolling through your social media feeds look smoother too.",
    "This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen this on a smartphone - both the Asus ROG Phone 2 and Razer Phone 2 feature similar tech - but this is arguably the first time we\u2019ve seen it on a mainstream device.",
    "The new 120Hz refresh rate isn\u2019t WQHD+-compatible though meaning you have to pick whether you want the higher resolution display or the faster loading picture.",
    "Touch-sensitivity is also upped, to 240Hz from 120Hz to make games more responsive, by sensing your finger brushes on the screen at a much higher rate than previously. This isn\u2019t something we found noticeable when we were using the phone, but those more dedicated to their mobile gaming may find that it makes a difference.",
    "We know an increase in screen size might be off-putting for some (there\u2019s pent-up demand for smaller one-hand-friendly phones), and we have good news and bad news about that. First the good news: while the S20 is taller than the S10, it\u2019s also a little narrower, with a 20:9 aspect ratio, and the screen is only marginally bigger.",
    "Here\u2019s the bad news: there\u2019s no Galaxy S10e sequel (that was the smallest, and cheapest, of the S20 range) to offer those with smaller hands a 5.8-inch display size.",
    "The S20 is as small as Samsung\u2019s 2020 S phones get, and while we appreciate the smaller front-facing camera punchole and return of HDR10+ to the display for punchier and more detailed images when gaming and watching movies, a bit of screen size diversity would be even more welcome.",
    "The Galaxy S20 has one of the best screens available on a smartphone right now, and if you\u2019re after a top-end phone screen that doesn\u2019t overwhelm your pocket you\u2019re sure to like the 563 pixels per inch this phone offers.",
    "The rest of the Samsung Galaxy S20 sports a familiar look, with two pieces of glass sandwiching an aluminum frame. There\u2019s still a curve to the right and left edges of the screen, but it\u2019s not as pronounced as on the S10, which will hopefully mean fewer accidental presses along the edges of the display.",
    "The S20 phones are the first in the S range not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. That means you\u2019ll have to use an adapter (which isn\u2019t included in the box) with your current 3.5mm wired headphones, or get a pair with a USB-C connection.",
    "This is the case with a lot of flagship phones now, and while it may disappoint some, the feature is less of a deal-breaker with more and more of us using wireless and true-wireless headphone and earbuds \u2013 and of course Samsung has you covered with its own Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds Plus.",
    "The rear of the phone is made of glass, but it feels more premium than ever. The raised camera bump is our main pain point, but it\u2019s something that Samsung has had to do in order to include all that camera tech. It does mean the phone will rock from side to side if you place it flat on a surface though.",
    "There are five Galaxy S20 colors in total, but not all of these are available in every market. The options are Cloud Blue (the handset pictured most in this review), Cosmic Gray, Cloud Pink, Cloud White and Aura Red.",
    "Those in the US and Australia are only able to choose from the Cosmic Gray, Cloud Blue and Cloud Pink options at launch, but you may also be able to find the others at a later date. Those in the UK are able to get all three colors above, and the Cloud White version came to that market at a later date.",
    "It\u2019s worth pointing out that there aren\u2019t any bold color choices here, and these are all relatively subdued options compared to the Galaxy S10 color range. The Aura Red is perhaps the boldest color choice, but that's one of the harder to find versions of the handset.",
    "As on the S10 range, the fingerprint scanner is embedded in the display. We found this to be faster and more reliable than the option on the Galaxy S10, but it isn\u2019t perfect with us regularly having to retry our digits on the reader to be able to access the phone.",
    "This isn\u2019t a major issue, but if you want to quickly unlock your phone you may want to bear in mind that in our experience a quick PIN code entry can sometimes be quicker than using the scanner.",
    "Samsung has made some important steps forward with the camera setup on the Galaxy S20 when you compare it to the Galaxy S10, but not all of the improvements are reflected in the stats you see in the spec list.",
    "We think it\u2019s best if you take the plethora of number-heavy camera specs with a pinch of salt, and instead consider what they mean in terms of the photos you can capture. Otherwise the S20 cameras could look like a downgrade compared to previous Samsung devices, and that\u2019s far from the case.",
    "The main camera, which remains 12MP, has an f/1.8 aperture. That\u2019s theoretically inferior to the S10\u2019s f/1.5 + f/2.4 dual aperture, which changes to suit the lighting conditions with the \u2018wider\u2019 f/1.5 setting pulling in more light for improved low-light shots.",
    "However, Samsung has increased the size of individual pixels here, from 1.4 microns to 1.8 microns. Combined with the larger sensor, you should be able to capture more detail and more light with the Galaxy S20\u2019s main snapper, and we found that to be the case when shooting in darker scenarios.",
    "There\u2019s also a new 64MP telephoto camera, which may sound like a huge upgrade over last year\u2019s 12MP telephoto camera. Here the individual pixels are smaller than last year\u2019s camera, but the megapixel count is far higher and the aperture is wider (f/2.0 instead of f/2.4 \u2013 smaller numbers are better).",
    "It\u2019s a positive result overall, allowing for 3x lossless zoom that\u2019s the best we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone so far. There\u2019s also 30x digital zoom if you need it, and while this isn\u2019t lossless we found it to be useful in some scenarios.",
    "Below you can see our examples of the zoom in action:",
    "If you need the ultimate in zoom capability the Galaxy S20 Ultra comes with a game-changing 100x zoom, but it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll find much use for that in everyday shooting, and we found 30x to be more than enough.",
    "The Galaxy S20\u2019s 12MP ultra-wide camera has changed the least compared to the S10 \u2013 the f/2.2 aperture is the same, but it has a smaller sensor with larger pixels (1.4 microns over last year\u2019s 1 micron). That makes your ultra-wide photos a touch better, even if the S10 had a 16MP ultra-wide camera.",
    "We found all the cameras to work brilliantly well, and if you\u2019re shooting in the automatic mode you\u2019re sure to be impressed with the results. You can see some of the shots we\u2019ve taken below:",
    "The Galaxy S20 Plus and Ultra both have a time of flight sensor that is missing from this phone. Even without it, the S20 is well capable of taking some fantastic-looking photos.",
    "The S20 range also breaks new ground with the introduction of 8K video recording, and anti-roll correction (up to 60 degrees) as part of Samsung\u2019s Super Steady stabilization feature.",
    "You can\u2019t, however, use both this higher resolution and Samsung\u2019s advanced stabilization tech at the same time \u2013 Super Steady is still strictly a 1080p affair (it doesn\u2019t even work in 4K).",
    "While 8K recording is limited to 24fps, it has one big benefit: you\u2019re able to crop and edit videos without sacrificing quality if you\u2019re exporting to 4K or 1080p.",
    "8K is a feature that\u2019s still in its infancy on smartphones, and we imagine that most people will be happy shooting at 4K or below, where you get more control over frames per second, 20x video zoom (8K is stuck at 6x zoom), and smaller files (8K footage will eat about 600MBs per minute in the HEVC format).",
    "If you do decide to shoot in 8K, you can hit the camera button when you're recording to take a 33MP still image. This should be useful if you want a high-quality snap while you're already filming video.",
    "Samsung\u2019s robust-yet-easy-to-use camera app continues to be the best among smartphones, thanks to new and returning features. We continue to like the fact that you can swipe anywhere on the screen to flip between the front and back cameras, make a hand gesture to trigger the selfie camera timer, and double-press the physical lock button to blindly launch the camera app.",
    "New here is Single Take mode, which cycles through all three rear cameras over the course of 10 seconds to capture a variety of photos and videos. It answers the \u2018Should I take photos or a video?\u2019 dilemma with \u2018Why not take both?\u2019",
    "You end up with photos, ultra-wides, portraits, hyperlapse video, regular video, and so on, and we\u2019re big fans of this feature \u2013 not every shot or clip is perfect, but it kept us out of the settings menus and more engaged with what we were trying to snap, and it changed the way we shot photos.",
    "The Galaxy S20 is the best first chance for mainstream consumers to get 5G on their smartphone. Only 1% of smartphones that shipped in 2019 were 5G phones, and most of those were expensive variants of 4G flagships.",
    "The S20 is largely 5G by default \u2013 as mentioned, in some markets you can buy a 4G version of the phone, but 5G is the norm, and download speeds will hover at around 200Mbps on average, 6x greater than 4G speeds in some parts of the world.",
    "This does, of course, depend on 5G being available in your area from your provider, but even if it isn\u2019t yet, Samsung is baking in the future-proofed connectivity.",
    "There\u2019s an important distinction between the 5G capabilities of the Galaxy S20 on one hand, and the S20 Plus and Ultra on the other. While all three support the low-to-mid-band sub-6 technology, only the Plus and Ultra have mmWave antennas, which pull down even faster speeds.",
    "The range of mmWave is limited \u2013 so you\u2019ll need to be relatively close to a transmitter in order to get a signal \u2013, but we were already getting 1.4Gbps in May 2019 when we tested mmWave 5G in Chicago on Verizon\u2019s newly rolled-out 5G network, using a different device.",
    "So while the S20 is fast (although we\u2019ve not yet been able to hook up to a 5G connection while testing the phone, so we\u2019ve not been able to run our own speed tests), its bigger siblings will be faster if your carrier supports mmWave.",
    "Sub-6 speeds should be good enough for most people \u2013 although Verizon customers in the US should note that it\u2019s an mmWave-exclusive carrier, and so the S20 won\u2019t be sold at Verizon stores.",
    "The Galaxy S20 is powered by one of two different chipsets, and where you live will decide which version you\u2019re getting. If you\u2019re in the US you\u2019ll get Qualcomm\u2019s top-end Snapdragon 865 chipset, while those around the rest of the world get Samsung\u2019s similarly high-end Exynos 990.",
    "This review is based on our time with the Exynos 990 version of the phone. We\u2019ve yet to fully test the Snapdragon 865 version of the S20, but we have tested the Galaxy S20 Plus running that chip and we had no complaints.",
    "As to the Exynos 990-powered S20, we\u2019ve experienced outstanding performance throughout our testing. It\u2019s powerful enough to do everything we need it to, whether that\u2019s playing games or loading apps quickly.",
    "On Geekbench 5, the Exynos 990 version of the phone averaged a multi-core score of 2699. That\u2019s quite a bit below the Exynos 990 Galaxy S20 Plus, which scored 3034, and the Snapdragon 865-powered S20 Ultra, which scored 3286.",
    "The S20 is scoring far higher than the S10 5G from 2019, which returned an average result of 2197, and the OnePlus 7T Pro, which scored 2584. These scores won\u2019t mean a lot for the average user, but it\u2019s a positive result for the Galaxy S20, and we found that it was reflected in day to day use.",
    "The 5G variant of the phone we tested comes with 12GB of RAM. It may be that some tasks will run a little slower on the 4G version, as that only has 8GB of RAM, but plenty of flagships \u2018only\u2019 offer 8GB, and we\u2019d still expect strong performance from that phone.",
    "We haven\u2019t encountered any issues with the power on tap in the Galaxy S20, but when we\u2019re able to properly test the Snapdragon 865 version of the device we\u2019ll be sure to update this review with our findings.",
    "The Galaxy S20 runs Android 10 as standard, with an upgrade to Android 11 now possible. Samsung\u2019s own One UI is overlaid, so it\u2019ll look different to the software you may have used on other Android phones that aren\u2019t made by Samsung, but the design is attractive and it\u2019s easy to use.",
    "Samsung includes a lot of its own apps on the device, but if you don\u2019t want these on your phone you can delete most of them and stick with Google\u2019s own pre-loaded options.",
    "You\u2019re limited to just 128GB of storage on the Galaxy S20 \u2013 there isn\u2019t a more capacious option. This should be more than enough space for the average user, but if you\u2019re planning to shoot lots of 4K video you\u2019ll likely want to make use of the microSD card slot.",
    "The Galaxy S20 supports cards up to 1TB \u2013 if you need even more internal storage, you\u2019ll want to opt for the Galaxy S20 Ultra or Galaxy S20 Plus that offer 256GB and 512GB options.",
    "If there\u2019s one thing we know about 5G it\u2019s that the super-fast internet technology is a battery hog, and with that in mind Samsung has equipped the Galaxy S20 with a 4,000mAh power pack, a notable increase over the 3,400mAh capacity on the S10.",
    "That\u2019s certainly paid off, as we\u2019ve found the Galaxy S20 to have solid battery life that will easily see you through a full day of typical use \u2013 in fact we\u2019d often get home after a day of what we\u2019d consider to be fairly heavy use to find the phone still had 20% or so left in the tank.",
    "There was the odd occasion where we noticed the battery life was being drained quickly, but that was with particularly intensive use \u2013 for example when we were using the phone with a high brightness and the 120Hz refresh rate turned on, so if you\u2019re taking full advantage of the screen tech on offer here you might not want to stray too far from your charger.",
    "Samsung\u2019s fast-charging feature works well \u2013 if you have the right charger setup you can get from zero to 100% in under an hour. There\u2019s also 15W wireless charging on offer, and while it\u2019s not as fast as the wired variety it\u2019s always a useful option to have.",
    "Like last year\u2019s S10 handsets, the S20 range features Samsung\u2019s reverse wireless charging feature, which enables you to use your S20 to charge other gadgets that support Qi charging.",
    "For example, if you have a pair of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless buds you\u2019ll be able to charge these on the back of your phone, and you could also lend your juice to a friend\u2019s compatible phone, although note that this will drain your own battery particularly quickly.",
