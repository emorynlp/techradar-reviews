    "The Scuf Impact is an exemplary PS4 controller with just one issue: the price. Like all \u201cpro\u201d style controllers, it\u2019s a significant investment - starting at \u00a3134.99 (roughly $188) - about as much as you might pay for a second-hand PS4 console. With a pad.",
    "You probably wouldn\u2019t buy a Scuf Impact on a whim, but we can\u2019t help but like it.",
    "The \u201cImpact\u201d series is where Scuf strays a little further from the PS4 DualShock and Xbox pad blueprint. Its outline is larger than either, but makes the rear paddle controls feel so natural it\u2019s as if gamepads have had paddles as standard since 2001.",
    "All the buttons are high-quality. The analog sticks don\u2019t stick (in our experience), the triggers have a short clicky action for a faster response. And while the D-pad does not feel custom made for Street Fighter tournaments, Scuf sells a Control Disc accessory that should improve the feel of those rolling special move gestures.",
    "Unlike the controller itself, a Control Disc only costs a few dollars.",
    "There are no issues with latency, the number of Scuf Impact permutations is dizzying thanks to all the customization options when you buy. This is not an excessively modular pad, so you need to make those decisions pretty carefully. You can, however, remove and replace the analog stick caps using a little tool supplied in the box.",
    "The Scuf Impact is a brilliant third-party gamepad, one that offers quality at least on-par with a first-party pad, but enough changes to make it seem an evolution of the DualShock 4. One that makes sense too.",
    "We can\u2019t go as far as to call the Scuf Impact a great deal, but that comes with the territory of an enthusiast gamepad.",
    "Some high-end pads ask you to accept a tough reality, that you pay more for first-party and yet get fewer features. That is not the case here.",
    "The Scuf Impact mirrors virtually everything in a DualShock 4, and then adds some extras. There are dual vibration motors, the Touch Bar and the light bar on the back. The Scuf Impact has a built-in speaker, headset jack and motion controls.",
    "This is a wireless pad too, making it a controller that matches the first-party one at each point.",
    "The shape and paddles are two primary reasons to buy a Scuf Impact instead of saving $100 and buying a DualShock 4.",
    "Scuf makes pads that emulate the style of the PS4 DualShock and the Xbox pad. These are the Infinity and Prestige lines.",
    "Impact broadens the width of the pad, and alters the angle of the grips a little. You could say it suits bigger hands, or that it\u2019s made for a surer grip. Those are valid observations, but our takeaway is the shape was chosen with trigger use in mind.",
    "The Scuf Impact has four triggers on the back, doubling up the ways to \u2018press\u2019 the pad\u2019s face buttons. These feel great, given enough room to allow the plastic paddles to curve outwards, rather than being crammed into a limited space between the grips\u2019 own contours.",
    "The paddles are removable. They are simple pieces of plastic you can twist out after pushing them up from their locked position. But the roominess of the Impact pad design means we don\u2019t feel we need to, even when using the face buttons instead.",
    "A paddle press also requires a reasonable amount of pressure from, most likely, the side of your middle finger, so you don\u2019t end up activating them accidentally. The paddles press into tiny micro buttons on the back of the Scuf Impact.",
    "After switching from a DualShock 4 our first two impressions were that a) the Scuf Impact\u2019s paddles feel great and that b) your hands seem further apart. If you want a petite controller, you don\u2019t want an Impact.",
    "Scuf isn\u2019t out to offer a small, dainty controller with the Impact. And you can make it a much grippier pad than the DualShock 4 or DualSense by choosing the \u201cHigh Performance\u201d grip when you buy.",
    "The Impact comes with a standard textured hard plastic surface on the back, but the High Performance option replaces this with a layer of embossed rubber.",
    "It\u2019s probably a good add-on if you play a lot of competitive games.",
    "There are a load of other tweaks too. Scuf lets you choose from 62 faceplates. The one seen here is called Energon.",
    "You can get concave or convex analog stick caps. There are short and long sticks, and they come in seven colors. Even the mounting rings around the sticks can be a completely different shade if you like. And the buttons come in 18 colors.",
    "We don\u2019t think this Frankenstein\u2019s monster stuff is as important as the quality of the Impact controller itself, of course, but what you see here is just one of the series\u2019s many, many faces.",
    "There are two options you need to think a bit more about. The first is EMR. This lets you re-map the paddles to emulate different face buttons.",
    "You put the little EMR magnets in position on the back, hold down one of the triggers and press a face button. That includes D-Pad directions and the L3/R3 inputs you get by pressing down an analog stick.",
    "Our Scuf Impact doesn\u2019t have EMR, so our triggers are locked to mimic the four standard buttons.",
    "Trigger style is one of the other Impact elements to consider. Scuf offers three types. There\u2019s a standard trigger setup, an adjustable hair trigger -which is probably the best all-around option - and what we have here, Scuf\u2019s Digital Tap Trigger.",
    "These make your triggers and bumpers feel more like mouse clickers than traditional trigger buttons. The \u2018clonk\u2019 of a trigger is replaced by a much lighter \u2018click\u2019, and this is great for fast reaction FPS games as you can press the thing much more rapidly.",
    "After an hour or so we didn\u2019t miss the darker feel of a normal trigger either. These things feel good, but are ultimately far more limited as there\u2019s no graduated input. If you want to play a racing or flight sim game, where the trigger acts as a throttle, it\u2019ll be at 0 or 100 \u2014 all of that fine-grain control is removed.",
    "Buy a digital trigger Impact controller and it becomes a pad best suited for FPS titles only.",
    "There are \u2018short\u2019 and \u2018long\u2019 analog sticks too. This is something you choose when you buy, as you don\u2019t get two sets in the box.",
    "Buy a replacement set separately and it\u2019s fairly easy to swap them around. A little bundled tool lets you remove the securing ring around the outside, after which you can pull the caps off.",
    "However, unlike the Trustmatser eSwap Pro this is not a truly modular system. You replace the caps, not the inner workings.",
    "We\u2019re not sure how well the Scuf sticks will fare after a year of regular use, as their upper rubbery covering is quite gummy. This feels pretty good, offering plenty of resistance and a softer-than-most surface. But you can feel some slight movement in this gummy rubber during the heat of the action, suggesting it may wear more quickly than a DualShock 4 stick. This seems to be a reasonably common complaint.",
    "The Scuf Impact makes a great all-rounder and FPS game controller. But what about fighting games?",
    "Its D-Pad uses the same style as a DualShock 4. The four buttons are separate islands in the pad surround. Their corners are rounded, making 180-degree gestures across them more comfortable than, say, they would be on an Xbox Series X pad.",
    "And perhaps our trusty DualShock 4 buttons have become a little slick over the years, but those same motions also feel smoother here than on a first-party pad.",
    "We\u2019re not convinced this is a world-class D-pad, though. The actuation response of the \u2018down\u2019 button is greater than that of the \u2018up\u2019. Still, it\u2019s one of the better non-specialized pads for one-on-one fighters we\u2019ve used. And Scuf offers a Control Disc accessory that increases the area of the D-pad and turns its surface into a rubbery plate.",
    "That is the only criticism we have about the SCUF Impact\u2019s button feel, though. The face buttons, the analog stick depress clickers and the triggers all feel great.",
    "The SCUF Impact is a wireless controller. Much like a DualShock 4, you can use it with phones and PCs as well as the PS4. And it has a microUSB port for wired use, one with a plastic perimeter wall around it to avoid socket damage.",
    "Its battery lasts around 7-8 hours off a charge in our experience, although that figure will drop if you play titles with a lot of rumble effects.",
    "Using the SCUF Impact in 2021 it feels like time for Scuf to make the jump to USB-C. But, hey, it\u2019s a PS4 controller, not a PS5 one.",
    "We didn\u2019t have a PS5 to test the pad with. However, it should also work with the newer console, albeit without the added features of a DualSense pad, therefore unsuitable for PS5-specific games.",
    "We also tried plugging it into an Xbox Series X and, unsurprisingly, it didn\u2019t work. It\u2019ll charge, but that\u2019s it.",
    "You want a serious pad for FPS games FPS players are probably the top SCUF Impact demographic. This pad has great paddle controls, the option of ultra-fast digital triggers, and we find the Impact\u2019s shape comfortable longer sessions.",
    "You want to make a pad your own Scuf offers stacks of customization options when you buy an Impact. These affect not just how it looks, but how the triggers and sticks feel. So we've only actually reviewed one of the many iterations of the Impact line.",
    "You are a price-conscious We\u2019re not sure a Scuf Impact is the best buy if money is tight. The starting cost is high enough but add color, grips or advanced triggers and the price starts to rise even higher. Spending this much on a pad for a last-generation console is probably a bit of an ask for many.",
    "You want a pad for PS5 We don\u2019t recommend buying a Scuf Impact for a PS5, rather than a PS4. While it will connect and work for PS4 games, you need a DualSense for PS5 games as it has a bunch of features not present in an Impact pad."
