  "summary": "The underrated middle child",
  "verdict": "The iPad Air 3 (2019) has serious horsepower hidden behind its laminated screen and uses Apple\u2019s excellent Smart Keyboard for proper 2-in-1 for productivity. Its traditional design and first-gen Apple Pencil compatibility make it look dated, but it doubles the performance of the entry-level iPad 9.7. The \u2018Air\u2019 revival is a potential Back to School winner this year.",
  "pros": [
    "Brilliant-looking laminated screen",
    "Cheapest Smart Keyboard iPad",
    "Fast charges via Lightning-to-USB-C"

  "cons": [
    "Uses the 1st Gen Apple Pencil",
    "Traditional design doesn't wow",
    "Two speakers instead of four"

    "The iPad Air is the awkward, destined-to-be-underrated middle child of Apple\u2019s tablet lineup.",
    "No, it\u2019s not as cute as the baby, the 7.9-inch iPad mini, and its traditional looks make it a wallflower compared to the head-turning premium iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9. It took us a few days of testing to realize why it\u2019s still important in 2019.",
    "That's doubly the case given the iPad Air 4, launched a year after the Air 3, is much more akin to an iPad Pro in design and specifications. Apple is clearly trying to steer the Air line away from its 'underrated middle child' status, and the iPad Air 3 is the last relic of the old ways.",
    "You might find the iPad Air 3 - and other members of Apple's tablets line - discounted over Prime Day on June 21. During the event we'll report on all the good deals to help you save some cash.",
    "Over time, we found the iPad Air 3 is the iPad for people who want 'a little more' than what the entry-level iPad 9.7 offers. It has a superior 10.5-inch display with thinner bezels, a faster chipset that matches the power in the iPhone XS, and a higher-resolution front-facing camera.",
    "You have new options for an Air compared to its predecessor: it has larger storage configurations, compatibility with the excellent Apple Smart Keyboard cover, and performance numbers double those of the iPad 9.7. It\u2019s a wholly better 2-in-1 productivity tool and a winner for Back to School shoppers.",
    "We\u2019re still left with wanting more. When we tested the device it ran iOS 12, which remains fairly limiting for Apple\u2019s post-PC \u2018computer\u2019 pitch. The supports multitasking, sure, but too often we found a MacBook better for handling moderately complex workflows. It also only works with the first-gen Apple Pencil, not the magnetic second-gen Pencil, and that optional Smart Keyboard doesn\u2019t light up like a MacBook keyboard. That makes it hard to type in the dark.",
    "iPads have traditionally run on the same iOS as iPhones, but after we tested the iPad Apple released its own offshoot operating system, called iPadOS. We haven't tested iPadOS on this iPad, but we have used it on other tablets, where it works a treat.",
    "This new operating system helps turn iPads from large iPhones into impressive mac-esque work stations, with functions like gesture controls and improved markups. Check out our iPadOS hub for everything you need to know about the new operating system.",
    "More than anything, the iPad Air 3 (2019) is a repackaged version of the iPad Pro 2017 Apple has stopped selling. It's nearly identical in looks and solid 10-hour battery life. Only it has a serious internal specs bump and addresses our main reservation of the otherwise likable Pro: it finally has a palatable price.",
    "You can look at it as the awkward middle child of Apple's iPad lineup, but it's also the cheapest iPad with real power and 2-in-1 functionality. Meaning, come Back to School season, it may have the last laugh.",
    "Update: iPadOS 15, the newest version of Apple's iPad-focused software, is coming to the iPad Air 3 towards the end of 2021. It brings changes to multitasking, improved widgets that you can put in different places around the home screen, and improved note-taking with the Apple Pencil.",
    "The iPad Air (2019) release date was Monday, March 25, following a subdued, very-out-of-character announcement via an Apple press release on Monday, March 18.",
    "Its price is a complicated selling point. It costs less than the iPad Pro 10.5 (2017) at launch, but priced the same as this two-year-old Pro tablet if you consider current sales. Is there any difference between the two? Kind of. The Air has better internal specs and has eSIM support, but only two speakers compared to the old Pro\u2019s four.",
    "The iPad 9.7 (2018) is the real competition \u2013 still on sale everywhere. It costs $329 (\u00a3319, AU$469), and we saw it drop to $229 during Black Friday 2018. It was such a good deal, I bought two for my parents, though I find it to be more of a read, not write-focused tablet. The same applies to the new pint-sized iPad mini (2019), starting at $399 (\u00a3399, AU$599).",
    "The iPad Pro 11 and 12.9, on the other end of the spectrum, start at $799 (\u00a3779, AU$1,129) for the 11-inch size. They\u2019re the only Air alternative with reliable 2-in-1 productivity chops. The iPad Air (2019) ends up being your cheapest answer to Apple Smart Keyboard cover support.",
    "This is the first iPad Air with a 10.5-inch Retina display and thinner bezels, and we found it to be a big upgrade over all of Apple\u2019s 9.7-inch non-Pro tablets we\u2019ve used in the past. This is mostly down to the fully laminated screen and wide color P3 palette.",
    "Its laminated display means there\u2019s almost no gap between the thinner glass on top and LCD panel underneath. The screen is pressed right up against the glass and really lets the colors pop. It\u2019s hard to unsee the difference next to a cheaper iPad, and it\u2019s a big deal when drawing directly on the screen with the Apple Pencil.",
    "We noticed more yellow from this iPad Air screen, and that\u2019s because it uses Apple\u2019s True Tone display technology to better adapt to our environment. Without this setting enabled, the screen looked very blue compared to TechRadar\u2019s office lighting, for example. Outside, we appreciated the screen\u2019s anti-reflective coating that\u2019s exclusive to this new Air and all Pro models.",
    "The new iPad Air\u2019s thinner bezels, laminated screen, wider color palette, True Tone display and anti-reflective coating may be enough to convince people to pick up this iPad over the iPad 9.7, which has none of these features.",
    "\u201cThis is the new iPad Air,\u201d I exclaimed to my coworkers this week. Their reaction? \u201cReally? It doesn\u2019t look any different.\u201d I walked away in shame (but agreeing). Don\u2019t go into this purchase expecting big changes from this traditional-looking iPad. It won\u2019t wow anyone like the all-screen iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9.",
    "But it does have fan-favorite features you won\u2019t find on the new Pros: a 3.5mm headphone jack, and the equally-reliable Touch ID button. And the size, while subtly different from 9.7-inch iPads, allows for the fully-sized 10.5-inch Apple Smart Keyboard to be attached (the same one used by the iPad Pro 10.5).",
    "It\u2019s Apple\u2019s thinnest non-Pro iPad at 6.1mm (the Pro is 5.9mm and the iPad 9.7 is 7.5mm), and also weighs just 1lb (456g). Its \u2018Air\u2019 moniker actually means something \u2013 only iPad mini (2019) is lighter at 0.66lbs (300.5g) among iPads currently on sale.",
    "The bottom of this iPad frame sticks with the traditional lightning port (newer Pros use USB-C). That\u2019s an okay design choice for people with tons of lightning cables already, but newer MacBook owners may be ready for the USB-C future. We feel like the bigger omission is lack of the quad speakers found on the iPad Pro 10.5 (2017). There are just two speakers here at the bottom of the tablet.",
    "iPad Air 2019 colors consist of silver, gold and Space Gray \u2013 the latter has a black front, while the others are white. Our gold review unit looks a bit like Rose Gold or copper. Oddly enough, Rose Gold isn\u2019t an option on this new iPad. In fact, Rose Gold isn\u2019t an option on any iPad Apple currently sells.",
    "Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard compatibility is the reason to spring for the iPad Air over the temptingly priced iPad 9.7 that only works with Bluetooth keyboards. It\u2019s one of the things you can\u2019t pass up if you\u2019re looking for 2-in-1 productivity from an iPad.",
    "This is the cheapest iPad with Apple\u2019s Smart Connector, which magnetically fastens the fabric tri-fold keyboard cover to the bottom (in landscape) of the tablet. No need to fumble around with those often unreliable third-party Bluetooth keyboards.",
    "You\u2019re forced to use low-pile keys, which isn't a problem if you\u2019ve adjusted to recent MacBooks or Mac Magic Keyboards. What\u2019s different is that this keyboard has a one-piece custom-woven fabric design with 64 keys etched out using lasers. Laser-etched fabric keys sound cool, and they have real-world benefits: they\u2019re water- and stain-resistant, and impervious to debris. I carelessly ate a croissant over the iPad Air \u2013 for testing purposes \u2013 and simply wiped away the many pieces that didn\u2019t make it into my mouth. Contrast that with various MacBooks I\u2019ve taken to the Apple Store for repair when a single crumb gets trapped underneath the delicate butterfly keyboard.",
    "The Smart Keyboard comes at a high price: $159 (\u00a3159, AU$235), and there are a few compromises. I can\u2019t modify keys or keyboard shortcuts; I\u2019d love to swap command and control, like I can do on my Mac, as I find hitting the very intendant command+C very awkward here. iOS 12 has no option for this.",
    "I\u2019m also hurting for a backlit Smart Keyboard \u2013 still. It\u2019s a complaint I had in our iPad Pro 9.7 review, and back then I used my iPhone 6S Plus to shine light on the keys at night. Today, it\u2019s an iPhone XS Max, or me yelling \u201cHey Siri, turn on the Philips Hue lights\u201d at a HomePod. This iPad Air is meant to be used in all sorts of situations.",
    "Every iPad that Apple sells now supports an Apple Pencil, and this is the first iPad Air to be compatible with the pressure-sensitive stylus. But it only works with the first-generation Apple Pencil and Logitech Crayon.",
    "That means it\u2019s incompatible with Apple Pencil Gen 2, which launched alongside the iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9. You don\u2019t get easy magnetic charging, the flat-sided design (Gen 1 is barrel-shaped and rolls away \u2013 constantly), automatic pairing, and gesture features like tap to wake the screen and double tap to switch tools.",
    "Charging the Apple Pencil Gen 1 remains precarious, with its capped end containing a Lightning connector that plugs into the iPad Air. It can break off easily and the entire thing is heavier than the Gen 2 version. It\u2019s the single biggest letdown of the iPad Air, mostly because our Apple Pencil rolled off the table twice while writing this.",
    "The good news is that the original Apple Pencil is cheaper and contains the same responsiveness as Gen 2 against an iPad screen. Drawing on the iPad Air, we experienced no lag, could create thicker lines by applying more pressure, and tilted the Pencil for shading. It\u2019s also our favorite way to annotate screenshots.",
    "The real reason to buy this iPad Air is the grunt hidden behind its colorful laminated display. It\u2019s one of Apple\u2019s most powerful iPads, rivaling the performance many today\u2019s best laptops.",
    "It doubles the performance of the entry-level iPad 9.7 (2018), according to our tests, offering another perk for anyone seeking serious productivity and looking for a long-term investment. It\u2019s equipped with Apple\u2019s custom A12 Bionic chipset, the same powerful System-on-a-Chip inside the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.",
    "The chip scored an 11,575 in the all-important a multi-core benchmark test. Among tablets, it\u2019s only bested by the iPad Pro 11 and iPad Pro 12.9, which has the A12X Bionic chipset and a 17,845 score. The iPad 9.7, with its iPhone 7-era A10 Fusion chip, gave us a 5,786 score. It's also better than two-year-old iPad Pro 10.5 (9,326).",
    "The performance bump translates into two important things: better speed for current apps and multitasking, and future-proofing the performance of the iPad Air. The base iPad Air configuration is 64GB, which is okay, and the top-line version is a much more acceptable 256GB version for extra cash. Sadly, there\u2019s no 128GB option to meet everyone's needs in the middle.",
    "The iPad Air runs iOS 12, and it does make navigating Apple\u2019s \u2018computer\u2019 easier than iOS 11 and certainly iOS 10, but we\u2019re still here waiting for iOS 13 to really change things up.",
    "App switching by pulling up the out-of-sight bottom dock does take a few gestures, but once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s rather easy to pop two supported apps into Split View and drag text across. You\u2019re just not going to find a permanent dock at the bottom or mouse support here.",
    "Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard makes the iPad Air our favorite way to accomplish single tasks, like writing reviews. It\u2019s also a great way to control lights and other HomeKit-compatible gadgets in our budding smart home via the Apple Home app. But for more complex research involving tabs (\u201cWhat were the specs of the older iPad?\u201d), we found ourselves seeking a Mac.",
    "We really got use out of the Apple Pencil with the software\u2019s new markup options, allowing you to take a screenshot and instantly start annotating on the captured moment. Changing up the pen thickness and color is easier than ever, too.",
    "iOS 12 also has other minor tablet perks worth mentioning: the redesigned Apple News app, deeper battery life stats, Screen Time (iPad usage numbers ideal for parents who let their kids borrow the iPad), and compatibility with third-party password managers.",
    "Apple has a very diverse lineup of iPads now, but here\u2019s something interesting: they all have the same battery life \u2013 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching videos or listening to music.",
    "That reflects what we saw when using the new iPad Air, however, it greatly depends on how you use the iPad. Standby time can be incredible, so on and off usage throughout the day gave us more than 24 hours with the iPad. With infrequent use, it can likely last a week on standby.",
    "No surprise, as we cranked out more tasks, played AR games, and treated this iPad more like a laptop, we noticed a dip. Mail and photo editing were where we saw the biggest drains among any single apps, according to the deeper battery life menu. Likewise, since we had the WiFi + Cellular version of the iPad, we noticed a another dip solely relying on our SIM card. Low-power mode really helps save battery life.",
    "The best news is that this is the first iPad Air with fast charging. That\u2019s been exclusive to newer Pro models before today (every Pro except the iPad Pro 9.7), so you won\u2019t find it on the cheaper iPad 9.7. The iPad Air 2019 was able to charge to 17% in just 15 minutes and 32% in 30 minutes when we used a Lighting-to-USB-C cable and our 13-inch MacBook Pro USB-C plug (it happened to be nearby). It took a total of 2 hours and 28 minutes to fully charge the iPad, which isn\u2019t so bad.",
    "Re-charge rate (via Fast Charging) from 0%",
    "It also didn\u2019t take long for the iPad Air to turn back on whenever we used this cable. While sold separately, the USB-C-to-Lightning cable and a USB-C plug are worth the cost if you intend to use your iPad Air frequently.",
    "The iPad Air takes respectable photos for a tablet, but it will never compare to your smartphone, and you also look rather foolish holding up a 10.5-inch display just to capture a shot.",
    "We get it, some people just need a really good reference shot for a school or work project, and old people love to use the big ol\u2019 viewfinder of an iPad. It has its niche place. For those few acceptable reasons, the iPad Air\u2019s rear camera captures 8MP photos with an f/2.4 aperture, the same as the entry-level iPad 9.7."
