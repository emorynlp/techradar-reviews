    "It\u2019s quite natural to forget passwords from time to time, especially considering that different websites and apps have different password requirements. Furthermore, while using a unique password for each of your accounts is one of the best ways to keep your information safe, this strategy makes it very difficult to keep your passwords in order. This is why over 100k businesses trust their passwords to 1Password such as IBM, Slack and GitLab.",
    "With the best password managers, you\u2019ll have convenient access to all of your passwords without compromising your security. In our 1Password password manager review, we\u2019ll take a close look at the service\u2019s features and help you determine whether it\u2019s the right option for you or your business.",
    "1Password currently offers a subscription model that is divided into personal and team plans (prior to 2016 it used to be sold as software that cost $49.99 per computer). Both have a free trial available, for the personal plans it is 14 days long. All plans also support an unlimited number of devices.",
    "1Password, the basic personal subscription, costs $2.99 per month when billed annually. Multiple platforms are supported, including Mac, iOS, Windows, Android, Linux, and the Chrome OS. It comes with all the tools you need to store passwords for an individual user, including unlimited passwords and up to 1 GB of document file storage. You can also restore deleted passwords up to 365 days later, and it has \u2018Two Factor Authentication\u2019 (2FA) to keep passwords secure.",
    "Upgrading to 1Password Families costs $4.99 per month per family when billed annually, and includes all the features of the basic tier plan. This subscription supports sharing passwords among up to five household members, with the option of adding additional family members beyond that for $1 per month. Admins can also manage online activities such as \u201cWhat family members can see and do\u201d online, and also to recover locked-out accounts for family members.",
    "Business users should look at the 1Password Teams Starter Pack for $19.95 monthly, and supports up to 10 users. Each user gets 1 GB of document storage, unlimited shared vaults for secure document sharing, and Team admins can manage permissions for each individual.",
    "Moving up is the Business plan at $7.99 per user per month. It comes with VIP support, 5 GB of storage per user, custom security controls, and other advanced features. Large businesses can also get a custom quote for an Enterprise subscription, which includes a dedicated account manager plus setup training and an onboard engineer.",
    "With 1Password, admins can manage their teams at a glance using activity monitoring, custom groups and permissions, company-wide Duo authentication, and more. Your organization can create an unlimited number of vaults in order to share passwords and documents with specific individuals or teams.",
    "1Password X, available for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, adds several notable features. You can automatically save and enter login and payment information, and the extension also provides suggested passwords as needed",
    "You can start using 1Password after taking a few quick steps to create your account. These include setting a master password, which is used to secure all of your information. 1Password doesn\u2019t require credit card information during setup, so you can sign up without taking on any risk.",
    "After creating an account, you\u2019ll be able to start adding items and vaults. Changes are automatically synced across all devices, so you can use 1Password seamlessly on all your devices, including your computer, tablet, and phone.",
    "1Password provides convenient access on virtually all devices. Along with mobile apps for iOS and Android, the platform also provides desktop apps for macOS, Windows, Chrome OS, and Linux, plus a command-line tool and extensions for popular browsers including Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.",
    "The platform\u2019s intuitive design streamlines the process of managing items, vaults, and users through either the website or app. It\u2019s also highly responsive, with changes on one device showing up on other devices almost instantaneously.",
    "1Password uses a wide range of tools to keep your information as secure as possible. Accounts are locked by a master password, which is never shared with 1Password or any third parties. Keep in mind that this also prevents forgotten master passwords from being reset. Therefore users only need to memorize this single master password, and then this unlocks all of their other passwords. Also be aware that the service is so secure, that if the user loses the master password, there is no way for 1Password to recover it.",
    "Subsequently, logins along with any uploaded private documents get locked away in the Password Vault. Items are organized by category, which has folders for common items to keep secured such as credit cards, bank accounts and driver licenses.",
    "Along with two-factor authentication through Authy and Microsoft Authenticator, 1Password comes with helpful security features, such as alerts for security breaches, protection against keyloggers, and AES 256-bit encryption. While your password is being used to provide credentials, it is also kept secure via the Secure Remote Password (SRP) feature which encrypts all traffic to the 1Password server, the password is authenticated without sending it all around the internet.",
    "With 1Password, you\u2019ll have access to 24/7 support via email. The website states that Business users get VIP support, but it doesn\u2019t explain the difference between regular and VIP\u2014just that help is available \u201cwhenever you need it.\u201d As mentioned above, Enterprise subscriptions come with a dedicated account manager and onboard engineer.",
    "The 1Password site also provides helpful articles covering a variety of support topics. These are a great place to start if you run into technical issues or want to learn more about the service\u2019s features.",
    "Lastpass, one of the most popular password managers, comes with some notable pros and cons compared to 1Password. Unlike 1Password, Lastpass offers a surprisingly robust free plan that enables users to store and share passwords across all their devices.",
    "Furthermore, Lastpass Emergency makes it easy to configure a digital will that automatically transfers your information in case of an emergency or death. The only way to set this process up on 1Password is to pay for a family or team plan and create multiple admins or organizers. That said, Lastpass and 1Password come with many of the same features, and their pricing is mostly similar aside from the Lastpass free plan.",
    "1Password offers everything individuals and businesses need to store and share passwords and other sensitive pieces of information. Starting at just $2.99 per month for individuals and $3.99 per month for teams, it\u2019s a low-cost way to keep your data safe.",
    "In addition to mobile apps, the service is also compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux along with several browsers. Its flexibility, affordability, and ease of use make it a great option for companies of all sizes."
