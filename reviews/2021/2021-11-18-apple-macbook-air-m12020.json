  "summary": "Same, but different",
  "verdict": "The MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is easily one of the most exciting Apple laptops of recent years. Its M1 chip is a real game-changer, and the ability to run both legacy apps, M1-optimized apps and iOS apps is very impressive. Battery life is also great, and performance is excellent as well.",

    "macOS Big Sur is fast and responsive",
    "Battery life is great",
    "Silent in use",
    "Keyboard remains very good"

    "With the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), Apple has given its thinnest and slimmest a giant leap forward in performance. The 2020 Air comes with the Apple M1 processor, the manufacturer\u2019s highly-acclaimed, impressively powerful ARM-based chip, under its hood, giving it just the right boost it\u2019s long deserved.",
    "Alongside the macOS 11 Big Sur it comes pre-loaded during its release \u2013 any MacBook Air M1 you purchase now should either come with the new macOS Monterey or have a free upgrade to it, it has become among the most powerful thin and light laptops. It boasts improvements in performance, as well as better power-efficiency and longer battery life, while sticking with the same pricing as its predecessor ($999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,599), the MacBook Air (2020).",
    "The MacBook Air (M1, 2020), therefore, offers upgraded internals without any additional cost. So, if you weren\u2019t swayed by the Intel-based model, then maybe this one will change your mind.",
    "Considering the price points of premium Windows 10 competitors like the HP Spectre x360 and Dell XPS 13 (Late 2020), both of which are pricier, the Air\u2019s price tag looks even more competitive.",
    "You can also go for a more powerful MacBook Air with extra storage for $1,249 / \u00a31,249 / AU$1,949, and both of these can be further customised with more memory and even more storage.",
    "Price-wise, then, we think Apple has nailed it. Of course, this certainly isn't a cheap laptop, but nor does it feel overpriced, especially compared to its similarly specced rivals - something that Apple has been accused of in the past.",
    "Apple has also been accused of caring more about aesthetics of its products than the actual features and functions, but with the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), we actually think the opposite is true. This is because while the MacBook Air has some huge changes on the inside - most noticeably the M1 chip - on the outside, nothing has really changed.",
    "So, this model looks (and feels) just like the last model (and the model before that). For people who love the look of the MacBook Air, this may be good news, but we feel it's a bit of a missed opportunity. The M1-based MacBook Air is such a revolutionary and exciting device, we'd have loved to have seen Apple take a few risks with the design as well, even if it was just by making it lighter, or slimming the bezels down that surround the screen.",
    "The fact is, HP and Dell have now overtaken Apple when it comes to designing thin, light and gorgeous laptops - a fact that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago.",
    "When it comes to performance, however, we have no qualms. The M1 has proved to be a complete beast that puts Intel to shame in many respects. During our time with the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), we were incredibly impressed with how it performed.",
    "Big Sur runs well, and the visual overhaul of the operating system offers a nice change, while still feeling familiar. The fact that both new and legacy apps run well on the M1 chip is very commendable, and so far there don't seem to be any issues with running apps built for Intel Macs using Rosetta 2, the tool used by Apple to allow older Mac apps to run on the M1. Also, the fact that you can now run thousands of iOS apps and games pretty much flawlessly is a huge win as well.",
    "Battery life also seems to be fantastic, and the fanless design is nice, as it means the laptop runs silently; we do have our concerns about how it manages heat, however.",
    "In the end, we'd have liked Apple to have been a bit more ambitious with the design of the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) \u2013 a bold reinvention of the laptop to match the internal hardware and software overhauls would have made this an even more exciting device.",
    "Prices for the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) start at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,599. As usual, there are a number of specifications available at launch, and you can further customize these to get the MacBook Air (2020) that best suits your needs and budget.",
    "The base model features an M1 chip with an 8-core CPU and 7-core GPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.",
    "There's also a higher-specced model, priced at $1,249 / \u00a31,249 / AU$1,949, which has an M1 chip with an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. So, for that extra money you're getting an additional core in the GPU, and double the storage.",
    "You can also configure these models to have 16GB of RAM (for $200 / \u00a3200 / AU$300 extra), and up to 2TB of SSD storage (for $800 / \u00a3800 / AU$1,200).",
    "For comparison, the MacBook Air (2020) launched earlier in 2020 also started at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,599, which was actually cheaper than the launch price of the MacBook Air (2019).",
    "So you're getting the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) for the same price as the earlier model, which we commend Apple for. If you bought a MacBook Air a few months ago, however, you may feel a little annoyed that it\u2019s already outdated.",
    "That $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,599 entry point isn\u2019t just the cheapest way of getting an Apple laptop; it\u2019s an incredibly competitive price point that undercuts many of the best 13-inch laptops running Windows 10, such as the Dell XPS 13. If you thought Apple\u2019s laptops were overpriced compared to the competition, think again.",
    "We've mentioned how, thanks to its competitive price, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is helping challenge people\u2019s preconceptions about MacBooks \u2013 but the MacBook Air, along with the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) and Mac mini (M1, 2020), also offer strong rebuttals to the criticism, often leveled at the Apple, that its products are more style than substance.",
    "People often dismiss Apple as making products that look good, but that don\u2019t do anything particularly revolutionary when it comes to the actual hardware. With the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), however, it's the complete opposite.",
    "With this laptop, Apple has actually done some really exciting things on the inside \u2013 switching to its own M1 chip, and building macOS Big Sur from the ground up to take advantage of it \u2013 while leaving the actual design of the device completely unchanged. This is both good news and bad news.",
    "First, the good news. For many people, the iconic design of the MacBook Air is pretty much perfect, so they don't see the need for any radical change. At the same time, by simply offering minor spec bumps every year, the MacBook Air was in danger of being outclassed by more ambitious rivals. So, by concentrating on revolutionizing the hardware of the MacBook Air, and not tinkering with the design, Apple is doing something many of its critics have argued it should do: focus on the unglamorous, yet essential, stuff.",
    "But what about the bad news? Well, because the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) promises to be such a big revolution, the fact that it looks \u2013 and feels \u2013 exactly the same as previous MacBook Airs is a little disappointing, to put it mildly.",
    "The MacBook Air (M1, 2020)\u2019s dimensions of 0.16\u20130.63 x 11.97 x 8.36 inches (0.41\u20131.61 x 30.41 x 21.24cm) and weight of 2.8 pounds (1.29kg) are exactly the same as those of both the MacBook Air (2020) and the 2019 model, and virtually the same as those of the 2018 Air, which is a bit lighter.",
    "On the outside, then, this MacBook Air looks identical to the three previous models \u2013 and it means that the excitement that comes with pulling the MacBook Air from its packaging is somewhat dulled, particular if you've owned one of those earlier machines.",
    "There had been rumors that the move to Apple\u2019s own silicon would result in lighter devices, but this isn't the case. One big design change that has been enabled by the M1 chip, though, is that the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is now fanless. This means the internals keep cool enough under workloads without the need for fans to kick in and cool them down. There\u2019s a catch to this (which we\u2019ll get to in a bit), but it means the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) runs virtually silently, and it\u2019s very impressive.",
    "The lack of fans could have allowed Apple to make the MacBook Air thinner and lighter, so it\u2019s interesting that it remains the same size and weight as its predecessors.",
    "On opening up the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) you\u2019re again presented with a sight that's familiar, and in a good way. The best addition to the previous MacBook Air\u2019s design, the Magic Keyboard, is again included here. It really is a lovely keyboard to work on, feeling tactile and responsive despite how flat the keys are.",
    "A Touch ID button is again situated above the keyboard, and it remains the best fingerprint scanner we\u2019ve used on a laptop. Too many of the fingerprint scanners on Windows laptops struggle to log us in reliably, but the Touch ID button here logged us in successfully pretty much every time, even when we\u2019d not completely covered the scanner with a finger.",
    "The screen is also virtually the same as the one on the MacBook Air (2020), except for one big difference. So, it\u2019s still 13.3 inches with a 400-nit LED backlit display, and a Retina display of 2560 x 1600 resolution, and comes with Apple's True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts the color temperature on the screen based on the ambient light.",
    "What\u2019s new here is that the MacBook Air (M1, 2020)\u2019s screen now supports the P3 wide color gamut, which results in more accurate, true-to-life images. P3 support used to be only found in the more expensive MacBook Pros, so it\u2019s great to see Apple bring this feature to its more affordable MacBook Air lineup. If you\u2019re a photographer or video editor who requires accurate colors, you no longer have to automatically go for a MacBook Pro.",
    "The screen is also surrounded by those big thick bezels that have been a staple of the MacBook Air\u2019s design for ages now, and which leave this laptop feeling a little dated. Devices such as the Dell XPS 13 and the Huawei MateBook X (2020) offer incredibly thin bezels around the display, and not only does it make these devices look more modern, it means the makers can actually reduce the overall size of the laptop further while offering the same-size screen.",
    "Yep, you read that right: we think Huawei has the edge over Apple when it comes to thin and light laptop design. Strange times indeed.",
    "The webcam above the screen is also unchanged from last time, with the same 720p FaceTime webcam. The 720p resolution feels distinctly outdated when most competitors offer 1080p, and with more people spending more time working from home these days, we\u2019d have liked Apple to have given the webcam a boost.",
    "However, the company claims that thanks to the M1 chip, the image signal processor has been overhauled, giving the webcam supposedly better noise reduction and dynamic range, along with auto white balance. We\u2019ve only used the webcam for a limited time so far, and it seemed fine, if not mind-blowing.",
    "Port-wise you get the same two Thunderbolt 3 ports and an audio jack as on recent MacBook Airs. The Thunderbolt 3 ports support charging, and can be used to power external monitors, and transfer data up to 40Gb/s. We\u2019re glad to see that Apple\u2019s move to its own M1 chip, rather than Intel, hasn't meant the loss of the Thunderbolt ports (Thunderbolt is an interface developed by Intel).",
    "As soon as we began using the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) we were impressed. It boots up quickly (an additional benefit of the M1 chip), Big Sur feels fast and responsive, and the look for the operating system really impresses. The interface has a more modern look, with bright, vibrant colors that really show off the MacBook Air's screen. It's also less cluttered, so you're not overwhelmed by icons and options, while the Control Center has been redesigned based on the version in iOS. It looks neater, and it's easier to use.",
    "All applications that you usually run in macOS on Intel-based MacBooks should work fine with the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), thanks to some software wizardry using Apple's Rosetta 2 tool, which allows apps to run on the new architecture.",
    "We tried a mix of both new apps built for the M1 chip, as well as legacy apps built for Intel Macs, and running via Rosetta, and there was no noticeable difference in terms of performance. The fact that you can seamlessly run older apps on the MacBook Air really is commendable \u2013 the M1 chip is based on ARM architecture, and one of the biggest drawbacks of Windows 10 on devices running on ARM-based chips is that you're limited to running only ARM-compatible apps from the Windows Store. There's a rather sparse selection of these, and this severely limits the usability of these devices. Microsoft needs to come up with its own Rosetta, pronto.",
    "Not only can you run pretty much any existing Mac app on the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), but thanks to the M1 chip using similar architecture to iPhones, you can now run any iOS app or game as well. This brings a huge amount of new tools to the MacBook, and is genuinely exciting. iOS apps and games are more feature-rich and graphically impressive than ever before, and having access to these could be a game-changer. We played a few iOS games, and they ran perfectly on the MacBook Air \u2013 suddenly, the MacBook has become a decent gaming machine.",
    "We were able to have quite a few apps running all at once, swapping between them with ease, and the Apple MacBook Air (M1,2020) kept up brilliantly. Throughout our tests it felt fast and capable. Moving a large 14GB file from an external SSD took less than a minute, for example. This really does feel like a fast and spritely machine.",
    "Apple claims the MacBook Air is three times faster than other laptops in its class, and faster than 98% of PC laptops sold in the past year. It also says the neural engine is nine times faster than the one in the previous MacBook Air, and its SSD is up to twice as fast thanks to the M1 and the latest flash technology.",
    "One thing to note is that the fanless design of the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) could mean that performance is throttled when it's performing demanding tasks over long periods of time. Because there are no fans to stop it overheating, the only thing it can do is reduce the performance of the components \u2013 known as throttling \u2013 to control temperatures.",
    "In fact, that\u2019s why pros may want to go for the MacBook Pro 13-inch. It has the same M1 chip as the MacBook Air, but it has fans, which means it can be used for intensive tasks over longer periods of time, without, Apple claims, throttling.",
    "However, in our tests we didn't notice any major incidents of throttling, and as you can see from the benchmark tests, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) came impressively close to the performance of the more expensive 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020).",
    "In both Geekbench 5 and Cinebench, the single-core performance of the MacBook Air was pretty much on par with the MacBook Pro, and multi-core scores weren't that much different either.",
    "This is great news for the MacBook Air - and slightly less good news for the 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020). Because the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is such a good laptop, it almost makes the MacBook Pro feel unnecessary. Performance seemed pretty similar in our day-to-day use, and we even played around with 8K video editing in Final Cut Pro, and while Apple seems keen to stress that the Air is capable of 4K video editing - it actually did a great job at 8K as well, allowing us to scrub through multiple 8K sources with ease. Very impressive.",
    "So, with that boost in performance, along with the P3 color gamut support, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is a brilliant choice for video editors who want a more affordable laptop than the MacBook Pro. It makes the MacBook Pro 13-inch a slightly harder to justify purchase, though it does have a few key features that the Air misses, such as the TouchBar and better cooling. Having both MacBooks churning through high intensity tasks for long periods of time should show a bigger performance gap in the Pro's favor. But for most people, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), will offer plenty of power and performance.",
    "As for battery life, we knew that the 'Apple silicon' would be more power-efficient, so it's no surprise to find that the MacBook Air has the longest battery life of any MacBook Air yet \u2013 up to 15 hours of wireless web browsing, or up to 18 hours of video, according to Apple.",
    "We\u2019ve been very impressed with the MacBook Air\u2019s battery life \u2013 even after a few hours of work (and web browsing), the battery only dropped a few percentage points, and even if you leave it on standby for a day and come back to it, the battery level remains high.",
    "In our official battery test, where we run a looped 1080p video at 50% brightness until the battery dies, the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) lasted a very impressive 11 hours and 15 minutes.",
    "That's a lot longer than the previous model lasted in the same tests (7 hours 55 minutes), and it just beats the latest Dell XPS 13 as well (11 hours 1 minute).",
    "This means you should be easily able to go a full work day (and more) without needing to charge the MacBook Air - though obviously the battery will deplete quicker if you're doing more intensive tasks with it.",
    "It doesn't quite reach the huge 13 hours and 22 minutes the 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020) managed, but we can\u2019t imagine anyone having any complaints with the MacBook Air (M1, 2020)\u2019s battery life."
