  "summary": "EXCLUSIVE: LG\u2019s answer to the AirPods Pro sound good and keep your ears clean",
  "verdict": "The LG Tone FP8 are a cheaper alternative to the Apple AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4 that retain many of the key features including simulated spatial audio and noise cancellation on top of LG\u2019s UVnano technology that kills bacteria in between uses. They\u2019re not the be-all, end-all pair of noise-cancelling true wireless earbuds, but they\u2019re a serious step up from any of LG\u2019s previous efforts.",
  "pros": [
    "Improved sound quality",
    "Good active noise cancellation",
    "UV cleaning is a nice touch"

  "cons": [
    "No built-in assistant",
    "3D surround isn\u2019t very strong",
    "Magnetic charging pins"

    "In its initial bid to create a pair of award-winning true wireless earbuds, LG didn\u2019t have a whole lot of success. Last year\u2019s LG Tone Free HBS-FN6 didn\u2019t exactly set the world ablaze, touting UVnano technology to kill bacteria (a neat feature, but not exactly a game-changer) and delivering audio reproduction that was, well, not top-class.",
    "Since then, LG\u2019s gone back to the drawing board and has emerged with the new LG Tone Free FP8 that are genuine Apple AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4 rivals that offer active noise cancellation and improved sound quality. These are a significantly stronger pair of true wireless earbuds than we saw a year ago.",
    "Having tested them over the course of a month, we had plenty of time to spend with them and while they didn\u2019t ace all of our tests \u2013 particularly before we applied the latest software update \u2013 we can safely say that LG is delivering a high-quality pair of buds at a lower price point than Sony and Apple, even if they can\u2019t quite overtake them in overall performance.",
    "While we\u2019d still recommend the aforementioned class-leading noise-cancelling earbuds over the LG Tone Free FP8, LG\u2019s latest true wireless buds are a great alternative at a slightly lower price, and are a great option if you find the idea of freshly cleaned eartips appealing.",
    "The LG Tone Free FP8 are due out by the end of August 2021, and will cost $179 in the US \u2013 around \u00a3130, AU$250 \u2013 though international pricing has yet to be determined.",
    "In the ultra-crowded true wireless earbuds market, that price is somewhat higher than average but still a significant amount less than other flagship buds from Apple and Sony. For reference, the AirPods Pro come in at $249 / \u00a3249 / AU$399, and the Sony WF-1000XM4 cost $279 / \u00a3250 / AU$449. That means LG\u2019s offering many of the same features at a fraction of the cost.",
    "That being said, there are a few cheaper options that also offer active noise cancellation and great sound quality that are worth mentioning. Among them are the new Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and Beats Studio Buds \u2013 they\u2019re just a tad cheaper and we feel that they offer pretty much the same value as the LG Tone Free FP8.",
    "In terms of design, the LG Tone FP8 borrows a few pointers from the Apple AirPods Pro. Both sets of buds use silicone eartips that fit snugly into the ear canal by way of an ear-conforming shell that extends out to a small nub that runs outside the ear. Aesthetically there are a lot of similarities \u2013 but not enough to make them exact replicas of one another.",
    "One thing that separates them is the choice of cases \u2013 the AirPod Pro come in a rectangular-shaped case with rounded corners while the LG Tone FP8 have a circular case. They\u2019re both small and fit easily in the pocket, but LG\u2019s case has one trick that Apple doesn\u2019t and that\u2019s the ability to clean the eartips between uses with UV light.",
    "According to LG, the case kills about 99.9% of bacteria on the earbuds between uses \u2013 which is kind of comforting if someone in your house, say a girlfriend, likes to borrow your earbuds without telling you and doesn\u2019t ever clean them.",
    "For us, the buds were perfectly sized, they fit in the ear snugly and created a perfect passive seal without any effort at all. In case you need a larger or smaller eartip, LG includes both in the box, but we\u2019d wager most folks should be fine with the medium pair that comes attached.",
    "Like the Tone earbuds before it, the FP8\u2019s touch-sensitive controls are housed at the very top of the ear stems; you can use these to play / pause your music, adjust the volume, answer phone calls, and activate Ambient Sound mode, which allows some environmental noise to pass through the buds \u2013 it's a handy feature if you need to quickly tune into your surroundings.",
    "While the marquee features of the earbuds are their active noise cancellation and bacteria-killing UV light, those aren\u2019t the only tricks up the FP8\u2019s sleeve.",
    "On top of everything else, the earbuds are IPX4 water-resistant that makes them fine companions for the gym or a light sprinkle and they offer upscaled spatial audio \u2013 similar in some respects to Creative\u2019s Super XFi technology. We\u2019ll get more into the weeds with that in a minute but the effects are fun\u2026 though maybe not as immersive as we\u2019d like them to be.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for customization options, you\u2019ll find them inside LG\u2019s Tone Free app. You\u2019ll find an EQ balancer and controls setting, as well as an option to check for new updates \u2013 something we highly recommend you do before you put the buds through your own testing. The app is intuitive and easy to use, making it a lot better than some of its competitors.",
    "Last but not least the app has a Find My Earbuds feature that will cause the earbuds to play a loud melody that should help you track them down. It\u2019s not exactly on par with Samsung or Apple\u2019s version of the Find My Earbuds feature that will show you where you left the buds on a map, but this one\u2019s handy if you left them somewhere in the house and can\u2019t find them.",
    "So what\u2019s the bad news? The LG Tone Free FP8 don\u2019t come with a built-in assistant like the Apple AirPods or Google Pixel Buds. That\u2019s not a deal-breaker, but it is certainly a huge convenience to just be able to say \u201cHey Google\u201d to get your assistant\u2019s attention at any place, at any time.",
    "The one area the LG needed to improve was its audio reproduction \u2013 and with Meridian's help it absolutely did. While previous versions of LG\u2019s Tone earbuds had muddied sound, harsh trebles and a severe case of sibilance, the FP8 now have a more lively sound that really focuses on accentuating the mids and lows with better overall balance.",
    "Unfortunately, though, there\u2019s still a lot to ask for in terms of clarity and width of the soundstage. That\u2019s disappointing because LG and Meridian set out to create the widest soundstage yet with their new Analogue Spatial Processing tech that simulates spatial audio. In theory this should take any source of audio and apply a 3D filter to it, but in practice it just makes the audio track sound more open and airy, but less refined. If you\u2019ve heard Dolby Atmos in the past, you\u2019ll know what immersive 3D audio sounds like and will recognize that LG\u2019s not quite at that sweet spot yet.",
    "As far as the noise cancellation goes, we were largely impressed with the LG Tone Free FP8\u2019s performance. While they still can\u2019t cancel out quite as much noise as, say, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the LG Tone Free FP8 can eliminate a large amount of outside noise. With music playing, background conversations happening around you all but disappear, and using them with a lawnmower means a nearly quiet experience while out in the yard.",
    "How they\u2019ll hold up to higher decibel sounds like an airplane engine remains to be tested \u2013 another unfortunate downside of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic \u2013 but so far we\u2019ve been relatively impressed with the FP8\u2019s noise cancellation chops next to our overworked air conditioner \u2013 the next best environment for a noise cancelling test.",
    "Not only can the buds keep sound out, but if you press and hold the touch-capacitive panel on either earbud, you can turn on passthrough mode that pipes in outside sounds. Why would you want that? Well, that\u2019s handy if you\u2019re at an airport waiting for a call or need to have a quick conversation with someone and you don\u2019t want to take out the earbuds.",
    "Speaking of conversations, call quality is another soft spot for the FP8. Friends and family we spoke to said we sounded echo-y and less crisp compared to other earbuds, but said we came in louder than traditional speaker phone. The result makes us leery about using these as your go-to pair for business calls and are probably best suited for short phone calls when possible.",
    "The other issue you\u2019ll encounter is that the buds might drop the connection every so often. It happened less frequently after we updated to the latest software, but right out of the box the buds might cut out on you every once in a while should you choose not to update.",
    "According to LG, you can expect 10 hours per charge in the buds and around 24 hours total for the case with ANC off. When it\u2019s on, we got around 6-ish hours of battery life and 18 with the case, which feels like the going average for noise cancelling earbuds.",
    "The case has a USB-C charging port on it and it also supports wireless charging if you have a Qi-enabled charging pad. Charging time is fairly quick, but definitely give yourself an hour or two before boarding a flight to have them fully charged.",
    "Our biggest issue with the LG Tone Free FP8 is that its magnetic charging pins are a bit fickle. On at least one occasion, our earbuds didn\u2019t charge because they lost connection with the pins in the case. In LG\u2019s defense they are magnetized in order to prevent that from happening \u2013 but it still might and it\u2019s a bit disappointing when it does.",
    "Other earbuds might have better battery lives and charging times, but the LG Tone Free FP8 hit somewhere right in the middle of what we\u2019d expect, which is absolutely fine."
