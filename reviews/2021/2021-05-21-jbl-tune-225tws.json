  "summary": "The JBL Tune 225 are a no-frills pair of true wireless earbuds",
  "verdict": "The JBL Tune 225TWS earbuds make a good first impression, with a nice design and charging case. But with no ability to create an in-ear seal, a sometimes uncomfortable fit and a general lack of frills, they are less than the sum of their parts.",

    "Fuss-free design",
    "Sleek case",
    "Passable call quality"

  "cons": [
    "No in-ear seal",
    "Bass feels thin",

    "JBL is an established name in the audio business, but it\u2019s by no means a stick-in-the-mud when it comes to embracing new product categories, and the firm has ridden the true wireless earbuds wave more confidently than many, turning out a succession of new models in recent years.",
    "With its new Tune 225TWS buds it\u2019s hoping to capture a slice of the mid-range segment, comprising earbuds priced roughly between $/\u00a350 to $/\u00a3100. Whether it can make an impact in this hugely competitive space, especially when previous JBL wireless earbuds haven\u2019t always made the grade, is unclear. However, on the evidence of these particular buds the signs aren\u2019t promising.",
    "The Tune 225TWS come with a raft of contradictions: they\u2019re lacking splash-protection when their design is clearly intended for use during outdoor exercise; there\u2019s a focus on bass performance, but this is undermined by the lack of a proper in-ear seal; and the lack of any noise-isolation pretty much rules them out for commuters.",
    "None of this is to suggest that these buds have nothing to offer. A highlight is the design, especially the charging case, which is light and compact. The buds themselves are plastic, and follow the stemmed design of Apple\u2019s AirPods, against which they appear to be pitted, rather than the in-ear design of models like the Samsung Galaxy Buds.",
    "Like the AirPods, the Tune 225TWS don\u2019t create an in-ear seal. While this makes them useful for those who like to listen to music while remaining aware of their environment, for example when jogging down a busy street, it obviates the inclusion of any active noise cancellation, so these buds aren\u2019t a good option for those working in a busy office or who commute on noisy public transport.",
    "They\u2019re comfortable for the most part, though we found that over extended periods of wear a few harsh edges could begin to pinch. Though there\u2019s nothing to \u2018hold\u2019 the buds in the ear, such as a silicon wing or tip, they mostly remained secure \u2013 and they\u2019ll likely stay put even in the ears of energetic runners.",
    "Sound quality is mostly good, given the inherent limitations of the design. With little passive and no active ability to block out noise, or the ability to create a tight in-ear seal, the \u2018Pure Bass\u2019 advertised for these earbuds is lacking in oomph.",
    "Battery life was fine, if not class-leading, with around four hours passing before both buds gave up the ghost on average.",
    "Though there are a few for whom the lack of any noise cancellation won\u2019t be a concern, it does mean these buds lag behind much of the competition significantly \u2013 and even buds going for 60% of the asking price here advertise the presence of ANC as standard.",
    "While the JBL Tune 225TWS are decent all-purpose buds, they don\u2019t serve any particular users \u2013 commuter, exercise enthusiasts, or anyone else \u2013 well. Other options are available at the same price point, and lower, which offer more and look better. If you\u2019re invested in the JBL brand, or are looking for a pair of no-nonsense earbuds, these will serve well. If you\u2019re looking for the most bang for your buck, however, it\u2019s worth looking elsewhere.",
    "The JBL Tune 225TWS are available now with a list price of $99.95 / \u00a399.99 / AU$179.95, though discounts are currently available. They\u2019re available in a range of color options: blue, gray, white, black, pink and gold.",
    "The JBL Tune 225TWS buds sport an AirPods-like design with long stems, and a light (yet robust) build. The same can be said for the charging case, which is made from the same strong matte plastic, and feels sleek and well-constructed..",
    "They sit well in the ear, although there\u2019s certainly room for improvement here, with our main issue being some slightly sharp edges. This wasn\u2019t immediately apparent the first few times we wore the buds, but, over time we found they did begin to dig into our ears a little and caused some discomfort, which is hardly ideal.",
    "The buds also lack any kind of silicon tip or wing to hold them in the ear. This means it\u2019s impossible to create a strong in-ear seal, which is to the detriment of overall audio quality, as you don\u2019t get the kind of noise isolation required for a strong bass response.",
    "If you need to maintain some awareness of your surroundings while listening to music, these will be a good choice. For anyone looking to block outside noise from seeping in, however, there are many better choices available, and for a lower price too.",
    "Though there\u2019s nothing to \u2018hold\u2019 the buds in the ear, such as a silicon wing or tip, they mostly remained secure, save for one unfortunate occasion which saw them become entangled in a face-mask \u2013 and they\u2019ll likely stay put even in the ears of energetic runners. Saying that, there\u2019s no IP water-resistance rating, so there\u2019s no guarantee that the JBL 225TWS will withstand a sweaty workout or a jog in the rain.",
    "With no in-ear seal, it was always going to be difficult for the JBL buds to stand out against the competition in terms of audio performance \u2013 that\u2019s because the physical barrier of an ear tip helps to block sound from leaking into to your ears from the outside, as well as leaking out, making bass frequencies sound more powerful. The only way to achieve this to any degree with the JBL buds is to crank the volume right up, which is not advisable due to the potential hearing damage this may cause.",
    "Given that the marketing trumpets \u2018PureBass\u2019 as a distinct selling point of these buds, the overall lack of bass is therefore a disappointment. If you like a thumping soundtrack to accompany your morning run, these will likely not cut the mustard.",
    "Thankfully, the picture is a little more positive when it comes to the mid and highs, which are clear and bright , making these buds particularly good for listening to podcasts and audiobooks. Pop is handled quite well in general, but energetic genres reliant on a wider soundstage, such as punk, rock and dance aren\u2019t given enough room to breathe.",
    "Overall, there\u2019s enough detail for most, with the tuning tending towards a more crowd-pleasing sound. Those looking for a little more, whether that\u2019s greater detail, a broader soundstage or more bass, will be best to look elsewhere.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, because these buds don\u2019t offer an in-ear seal there\u2019s no noise-cancellation, either active or passive. When these are in your ears you\u2019ll hear every noise around you.",
    "For the most part at least the Bluetooth signal was rock-solid, and the compatibility with Google\u2019s Android Fast Pair tech meant that firing up some tunes was never a difficult process. You can also use each earbud separately, if you wish.",
    "Controls on small earbuds are often fiddly and almost never simple to use. In the race to abandon buttons, touch-sensitive housings and gesture controls have been adopted by many manufacturers as the main means by which you interact with your music.",
    "The JBL Tune 225TWS buds are an outlier here, keeping buttons at the forefront of the user experience \u2013 and they actually work very well. Each bud has a thin button at the top of the stalk, with different control combinations accessed via the left and right buds.",
    "This offered much greater accuracy and fewer false positives than with many touch-sensitive competitors; buttons are a less error-prone form of interaction than gestures. Pausing our music was never a complicated task. That isn\u2019t to say that they are completely without fault in this area however \u2013 we found that it was too easy to power individual buds down when attempting to activate our device\u2019s voice assistant for instance.",
    "Battery life came in at around four hours from the earbuds themselves, with a further 20 provided by the charging case \u2013 though that onboard battery life did occasionally come in closer to the five hours advertised by JBL during our tests.",
    "There\u2019s no wireless charging through the case, and although this is something that may have made the case slightly bigger, it\u2019s an unfortunate omission given the price of these buds."
