    "You might need time to adjust to its split-key design, but the Cherry KC 4500 Ergo is a cheap, well-made ergonomic keyboard. It\u2019s very light and isn\u2019t made with the most expensive materials, but being able to configure your keys, and rest your arms comfortably, makes it great value for money.",
    "The Cherry KC 4500 Ergo keyboard is a sturdy, low cost ergonomic keyboard, which provides enhanced comfort with its palm rest and front end tilt legs.",
    "It has a curved, split key-frame to provide full ergonomic support and improve posture; it\u2019s black, looks professional and uses Cherry\u2019s Cherry Keys software, which allows you to customize your keyboard settings to suit you.",
    "The chiclet keys and rubber membrane are comfortable to touch and make a nice, soft thunk when pressed.",
    "They aren\u2019t the best offering from the mechanical key switch legends, but they\u2019re good enough. They\u2019re ok for gaming, but we\u2019d advise sticking to low-paced or mouse-heavy games, TBS and some RTSes.",
    "The keyboard\u2019s wired, but the cable is quite long, at 180 cm. Wireless is always a good option, but the cable\u2019s length makes up for that. The feet can tilt the keyboard up to 43 mm and have rubber grips to prevent slipping.",
    "The Cherry KC 4500 Ergo keyboard is priced at a cool \u00a336 (around $50, AU$65), and is available to purchase at ebuyer.com. It has a two-year statutory warranty, and a one-year extended warranty.",
    "The full-sized keyboard measures 456 mm wide and 217 mm tall, and is very light at 750g. The familiar double-duty function and media keys \u2013 calculator, PC Lock, etc \u2013 are across the top row of the keyboard. From Cherry\u2019s website you can download its free Cherry Keys software, which lets you rebind keys and record macros, designate single keys to immediately launch commonly-used programs, and more.",
    "The keyboard is easy to set up: once plugged in, it\u2019s ready to go and is compatible with any operating system, but the software only works on Windows 8 and 10.",
    "Ergonomic peripherals are made to provide maximum comfort for short to long periods of use, and avoid typing-related ailments like Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), and palm supports are particularly important.",
    "The one on the Cherry KC 4500 Ergo is made out of memory foam and PU leather. While it\u2019s comfortable enough, it\u2019s not as comfy as say, that of the Logitech ERGO K860 (however, that keyboard is over double the price of the KC 4500).",
    "The Cherry KC 4500 Ergo\u2019s palm rest is also not detachable. Our one criticism of non-detachable wrist or palm rests is that the size of your hands will influence how effective it is. If your hands are large then your palm will go well past the rest, defeating the whole point of its purported ergonomics.",
    "If you have a read of the manual, you\u2019ll find tips on setting up your workspace ergonomically. There\u2019s also a digital copy available if required.",
    "Although it\u2019s great for personal use, the Cherry KC 4500 Ergo is really designed for the office, so it may not matter to you that it\u2019s only available in black and has no RGB or backlighting."
