  "summary": "How does Tile's best tracker stack up?",
  "verdict": "The Tile Pro is Tile\u2019s best tracker with a great 400ft BlueTooth range, a sleek design, and a one-year replaceable battery. It isn\u2019t as feature-packed as the Apple AirTags, but when you factor in necessary peripherals it ends up being a cheaper solution you won\u2019t want to dismiss.",
  "pros": [
    "Support on iOS and Android",
    "High find rate",
    "Replaceable battery"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No ultra-wideband tracking",
    "Shorter range than Apple AirTag",
    "Only great for tracking keys and bags"

    "Tile\u2019s best tracker - The Tile Pro - offers users a great tool for keeping an eye on your most important items whether you\u2019re on Android or iOS.",
    "Its sleek design makes it well suited for use on your keys or bag, while its IP67 waterproof rating means it can survive pretty rough conditions.",
    "Thanks to its one-year replaceable battery the Tile Pro will last you a long time too, as every time it\u2019s about to run out of juice you can plug in a new battery so it can get back to looking after your belongings.",
    "The 400ft range and loud ringer should mean you\u2019ll never lose track of your stuff at home ever again; with the Tile network\u2019s over 90% success rate at returning missing items to their owners you can rest easy knowing your most important belongings will come home eventually.",
    "Thanks to new features like the Lost and Found QR code printed on the back we expect this success rate will only go up, and as services like Amazon Sidewalk reach regions outside the US you\u2019ll have an even larger network of devices to rely on to locate your lost Tile Pro.",
    "While you won\u2019t find the ultra-wideband tracking that is used by the Apple AirTag - despite paying the same price - you won\u2019t need any additional peripherals to make the Tile Pro work with a majority of items meaning it ends up a fair bit cheaper than Apple\u2019s tracker.",
    "You can pick up the Tile Pro from Tile\u2019s official store as well as a handful of third-party vendors across different regions. The 2022 Tile Pro will set you back $34.99 / \u00a329.99 / $49.95.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a cheaper alternative, check out our review of the Tile Mate (2022) which includes details about the Tile Slim and Tile Sticker too.",
    "The Tile Pro tracker has had a slight design refresh for 2022, adopting a more slim rectangular shape to better differentiate it from the square Tile Mate. In addition its holepunch is placed next to a thinner piece of material, making it much easier to slide onto your current keys.",
    "You can nab one of these trackers in either black or white, and you\u2019ll want to choose your design carefully as it\u2019ll stick with you for a while thanks to its 1-year battery life with a replaceable battery (so when it\u2019s running low you can just put a new one in).",
    "Once the Tile Pro has been registered on your Tile app you\u2019ll be able to use its BlueTooth tracking to detect it within 400ft (121m) of you and you can make it ring to make finding it a breeze.",
    "If it isn\u2019t in range your Tile will be registered as lost where - much like Tile\u2019s other offerings - the Find Far Away function should pin your Tile\u2019s last known location on a map. Its location can be updated by the Notify When Found option which relies on Tile\u2019s global network (which includes other users and Amazon Sidewalk in the US) to update its position.",
    "In addition the Tile Pro is now stamped with a QR code on its back. If a person discovers the lost Tile tracker (whether they\u2019re in the Tile network or not) they can scan it to receive contact information you have chosen to give out. With this information the good samaritan can now contact you to return your item to you.",
    "The Tile Pro has an IP67 water and dust resistance rating. This score means it is completely dustproof and can survive being submerged in up to 1 metre of water for up to 30 minutes.",
    "Lastly, our favorite feature on the Tile trackers has to be the reverse track. By double tapping the Tile logo on the Tile Pro you can make your in-range smartphone ring out like a Tile tracker. You wouldn\u2019t believe how helpful this tool is.",
    "From our own experience, the Tile Pro is a big time saver when you\u2019re trying to get out the front door. It makes finding important items - like your keys - much quicker than blindly searching for where you last put them down.",
    "It\u2019s also good peace of mind if you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve left your item somewhere else to be able to quickly double-check that you did bring it home with you (or where it was lost if you in fact left it behind).",
    "The ringer can get pretty loud, and inside our home we were able to hear it clearly enough from far away to focus in on where the Tile Pro was hiding.",
    "If you do lose an item outside of your home though, Tile has told us its trackers have a 90% return rate - meaning the vast majority of items marked as lost are later found by their owners. We imagine this number will only increase thanks to the addition of the QR code and as Tile\u2019s network grows (for example when Amazon Sidewalk launches outside the US)."
