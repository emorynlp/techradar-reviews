  "summary": "Let your smart display track your sleep",
  "verdict": "The Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) may look very similar to its predecessor, but with Soli radar technology built in, it can track your sleep, making it Google\u2019s most innovative smart display to date. Sleep sensing works well, although you won\u2019t get the detailed statistics a wearable sleep tracker offers, and with handy features such as the Sunrise alarm too, this is a device that will help you both wind down and wake up.",
  "pros": [
    "Smart display can track your sleep",
    "Can help you wind down and wake up gently",
    "Watch Netflix, Disney+, and cast other videos on the 7-inch screen"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No camera for video calls",
    "Audio doesn\u2019t have powerful bass",
    "Sleep tracking not as accurate as a wearable"

    "The Google Nest Hub 2, or the second generation as the tech giant is calling it, is Google's latest smart display, and like the previous version, which was called the Google Home Hub before the name was changed to Google Nest Hub, it\u2019s billed by Google as the perfect bedside smart display.",
    "While that claim was a bit of a stretch in the case of the original model (it was based in part on Google\u2019s Hub not having a camera), Google may feel it\u2019s got a stronger case this time around, because unlike any other smart display on the market, the new Google Nest Hub can track your sleep.",
    "This smart display is the first from Google to feature Soli radar technology, which has already been used in the Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphone, and which enables you to wave and \u2018tap\u2019 the air in front of the smartphone to activate certain controls such as playing or pausing music.",
    "The Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) offers these features too, but the technology is also used to monitor the smallest of movements, such as the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe, to help the device monitor how much sleep you\u2019re getting and whether it\u2019s uninterrupted.",
    "The Google Nest Hub 2 has the same \u2018floating display\u2019 design as the previous iteration, with a 7-inch screen set at an angle on an oval base, which comes in four different colors. An Ambient EQ feature automatically brightens or darkens the screen based on the ambient light in the room, so it won't be a shining beacon lighting up your room when you\u2019re trying to sleep if you do decide to use it on your bedside table.",
    "When you\u2019re not using the smart display it will display a clock face, or it can be used as a digital photo frame, serving up your albums from Google Photos.",
    "You can also watch Netflix and Disney+ on the 7-inch screen, or listen to various streaming services on its speaker. While Google claims the new Hub offers 50% better bass than its predecessor, don\u2019t expect a thumping, room-filling sound \u2013 it\u2019ll suffice if you\u2019re using it for background audio though. Similarly, the screen quality won\u2019t blow you away, but if you want a larger screen than your smartphone to run video in the background, it will do the job.",
    "Google Assistant is built into the smart display, enabling you to set timers, get the latest weather or news headlines, and even control your smart gadgets like smart lights or smart plugs with your voice (you can also do all of this by swiping and tapping on the display). As well as an audible response to questions and commands, extra information will be displayed on the screen. Ask for the weather, for example, and as well as Google Assistant telling you the current temperature, an hour-by-hour breakdown will be displayed.",
    "However, while the Nest Hub can be used to make audio calls, there\u2019s no camera here \u2013 unlike on the Amazon Echo Show 8 \u2013 so video calls are off the menu.",
    "Google says this is for privacy, and to make users feel more comfortable about having the display in their bedroom, but at $99 / \u00a389 / AU$149 this certainly isn\u2019t the most affordable smart display on the market, and the lack of a camera is likely to put off some potential customers, especially those who would potentially use it in a room other than the bedroom, and for whom sleep tracking isn\u2019t a major draw.",
    "The addition of sleep tracking certainly makes the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) more than just a way to access Google Assistant and could be a welcome solution to those that don\u2019t want to wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker at night.",
    "The Google Nest Hub 2 is priced at $99 / \u00a389 / AU$149. It\u2019s a little pricier than the first Google Nest Hub, which was initially called the Google Home Hub and launched in 2018, but only by $10/ \u00a310 / AU$20.",
    "The Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) is available to buy now in the US, UK, and Australia.",
    "The latest Google Nest Hub 2 is almost identical to the previous iteration in terms of design. Measuring 4.7 x 7 x 2.7 inches / 12.04 x 17.74 x 6.95cm (w x d x h) it\u2019s slightly smaller than its predecessor, which wasn\u2019t exactly bulky to begin with. The oval-shaped base, which is small enough that it can be held in the palm of a hand, contains the full-range speaker with a 1.7-inch driver. The base is covered in the same mesh fabric as on the Google Nest Mini smart speaker, which is made from recycled plastic, and is available in four colors: Chalk (pale grey), Charcoal (dark grey), Sand (pale pink), and Mist (pale blue). The 7-inch screen, which has a resolution of 1024 x 600, is positioned on top of the base.",
    "On the top of the screen is a physical button for muting Google Assistant, along with three far-field microphones that listen for your voice. On the back of the screen, to the right, is a rocker switch for adjusting the volume. However, unlike Amazon\u2019s rival, the Echo Show 8, the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) doesn\u2019t have a headphone socket for private listening, or a micro USB port for charging other devices, which is disappointing considering this smart display is positioned as the perfect device for the bedside table.",
    "Towards the bottom of the device is a power socket; like other Google Nest smart speakers and displays, this one needs to be plugged in at all times. The Ambient EQ feature automatically brightens or darkens the screen based on the ambient light in the room, although you can manually tweak the brightness by swiping up from the bottom of the display and tapping the sunshine icon.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, this is the first Google Nest smart display to include Soli radar technology, which is used for Sleep Sensing, Google\u2019s sleep tracking feature, as well as for the Quick Gesture feature, which lets you play and pause music and video by \u2018tapping\u2019 the air in front of the smart display.",
    "The Google Nest Hub 2 has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, alongside support for Thread (a networking technology that enables smart home devices from different manufacturers to communicate), although this isn\u2019t active yet. Once activated via a software update, which Google says will happen soon, the number of different smart home devices from different manufacturers you can control using the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) will increase, and you\u2019ll be able to control any devices that support Thread, even when you\u2019re not connected to your home Wi-Fi network, as the Google Nest Hub 2 can be used as a Thread border router.",
    "The biggest difference between the latest iteration of the Google Nest Hub and previous generations is the new Sleep Sensing feature. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Soli radar technology can sense even the smallest of movements, such as the rise and fall of a chest when you\u2019re breathing. The smart display also utilizes the built-in microphones, and ambient light and temperature sensors, to assess how much sleep you get, and whether coughing, snoring, and light or temperature changes in your bedroom interrupt your sleep.",
    "We\u2019ve been testing the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) for just over a week, and we\u2019ve found the sleep tracking to be mostly accurate when it comes to assessing the length and quality of our sleep. As well as using the Google Nest Hub 2, we also wore a Fitbit Sense during our testing, and compared the sleep statistics captured by both devices.",
    "On one hand the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) and the Fitbit Sense offered very similar data for the time we fell asleep, the length of sleep, and if we were awake for any period during the night. However, on one evening during the eight nights of testing, the Google Nest Hub did fail to detect that we\u2019d gotten up and gone to the bathroom in the middle of the night, while the Fitbit logged this awake time. The Google Nest Hub also doesn\u2019t provide a breakdown of sleep stages, or how long was spent in REM, light and deep sleep, unlike the Fitbit Sense and many other wearables.",
    "The Google Nest Hub 2 also picked up the snoring and coughing from our partner, but attributed it to us, which affected our Sleep Summary. Each morning, your Sleep Summary can be viewed on the Wellness screen of the Nest Hub, and it breaks the sleep statics down into three areas: schedule, which includes the time we fell asleep after getting into bed, when we woke up and whether this is consistent throughout the week; how much sleep we actually got; and the quality of the sleep, which takes into account the respiratory rate, which is the number of breaths taken per minute during sleep, and the number of minutes spent coughing or snoring. These three factors are displayed are circles, which when you\u2019re excelling at them, appear purple and are aligned, while if you\u2019re struggling at one or more areas they\u2019ll turn orange and be out of alignment. In addition to viewing your Sleep Summary on the Wellness screen of the Google Nest Hub, you can also access it in the Google Fit app on your smartphone.",
    "We liked that, on a day when we got more sleep than was necessary, not only did Google highlight that fact that we\u2019d got into bed a little early, and suggest how we could amend our bedtime, it also provided some information on the effects of sleeping-in on the main screen.",
    "After seven days, the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) will provide you with a sleep report with personalized tips, as long as Sleep Sensing has been active on the smart display for at least four nights in that period, and you\u2019ll continue to receive a sleep report every four days after that. After 14 days of consecutive sleep tracking, Google will offer a personalized recommendation for when you should go to bed, and when you should wake up, based on what Sleep Sensing has learned about your body clock and how you sleep.",
    "You can pause Sleep Sensing at any time by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and tapping the bed icon, and you can also ask Google Assistant to pause Sleep Sensing, or delete your sleep data. Alternatively, it can be deactivated completely in the Google Home app.",
    "The Google Nest Hub (2nd generation) doesn\u2019t only track your sleep, it also has a handy sunrise alarm, which illuminates the screen in colors that mimic sunrise between five and 15 minutes before your alarm is scheduled to sound, to help you wake up. The Nest Hub will also help you wind down ready for bed, by automatically switching the interface to a dark theme in the evening, and by offering shortcuts for setting your alarm, turning off or dimming the smart lights in your bedroom, and even playing relaxing sounds, either for a set period of time or all night, to help you drift off.",
    "A wide range of music services can be played through the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation), including Spotify, Apple Music and the free version of YouTube Music. You can control playback with your voice via Google Assistant, and we found this worked smoothly.",
    "Google claims the Nest Hub (2nd generation) offers 50% more bass than its predecessor. On test, we found while the audio is room-filling and has a sense of bass, it\u2019s certainly not booming and there\u2019s some distortion when it\u2019s at full volume.",
    "You can watch YouTube, Netflix and Disney+ directly on the smart display, and with Chromecast built in you can also cast other video services to the Google Nest Hub. It may not be the sharpest screen \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly never going to replace your main screen \u2013 but the quality is fine if you just want videos running in the background while you\u2019re doing other things.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, the Quick Gestures feature lets you play or pause music and videos, as well as timers and alarms and Google Assistant when it\u2019s speaking if you\u2019ve heard enough, by making a tapping motion in mid-air in front of the device.",
    "Google Assistant is built in to the Google Nest Hub (2nd generation), and it can do everything it can on other Google Nest devices, from setting timers and answering questions to providing the day\u2019s news, weather and sports scores, while also offering up additional information on-screen.",
    "Google Assistant can also help you keep in touch, either by placing voice calls to friends and family, or by making announcements on other Google Nest speakers in the home, either at set times or the day or on an ad-hoc basis. We also loved that you can ask Google to show you photos that you\u2019ve taken in particular locations, or snaps of certain people or pets, on the smart display\u2019s screen \u2013 it\u2019s easier than having to trawl through hundreds of pictures yourself.",
    "However, Google Assistant can\u2019t open the settings menu, or tweak any of the smart display\u2019s features for you."
