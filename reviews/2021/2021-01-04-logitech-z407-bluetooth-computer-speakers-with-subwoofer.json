    "The Logitech Z407 is somewhat of a rarity. Even now, if you want an excellent set of computer speakers, chances are you\u2019ll have to spend a little more than $100/\u00a3100. Spend less, and you\u2019re likely to end up with ones that sound middling at best.",
    "Once in a while though, we are treated with more than decent computer speakers that not only look great but sound great as well. And, the Logitech Z407 is one such peripheral.",
    "This fairly new release from Logitech has surprised us in many ways, delivering a powerful sound, rumbling bass, several connectivity options, and a nifty wireless dial for only $79 (\u00a379, AU$149).",
    "For that same price, the older Edifier M3200 is slightly less powerful and doesn\u2019t offer Bluetooth connectivity. Meanwhile, the 2019-released Creative T100 may boast satellites that offer the same level of audio power, but doesn\u2019t have a subwoofer, is slightly bigger, and costs $20/\u00a320 more \u2013 which makes the Z407 a better value.",
    "That value starts in design. At 7.87 x 3.70 x 3.35 inches (satellites) with a 9.45 x 9.21 x 7.09-inch sub, the Logitech Z407 is small enough to fit perfectly on a small desk. The speakers also sport a smart look, with capsule-shaped satellites and a dark gray finish that makes it a classy addition to work and creative setups. And, it has an overall rigid build that should see it last several years.",
    "The Logitech Z407 is also versatile. The removable satellite stands may be attached in two ways so you can either have a horizontal or an upright setup. It also has a wireless control dial with a 20-meter range, and three connectivity options \u2013 Bluetooth, micro USB, and the 3.5 mm \u2013 which further boosts its versatility.",
    "The wireless dial may be confusing at first, especially because not all media apps offer full support: Spotify does, but Apple TV on Mac doesn\u2019t support the skip or forward functionality while Netflix on Windows won\u2019t even let you rewind with it. On top of that, it may take you a bit to figure out whether you\u2019re controlling the volume or the bass level as you\u2019re essentially using the same physical dial for both.",
    "We\u2019re not saying it\u2019s convoluted, just that it\u2019s not as straightforward as most people (aka those who won\u2019t bother reading the manual) would prefer. However, once you do get used to how the dial works, it\u2019ll feel like an extension of the arm.",
    "Just because there\u2019s wireless connectivity, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be going cable-free with these speakers. The satellites themselves need to be connected to the sub via RCA cables. However, you still have the option to connect the system to your computer or device via Bluetooth, which means that the clutter can stay behind your desk where it belongs.",
    "Since the Bluetooth connectivity is pretty darn good and up to par with the 3.5mm option, you can stick with it for convenience and still get excellent, lag-free audio. For slightly higher quality sound, the micro USB connection seems to have a bit more high end and detail.",
    "When it comes to audio quality, the Logitech Z407 gets right what so many cheaper computer speakers fail to do. In fact, for a computer speaker system this compact, it blasts out surprisingly hefty audio in terms of quality and volume.",
    "Its sound may be slightly lacking in detail and its sub can overpower the rest of the frequencies when it\u2019s at a higher volume (though a simple turn of the dial should fix it right up). However, the Logitech Z407 still sounds impressive.",
    "Unlike other affordable speakers out there that tend to bump up their bass and high end, which typically make them sound harsh and easily fatiguing, this offering from Logitech is mid-focused, allowing it to produce a richer, warmer sound. The subwoofer has a lot of power for its size, with a down-firing driver that gives it a whole lot of rumble. Trust us: even at a lower bass level, you will hear AND feel this sub.",
    "You'll get decent separation when you\u2019re sitting directly in front of it, which is where you\u2019re meant to experience computer speakers. However, there\u2019s no virtual surround sound feature here so you're really only experiencing 2.1 audio, which means that you\u2019ll hear things from the left, the right, and somewhere in between\u2026 but that\u2019s about it.",
    "As a result, it may not be immersive enough for hardcore gamers. If you\u2019re looking for something that will help you game better, you\u2019re better off with a gaming headset with surround sound features.",
    "Still, the Logitech Z407 boasts plenty of rumble and produces terrific sound quality that will satisfy most gamers as well as users looking to consume media \u2013 whether that\u2019s music or movies. And, its added perk of being versatile will benefit every type of user."
