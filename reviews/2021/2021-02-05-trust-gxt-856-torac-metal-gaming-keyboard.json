  "summary": "A solid entry",
  "verdict": "The Trust GXT 856 Torac Metal Gaming Keyboard is a pretty decent keyboard, and great value for money. It comes with 12 programmable media keys, anti-ghosting, and a metal top plate giving it a nice and sturdy feel. It also has rainbow LED backlighting, but isn\u2019t customizable, and has no key lighting.",

    "LED rainbow lighting",
    "Sturdy metallic frame"

  "cons": [
    "Not wireless",

    "The Trust GXT 856 Torac Metal Gaming Keyboard is a good-priced, and sturdy, unit that\u2019s great for not just gaming, but also everyday use.",
    "Its design is simple with a robust metallic top plate with no flex. It has rainbow LED backlighting, and is only available in black.",
    "The GXT 856 is priced at $48.00 (\u00a334.99 AU$62.00). It\u2019s wired, comes with a two-year warranty, 12 programmable media keys, and anti-ghosting.",
    "The USB 2.0 cable is 180cm long, which is a good length, and long enough to comfortably plug in to your PC.",
    "The keyboard is full-size, with dimensions of 468mm wide and 188mm tall. There are two stands at the back to raise it to a more comfortable angle. The unit weighs a hefty 913g, and coupled with the metal top plate, feels like it can probably withstand a few minor bashes here and there (though we still think you should be kind to your keyboard).",
    "It has 12 programmable media keys, and quick launch applications (calculator, email, browser home page) triggered by the function key.",
    "There is a Game mode switch which allows you to lock your windows key with just one tap. It has Anti-ghosting and registers up to eight different keyboard inputs at the same time, which can be particularly useful for MOBAs and FPS gaming.",
    "Since it is plug-and-play, it\u2019s compatible with Windows, from 7 to 10, Linux and Mac and Chrome OS. It\u2019s also compatible with the Xbox One and PS4 consoles.",
    "It\u2019s not got an ergonomic design, but it\u2019s comfortable to use for long periods of time, but if you're disabled and require some kind of wrist support or would benefit from an ergonomic unit, then this would not be the best option for you.",
    "Its membrane keys are initially stiff, but feel more comfortable after several hours to a day of use. As it\u2019s a membrane keyboard it isn\u2019t noisy, unless you enjoy bashing your keys for some particular reason.",
    "The rainbow LED backlighting is nice, and has three settings, but it's not customizable, which is a shame. You can, however, adjust the brightness, and switch between fixed or an illuminating pattern via a button on the unusually tilted bottom row of the keyboard used alongside the \u2018FN\u2019 function key.",
    "There is no per key lighting, which would have been great, but is really down to personal preference and may not be an issue or important to some.",
    "Setup is simple and straight forward, but there is a quick two-page installation guide available via the Trust website.",
    "The non-ergonomic design, lack of key illumination and customizable backlighting might lose some points for you, but the metal top plating and sturdiness of it is definitely a plus.",
    "A reasonably-priced mechanical keyboard might be a better option for you if you\u2019re not too fussed about the design of your keyboard, but prefer better keys, macros and generally better functionality. It isn\u2019t wireless, but the length of the wire is appealing. As a budget keyboard, it does the job well enough, but without really excelling."
