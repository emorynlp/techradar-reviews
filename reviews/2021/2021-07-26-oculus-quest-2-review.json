    "Voted Best Gaming Accessory at the TechRadar Choice Awards 2021",
    "The Oculus Quest 2 is one of the best VR headsets available for both beginners and seasoned VR veterans alike. In fact, we\u2019d go so far as to say it\u2019s a must-have device if you\u2019re looking for a top-tier VR system that doesn\u2019t require the additional wires, huge expense or added fuss of a PC-based VR setup, like the HTC Vive or now-discontinued Oculus Rift S.",
    "But for how long will it remain top of the VR pile? Facebook (now called Meta) just announced its latest VR headset \u2013 dubbed Project Cambria \u2013 at its most recent Connect event, with the company explaining that this new device will be home to groundbreaking technology which aims to help establish the earliest days of its ambitious 'metaverse'.",
    "It's not expected to arrive until next year, though, so for now, Oculus' flagship VR device continues to rule the roost.",
    "For starters, the standalone Quest 2 brings you easy access to everything that makes virtual reality special and well worth your time, delivering high-quality virtual reality experiences at a fair price to your front room with minimal set-up.",
    "The Quest 2 allows you to (almost literally) step inside gaming worlds, as well as access 360-degree video content and apps covering all genres. This is a truly immersive gadget that even the most tech-shy members of your family can have a blast with \u2013 once they\u2019ve eased themselves into it, that is (VR-induced motion sickness is real).",
    "The Oculus Quest 2 VR headset is the second version of the Quest headset range. It\u2019s similar to the original Oculus Quest in that it\u2019s a battery-powered, standalone headset that allows you to freely roam around your physical and digital play spaces without fear of tripping over a wire.",
    "But there are some significant changes that would make an upgrade well worth it if you currently already have the original Quest and you\u2019re considering the Quest 2. The new model offers a more responsive experience overall, thanks to improved RAM and chip specs. It also has a higher resolution display, which is a whole 50% sharper than its predecessor. Combined, these upgrades make the Oculus Quest 2 experience even more seamless and immersive.",
    "What's more, where the Quest 2 is concerned developers now have the option to make their games run at 90Hz (this is important for increased comfort and even more realism while playing), and the headset itself is noticeably lighter than before, with double the battery life in the controllers. Hand tracking \u2013 which arrived on the original Quest via a firmware update, but is baked into the Quest 2 from the off \u2013 is also highly impressive, though still feels a little like a work in progress at times.",
    "There are hundreds of separately-sold Oculus Quest games \u2013 and some free ones too \u2013 available to play with the headset, including everything from shooters to puzzle games, fitness titles to meditation apps, there truly is something for everyone, even if levels of quality \u2013 and comfort \u2013 can vary depending on what you're watching and playing.",
    "The Oculus Quest 2 also offers a social experience. Though some will shudder at the newly-introduced Facebook account requirement (more on this below) or the recent introduction of ads, the Oculus Quest 2 is superb when playing with friends, whether you choose to do that through online avatars, or in the same physical room thanks to the option to Google Cast whatever you\u2019re viewing within your headset to a nearby display.",
    "And yet, while Quest 2 is the most accessible and feature-rich VR headset we\u2019ve tested to date, it still falls foul of some of the same pitfalls that virtual reality as a whole suffers from. There\u2019s still the chance you\u2019ll experience a degree of motion sickness, depending on your constitution, which is unavoidable on most headsets \u2013 even those that claim to have solved these problems \u2013 and might require you to introduce yourself to VR more gradually to avoid the telltale signs.",
    "What's more, getting a good, tight fit to ensure the screen appears as clear as possible can be claustrophobic and a little uncomfortable (even irritating to the skin). These base-level issues remain unsolved; for a new generation of hardware, we\u2019d have liked to have seen a wider array of brand-new software to go with it, too.",
    "Having said that, we are expecting more and more upgrades to the Quest 2 that might not address every niggling issue but could improve the VR experience even more. For example, according to rumors, the Oculus Quest 2 could get 120Hz 'experimental' refresh rate very soon. This won't just make for smoother gaming but, at least for some, might reduce the chance they'll experience VR-induced motion sickness.",
    "Oculus Quest 2 isn\u2019t perfect, then \u2013 but it\u2019s as close to perfect as VR has come so far and well worth your time, money and energy if you\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to swap reality for virtual reality. Until we see a Quest 3, this is the VR headset you want.",
    "Augmented reality passthrough coming to Quest 2 Oculus VR has announced its new passthrough API technology is now available for developers to test in the latest Oculus SDK build. The technology would allow the headset to beam augmented reality objects, images and more into your virtual environment.",
    "The passthrough tech will essentially act as an overlay to your VR activities, and will be able to provide experiences based in social, productivity and gaming-focused areas. These include sharing a virtual screen to watch a movie or show, or to fight \"zombies hiding in your living room.\"",
    "Developers will be able to patch in passthrough API features into their games and apps later this year, and the update could allow dev teams to add even more value and functionality to their projects.",
    "As mentioned, the tech is only available to Oculus Quest 2 developers at present, but we'll update the review when we've had the chance to test out some of these passthrough features in the near future.",
    "Oculus Quest 2 comes in two variants: a model with 64GB of storage, priced at \u00a3299 / $299 / AU$479, and a 256GB version for \u00a3399 / $399 / AU$639. Pre-orders are open now through the Oculus website, with general retail availability opening up on October 13, 2020.",
    "That\u2019s a significant saving over the price that the original entry-level Oculus Quest model opened sales at. It\u2019s certainly not cheap, but considering it\u2019s a contained experience that doesn\u2019t require a PC, console or even an additional screen in order to work with it, it represents great value.",
    "The Oculus Quest 2 is worn on the head, quite a bit like a scuba mask. Where a scuba mask\u2019s window would be, you\u2019ve instead got a padded cavity that houses a pair of goggle-like lenses that sit in front of a screen, giving you stereoscopic 3D visuals. Paired with motion sensors and accelerometers in the headset, you can move your head and see the motions reflected in real-time on the digital screen in front of you, as if you were looking out and moving around in the real world.",
    "It\u2019s a similarly lightweight design to the first Oculus Quest (now available in white plastic rather than a dust-hugging, fabric-covered black) with its outer shell housing external cameras that help to track your positioning and that of the supplied controllers. You tighten the headset with a velcro, slightly-elasticated fabric strap \u2013 a change (not necessarily for the better) from the more structured rubberised original.",
    "The internal improvements between the Quest 2 and the original Quest headset are significant. Compared to the original Quest, the Quest 2 offers 6GB of RAM compared to 4GB, and there\u2019s a much faster Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset running the show. This allows for greater fidelity in experiences shown on the Quest 2, as well as allowing for boosted resolutions and refresh rates.",
    "The first Oculus Quest made use of dual 1440 x 1600 resolution OLED displays (one for each eye), but the Quest 2 opts for a single LCD panel, split so as to display an 1832 x 1920 pixel resolution per eye. That\u2019s about 50 percent sharper than the original, and while we\u2019d usually prefer the richness of an OLED display, we hardly missed it here. LCD also opens up an improved refresh rate of 90Hz to developers, compared to the original Quest\u2019s 72Hz. Where supported, it will be a notably smoother experience.",
    "Note though that there's a change to the Interpupillary distance (IPD, the gap between your pupils) slider on the Quest 2. Previously, you could make fine adjustments with a slider on the underneath of the original Quest. Now you have to physically shift the goggles themselves over three pre-set distances, 58mm, 63mm and 68mm. While most won't notice any difference (the three settings cover the most common IPD ranges), it's a shame that more delicate control has been lost.",
    "The Quest 2 does all of this while still offering the same 2-3 hour battery life as the first Quest, depending on the application you\u2019re using. That may not sound like much, but longer play sessions than that are unlikely to be comfortable anyway. Oculus has managed this thanks to significant improvements to its tracking algorithms, which extend to the controllers too, now offering double the battery life (we\u2019re talking weeks of constant play) compared to their predecessors.",
    "The motion controllers themselves have seen some small improvements too. Now available in white, they offer more room to rest your thumb during play, making them easier to hold for longer sessions. Each has a baton-like handle, including triggers for your forefingers and grips, as well as facial buttons and movement sticks for your thumbs. A strap keeps the controllers from flying free from your hand, while a plastic ring surrounds your thumbs, housing the near-invisible LEDs that allow the headset to track your hands\u2019 and arms\u2019 movements.",
    "Speakers are built into the headset\u2019s strap supports, offering directional left and right stereo sound. They\u2019re reasonably clear and loud enough to get across the drama and directional audio feedback of your games, while keeping your ears free in order to allow you some awareness of your physical surroundings. Note that if you\u2019re playing in a room with a friend, they\u2019re going to hear everything going on using the built-in speakers, but there\u2019s also a 3.5mm jack if you want to connect your own headphones for a private session.",
    "A microphone is built in too, again clear enough for communicating in multiplayer games and doing some voice searches in the various UI elements of apps that support it. Speech recognition is surprisingly accurate, too.",
    "Getting a VR headset set up can be a painful affair \u2013 there\u2019s usually loads of wires to plug in, and external sensors to arrange. But because all the computing and motion tracking is done on the self-contained Oculus Quest 2 headset, getting into the action here take just 5-10 minutes.",
    "You\u2019ll turn on the headset after its first charge, and be showed a few safety clips, and a very short intro video that introduces you to controllers and how their wand like point-and-trigger system can be used to navigate menus. You\u2019ll then be asked to set up what's called a \u2018Guardian' \u2013 the first of many 'wow' moments the Oculus Quest offers.",
    "Using the headset\u2019s external cameras, you\u2019ll be shown a grayscale view of your surrounding environment on screen, in real-time. You\u2019ll then use the controllers like a spray paint can, painting around the edges of your room to show the headset the safe play space you can freely walk about in without bumping into, say, your TV or sofa. Stationary or seated settings are also available, but it\u2019s these roomscale experiences that prove the most immersive. Oculus suggests a minimum space of 6.5 feet by 6.5 feet for roomscale titles, but you can probably get away with a bit smaller if you're careful. With the boundaries established, the Guardian wall is then revealed: a grid-like digital wall that only makes itself visible if you\u2019re attempting to cross its boundaries. Here you\u2019ll know the limit of safe play space, and if you stick your head through the digital wall, you\u2019ll again see your real-world environment. It\u2019s an ingenious safety feature.",
    "The safety video animation below, which was revealed alongside the original Quest, does a good job of illustrating how it works:",
    "With the Guardian set up, you\u2019ll then be shown how to (optionally) use your hands to navigate menus, instead of using the controllers. This remains a beta feature for the time being, but it\u2019s still amazing to see your hands\u2019 outlines move in front of you, as seen by the Quest 2\u2019s cameras. Small movements like thumb and forefinger pinches can be used to select options, and looking at you palm with fingers touching opens up menus. While the number of games using it remains limited, it\u2019s a feature so intuitive as to no doubt be used more and more in the future.",
    "With set up out of the way you\u2019re into the Oculus menu system, which sits like a floating panel over your customisable \u2018Oculus Home\u2019 environment, a bit like a virtual living room.",
    "It\u2019s here that you can browse app, game and video content, manage the storage on your headset, and connect with friends through Facebook. Note that a Facebook account is now an unavoidable part of the Oculus Quest experience, so if you\u2019d rather not be a part of Zuckerberg\u2019s data-harvesting empire, you\u2019re going to have to pass on the headset entirely. It simply can\u2019t be used without one.",
    "That moral quandary aside, it\u2019s a smooth and easily navigable device. It also instantly shows just how far VR has come, especially mobile VR. Text is sharp and legible, and motion smooth and comfortable. While your field of view is narrowed by the goggles, it doesn\u2019t take too long to get used to inhabiting the virtual space. For a newcomer, it\u2019s breathtaking.",
    "And while VR is often accused of being a solitary affair, Oculus has made strong efforts to make using Quest 2 in a group accessible. Like the original Quest, you can use the Google Chromecast screen sharing function within the Quest 2\u2019s menu to allow someone not wearing the headset to watch what you\u2019re up to on a second display like a smartphone or TV. Some games even actively encourage it, with one player taking charge of a role in the real world, while another navigates the VR world presented in the headset.",
    "All Oculus Quest apps work on Oculus Quest 2, and for the time being at least, any new applications will be backwards compatible with the original Quest 2. Facebook admits that may change over time as developers get more to grips with the increased specs potential of the new model, but for now anyone rocking the first-gen edition won\u2019t get locked out of upcoming experiences.",
    "As such, there are already hundreds of games and apps available to Oculus Quest 2, as well as a handful of new ones to accompany the launch. It\u2019s an iterative upgrade in that respect then \u2013 more like making the jump from one iPhone generation to the next, in terms of continued application support.",
    "But aside from future proofing, there are obvious benefits to using the new system over the previous one. Resolution is markedly sharper, the whole system and its menus feels dramatically more responsive than even the snappy earlier edition, and, where it will become buttery smooth in motion in 90Hz apps. It\u2019s this last point that\u2019s perhaps the biggest, most exciting change \u2013 should developers choose to take advantage of it, they can now activate a 90Hz refresh rate mode in their existing titles. It seems like a small difference, but a delight in practice.",
    "Oculus Quest 2 has access to some of the best virtual reality games that have been made. Whether you\u2019re living out your super-spy gun-toting dreams in Super Hot VR, guiding an intrepid warrior mouse around in Moss, or solving the mysteries of The Room VR: A Dark Matter, there are loads of different experiences to take in. Some are simple shooting galleries, where you inhabit the avatar, while others play out like dollhouses, with you guiding characters around a world that plays out around you.",
    "The range of inventive ideas on show is delightful, though we\u2019d still like to see a more consistent cadence to big game releases on the platform. It\u2019s a wondrous experience losing yourself in the Quest 2, letting you really live within and feel connected to the games that you play. But the crucial question is\u2026 can you stomach it?",
    "Some people can enjoy VR for hours without any complaint, while many feel symptoms akin to sea sickness, such is the disconnect between what your senses feel, and eyes see. Though a tolerance to VR motion sickness can be built up over time, be prepared to limit your play sessions accordingly, or keep a bucket handy. Many games thankfully have various comfort settings that can ease you in, such as snap turning, or features to make moving on the spot less sickening, so you should be able to find something that works for you.",
    "But Quest 2 goes beyond games, of course. VR can be educational \u2013 there are applications talking you through historical moments, such as a touching look at the life of Anne Frank, and one letting you visit the Chernobyl disaster zone. Virtual reality can be seen as an \u2018empathy\u2019 platform, letting you experience not only other worlds, but other lives and cultures. There are great apps from National Geographic and other organisations that let you visit locations around the world for a spot of virtual tourism, while also opening up the very real dangers of climate change. With fitness studios and meditation spots also available in app form, if you can visit it in the real world, there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019s a VR alternative being developed, or already in existence.",
    "And then there are video players \u2013 Quest comes with a built in video player for side-loading your own clips onto, and there\u2019s browser access, too. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube are all also available to download, offering digital living rooms for you to watch titles on. YouTube VR is the best of the three \u2013 not only does it let you sit inside 360-degree videos and access the wealth of content uploaded to YouTube, it generally feels sharper, and gives you the option of pulling its massive screen closer to your seated position, as if you were at your very own personal IMAX screening.",
    "The Oculus Quest 2 rings the death knell for Oculus\u2019s tethered, PC-only headsets, such as the Oculus Rift and Oculus Rift S. It has confirmed to TechRadar that, going forward, its headsets will offer a combination of mobile and PC tethered play, rather than being solely PC-tethered hardware.",
    "Should you be lucky enough to have a decent-spec gaming PC, you can use the Oculus Quest 2 to tap into tethered virtual reality experiences powered by your computer. It\u2019s simply a matter of plugging in a high speed USB 3.0 cable to your headset, setting up the PC-based Oculus launcher and store on your computer, and grabbing the apps that take your fancy.",
    "This dramatically increases the amount of titles available to Oculus Quest 2 players, providing they have the PC hardware to power them. In addition, PC-based experiences, by virtue of the potential GPU horsepower behind them, can be more detailed and ambitious by an order of magnitude than their mobile counterparts.",
    "With the greater power of a PC at hand, the Quest is capable of taking advantage of some really impressive adventures, such as the god-stomping Asgard\u2019s Wrath and mind-blowing Lone Echo. These are high-end VR adventures with graphical fidelity leagues ahead of the majority of Quest 2\u2019s mobile apps, and should be taken advantage of if possible. With a bit of tinkering, you can get the Quest 2 to play VR apps from other stores, such as Steam VR\u2019s highlight Half Life: Alyx, too.",
    "Offering access to both these play scenarios through one headset line is a wise move by Facebook, reducing the amount of hardware it supports. However, as mobile VR now becomes the default for Oculus (not everyone has a gaming PC, after all), we hope that that doesn\u2019t dull the ambitions of developers. We wouldn't want to see apps focus solely on the lower-powered mobile headset and give a cold shoulder to the more powerful made-for-PC experiences that can be achieved.",
    "New for the Oculus Quest is the introduction of a number of Oculus-licensed accessories beyond the controllers. These will start shipping in the coming months, and will include a new, structured headband for an optional comfort fit, a headband with a built in battery to double play time, audio accessories from Logitech and different inner face plates for varying sizes.",
    "As yet, we\u2019ve yet to touch or even see these touted accessories, but we\u2019ll be sure to update the review once they become available. At any rate, a degree of customization is welcome in the VR world, where a one-size-fits-all approach rarely works.",
    "What has however started to come through is third party accessories, like the Customizable Facial Interface & Foam Replacement set from VR Cover, pictured below:",
    "On sale from VR Cover's online store at $29 (about \u00a325 / AU$42) it includes a replaceable facial interface that includes venting for passively reducing heat from the display to reduce the build up of humidity, as well as a pair (thick and thin) of leatherette padded foam cushions for the inside of the headset, which is far more comfortable than the default standard the Quest 2 ships with.",
    "With a nose guard that also prevents light leaking in to the headset, and complete with a carry case and lens cover, the VR Cover kit shows there could be a lot of promise in accessories made for making the Oculus Quest 2 VR experience comfortable for all wearers, and comes recommended."
