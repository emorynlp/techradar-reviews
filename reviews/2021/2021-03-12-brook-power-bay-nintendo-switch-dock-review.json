    "The Nintendo Switch, with its hybrid on-the-go and in-the-home play styles, has been a huge success. But actually getting hold of Nintendo\u2019s own accessories can be difficult, either due to stock or the high premium pricing that Nintendo\u2019s gadgets command. In the case of the Nintendo Switch\u2019s dock unit, it even feels as if it\u2019s lacking in a few features \u2013 namely wireless headset audio support.",
    "Enter gaming accessory maker Brook, and its delightful Brook Power Bay Nintendo Switch dock offering. Looking like a shrunken down Nintendo GameCube console, it\u2019s an affordable alternative to Nintendo\u2019s official Switch dock, and throws in a couple of nifty extras too.",
    "Not only can it charge your console and output its video over HDMI to a big screen TV (doing all this safely without fear of bricking your console like some similar alternatives fall foul of), the Brook Power Bay also offers two built-in GameCube controller ports for Super Smash Bros. fans, support for Bluetooth headset audio, and mains-powered play when away from a TV, too.",
    "It may not have Nintendo\u2019s seal of approval, and can feel a bit plasticky in the hand, but with a lower price tag and a wider feature list, we\u2019ve fallen in love with it.",
    "The Brook Power Bay is available now and costs $50 (about \u00a338), while the Bluetooth-less Crimson edition is slightly cheaper at $40 (around \u00a330). Depending on where you buy it (and if you can find one in stock) an official Nintendo Switch dock will cost you double that.",
    "While its finish isn\u2019t as premium as Nintendo\u2019s own, the Brook Power Bay makes up for it with its wider feature set, and makes for a very worthy competitor to Nintendo\u2019s own accessory.",
    "If you reminisce about the chunky fun box that was the Nintendo GameCube, you\u2019re going to love the look of the Brook Power Bay. It looks just like the older Nintendo console, if it had been flattened down a bit, with the Brook Power Bay measuring just 80mm \u2013 half the length of a regular Nintendo Switch dock. It\u2019s small enough to fit in a pocket, and even comes with a little GameCube-aping detachable carry handle that can be popped onto the underside of the Power Bay to adjust the angle that your docked Switch sits at.",
    "Once you\u2019ve got a HDMI lead and a power supply plugged into the back of the Brook Power Bay (note it doesn\u2019t come with a charging mains unit \u2013 part of the cost saving on show here), it\u2019ll work just like a regular dock. Slot your console in under the purple plastic leanback flap, and it\u2019ll beam the Switch\u2019s screen up onto your TV, while charging it at the same time. Providing you use an official Nintendo power supply for the Switch, Brook promises that its dock will not cause any dangerous power fluctuations that some other third-party Switch docks fall foul of \u2013 the type that could potentially brick your prized portable. Like the official dock, the Brook Power Bay constantly alters its voltage supply based on what your console needs, ensuring it doesn\u2019t fizzle up and burn out.",
    "It\u2019s around the front where the Brook Power Bay starts to come into its own though. Not only does it offer two easily accessible USB ports, but there are two built-in GameCube controller slots too. It\u2019s not quite plug-and-play as you must hold a button down on the left hand side of the dock to ensure they\u2019re recognized as the GameCube pad and not a regular Switch pad, and the button mapping issues that brings with it, but it\u2019s a minor complaint for a feature that would otherwise only be accessible by an additional adaptor. [Brook informs me that a forthcoming firmware update will address this issue in the coming days, making for a true plug-and-play experience, but that wasn\u2019t ready in time for this review.] For Smash Bros. players, it almost makes it worth the purchase alone, given their die-hard preference to the earlier control pad.",
    "Another boon over the official dock is the much-missed Bluetooth audio support. With the Brook Power Bay you\u2019re able to hook up two Bluetooth audio devices for wireless audio from your sofa, without the need for an additional Bluetooth adapter of losing one of the dock\u2019s USB ports. Using the Qualcomm CSR SoC, there\u2019s no obvious latency introduced, making for seamless wirefree listening.",
    "Though its portable size will be welcomed by on-the-go gamers, we\u2019d have actually appreciated a little more weight and heft to the Brook Power Bay. If you\u2019ve got stiff cables coming out the back of your dock, you might find that they push the lightweight Power Bay off a level surface, which could cause instability for your Switch. Likewise, you\u2019re going to have to carefully direct your Switch\u2019s charging port into the Brook Power Bay\u2019s connector (which moves around a little bit to accommodate different leaning angles), as it doesn\u2019t have the deep gully they official dock has, which makes it so easy to safely navigate into the charging position. It\u2019s that rare occasion where a portable accessory would actually benefit from being a little bigger.",
    "A cheaper red model, the Power Bay Crimson is also available, and does all of the above but drops Bluetooth support.",
    "The Brook Power Bay works a treat. It lacks the premium feel of Nintendo\u2019s console, and the snug fit of its larger dock, but what it lacks in polish it makes up for in functionality. All its advertised features worked incredibly well, and while some elements are a bit fiddly \u2013 like getting the GameCube controllers recognized, and guiding the Switch onto the power point \u2013 they\u2019re small issues given the overall value offered here. Sure, you\u2019ll have to find supply your own power unit, but you could well find this replacing your official dock, given how much more feature-rich the Brook Power Bay proves to be.",
    "The more I used it, the more I discovered it had a few hidden features too.",
    "Remove the HDMI lead from the back of the Brook Power Bay, but leave it powered on, and you can then use the Switch with its own screen powered on while standing in the dock, without losing the Brook Power Bay\u2019s other useful features. This actually also makes it useful to Nintendo Switch Lite owners, as they can use it as a powered stand even if they can\u2019t make use of its HDMI video output settings.",
    "The dock has one final trick up its sleeve, too. If you\u2019re rocking a mobile device that has a USB-C port, and can support DP Alt-Mode to carry video data over that USB-C connection, the dock will also output video from that device too. Just plug your phone into the slot, and it\u2019ll automatically mirror its output onto a big screen. It\u2019s a handy extra feature, adding further value to an already value-adding package.",
    "Since the release of the original Brook Power Bay Switch Dock, the company has put out a revised edition of the Switch accessory which introduces an Ethernet port to the rear of the design.",
    "The Brook Power Bay Ethernet Switch Dock is otherwise all-but identical to its predecessor, again including a dock slot, two USB ports and the all-important built in GameCube ports. It's purpose really is to lower ping in online matches \u2013 if you're a big Switch online gamer, having a stable connection is important, something that the Wi-Fi only standard Switch and Dock can at times struggle with. Brook's alternative offers complete stability over its hardwired connection, providing your console is in a position to run an Ethernet cable to it.",
    "At present, the Brook Power Bay Ethernet Switch Dock isn't on widespread release. We've been playing around with a prototype model, but can confirm it's every bit as good as the original device. Expect to see this edition on sale by April 2021 \u2013 and we'll have full pricing and availability details to share when it goes on general sale."
