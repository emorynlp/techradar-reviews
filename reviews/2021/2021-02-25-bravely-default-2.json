    "Bravely Default 2 (or Bravely Default II) is catnip for classic RPG apologists. Your characters group up in a line on one side of the Nintendo Switch screen, and enemies coagulate on the other. You take turns wailing on each other with physical and magical abilities until one party falters. For the better part of 60 hours, that doesn\u2019t change. Bravely Default, as a series, has always been designed to add some flair to the turn-based battles of old \u2013 layering the curious titular mechanics on top of the familiar to create something new. Or new enough, anyway.",
    "The game is meant to be a fully new chapter in the series \u2013 much in the vein of numbered Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games establishing a whole new world with each entry \u2013 and as a fresh start for players that want to get their teeth into a new role-playing adventure, it excels. But, for all the flourishes and revisions to the core RPG formula it's made, Bravely Default 2 still feels hemmed in and hamstrung by its obsession with Final Fantasy 3 or The 4 Heroes of Light.",
    "In many ways, Bravely Default 2 iterates on Bravely Default and Bravely Second; the story is darker, and loses the sanitized YA sheen the first game had. The combat is harder and revels in overwhelming you with options and making you solve puzzles in order to progress. The world itself is broader, and more varied \u2013 at the cost of feeling empty or soulless, at times. As much as the development team is daring to dip its feet into new waters, it often feels scared of fully committing to the plunge... and that can have an impact on the game as a whole.",
    "From the second you boot up the game, the tropes start coming and don\u2019t stop: the main character is a lone pirate that gets washed ashore after a storm, apparently blessed by the divine light of a crystal. He just so happens upon a ragtag crew duo of travelers, who are searching the world for Asterisks (which bestow Jobs on your characters) and employ him to help. Quickly, and conveniently, you run into the deposed princess of a destroyed nation \u2013 and from there, you all band together to help the Princess reclaim her lost throne.",
    "At least the characters all have a bit more agency than they did in previous Bravely titles, though. The localization team has knocked it out of the park with its voice acting and scripting choices, and a special mention must be made to Side UK and the voiceover talent they\u2019ve chosen. Having a whole town of friendly Scottish black mages? Inspired. Having one of the first villains you encounter realized as a cocky Aussie chad? Brilliant. Casting budget Bjork as one of your main four heroes? Unlikely, but it works a treat.",
    "If you\u2019ve picked up an old RPG \u2013 or any of the other Bravely titles \u2013 the rest will seem formulaic enough: you travel from town to town, solving the locals\u2019 problems and unpicking a wider conspiracy whilst you\u2019re at it. Typically, the center of the town's problems will be a corrupt official or malicious bad faith actor who is inconveniencing the common folk for their own diabolical ends. How art imitates life, eh? You and your comrades \u2013 through a series of battles, dungeon-crawling escapades and the odd fetch-quest \u2013 right the wrongs, set things straight, and head off to the next town.",
    "Every single town you visit looks incredible. Every single dungeon you enter comes to life with its own palette, its own graphical asset pool, its own unique monsters. Though many may be color-swapped models, at least the developer respects its environments enough to unify dungeon inhabitants with a few extra puffs of mold here and there, or cover them in mud, or make them wear little plant hats, or whatever, depending on where they live. The OST, as you\u2019d expect from a Square Enix game, also matches all of these varied locales with effortless verve and charm. That\u2019s nice.",
    "What\u2019s not so nice is the weird, choppy animation, the low-poly models of the human characters, the not-uncommon lag in battles that\u2019ll cause the game to miss showing you why an enemy absorbed your attacks, or why they countered you and you\u2019re now sat on the Game Over screen. Optimization \u2013 for both handheld and docked gameplay \u2013 leaves a lot to be desired. But maybe that\u2019s because nudging a series from 3DS to Switch is pretty tricky, especially when your whole art style was devised and perfected around a tiny little 800\u00d7240 screen. Transplanting that wholesale onto HD hardware just doesn\u2019t look very good when it comes to 3D models.",
    "And this creates one of the game\u2019s main problems: even the most climactic battles sometimes struggle to connect because of how dodgy the game can feel. Finishing off a boss with a special attack that skips frames of the animation and then just\u2026 ends\u2026 feels weird. Detached. Unsatisfying. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but the inconsistency in performance, the half-baked animations, and the general feel of some of the 3D graphics all combine to make the game \u2013 very often \u2013 feel anticlimactic.",
    "And that\u2019s a real shame, because Bravely Default 2\u2019s strongest feature is its combat. Bringing in the eponymous mechanics allows for players to gamble or play it safe \u2013 to Brave is to use up a turn ahead of time, to Default is to stock a turn and use it later (taking a defensive stance in the meantime). Rather than doing that for your whole team, as in past games, you now control Brave/Default commands per character.",
    "It sounds simple enough, but then developer Clay Tech Works starts weaving in many more small moving parts that make later combat puzzles fiendish in their complexity. Considering each character can have a main Job and a sub-Job, can carry equipment that makes them more or less likely to be the victim of attacks, and can equip two Accessories that allow them to negate status changes or elemental damage\u2026 it can all get a tad overwhelming.",
    "And that\u2019s ironic, really, considering the developer has stated that Bravely Default 2 is designed to grasp lapsed RPG players that find newer genre titles \u2018impenetrable\u2019. The upside of this layering of mechanical Jenga is satisfaction when you get it right; going up against an end-of-Chapter boss with the right weapons equipped, the right Jobs in order, and the right Brave/Default rhythm in mind and smashing their last 20,000HP off in one turn \u2013 with all your characters Braving their hearts away \u2013 is a stupendous feeling. The kind of risk/reward mechanic that moves your butt a bit closer to the edge of your chair, that makes your breath catch in your throat just a bit.",
    "If you\u2019re a fan of grinding, you\u2019ll be happy that the developer has pilfered \u2013 wholesale \u2013 the one-handed controls from the 3DS games. This means, if you\u2019re playing on Switch Lite for example, you can control everything via the left side of the Switch, or left JoyCon, and use your other hand to scroll your socials and so on. You\u2019ll probably need to grind, too; there are some pretty noticeable level jumps and difficulty spikes if you\u2019re playing on anything other than the easiest mode. Luckily, there\u2019s also an in-game function that allows you to harvest level- and Job-boosting items whilst the game is left idle\u2026 but it\u2019s slow-going and meant as a companion to your grinding, not a replacement for it.",
    "Aside from a few gripes when it comes to formulaic setups, graphics woes and optimization, Bravely Default 2 is a solid RPG. Fans of classic Japanese RPGs \u2013 that long for the halcyon days of turn-based combat, min-max mathematics and a linear story \u2013 will find something special in this project. Proper devotees of the role-playing game will find joy in the intricate battle system, which oozes with possibility at every turn and threatens to overwhelm at times. Masochists and maniacs will bristle with glee at the deep and rewarding end-game and promise of bosses and super-powered monsters tucked into the darkest recesses of the world.",
    "It\u2019s a solid game, and one that expands on what worked in previous Bravely titles whilst plastering over what didn\u2019t. A game that rewards tactical thinking, scratches your itch for ceaseless exploration, and does it all with charm and self-awareness? Sounds like a Job for Bravely Default 2."
