    "Keeper Password Manager is considered one of the best password managers out there, and for good reason. Businesses of all sizes will appreciate the top-notch security, practical and intuitive user interface, and powerful user management. With a strict zero-knowledge policy and top-of-the-line encryption, Keeper Password Manager is a good solution for any business looking to safely share company passwords and sensitive information.",
    "Keeper Password Manager was created by Keeper Security, which has been around for a decade. It has its global headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.",
    "Keep reading our Keeper password manager review to learn more and decide whether it\u2019s the right solution for your business.",
    "Keeper has plenty of great functions for both end-users and admins, with an emphasis on security baked into each and every feature. Functions such as a zero-trust framework and zero-knowledge security architecture ensure that the information is kept secure at all times, and prevents information being violated in a security breach.",
    "Each user has their own encrypted vault for storing passwords, credentials and information, accessible through any number of desktop, mobile, and online apps. All the password management basics are here: a password generator for strong and unique passwords, identity management and payment information, and access to shared passwords. However, identity information for form filling is a bit limited, as you can\u2019t create your own fields or add multiple addresses.",
    "Administrators can easily manage multiple users, who can be assigned to roles and divided up into teams. Passwords, folders, and subfolders can be shared with individual users, teams, or roles, with the ability to disable password re-sharing, editing, or even viewing, while enforcement policies ensure everybody in your company is using or generating strong passwords. There is also an Admin Console for monitoring and managing Keeper across the organization. This can also help to enforce use of best security practices like 2FA, and password security.",
    "It\u2019s clear that Keeper\u2019s developers put a lot of thought into its business products. Mass distribution is made easier thanks to command-line installation (Windows only), while desktop and mobile apps and browser extensions are very easy to install. Most users will have themselves up and running in a matter of minutes.",
    "Initial administrative setup will obviously take longer, but again, a lot of thought has gone into streamlining this process, with multiple methods for bulk-importing users, like email auto-provisioning based on domain name, SSO, or API/SDK. After spending some time setting up various teams and roles, you need only add users as appropriate.",
    "Users can store and access their passwords on any number of Windows, macOS, iOS/iPadOS, Android or Linux devices, and Keeper also easily integrates with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, Edge, and Opera.",
    "The app interface is intuitive and easy to use, with tabs for passwords, identities, security audit, and BreachWatch. In-browser password autofill and form-filling are well executed, with tabs for entering a password, address, or card information.",
    "The admin interface is equally agreeable to use, with a Dashboard that gives you a quick overview of user activity and any security issues, and an Admin tab for managing users, roles, teams, two-factor authentication, and provisioning. If you\u2019ve paid for additional modules, you\u2019ll have access to the Security Audit, BreachWatch, and Reporting & Alerts to manage these features. Everything is also clean and well laid out.",
    "Security is first and foremost at Keeper. First of all, it\u2019s a zero-knowledge company that undergoes regular SOC 2 and ISO 27001 auditing. It also meets US and EU directives on data protection. Encryption is done on the fly and at device level, with AES 256-bit and PBKDF2 encryption, so no readable information is ever kept on Keeper\u2019s servers.",
    "Admins have full control over which users can access what information and for how long, so there\u2019s no risk of an employee keeping any information after leaving your company, while BreachWatch continuously watches for leaked passwords, and a secure file storage system helps keep your most sensitive documents safe.",
    "Keeper comes with great support for businesses. Not only can you benefit from onboarding and training for the whole team, but the support center features a very rich knowledge base with plenty of videos and articles that balance depth and accessibility.",
    "Chat support is available 24/7, which is great for businesses, while phone support is available 10AM\u20135PM CST. We were a little confused by the online chat, which didn\u2019t tell us if we\u2019d been connected to somebody or how long we might have to wait, although somebody did get back to us within two minutes.",
    "Personal users don\u2019t get the same support as the business clientele. There is no direct phone number, nor an email, but rather they need to go through the support portal. They still have access to all the articles and videos on the self support side, such as step by step guides for installing Keeper on each of the web browsers and supported platforms.",
    "Keeper has plans for individuals and businesses of all sizes, starting with the Keeper Business Plan at $3.75/user/month (billed $45/user annually). The basic plan includes password management for users, while administrators can manage user groups, enforce policies, and perform security audits. Enterprise plans need a custom quote, but apparently start at $5.00/user/year (billed $60/year annually) and adds support for single-sign-on authentication, automated team management, and advanced provisioning methods.",
    "Additionally, you can add custom modules with additional features. These include the advanced reporting module for $10/user/year, compliance reporting for $10/user/year, file storage and sharing starting at $125/year, dedicated onboarding and training for $750/year, dark web breach scanning for $20/user/year, and ultra-secure messaging for $20/user/year.",
    "For personal users, meanwhile, the Keeper Unlimited plan is available for just $2.91/month (billed $34.99 annually) which supports unlimited passwords on an unlimited number of devices for an individual user. Users can also upgrade to the Keeper Plus Bundle for $4.87/month (billed $58.47 annually) which adds the password manager, BreachWatch Dark Web Monitoring, and secure file storage. There is also the five-user Family Plan available for $6.24/month (billed $74.99 annually) and has five private vaults.",
    "There are a number of good password managers out there for businesses. Dashlane has a similar business offering, but includes dark web monitoring at just $4.00/user/month, compared to $5.40/user/month for Keeper Business + BreachWatch. If you don\u2019t need Keeper\u2019s advanced user management, this is a good solution. Alternatively, LastPass ($4.00/user/month) includes support for Opera and doesn\u2019t make you pay extra for secure file storage.",
    "Keeper offers industry-leading security with a simple interface that both end-users and IT managers will find easy and enjoyable to use. Pricing is broadly in line with industry standards, although additional features like BreachWatch and onboarding can significantly increase the yearly invoice. Nonetheless, for managing passwords and sensitive information across various teams and roles, Keeper is hard to beat.",
