  "verdict": "Though not as extension-heavy as other browsers, Safari is the familiar go-to for devoted Apple users and syncing capabilities make it hard to break that bond.",

    "Already built-in on most Apple devices",
    "iCloud Keychain updates and syncs passwords",

    "Safari is the browser you\u2019ll find on your Apple devices, and according to the company, it\u2019s \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest browser,\u201d more than 50% faster when loading frequently-visited websites than Chrome. (The Safari home page has benchmark ratings and comparisons, too.) Also, because it\u2019s specifically designed for Apple devices, it was created to be kind to your battery life (it grants you one more hour of browsing when compared with Chrome and Firefox, says Apple).",
    "However, Safari isn\u2019t the only option you have for a browser if you\u2019re an Apple user, even if it\u2019s the most convenient choice since it comes standard on Apple-everything. Learning about its features, privacy protection, user experience and more will help you decide if this is the browser to stick with or replace.",
    "Safari\u2019s Smart Search lets you search from the address bar, and if you have your Favorites added to your customized start page (more on that in a second), they\u2019ll show up as icons when you click the search field. When the field is blank, click the magnifying glass on the left side to search again for a recent search.",
    "You can customize the start page with an image of your choosing, as well as your iCloud tabs, Favorites, reading list, and/or Siri suggestions.",
    "With Safari, in-browser 4K HDR video playback is available for Apple TV+, Netflix, and YouTube. You can also start a text message convo or place a phone call by clicking a phone number in Safari.",
    "You\u2019re able to sync bookmarks, history, passwords, and tabs across your Apple devices. When your iOS, iPadOS, or Mac devices are close to one another, you can use the Handoff feature to pass off what you\u2019re doing from one device to another. Apple Pay is also available on Safari, letting you complete transactions using Face ID or Touch ID.",
    "If you can't get enough functionality from Safari\u2019s built-in features, you can also extend what it can do by installing third-party extensions.",
    "When you load web pages in Safari, each one is considered a separate process. This means that if there\u2019s harmful code, it\u2019s contained to the single page and won\u2019t impact the rest of the application or have access to your other data.",
    "Safari\u2019s Intelligent Tracking Prevention identifies trackers and keeps them from following you online. It\u2019s common for advertisers to create a fingerprint of your device that they use to target you based on characteristics like the fonts and plug-ins you\u2019ve installed. Safari\u2019s fingerprinting defense only shares a simplified profile of you with the websites you visit, which makes it more difficult for you to be identified.",
    "App Tracking Transparency lets you control the apps that are allowed to track your activity across other apps and websites. Plus, a notification will tell you if you\u2019re trying to access a suspicious website, and Safari will prevent it from loading.",
    "In the iCloud Keychain, you can securely store your passwords and then have them auto-filled when needed. This is synced across all your devices. And with Password Monitoring, you\u2019ll be alerted if there\u2019s a password breach.",
    "The Privacy Report button in the toolbar shows you how your privacy is protected when you\u2019re online. You\u2019ll see a snapshot of cross-site trackers that Safari is not allowing to profile you on the site you\u2019re visiting. There\u2019s also a weekly Privacy Report for a broader view.",
    "Like with most Apple products, if you use Safari for long enough, it\u2019s hard to switch to anything else. For those who pledge allegiance to Apple, it may be the only browser that matters. If you\u2019ve never veered away from Safari in the past, odds are you\u2019ll find any other browser too hard to learn at this point, making this one\u2019s user experience second nature.",
    "That said, even if you are open to other browser options, Safari is still perfectly pleasant to use on both a computer and a mobile device. It has all of the essentials \u2013 bookmarks, reading list, extensions, etc. \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want to go without, and it\u2019s just basic enough (without being overly simple) to not have a learning curve.",
    "Safari is Apple\u2019s default browser, and it\u2019s available on Apple computers and mobile devices, like the iPad and iPhone. Safari won\u2019t run on Android, and while you may be able to find a way to run it on Linux or Windows, it\u2019s not recommended \u2013 the lack of support that Apple offers for different operating systems means your device could be vulnerable.",
    "Chrome is likely Safari\u2019s biggest competitor, just as Android goes head-to-head with iOS. And if you\u2019re looking to outfit your browser with everything you could possibly need extensions-wise, Chrome is going to be the more flexible choice \u2013 if you can get comfortable using it.",
    "As far as safety, Firefox is often considered a leader, but Mac users generally feel quite safe using the OS to begin with, and Safari feels like another branch on an already secure tree.",
    "If you\u2019re already invested in the Apple ecosystem, Safari is a reliable and practical browser option. It\u2019s already on your devices, so you\u2019ve likely used it somewhere and have grown used to it. It\u2019s not as flashy as something like Chrome, but if you can get what you need from it without making too many (or any) compromises, the question that all Apple users ask themselves at some point is posed: Why switch?"
