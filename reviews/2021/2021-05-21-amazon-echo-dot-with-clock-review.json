    "The Amazon Echo Dot is one of the best-selling smart speakers of all time, and with good reason; since its release in 2015, the Alexa-powered speaker has gone through four generations, each better than the last.",
    "The third generation of the little smart speaker saw an upgrade in the form of the the Echo Dot with Clock (2019), which takes the Echo Dot (2019) and furnishes it will a built-in timepiece \u2013 and while it has been replaced by the new Echo Dot with Clock (2020), it's still worth considering.",
    "Giving the Echo Dot a time piece was a smart move from Amazon; after all, the most regularly-made request of Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled smart speaker is \u201cwhat\u2019s the time?\u201d We put the the upgraded Echo Dot with Clock to the test to see just how much of an improvement it is over the third-gen model.",
    "The Amazon Echo Dot with Clock (2019) is available to buy for $59.99 / \u00a359.99 / AU$99 \u2013 that\u2019s $10 more expensive than the third-generation Echo Dot.",
    "As ever, the Dot is one of the more affordable smart speakers on the market \u2013 sure, it\u2019s diminutive in size, but has a decent sound for the price, and the addition of the clock element adds to its value.",
    "The new Echo Dot with Clock (2019) looks pretty much identical to its predecessor \u2013 except of course, for the addition of an LED clock that runs around the Dot\u2019s front-edge.",
    "With a fabric grille and sleek rounded design, the puck-shaped smart speaker makes an attractive addition to any home; the Echo Dot with Clock only comes in Sandstone (a light gray hue) currently, but this chic shade won\u2019t intrude on your decor, whether you have it in the living room, kitchen, or bedroom.",
    "In fact, the inclusion of a segmented LED display makes it particularly ideal for the latter two examples; in the bedroom it can double up as an alarm clock, while its ability to set timers makes the Echo Dot with Clock a useful tool in the kitchen.",
    "That LED display also adjusts to the brightness of your room, so it won\u2019t blind you in the darkness, and you should be able to see it easily in full sunlight.",
    "Aside from the clock feature, the upgraded smart speaker is otherwise exactly the same as the third-gen Echo Dot. On the top of the speaker you\u2019ll find volume up and down, microphone mute, and Alexa, buttons, as well as a four-microphone array that\u2019s there to pick up your voice.",
    "When you activate Alexa using your voice or the dedicated button, the signature blue-ring that runs along the top edge of the speaker will light up \u2013 this happens pretty much the instant you summon the voice assistant.",
    "At the back of the 2019 Echo Dot with Clock, you\u2019ll find a power input and an auxiliary 3.5mm jack, that can be used to connect it to an additional speaker \u2013 handy if you want to beef up your sound for a party or lend your regular \u2018dumb\u2019 speaker some Alexa smarts. If you want to do this, you\u2019ll need to buy your own cable, which is slightly annoying.",
    "While the Echo Dot with Clock shares many of the same features as its predecessor, it does come with a few extras that justify that $10 price increase.",
    "For example, when you ask Alexa to set a timer, it\u2019ll visibly count down with the LED display, and if you ask for a weather report, the temperature will be displayed too.",
    "Another new feature is the ability to tap the top of the device to snooze alarms. This is very much aimed at the bedside then, with each tap buying you an additional nine minutes of beauty sleep.",
    "Aside from that, you\u2019ll find that the Echo Dot with Clock can do anything any Alexa-powered speaker can do; it can play your music, control smart home devices like smart lights and security cameras, trigger alarms, timers, news reports, place calls and more.",
    "Set up is super simple; all you need to do is download the Alexa app to your smartphone and tablet, and follow the instructions to hook it up to your Wi-Fi, name your speaker, and create different voice profiles.",
    "Alexa responds quickly to commands and questions \u2013 but to get the most out of Alexa's capabilities, you'll want to tap into the wide range of additional skills on offer \u2013 over 100,000.",
    "These include everything from music and radio streaming services to skills that let you turn your Philips Hue lights on and off.",
    "One cool Amazon Echo service is Alexa Communication, which lets you make and receive calls using Alexa \u2013 totally hands-free.",
    "If you want to get in touch with a friend over your Echo Dot with Clock , you can call that contact's landline, mobile, or \u2013 if they have one \u2013 their own Echo speaker using just your voice.",
    "We tested out the Echo Dot with Clock\u2019s sonic capabilities by enabling the Apple Music skill on the Alexa app. We asked Alexa to \u201cplay Little Dragon on Apple Music\u201d, and we were away; we also tried controlling the volume using our voice alone, and found it worked seamlessly.",
    "You can also skip tracks, rewind, fast-forward, and go back to the previous track using voice commands.",
    "Asking Alexa to play well-known artists on Apple Music works well; however, ask the voice assistant to play something a little more obscure, and it starts to struggle. You may find that it pulls up the incorrect song or doesn\u2019t play anything at all.",
    "We also felt that the inbuilt microphones could be more adept at picking up our voice while playing music; play anything above a \u20185\u2019 in volume, and you\u2019ll need to speak uncomfortably loudly for Alexa to hear you.",
    "While the Echo Dot isn\u2019t exactly known for its audio prowess, it performs admirably for its size; listening to \u2018Find U Again\u2019 by Mark Ronson ft. Camila Cabello, there were decent separation between the frequencies, with sparkling keys pushing through bassy synths and Cabello\u2019s powerful vocals.",
    "At higher volumes we noticed quite a lot of distortion, which does subtract from the listening experience, and means you miss out on some of the more subtle details in your music. This occurred over a range of genres, whether we were listening to complex electronic tracks of stripped-back acoustic songs.",
    "You won\u2019t get the kind of clarity you\u2019d expect from a bigger, more audiophile-focussed speaker, but if you\u2019re looking for something to play a bit of background music as you potter around the kitchen, the Echo Dot with Clock works just fine.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a budget-friendly wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home, and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot with Clock (2019) could make a fantastic addition to your home.",
    "It has the chic design of the third-gen Echo Dot, with the addition of an attractive LED display that makes it an ideal bedside table companion.",
    "Sonically, it doesn\u2019t deliver the audio fidelity you\u2019d want from your main speaker, which makes it more suitable as a desk buddy, rather than something you\u2019d use to soundtrack a house party.",
    "However, as a cheap entryway to the Alexa ecosystem and into the world of smart home technology, it\u2019s worthy of parting with your hard-earned cash \u2013 and if an extra $10 gets you the added functionality of an alarm clock or timer, it\u2019s absolutely worth the money."
