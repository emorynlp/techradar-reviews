  "summary": "Can this affordable cordless vacuum really rival Dyson and Miele when it comes to cleaning performance?",
  "verdict": "The Roidmi R10 is an affordable lightweight cordless vacuum that cleans hard floors with ease. It\u2019s stylish, and has won awards to prove it, and can be converted into a handheld cleaner too, but we were disappointed by its suction power on carpet and the battery life, as you\u2019ll only get 10 minutes of cleaning on the highest power level.",
  "pros": [
    "Good suction on hard floors",
    "Compact and lightweight",
    "Sleek design"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Small-capacity dust bin",
    "Loud in use",
    "Suction could be stronger"

    "Roidmi is a relatively new brand as it was founded in China in 2015 and it's fast becoming one worth considering alongside floorcare stalwarts Dyson and Miele, as it offers robot vacuums along with some of the best cordless vacuums that have high-end specs but more affordable price points.",
    "The Roidmi R10, which was previously called the Roidmi S1E, is the brand\u2019s lightest cordless vacuum cleaner, weighing in at just 2.4kg. Like other Roidmi vacuum cleaners, including the RS60, the handle curves around the main body - ensuring it\u2019s comfortable to hold whether it\u2019s used to clean the floor or suck cobwebs from up high.",
    "The floor cleaning head has a soft brush bar, so hard floors won\u2019t be damaged during cleaning, while Roidmi says plastic teeth located in the cleaning head dislodge any pet or human hairs so they don\u2019t get tangled around the brush bar.",
    "It\u2019s a good-looking cordless vacuum - the six design awards it has won are testament to that but with just two power levels - many of the best vacuum cleaners have three - and a maximum suction of 90W, it\u2019s not quite as powerful as other cordless vacuums we\u2019ve tested.",
    "The Roidmi R10 has a triple filtration system including a removable HEPA filter, which the brand says captures 99% of dust, hair, and allergens as small as 0.3microns in size, and a battery that will last up to 40 minutes between charges, depending on the power settings used.",
    "Compared to other cordless vacuums, the Roidmi R10 is more wallet-friendly at $299 / \u00a3269 / AU$499 - but does this mean you\u2019re compromising on its ability to clean? We put it to the test to find out.",
    "The Roidmi R10, which was originally known as the Roidmi S1E until it was re-branded at the start of 2021, is priced at $299 / \u00a3269 / AU$499, and is available worldwide from Amazon under its original name, and Harrods under the R10 moniker. In the UK it\u2019s also available from Roidmi\u2019s own website.",
    "The Roidmi R10 is a versatile cordless vacuum cleaner that can also be converted into a handheld device by detaching the canister from the main wand and using one of the three tools it comes with including a motorized mattress brush.",
    "Extremely lightweight - the Roidmi R10 weighs just 1.3kg in handheld mode and 2.4kg when the wand and cleaning head are connected, it\u2019s also one of the most compact cordless vacuums we\u2019ve tested.",
    "There\u2019s a power button on the front of the handle and below this are five LEDs that indicate the battery level, while a button on the top allows you to switch between the two suction levels. The R10 ships with one cleaning head that has a soft brush bar so it can be used to clean both carpets and hard floors without causing any damage. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the cleaning head has a number of plastic teeth that sit adjacent to the brush bar to dislodge any pet or human hairs before they get tangled around it.",
    "The dust canister has a 0.1-gallon / 0.4-liter capacity, while the HEPA filter can be removed and cleaned with the cleaning tool, although it\u2019s not washable so will need to be replaced every three months. An extra HEPA filter is included in the box to soften the blow.",
    "Quick and easy to assemble, the Roidmi R10 is a breeze to get going and, in our tests, performed best on hard floors - whipping away fine dust, cereal and rice in seconds on the most powerful setting. While it glided easily on both hard floors and carpets, we were left disappointed with its carpet-cleaning ability - we found there was still dust left after one sweep on the most powerful setting, and we needed the crevice tool to remove all dust from the edges.",
    "Converting the vacuum into handheld mode and back again was simple, thanks to the click-in design of the various components, which all feel well made and sturdy. The LED lights on the front go some way to identify when the battery needs charging, but we\u2019d have liked to see the remaining run-time in minutes - a feature offered by some vacuums, such as the Dyson V15 Detect Absolute.",
    "We found the R10 is a little fiddly to empty, as the wand and attachments need to be removed and the canister disconnected from the handle and main unit. However, once this has been done, a single button press opens the canister and ejects the dirt. The vacuum was loud when used on the most powerful setting, with our decibel meter hitting 83db, which is equivalent to a truck traveling down the road at 40mph, making it one of the loudest cordless vacuums we\u2019ve tested.",
    "We\u2019ve mentioned already that the battery lasts up to 40 minutes between charges, but that\u2019s on the lowest power setting; if the cleaner is used on the most powerful setting the battery life drops to just 10 minutes. The R10 also comes with a magnetic wall charger to make powering-up the vacuum easier.",
