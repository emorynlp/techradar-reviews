  "summary": "Premium competitors to Sony\u2019s throne",
  "verdict": "While the Klipsch offer excellent sound quality, a premium design, decent noise-cancellation, and some unique features, they\u2019re not as successful across the board as Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4 and the extra cost associated with them is more difficult to justify. If you\u2019re after earbuds that you can control to some degree via head gestures, there are few alternatives.",
  "pros": [
    "Remarkable audio with Dirac HD",
    "Premium design and feel",
    "Automated commands are a boon"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Pricey compared with competitors",
    "Average battery and no fast-charge",
    "ANC is solid but not the best"

    "It\u2019s natural to compare the Klipsch T5 II ANC to Sony\u2019s class-leading WF-1000XM4 buds given their similar price points and feature sets, and while the Klipsch certainly make a solid case for themselves, they don\u2019t quite offer as well-rounded a product as Sony\u2019s slightly more affordable competition.",
    "Available in three classy colors along with a limited (and more expensive) McLaren Edition, the T5 II ANC look classy and feel premium. The case is all-metal and hefty while the buds themselves are lightweight and comfortable, and both are tastefully styled.",
    "A pair of soft-touch buttons (emblazoned with the Klipsch logo) allow you to painlessly take control, although customization of their functionality is limited to just the left bud. Six oval-shaped, silicon tips are included and \u2013 paired with the light weight of the buds \u2013 make fit and seal a breeze.",
    "The Klipsch Connect app allows for all kinds of clever adjustments, including a six-band EQ, automations for enabling transparency mode when pausing music or taking calls, and settings to allow Bragi Moves\u2019 head-nodding or shaking gestures to answer or decline calls or skip tracks.",
    "The ANC on offer isn\u2019t quite up to the standard that Sony and Bose have set, but it\u2019s certainly capable and will serve perfectly well unless you need the absolute best. It\u2019s a similar case with call quality, being about on-par with most of the true wireless market at the moment \u2013 good but not outstanding.",
    "The audio quality of the T5 II ANC is where they truly shine \u2013 thanks to Dirac HD (an algorithmic enhancer with mysterious workings), the sound is rich and clear at once, offering punchy bass, pronounced mids and clarity between instruments.",
    "With ANC enabled, you\u2019ll get 5 hours out of the buds themselves with an extra 15 stored in the case, which is average for the industry but not great. The case sports wireless charging but there\u2019s no fast-charge capabilities on offer.",
    "The buds feature a Bluetooth 5.0 connection \u2013 not the latest, but not a dealbreaker either \u2013 and support for SBC and AAC codecs, which will be ample for the vast majority of listeners.",
    "The Klipsch T5 II ANC are a great pair of true wireless earbuds and are largely let down by the stellar performance of their peers and the reduced cost at which the competition comes.",
    "The Klipsch T5 II True Wireless ANC earbuds are available now globally and priced at $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$429, making them pretty close competition to Sony\u2019s class-leading WF-1000XM4 buds ($279 / \u00a3249 / AU$449).",
    "In the UK, the Klipsch\u2019s price is a considerable \u00a350 jump over the Sony\u2019s, whereas in the US the $20 difference is a little more palatable. In Australia, they\u2019re technically AU$30 cheaper than Sony\u2019s RRP but every retailer in the country is stocking the WF-1000XM4 at AU$389 by now, so it\u2019s fair to say the Klipsch buds are pricier across the board.",
    "There\u2019s also a limited McLaren Edition model of the T5 II ANC that includes a wireless charging mat and a unique carbon fiber and tire-rubber finish on the case, but this model will set you back a rather luxurious $349 / \u00a3379 / AU$499.",
    "From the outset, there\u2019s no doubt that the Klipsch T5 II ANC are a premium pair of buds. The charging case feels like a fancy Zippo lighter with its considerable heft, metal casing and side-hinged flip-top lid. For some context on this solidity, the Klipsch\u2019s case and buds weigh 82.4g (77g for just the case), twice that of the Sony WF-1000XM4 buds-and-case combo (41g).",
    "They\u2019re available in a stylish array of finishes \u2013 Gunmetal, Silver, Copper and a limited McLaren Edition \u2013 with each upholding the premium chic the brand is known for. While the finish on the case certainly feels nice and comforting to the touch, there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s also a fingerprint magnet (seen below).",
    "One neat addition worth celebrating is the integrated rubber foot on the case\u2019s base. Perhaps introduced to help keep the case secure on a wireless charging mat, its security translates to any surface you place the T5 II ANC on.",
    "As for the earbuds themselves, the units are relatively compact and lightweight, enough so to sit comfortably in the ear and reduce fatigue when worn for extended periods. They also feature an IPX4 rating which, while rather low on the scale and a downgrade from the regular T5 II\u2019s IP67 score, will still keep them safe from sweat and other light splashes (although the case does not share this protection).",
    "They\u2019re adorned with a button, each brandishing Klipsch\u2019s cursive logo, along with a single large indicator LED surrounded by a trim featuring a different accent depending on your choice of color.",
    "These buttons have a relatively soft actuation that isn\u2019t the most satisfying to press, and although it doesn\u2019t provide as much tactile feedback as some other buds, it does alleviate the issue of applying extra pressure to your ear canals when pressing them.",
    "Within the Klipsch Connect app, you can customize the actions performed by these buttons, but oddly this is limited to just the left earbud. The usual array of options is present \u2013 playing, pausing, skipping, volume adjustment, ANC or transparency mode, answering or declining calls, and voice assistant activation are all here.",
    "As for fit, there are a generous six included eartips in the box, all silicon and all sporting Klipsch\u2019s patented oval-shaped design. We found the default medium tips to provide an easy and solid seal, and we imagine one of the other five options should suit most users\u2019 ears if the standard tips don\u2019t.",
    "As compared to Sony and some other competitors, the T5 II ANC don\u2019t feature any sensors to detect the proximity of your ear, which would allow for automatic pause and playback of music.",
    "One of the most unique features of these buds is their integration with Bragi Moves \u2013 a system that allows head-movement gestures like nodding or shaking to activate certain controls (currently limited to answering or declining calls and skipping tracks). We found it to work reliably and as intended.",
    "For those with physical impairments, we imagine this could be a god-send. For others, we suspect the infrequent cases in which you\u2019d prefer not to touch the T5\u2019s button would mean that you\u2019d forget this functionality even existed, relegating it to the realm of novelty.",
    "As the product title may suggest, one of the main changes from the regular T5 II True Wireless earbuds is the addition of active noise cancellation (ANC), and while they perform admirably, they\u2019re still no match for Sony\u2019s competing buds or Bose\u2019s exceptional noise-cancelling QuietComfort Earbuds.",
    "Most static environmental noises are dealt with effectively thanks to the twin-mic ANC design (one feedback and one feedforward), but there is a low-level background noise introduced by the function itself, and more dynamic sounds like construction noise aren\u2019t handled as elegantly as Sony and Bose manage it. Overall the ANC performance is great, but we\u2019ve truly been spoilt for choice at this stage.",
    "On the topic of microphones, there\u2019s six beam-forming mics (three on each bud) that help with voice clarity when on calls. While they do a solid job, it\u2019s a limitation of the true wireless format that you won\u2019t be rivalling phone-to-face quality or even that from over-ear cans \u2013 the microphones are simply too far away from your mouth and are prone to picking up other external sounds as a result.",
    "As is to be expected by this point, the T5 II ANC feature a transparency mode that allows external sound to enter the buds for the sake of awareness and conversation. This feels natural in practice and comes with a built-in noise shield to stop unexpected loud noises.",
    "We previously mentioned the buds\u2019 gesture control, but another feature that Klipsch\u2019s integration of Bragi tech enables is called Sidekicks \u2013 essentially allowing for multiple settings to be enabled via a single command or action.",
    "This includes automatically enabling transparency mode when on a call (excellent news for those that need to hear their own voice in order to speak properly), automatically engaging ANC when listening to music, and enabling transparency mode when pausing it.",
    "These Sidekicks are genius and we\u2019d love to see them integrated into more headphone designs (frankly, we\u2019re surprised they\u2019re not). We suspect the most common reason a listener pauses their music is in order to hear their surroundings, so why make this process require multiple commands or the removal of the buds altogether?",
    "The T5 II ANC are the first true wireless earbuds to boast Dirac HD \u2013 a somewhat mysterious enhancement setting that Klipsch claims improves \u201cstaging, clarity, vocal crispness, and bass fidelity\u201d.",
    "As we hinted at, it\u2019s difficult to pin down exactly what this setting does to work its magic, but we found the above claims to be accurate, with its particular frequency adjustments resulting in a more rich and 3D experience.",
    "When engaging this feature, we couldn\u2019t help but feel that these buds were designed specifically to sound good with it enabled, potentially sacrificing some of the vanilla audio fidelity in the process. This influence was by far the most prominent when toggling the mode on and off and hearing the direct comparison \u2013 although a few minutes of listening allowed us to acclimatize to either setting.",
    "This enhancement mode makes it tricky to get a sense of the T5 II ANC's overall audio profile, but with Dirac HD engaged the response moves from being relatively flat to having more excited bass and upper-mids.",
    "When put up against the WF-1000XM4, the T5\u2019s bass is a little more punchy and the overall response feels a little less dampened in the high-end when Dirac HD is enabled, but when comparing the out-of-the-box sound, Sony\u2019s signature warm profile was more pleasant and appeared less thin.",
    "It\u2019s a tasteful sound that provides exceptional clarity even at higher volumes, at which there\u2019s no sign of distortion, and offers solid separation between musical components without disturbing the glue of the overall mix. If you\u2019re not happy with the balance, the Klipsch Connect app provides a helpful 6-band EQ with each band\u2019s associated frequency listed (something we\u2019ve seen excluded from competitors too often).",
    "The initial snare hit of MorMor's Heaven's Only Wishful is punctual and crisp, and throughout the track the Klipsch allows each synth and guitar component to comfortably coexist with the vocal rather than compete. The same is true during the song\u2019s climax when a crunchy guitar solo is paired with an octave jump in the vocals, both delivered with a pleasant smoothness considering their abrasive nature.",
    "In Off-Piste by Photay, the intro\u2019s glitches are given three-dimensional life before being replaced with the off-kilter drop and kick-ducking bass. In a song where individual elements are threatened with being submerged in the wide-open wash of synth pads and sustained notes, the T5 do a remarkable job of distinguishing each melodic nuance and percussive dynamic.",
    "On Deserta's shoegaze delight, Hide, this ability to create distinction is even more obvious \u2013 the delicate balance between an oppressing wall of noise and musical interplay is maintained without losing its sense of raw power.",
    "For something a little softer, Westerman's 'Sketch' version of standout track Blue Commanche displays all the tenderness and faults that come with a demo recording. The characteristic slapback echo provides a rich sense of space to the mournful vocal delivery while the compressed acoustic guitar fills out the rest of the soundstage with gorgeous and intimate detail.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, the charging case for the Klipsch T5 II ANC supports wireless charging, another upgrade from the regular T5 II buds, or you can plug it in via USB-C. Disappointingly, there\u2019s no sign of fast-charging, which has become a rather standard inclusion in the earbud market and is a real lifesaver for those that are about to leave the house only to find the buds completely drained.",
    "The battery life is fairly average for the industry \u2013 there\u2019s 5 hours in the buds themselves with an extra 15 in the case (this extends to 7+21 if you forego ANC). By comparison, Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4 boast 8 hours in the buds and 16 in the case with ANC enabled, and the full package weighs half as much.",
    "As for connectivity, the T5 II ANC features Bluetooth 5.0, which isn\u2019t the latest standard \u2013 the WF-1000XM4 sports 5.2 while the QuietComfort Earbuds has 5.1. In practice, the differences between these technologies doesn\u2019t yet have much of a real-world impact, but we always like to see the latest standard adopted to better futureproof products.",
    "The Klipsch buds support SBC and AAC codecs, neither of which are especially hi-res but are capable of 320Kbps streams, which is more than enough for the majority of listeners relying on streaming services or on-device MP3s."
