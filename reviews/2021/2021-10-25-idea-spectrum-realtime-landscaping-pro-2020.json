    "Landscape design is usually back breaking work, involving a spade, and most likely a wheelbarrow. But why not forgo all of this and start your work from the comfort of your own computer, by using a program like Idea Spectrum Realtime Landscaping Pro 2020.",
    "Let\u2019s take a look at what this software has to offer.",
    "As its name implies, this Windows-only package is focused on helping you create outdoor areas. If you need to design a room, or an entire house, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t create exteriors of houses. In fact, Realtime Landscaping Pro lets you add houses to your design. You just can\u2019t venture inside them.",
    "The interface is very clear and easy to understand: you have manipulating tools in a sidebar on the lefthand side, all your building materials are at the top, organised in categories such as Building, Landscape, Water Features and Utilities, and once you select an object, an inspector section appears on the right with all the properties you can alter.",
    "Take the \u2018House\u2019 tool for instance, located in the Building menu. When you select it, you mark its area on your plan, and once done, Realtime Landscaping Pro creates the walls and roof all automatically for you instantly. You\u2019re of course free to change the material, colour, wall height, roof pitch, etc, add a few windows, a door here and there, but you\u2019ll have to agree this is a huge time saver.",
    "Your creation work takes place in multiple views. You have the standard top-down option (selected by default), but oftentimes, especially when you work with different elevations, a perspective view is better suited. This allows you to be in your creation and can help to find out where any alterations need to be made.",
    "A third view is called \u2018Walkthough\u2019. This is mostly of use to admire your creation. Everything is rendered in higher quality, and you explore your surroundings using the mouse and keyboard, but you have no editing capabilities. Should you find something that needs changing, going out of Walkthrough takes you back to where you were before you started \u2018exploring\u2019, so you\u2019ll have to make your way back to the problem area in order to fix it.",
    "All of these views can be triggered at any time by clicking on their respective buttons, lower left of the interface.",
    "You\u2019d expect a landscape program to have a lot of plants at hand, and you\u2019d be right. You have a choice of over a thousand of them (thank god for a \u2018search\u2019 feature). But that\u2019s not all: they have an age setting (which mostly changes their height), and you also have the option of altering their seasonal look - by default, it\u2019s set to the general season you\u2019re working in, but you can manually change that if you feel an autumnal look works best for a particular plant, even in summer.",
    "Speaking of your environment, you have full control over it via a handful of \u2018Settings\u2019 menus. From there, the sky is changed, even the time of day, or in which phase the moon is in. Changing seasons is a given too, helping you get the most of the look you\u2019re after.",
    "As you build your project, the number of objects you use will increase, but you\u2019ll find that each category has a \u2018Currently Used\u2019 section to help you locate those items quickly, should you wish to make use of more of them elsewhere. But this only works on a per-project basis. If you wish to move over items you like and use regularly from project to project, that\u2019s where the \u2018Favourites\u2019 section comes in. When software offers you a wealth of options, it\u2019s good to know you can narrow that down to help you speed up your work.",
    "Of course, landscaping an entire area from scratch can take some time, but just like with designing a house, Realtime Landscaping Pro is there to help speed up the process too, with the use of Wizards. You have a handful of them, helping you with your Landscape, Decking, or even Pond, among others.",
    "The process is very simple, and once again, you\u2019re offered a list of templates to choose from. Once you\u2019re happy with your selection, you just drag it to your ideal location and, most of the time, you\u2019re done. You have however the option of fully customising your chosen template, from its building material, to the size of individual elements. So it\u2019s both a time saver to help you get started, and a launchpad to further your own creativity.",
    "You can spice up the walkthrough view we mentioned earlier with the addition of characters, and Realtime Landscaping Pro offers you a few to pepper throughout your creation. You don\u2019t have customisation options with them, but to make your landscape more interesting you have the ability to animate them.",
    "Some can be walking, others jogging, a handful can be swimming. Set their path, and they\u2019ll perform their set action, reset, and perform it again, ad infinitum. Even if they\u2019re sitting, or just standing, some parts of them will move from time to time, like a head turn for instance. Although you do have the option to see a preview each of them in Perspective, and even Top-Down mode, this can only be done for one character at a time. These virtual Sim-like people take on a life of their own in the Walkthrough.",
    "We did like the ability to create a movie of a Walkthrough complete with soundscape (although it doesn\u2019t record your own travels but is dependent on a moving camera you set up ahead of time - one of the many \u2018utilities\u2019 of this software). There\u2019s even the option of connecting your Walkthroughs to an Oculus Rift for a truly immersive experience.",
    "For $150, Realtime Landscaping Pro offers a wealth of features to help you create the garden of your dreams. If can be used for fun or as a professional tool to create what your client is after prior to having picked up a spade. The interface is easy to understand, and interaction with the software is fluid, even on a machine that isn\u2019t the most recent up-to-date model. The inclusion of characters is fun, but is really more of a gimmick, especially since your options there are quite limited. But overall, this is an excellent piece of software for anyone who loves or needs to design landscapes virtually."
