  "summary": "The wholly redesigned Pixel 6 redefines phone photo perfection",
  "verdict": "The Google Pixel 6 isn\u2019t the most powerful phone on the market, but its new Tensor chipset elevates its photo-taking capabilities beyond that of rival handsets. While it lacks a telephoto lens, and its battery life isn\u2019t anything to brag about, it\u2019s a big phone with a 6.4-inch display, a radical new design, and a price that can undercut rival Android phones \u2013 although carrier-specific versions might be pricier.",
  "pros": [
    "Fantastic photos",
    "Good price",
    "Intriguing design"

    "The Google Pixel 6 is the biggest update to the search giant\u2019s smartphone line in years, and while Google\u2019s new Tensor chipset doesn\u2019t quite reinvent the wheel, it empowers the handset\u2019s photo software to produce some of the best images we\u2019ve seen from a phone.",
    "The Pixel 6 is a more premium device than its predecessors, delivering a sleeker design and more powerful cameras. Most notably, it packs Google\u2019s new Tensor chipset, the first silicon built by the company.",
    "However, if you were expecting a powerhouse to rival the Apple-built A-series Bionic chipsets in iPhones, you\u2019ll be disappointed. The Pixel 6 isn\u2019t slow, but its benchmark results put its performance capability around atypical phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 and below even the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.",
    "That\u2019s okay for a phone at the Pixel 6\u2019s price, though. The phone also packs 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of storage, and a 4,612mAh battery, which lasts around a day. The 6.4-inch Full HD (2400 x 1080) OLED display is larger than the screens that accompany most flagships, and with a 90Hz refresh rate, offers smoother browsing than phones that max out at 60Hz \u2013 although 90Hz is really the minimum we\u2019d now expect to see on a phone in the Pixel 6\u2019s premium-mid-range price tier.",
    "Nevertheless, it will be the phone\u2019s cameras that many Pixel fans will likely be most excited about. Google finally gives us higher-megapixel sensors worthy of its outstanding photo software, along with its Tensor chipset tuned to Google\u2019s image algorithms. And the hype is deserved: the Pixel 6 takes great photos, at all levels of light, capturing nuance in color and shadow, as well as taking clearer photos at night than any other phone that has come before it.",
    "The two rear cameras comprise a 50-megapixel main shooter and 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with 114-degree field of view \u2013 lacking any zoom photography, so you\u2019ll have to make do with the phone cropping in with the main sensor if you want to shoot anything from a distance. It\u2019s not a letdown, as many flagship phones do the same, but getting a 4x telephoto zoom is the biggest reason to upgrade to the Pixel 6 Pro.",
    "The phone is the first to launch with Android 12 out of the box, and there are plenty of new features to discover. Most of these upgrades are incremental or not too noticeable, but some are huge.",
    "At the top of the list is the new Material You color palette coordination, which syncs up widgets and UI icons to match a chosen color theme. That\u2019s just scraping the surface of the update; there are some Android 12 features that are only available to the Tensor-powered Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 6 Pro, like Live Translate of audio and through Google Lens which can finally be done on-device \u2013 situational perks, yes, but powerful.",
    "Yes, the Pixel 6 is launching with a bigger sibling, but a larger screen and boosted 5,000mAh battery capacity aren\u2019t the only things that set the Pixel 6 Pro apart. Its 6.7-inch OLED display has QHD Plus (3120 x 1440) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, and it comes with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. It packs an extra rear camera, too: a periscope telephoto lens offering up to 4x optical zoom.",
    "The Pixel 6 Pro is significantly pricier than the standard-issue Pixel 6, making the latter incredibly good value for its price. Sufficiently powerful, with a battery lasting little more than a full day, but with cameras and photo software that outstrip other flagship phones. It might not be the most impressive phone on the market, but it hits a sweet spot of capability and more unique perks for its price point.",
    "The Google Pixel 6 was unveiled on October 19 alongside the Google Pixel 6 Pro, and each of these smartphones were released on October 25.",
    "Prices for the Google Pixel 6 start at $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999 for 128GB of storage, while 256GB starts at $699 / AU$1,129. We've yet to find out the price for the higher variant in the UK.",
    "That starting price is lower than the launch price of the Google Pixel 5, which was available in only a single configuration (and a sub-flagship chipset) for $699 / \u00a3599 / AU$999. The Pixel 6 is priced notably below rival handsets at the lower end of the flagship spectrum: prices for the standard iPhone 13 start at $799 / \u00a3779 / AU$1,349, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 is priced almost identically at $799 / \u00a3769 / AU$1,249.",
    "We should reiterate that the above price is a starting point; it may be higher in your region due to different versions sold by carriers. In the US, Google sells its own version of the Pixel 6 that only has sub-6 5G, while Verizon and AT&T sell a variant that supports sub-6 and mmWave for a higher price \u2013 $699 and $739, respectively.",
    "Contrast that with the Google Pixel 6 Pro, whose prices start at $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,299 for 128GB of storage, climbing upwards thereafter. However, that price still sits below that of rival flagship phones. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus comes in at $999 / \u00a3949 / AU$1,549, while prices for the iPhone 13 Pro Max start at $1,099 / \u00a31,049 / AU$1,849. In comparison, both new Google phones appear to be bargains, although bear in mind that they aren\u2019t as technically powerful.",
    "The Pixel 6 is available in three colors, with the 256GB storage model available in Stormy Black (grey/black) and Sorta Seafoam (blue/green), with Kinda Coral (pink/red) only available in the 128GB of storage option. To avoid any confusion, some US carriers have opted to sell only the former two colors \u2013 or just Stormy Black.",
    "If you want a 512GB variant, you won't find one for the Pixel 6. The Pixel 6 Pro is available with that much storage in the US and Australia, but that's even limited to certain colors.",
    "The Google Pixel 6 sports a new look that was officially revealed months before the phones launched. Perhaps this was to ready the public for the radical redesign over the more generic-looking Google Pixel 5, which had a single-color rear marked only by a subtle fingerprint sensor and square camera block.",
    "The new Pixel 6\u2019s rear, on the other hand, is two-tone and split by a horizontal camera block that spans the width of the phone. It\u2019s a bold design, to be sure, and the joke comparisons to Star Trek\u2019s Geordi La Forge are plentiful. It\u2019s certainly unique, and will possibly be a dealbreaker for those who would like a more modest camera array on their phone. The Pixel 6 will certainly require a unique case as a result \u2013 and it feels borderline necessary.",
    "Google does include a silicon Pixel 6 case in the box, with additional bumpers above and below the camera gap, to ensure the glass doesn\u2019t scratch against the surface on which you place the phone. We don\u2019t feel particularly confident that it would survive a drop that directly impacted the phone\u2019s rear, however; nor we aren\u2019t sure if the glass on the rear is of the Gorilla Glass Victus protecting the front.",
    "Nevertheless, we kept the Pixel 6 in the official Google case throughout testing, and while it doesn\u2019t add much weight, it did make the already generously-sized phone feel bigger \u2013 which might be alarming for those who like smaller handsets.",
    "With or without the case, the Pixel 6 won\u2019t lay flat on a desk, with the sizeable camera bump causing the ramp-like inclination.",
    "However, unlike the Pixel 5, iPhone 13 and Galaxy S21 ranges, the full-width camera bar on the Pixel 6 means the handset doesn\u2019t rock on prodding the screen. The latest model ranges from both Apple and Samsung continue to see their camera blocks placed in a corner of the device, making for an unbalanced posture when the phones are placed on a flat surface.",
    "Something else the camera bar influences is the Pixel 6\u2019s weight. At 207g, the handset is heavier than the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro, as well as the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. Pick it up and you\u2019ll find the Pixel 6 is top-heavy, requiring a firm grip when held in one hand to ensure its safety. The ungainly balance, weight, and camera block jutting out from the back mean the phone is less svelte than other handsets. You may be slower pulling it out of a pocket or a bag, and find it catches on the way out.",
    "The Pixel 6 has a glass rear, instead of the metal wrapped around the back and sides of the Pixel 5, but the new phone does have a similar matte finish to its metal frame, with quality material that doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Both the power and volume keys reside along the right edge of the handset, with the latter falling relatively well under thumb. The power button will be a slight reach for those with smaller hands, but its placement isn\u2019t terrible.",
    "IP68 dust- and water-resistance means the Pixel 6 should happily survive a trip to the beach or a quick plunge in the bath.",
    "Overall, the Google Pixel 6 isn\u2019t as curved as the Pixel 4 and Pixel 5-series phones, with its more straight edges and less-rounded corners resulting in a look that\u2019s not wholly dissimilar to the Sony Xperia 1 III. It does feel a bit wider, though, which may lead users to fumble it when handling the phone; it isn\u2019t really suited for one-handed use.",
    "However, where it excels is for watching media \u2013 and listening to it. We loved the Pixel 4\u2019s speakers, and we\u2019re continued fans of the Pixel 6\u2019s audio, which sounds evenly balanced among highs and lows. Other handsets have uneven splits between their dual speakers (typically around the earpiece and next to the power port), with treble or bass favoring one or the other; but the Pixel 6 feels much more even, with its two speakers delivering a more even mix.",
    "The increased weight and less cutesy design help to create the more mature aesthetic Google is apparently aiming for with the Pixel 6, helping it look and feel like a real premium contender.",
    "There\u2019s no headphone jack here, which keeps the Pixel 6 in line with the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4 before it. If you\u2019re a fan of wired listening then you\u2019ll need to keep your fingers crossed that a Pixel 6a arrives with a 3.5mm port \u2013 Google has, to date, reatained this connection for its cheaper \u2018a\u2019 series handsets.",
    "The Pixel 6\u2019s 6.4-inch OLED display is the biggest screen included on a Pixel phone, with the exception of the Pixel 6 Pro with its 6.7-inch screen, topping even the 6.3-inch Google Pixel 4 XL from 2019.",
    "The Full HD Plus 2400 x 1080 resolution here (so not QHD) equates to 441 pixels per inch, which is on a par with other phones around the price (and even with some pricier options such as the Samsung Galaxy S21).",
    "But in side-by-side comparisons between the Pixel 6 and its pricier Pixel 6 Pro sibling \u2013 which does have a QHD (3120 x 1440) display \u2013 we couldn\u2019t really determine much difference in detail watching identical media (a 4K YouTube video scaled to each phone\u2019s respective resolution). In fact, it wasn\u2019t until we got within inches of both phones that we could discern any difference, and even then, it was very minimal.",
    "The display does tend towards a more vibrant mix of colors than handsets such as the iPhone 12 Pro \u2013 and that isn\u2019t only in the overall palette, either. The Pixel 6\u2019s OLED screen displayed greater contrast in adjacent colors, going from brighter to darker hues; side-by-side evaluation of contrast saw the iPhone 12 Pro\u2019s display flatten more of the color together.",
    "The big update to the Pixel 6 display is its size, but the faster refresh rate, as seen on its predecessor, is welcome too. It\u2019s a 90Hz screen, which makes navigating the UI and browsing websites far smoother. While the difference over previous panels is more slight compared to the 120Hz refresh rate on the Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s display, the Pixel 6 price is lower than many of its 120Hz rivals, and 90Hz is likely sufficient for most users. It\u2019s certainly better than the static browsing on a 60Hz refresh rate screen.",
    "The Pixel 6 doesn\u2019t come packing a greater camera count than its predecessor (you\u2019ll have to upgrade to the Pixel 6 Pro for a telephoto shooter), but the suite has been upgraded with higher-megapixel cameras and software, which Google asserts is empowered by its Tensor chipset.",
    "However, the proof is in the photos \u2013 and whether compared to images captured on a flagship such as the iPhone 12 Pro, or last year\u2019s Google phones such as the Google Pixel 5a, the Pixel 6 takes better photos. There\u2019s more nuance in the color and shadows, along with more true-to-life temperature that reflects real conditions.",
    "On the rear, the Pixel 6 has a 50-megapixel main shooter with an 82-degree field of view and f/1.85 aperture, and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor with 114-degree field of view and f/2.2 aperture.",
    "The Pixel 6 also includes a 8-megapixel front-facing camera, in a punch-hole at the center-top of the display, which has an 84-degree field of view and f/2.0 aperture.",
    "There\u2019s no optical zoom available here then, as there is on the Pro model, but the Pixel 6\u2019s \u2018Super Res Zoom\u2019 does deliver a 7x digital zoom.",
    "Note that digital zoom isn\u2019t as good as optical, since it crops into the image to artificially get you closer to the action, resulting in a slight loss in image quality. As would be expected, the Pixel 6\u2019s zoom capabilities are limited. Don\u2019t expect to get much clarity beyond 2x zoom \u2013 for that, opt for the Pixel 6 Pro instead.",
    "The new Motion mode is a mixed bag. It\u2019s possible to achieve some fun imagery out of its two sub-modes, Action Pan and Long Exposure, for photos that capture a still subject with motion around it and blurring light trails, respectively. The former is easier to pull off, although there aren\u2019t any instructions on how you do so; you\u2019ll have to figure it out on your own. As for Night mode, the Pixel 6 improves on its predecessor here, too, producing far less noise when illuminating low-light photos.",
    "While it's not surprising that the Google Pixel 6 takes great photos given how much its predecessors have been capable of, the Pixel line has been doing wonders with 12MP cameras for years \u2013 and we wondered what Google's new phone could do with its 50MP main camera and Tensor chipset.",
    "The answer is: a lot. Here's a few samples \u2013 note the rich colors adjacent to each other, unlike other phones that flatten patches of color. Also note how clear the sky is captured, which is often a weak point of other phones' cameras.",
    "Here's Portrait mode:",
    "And a low-light photo of a sunset \u2013 compare the shadows in the clouds and color gradient on the horizon in the Pixel 6 (first photo) compared to the same details taken by the iPhone 12 Pro (second photo) and Google Pixel 5a (third photo) \u2013 the latter of which had the same 12MP main camera and Snapdragon 765G chipset as the company's former flagship Google Pixel 5.",
    "And here is Night Mode, capturing a park bench with zero ambient light. While the phone lets you zoom in and shoot in Night Mode, we strongly recommend against it, as all our shots attempting the same were extremely blurry. Note the difference between the Pixel 6 (first photo) and the night modes of the iPhone 12 Pro (second photo) and even the Google Pixel 5a (third photo), which have far more grain:",
    "As far as the new Motion modes, we couldn't get the Long Exposure sub-setting to work, but we had fun with Action Pan, which lets you immobilize a subject and blur the world around them. It works better with subjects bicycling or jogging (first photos) \u2013 we struggled to capture a car moseying around a parking lot (second photos). Helpfully, the Pixel 6 also saves static photos of the blurred image, making for great compare and contrasts here:",
    "Finally, here are a pair of selfies. Note that the Pixel 6 Pro's front-facing camera does have a wider field of view than the Pixel 6's selfie shooter, allowing you to get more friends in for group shots. But the latter does just fine, with good sky detail in the regular shot, which is something nearly every phone's front-facing camera struggles with. The Portrait mode shot doesn't have much sky detail, but that's not really needed in a depth shot anyway:",
    "The Google Pixel 6\u2019s specs were another great mystery: just how good would the Google-designed Tensor chipset be? While benchmarks don\u2019t see the phone outperforming any leading flagships to any great extent, the phone does have enough power to run smoothly and take great photos.",
    "The Pixel 6\u2019s other key specs are respectable, with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. As noted before, it\u2019s only the 128GB model that comes in the Kind Coral hue.",
    "The combination of 8GB of RAM and the Tensor chip saw the Pixel 6 achieve an average Geekbench 5 score of 2837 \u2013 which is just above the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 at 2801, and below the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus at 3034. Note that the Pixel 6 Pro didn\u2019t score particularly higher at 2895, suggesting the Tensor chipset may not hit the performance levels of Snapdragon 888-powered phones.",
    "Whether that matters is another question: like the Samsung phones mentioned above, the Pixel 6 breezes through browsing, watching media, and other tasks, without a hitch. Those scores are also notably higher than that of the Google Pixel 5, which, with its Snapdragon 765G chipset, got a Geekbench 5 score of 1600.",
    "The Pixel 6 runs Android 12 out of the box, complete with Material You and a host of other upgrades. Most are refinements of the Android UI, such as the new Security settings page that collects all security risks in an easy-to-understand color-coded checklist. However, many other improvements are small and tough to notice, such as faster orientation recognition when switching between portrait and landscape on rotating the phone in camera mode. In other words, while they might not be seismic, they offer plenty of quality-of-life improvements.",
    "We can at least be relieved that Google likely won\u2019t repeat the mistake of hobbling its new phones with inadequate battery life. The Google Pixel 6 has a 4,612mAh capacity, up from the 4,080mAh of last year\u2019s Pixel 5, and far above the measly 2,800mAh in the Pixel 4.",
    "While the Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s battery offers even more capacity at 5,000mAh battery, the Pixel 6 comfortably makes it through a full day of use. Google claims the phone will last for up to 24 hours, which can be extended to 48 hours with the help of the Extreme Battery Saver mode, although we\u2019d expect less than that with our testing.",
    "The Pixel 6 supports fast charging up to 30W \u2013 and while a USB-C to USB-C cable is included in the box, there\u2019s no plug adapter. It appears Google has joined other phone makers in the war on e-waste, so you\u2019ll need to source one yourself.",
    "We managed to recharge the Pixel 6 to a respectable 47% in 30 minutes \u2013 the phone maxes out at 30W of charging via the company\u2019s 30W USB-C charger, which is an optional extra you\u2019ll have to pay for. In testing, we achieved a little over 80% charge in an hour.",
    "It\u2019s nowhere near the fastest charging we\u2019ve seen: at the top of our list is the Xiaomi 11T Pro, which can charge to full in just 17 minutes via its 120W charger. Even other Android flagships with less absurd fast-charging \u2013 the Asus ROG 5 supports 60W charging, and the OnePlus 9 can hit 65W \u2013 would leave the Pixel 6 in the dust.",
    "The Pixel 6 does also support wireless charging (up to 21W), enabling you to pop the device onto a charging mat without the need to fumble for a cable. This is comparible to the 10W and 15W maximum wireless charging rates typical of other phones.",
