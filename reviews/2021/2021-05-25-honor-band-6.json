  "verdict": "Unless you own a Huawei or Apple smartphone you can\u2019t use connected GPS with the Honor Band 6, which renders it useless for workout tracking. It also has flaws with a few other key health and lifestyle features, and lags behind in areas where rivals excel, and its low price and lightweight design aren\u2019t sufficient compensation.",

    "Of the many smartphone companies that also make wearables, Honor is arguably one of the best \u2013 its smartwatches are feature-flush and affordable, and its fitness trackers are great low-cost health and workout devices.",
    "The affordable fitness tracker market is a busy one, with the Honor Band range rivalling the Huawei Band and Xiaomi Mi Smart Band ranges, the Oppo Band, the OnePlus Band, the Samsung Galaxy Fit and more.",
    "Honor used to reign supreme, with its Band 5 being one of our favorites, and this introduction may seem to contradict the negative verdict and low score for the Honor Band 6 you see above. This is the first of the company\u2019s wearables we\u2019ve been disappointed with in a long time \u2013 it has a few major issues, and misses out on some key features, and as a result it\u2019s hard to recommend.",
    "Our first, and biggest, problem with the Honor Band 6 is with its GPS. While some wearables have built-in GPS, so that they can track location and distance, most (especially at this price point) have connected GPS, so they use your smartphone\u2019s location to gather their data.",
    "The Honor Band 6 only lets you do this if you have a Huawei or Honor phone running the brand\u2019s EMUI Android overlay, or an iPhone \u2013 otherwise you\u2019re not able to use connected GPS at all. If you own a different device, the Honor Band 6 won\u2019t record your workout map, and will return pretty inaccurate distance data too (as it\u2019s based on other factors like steps).",
    "The lack of this very basic feature makes the Honor Band 6 hard to recommend on its own (unless you have one of these phones, of course), but there\u2019s more. We found sleep tracking was fairly inaccurate, while some key workout modes, like outdoor cycling, aren\u2019t available on the watch unless you\u2019re in the cool GPS crew.",
    "So ignoring the \u2018fitness\u2019 part of \u2018fitness tracker\u2019, what\u2019s the Honor Band 6 like as a standard wrist companion? Well, it\u2019s not as bad \u2013 notification handling, weather reports and timers and alarms all work fine, the battery lasts a fairly long time, and the band\u2019s pretty small.",
    "Does the band\u2019s low cost redeem it? That\u2019s hard to ascertain \u2013 while it\u2019s definitely a budget band, it launched for a higher price than the Honor Band 5, although its price dropped well below that of its predecessor almost immediately.",
    "We\u2019ll go into more detail about our issues with the Honor Band 6 below, but if you\u2019re just reading this review for our buying advice, it would be \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d. Instead check out the Honor Band 5, or one of the other devices on our list of the best cheap fitness trackers.",
    "The Honor Band 6 launched for $50 (roughly \u00a335, AU$65), and is available from online retailer AliExpress \u2013 it\u2019s not on sale from Honor\u2019s website or better-known online retailers like Amazon.",
    "AliExpress is an import website, so if you order the device it\u2019ll take a while to get to you, likely around a month. There are plenty of listings for it, with different companies importing it from different countries, but the official Honor listing is this one.",
    "The Honor Band 6 was available from AliExpress for less than its list price almost immediately upon its release \u2013 we saw it listed for \u00a326 in the UK for example \u2013 so if you really want to buy this fitness tracker you should be able to get it for a low price if you shop around.",
    "The Honor Band 6 brings some design improvements over the Band 5 \u2013 in particular, it seems that some of the DNA of the Honor Watch ES (a pricier Honor smartwatch) is here. It\u2019s your standard body-and-two-straps design, although the straps are a little harder to remove than on most bands.",
    "The strap is made of silicone, which isn\u2019t the most comfortable band material in the world, but it\u2019s standard for this kind of tracker, and it can be replaced with a third-party strap if you prefer. It has plenty of holes for an easy fit and is really long too, so you don\u2019t need to worry about your wrist being too big.",
    "The body is noticeably larger than that of the Band 5 and rival fitness trackers, mainly thanks to the large display. It has a single button, which brings up the app menu, and some sensors on the back.",
    "The Honor Band 6 is water-resistant up to 50 meters, and though there\u2019s no official IP rating, that water resistance pretty much guarantees that it\u2019s splash-proof, and safe for swimming.",
    "While the Honor Band 5 had a 0.95-inch display, on the Band 6 it\u2019s bumped up to 1.47 inches, a sizeable increase that makes menus, options and figures easier to see. It\u2019s a touchscreen that takes up the entirety of the front of the body \u2013 there\u2019s no front button here, as on the Band 5 \u2013 and has a 194 x 368 resolution.",
    "There are plenty of watch faces to choose from; you\u2019re not limited to a select few, as has been the case with previous Honor fitness trackers, as you can download more via the app. You can even use your own photos as the face, an opportunity we never pass up.",
    "The Honor Band 6 ticks all the boxes for everyday use. Notification handling works well, weather reports are fairly accurate, and ambient activity tracking was largely accurate.",
    "There\u2019s constant heart rate tracking and stress monitoring, as well as step and active-hour counting. You can also set up reminders to alert you if you\u2019re idle for too long",
    "Less impressive is sleep monitoring, which felt inaccurate at times. While the feedback you receive, which includes a sleep score, breakdowns of the types of sleep you have, and a night-by-night comparison, is useful, it\u2019s not always reliable, especially when it comes to start and finish times.",
    "The sleep tracker often conflated \u2018lying in bed\u2019 with \u2018being asleep\u2019, so that if we lay in bed reading before sleep, or dozed in bed before getting up, our overall sleep time could be artificially inflated. For some reason, we could even use the band and it wouldn\u2019t detect that we were awake.",
    "Another issue we found with the band in everyday use was with music control, as the band often told us we were listening to a song that was actually a few tracks back in the playlist. The controls, such as skipping songs and pausing, worked fine though.",
    "A few other features were useful though like alarms, stopwatches, timers and a Find My Phone function that set off an alarm so loud that people a block over could hear where our smartphone was.",
    "Honor claims the Band 6 has a 14-day battery life, but we can\u2019t quite concur \u2013 11-12 days feels a better estimate of how long you can go between charges, which is pretty much fine for a fitness tracker, and means you won\u2019t have to be constantly checking your battery level. Charging takes about an hour, and is done via a dock that comes with the band, which plugs into any USB port.",
    "Our biggest issue with the Honor Band 6 is that it just wasn\u2019t great for tracking our runs, the reason being that its connected GPS won\u2019t work for many people.",
    "For the uninitiated, \u2018connected\u2019 GPS is where a fitness tracker or watch gains its location data from a smartphone it\u2019s paired to via Bluetooth. Low-cost bands tend to use this, instead of having their own GPS.",
    "On the Honor Band 6, for some reason, you can only use connected GPS if you have a Huawei phone or an iPhone. The Huawei Health app (Honor used to be a sub-brand of Huawei, and this band is their last collaboration) states that: \u2018If you want to record your workout route, make sure [...] your phone is running EMUI 5.0 or later, or iOS 9.0 or later\u2019.",
    "So if your phone runs stock Android, as the phone we used while testing the band does, or if you have a device from Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo or any other Android phone brand, you\u2019re out of luck. We couldn\u2019t see any mention in the marketing materials of the fact that this key fitness feature doesn\u2019t work on the vast majority of phones, and we\u2019re sorry that you had to learn such an important detail via this review.",
    "Technically, there\u2019s a way to get location data for your workouts. The Huawei Health app lets you track your workouts, and when you press the \u2018go\u2019 button on the app, your fitness tracker also starts a countdown. But not only does having to use your smartphone defeat the object of having a fitness tracker, there are discrepancies between the time and location reported by the band and by the phone \u2013 and furthermore, the Workout Record function of the band doesn\u2019t log these workouts.",
    "So, unless you\u2019ve got a phone from Huawei or Apple, we wouldn\u2019t recommend picking up this fitness tracker.",
    "The Honor Band 6 features 10 exercise modes: Outdoor run, Indoor run, Outdoor walk, Indoor walk, Indoor cycle, Pool swim, Elliptical, Rower and \u2018Other\u2019. There\u2019s also an Outdoor cycle mode, but as with GPS tracking, this is exclusive to Huawei or Apple users.",
    "If you\u2019re not using this connected GPS, distance tracking on runs was pretty inaccurate (as it\u2019s based on some other factors, like steps) and we frequently found that the watch reported distances that were way off. When we went on our standard 8km run for example, the watch thought we\u2019d completed less than 7km.",
    "Tracking that doesn\u2019t use GPS isn\u2019t so bad though. There\u2019s steps, cadence, stride, heart rate and pace, which should be useful for many users.",
    "There are a few more modes on the watch too. There\u2019s Sp02 monitoring, which takes about 10 seconds to give you a reading, and female cycle tracking, which charts your menstrual timings and informs you of your fertile window, although activating this requires jumping through some hoops on the app.",
    "We\u2019ve already described the necessity of using the app for some users, but generally, Huawei Health is one of the better wearable tie-in apps we\u2019ve tested \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t get a chance to shine here.",
    "You can see routes you\u2019ve taken on workouts, with a kilometer-by-kilometer breakdown of your exercise (although, unless you use the workaround we detailed above, you won\u2019t get workout maps). You can also see a more detailed breakdown of all the metrics tracked.",
    "It\u2019s easy to access other kinds of data tracked too, like your sleep habits or stress levels.",
    "Huawei Health can also be used to change your watch face \u2013 there are plenty of options that you can install from an online gallery, though we always like to use our own photos, which you can do here. You can even select multiple photos, turning your watch face into an on-the-wrist slideshow.",
    "If we have one complaint about Huawei Health, it\u2019s that it can sometimes be buggy. We\u2019ve never managed to log in using SMS, on this or any other device, as the servers always seem to be down, and we had trouble pairing with the Band 6 with our phone, as the app\u2019s device list didn\u2019t populate for the first few days of our testing period.",
    "A Huawei Health update mid-way through our testing period caused us to reconsider our previously-positive thoughts on the app. Now, when tracking workouts via your phone, if the phone isn\u2019t in use (so is locked), an always-on data display fills the screen. The display also provides workout controls, with an option to pause the timer or mute the distance announcer, and it also shows where you are on a map.",
    "However this display has multiple negative effects on a workout. The \u2018pause run\u2019 button is really easy to accidentally hit with your hand; the display is constantly on, which drains your phone\u2019s battery quickly; and there\u2019s no obvious way to minimize it, even if you unlock your phone. In fact, the only way we could access Spotify to change music on a run was to open that app via the swipe-down menu on our phone.",
    "We could find an option in the settings to stop this map appearing, and the aforementioned issues had a negative effect on our workouts.",
