    "The new Huawei MateView isn\u2019t like most other PC monitors. The big difference? Tallness. The 3:2 aspect ratio of its 28.2-inch LCD panel is designed to match other products in the Huawei \u2018Mate\u2019 portfolio, most obviously the MateBook laptops, all of which also sport 3:2 aspect displays.",
    "With that taller aspect ratio comes an unusual 4K-plus native resolution of 3,840 by 2,560 pixels. That comes to a grand total of 9.8 million pixels and a fairly significant step up on the 8.3 million pixels of plain old 4K.",
    "The 3:2 aspect works really well in Huawei\u2019s MateBook PCs where the increased vertical space for viewing documents and webpages really pays off.",
    "That\u2019s less of an issue on a desktop display. Arguably, for this type of premium panel the ability to view multiple documents in parallel is just as important. The Huawei MateView will make a reasonable fist of two pages or documents side-by-side. But at this relatively loft price point, several ultrawide monitors better optimised for that multiple-document-viewing thing are available.",
    "Still, the Huawei MateView has a few more unusual tricks up its sleek, slim-bezelled sleeves. For starters, there\u2019s wireless display mirroring with support for both smartphones and laptops, including keyboard and mouse support for the former.",
    "The catch is that the wireless phone connectivity is only compatible with select Huawei handsets and the wireless PC interface is limited to 2K resolution.",
    "Then there\u2019s the SmartBar, which is a touch sensitive panel along the bottom of the display which provides access to the Huawei MateView\u2019s various (and rather limited in image quality terms) settings. It\u2019s a neat alternative to a battery of buttons, but isn\u2019t hugely responsive or reliable in use.",
    "As for audio, Huawei reckons the twin speakers built into the stand deliver theatre-level sound (that\u2019s an exaggeration, they\u2019re merely adequate), while the dual microphones dampen ambient noise.",
    "Rounding out the feature set is a trio of inputs, namely DisplayPort (of the Mini variety, a MiniDP to DP cable is included), HDMI and USB-C. The USB-C interfaces includes 65W of device charging power for slick and a two-port USB-A hub, single-cable laptop connectivity. Note that only the DisplayPort and USB-C interfaces support the panel\u2019s native resolution at 60Hz. The HDMI socket is limited to 50Hz at native resolution.",
    "And what of the minor matter of image quality? Nearly 10 million pixels on a 28.2-inch panel makes for a very sharp and detailed image. Fonts look particularly good in MacOS, but the Windows operating system looks super sharp, too. Both sRGB and DCI-P3 presets are available (Huawei claims an impressive 98 percent coverage of the latter) and, as it happens, the default colour balance is a very good match for the factory calibration of Apple\u2019s MacBook displays.",
    "Rated at 500 nits, the Huawei MateView doesn\u2019t feel quite that bright in practice, but colors are gorgeous and natural, while the viewing angles from the 10-bit IPS panel are excellent. The only problem is that the panel\u2019s anti-glare coating is a little opaque, which has the effect of reducing subjective contrast, which is a pity. Oh HDR support is limited to DisplayHDR 400 certification, so there\u2019s no local dimming or any of that fancy mini-LED backlighting stuff.",
    "But did we mention how slick this panel looks, generally? With its 94% screen-to-body ratio and minimalist brushed-allow looks (it\u2019s actually mostly plastic, but at least the stand adjusts for both tilt and height), it feels a lot like the relatively affordable display Mac users wish Apple would make. For everyone else, it\u2019s a very sweet and unusually proportioned IPS monitor with one or two slight niggles."
