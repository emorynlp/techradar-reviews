    "With the A6G series, Hisense has done that classically \u2018Hisense\u2019 thing of delivering a big, well-specified television for really not very much money at all. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision HDR? Some HDMI 2.1 action and eARC? Voice control and a half-decent smart TV interface? At this price, Hisense, you are spoiling us.",
    "Well, up to a point. There are definite positives to the native 4K pictures the A6G is capable of delivering, and it\u2019s not the worst upscaler of Full HD content you ever saw either. It\u2019s even decently rapid as a gaming monitor.",
    "It\u2019s not all that bright or all that dark a picture it serves up, though, and it\u2019s pretty flat and 2D too. It\u2019s not at all comfortable upscaling properly lo-res content, either, and the less said about the sound it makes the better.",
    "None of this automatically makes the Hisense A6G poor value for money, of course. But it needs more excuses made for it than a lot of Hisense TVs we\u2019ve seen lately.",
    "The Hisense A6G is part of the Hisense TV 2021 collection and is on sale now. In the United Kingdom the 55-inch we\u2019re testing here is available for around \u00a3429, though it can also be had in 43-inch (\u00a3329), 50-inch (\u00a3399) and 65-inch (\u00a3549) versions as well. There's a 75-inch model that\u2019s due any day now, but we've yet to hear pricing information on it.",
    "In the United States, pricing is even more aggressive: the 43-inch version is $309, while the 50-inch goes for $379 and this 55-inch will set you back $429. The 65-inch model is $509 and the massive 75-inch only costs $789.",
    "In Australia, meanwhile, there\u2019s no confirmation the A6G will be made available. However, the Hisense A7G is on sale, though, and it adds understanding of Dolby Atmos soundtracks to a spec-sheet that\u2019s otherwise identical to that of the A6G. The A7G line-up goes for AU$899 (43in), AU$999 (50in), AU$1,099 (55in), AU$1,499 (65in) and AU$2,299 (75in). Australian maximalists will be pleased to learn they have an 85-inch version available to them for AU$3,499.",
    "It\u2019s unusual to find any departure from the accepted idea of \u2018design\u2019 where televisions are concerned, and that goes double when the TV in question is priced as aggressively as the Hisense A6G. So it follows that this TV looks reassuringly like a TV, with no gratuitous design flourishes to be seen.",
    "The direct backlight arrangement (which Hisense refers to as \u2018DLED\u2019) dictates a chassis depth that\u2019s on the bulky side - at 74mm the 55A6G doesn\u2019t make all that compelling a case for wall-hanging. But it\u2019s neat and tidy enough if you decide to stand it on its simple \u2018boomerang\u2019 feet, just as long as your shelf, table-top or what-have-you is wide enough - those feet are fairly far apart.",
    "Build quality is perfectly acceptable, and while there\u2019s nothing luxurious about the feel of the plastics from which the Hisense is mostly made, there are no creaks or groans from the frame either. Keep the price uppermost in your mind and there\u2019s little to be disappointed about here.",
    "As far as specification goes, it\u2019s a similar story: not much about the way the Hisense A6G is equipped would tip you off to the fact it\u2019s been built to compete right at the entry level of the market. It\u2019s compatible with HLG, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision HDR standards - which is not something most far pricier 55in TVs can boast - and it has plenty of connectivity. Three HDMI sockets, all of which can deal with the ALLM and VRR aspects of HDMI 2.1 specification and one which is eARC-enabled, are joined by a pair of USB inputs (one 3.0, one 2.0), a CI card slot, Ethernet socket, RF aerial for the digital and analogue tuners, and a composite video input for your properly vintage equipment. Wi-Fi takes care of wireless functionality, and there are digital optical and analogue 3.5mm outputs.",
    "Overall performance is handled by a quad-core processor, about which Hisense is far from forthcoming. It\u2019s fast enough to get input lag down below 20ms when in \u2018game\u2019 mode, and it copes with a pretty comprehensive smart TV offering, though, so it would seem to be potent enough in operational terms at least.",
    "Hisense is quite promiscuous where operating systems are concerned - with the A6G it\u2019s gone with it\u2019s in-house VIDAA system. And as far as these things go when they\u2019re not Samsung\u2019s Tizen or LG\u2019s webOS, VIDAA U5 is pretty decent. It can be customized, which is always nice, and app support is pretty good (inasmuch as the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are available, while Apple TV and Disney+ are not).",
    "In the US, however, you'll find the A6G comes equipped with Android TV. Android TV, especially on entry-level TVs like this can be a bit slower than some of their high-end counterparts but at least Android TV is well-stocked with apps. You'll find all the basics here, and the smart platform will do its best to recommend shows and movies you might like based on your previous viewing history.",
    "Amazon Alexa voice control is built in (it\u2019s accessible via the Remote NOW app), or there\u2019s the remote control handset. It\u2019s big and comprehensive, with something approaching a plethora of direct access buttons - so if you simply cannot wait another second for access to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Freeview Play or, um, Rakuten TV, you\u2019re covered.",
    "Between the HDMI inputs and the smart TV interface, it\u2019s the work of a moment to get some native 4K content on board. And thanks to set-up menus that are either mercifully brief or frustratingly restricted (depending on your point of view), it won\u2019t be long before you\u2019ve achieved the most pleasing picture balance available.",
    "With a Netflix-derived 4K Dolby Vision stream of Enola Holmes up and running, there are obvious and numerous positives to the way the Hisense goes about its work. Detail levels, for example, are respectably high - and that\u2019s true of even the finest details of texture or skin-tone. There\u2019s very agreeable insight into darker tones, without the rather artificial cast some screens can succumb to when trying to eke out the minutiae from dimly lit scenes.",
    "Motion-handling, too, is more than acceptable. The most complex on-screen movement can momentarily betray the amount of work the A6G is getting through, but for the vast majority of the time it simply takes a firm grip of motion and describes it faithfully. The stability and authority the Hisense demonstrates puts it well ahead of any number of \u2018entry-level\u2019 alternatives from any number of rival manufacturers.",
    "It\u2019s similarly accomplished where colour fidelity is concerned, even if it\u2019s not capable of delivering the tiniest variations in tone and shade that some much more expensive televisions can manage. The balance here between \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018vivid\u2019 is nicely struck, and even with content that relies on an overdriven colour palette (anything at all from the \u2018Marvel\u2019 franchise, for instance) colours stay the right side of \u2018searing\u2019.",
    "There\u2019s a definite flatness to the images the Hisense serves up, though, an overt two-dimensionality where plenty of modestly priced alternatives can generate half-decent depth of field. And while we\u2019re being mildly picky, it\u2019s safe to say the 55A6G isn\u2019t capable of delivering actual black - instead the best it can muster is a variety of extremely deep grey. Combined with the screen\u2019s lack of outright brightness, it means contrasts are understated and there\u2019s a definite lack of \u2018pop\u2019 when white tones dominate the screen.",
    "As an upscaler, the Hisense is reasonably adept with 1080p content and all at sea with anything less information-rich. Taking a Full HD image and making it fit the screen doesn\u2019t impact too badly on detail levels or colour fidelity, and motion remains admirably smooth and stable too. But edges can get a bit restless, and the depth of field that is at such a premium with 4K stuff disappears altogether. But taking some DVD-borne information, say, or (worst-case scenario) some daytime TV broadcasts gives the A6G what used to be called \u2018the vapours\u2019. Detail levels fall off a cliff, to be replaced by ambiguity and noisiness. Few are the televisions capable of making pictures look simultaneously soft and edgy, but the Hisense 55A6G is one of them.",
    "There are many TVs, at all sorts of prices, which make us suggest you buy a soundbar. The Hisense A6G is a TV that makes us shout \u2018BUY A SOUNDBAR\u2019 at the tops of our voices. It\u2019s fitted with an audio system of two full-range drivers powered by a total of 16 watts - and while Hisense may have been shooting for \u2018smooth and inoffensive\u2019 it\u2019s actually ended up with \u2018bland and uninvolving\u2019.",
    "Dialogue is distinct, to be fair, and the top of the frequency range isn\u2019t as zizzy as it might have been. But low frequencies are basically absent, and at anything other than very modest volume levels the Hisense sounds asthmatic. You don\u2019t have to spend very much money at all on a soundbar that will wipe the floor with the audio system fitted to the A6G.",
