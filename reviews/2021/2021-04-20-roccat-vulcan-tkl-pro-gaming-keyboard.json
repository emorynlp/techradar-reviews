A tenkeyless gaming keyboard, it boasts the brand\u2019s Titan optical switch that\u2019s both impressive in performance and quiet in operation. It\u2019s a beaut as well, with a classy brushed gunmetal finish and floating keys that showcase its customizable RGB lighting brilliantly.",

    "The new addition to the Vulcan line, the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro, doesn\u2019t exactly go full compact, like the host of mini gaming keyboards that have recently hit the streets. This one just sacrifices the numeric keypad, only chopping a few inches off its original\u2019s form factor so that it fits small setups better, without completely abandoning the necessary bits like arrow keys.",
    "This strategy isn\u2019t exactly new. Gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition and Corsair K63 Wireless have done it years prior. However, Roccat adds its own spin to the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro, giving it the floating keys design that\u2019s an absolute stunner and those Titan optical switches that are just a pleasure to use.",
    "With a compact form factor, a gorgeous design, and extremely satisfying tactile feedback, the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro already has a lot to offer. But does it perform good enough for the price?",
    "At $159 (\u00a3149, AU$239), it isn\u2019t exactly the most affordable gaming keyboard of the lot. Though that price is also on par with some of the best gaming keyboards right now, full-size and otherwise. It\u2019s only about $50/\u00a340/AU$60 pricier than the Corsair K63 Wireless and $30/\u00a320/AU$20 more than the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition, and about just slightly cheaper than the full-sized gaming keyboards that have made it on the list.",
    "The Roccat Vulkan TKL\u2019s performance, design, and features should justify that price to serious gamers willing to invest money on gear. At the same time, it\u2019ll turn off others.",
    "For those folks, there are more affordable options, including the Roccat Vulcan TKL, the mechanical version of the Pro that costs a little less at $129/\u00a3119/AU$209. It boasts mostly the same design and features, only it has mechanical switches instead of optical \u2013 with a deeper actuation of 1.8mm (as opposed to the optical\u2019s 1.4mm). If we\u2019re being honest, however, it doesn\u2019t feel any better or worse when it comes to performance \u2013 or at least not enough that most people will notice.",
    "The only apparent differences are the feedback and the noise level. While both are comfortable and excellent to type on, the Pro has a bit more resistance and feels bouncier \u2013 not too much that it affects your overall typing experience, but enough to be noticeable. It\u2019s also a lot quieter. Both of these could be good or bad, depending on your personal preference.",
    "We appreciate the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro\u2019s quiet operation, and it also gives it a classier sort-of feel over the Vulcan TKL. Though we have to say that its overall design pretty much has that covered all on its own. There\u2019s no arguing that this is among the most appealing and elegant-looking gaming keyboards we\u2019ve ever tested.",
    "Those smooth and thin floating keys really allow the keyboard\u2019s customizable RGB lighting to take center stage so that it really lights up even in the daytime. Folks who feel like that brushed gunmetal finish has been overused might feel differently when they see it on the Vulcan TKL Pro, as Roccat has done such a marvelous job. The size of the keyboard helps as well. At 13.3 x 36.0 x 3.4 cm, it helps make your setup look cleaner and more minimal.",
    "Despite its size, there\u2019s also a lot of heft here. Roccat says that it\u2019s reinforced by a layer of aircraft-grade aluminum to make it stronger and more durable. Adding to the are the optical switches themselves, which are typically longer-lasting than mechanical switches.",
    "Roccat\u2019s Titan optical switches are rated at 100 million keystrokes. That means that if you\u2019re averaging at 8,000 keystrokes per hour and on your computer for 8 hours a day, this keyboard in theory should last you a little over four years \u2013 but that\u2019s when you\u2019re doing a whole lot of gaming and typing.",
    "Design extras include a media control section in the top right corner of the keyboard. There\u2019s not much here \u2013 only a dial and a button that controls the volume and set it to mute respectively. However, they are plenty useful as having quick access to volume like that makes things convenient.",
    "Being a compact gaming keyboard, the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro comes with a host of shortcuts. You\u2019ll find yourself using that FN button a lot, for better or worse, whether it\u2019s for media controls, toggling settings, or adjusting RGB lighting. Some gamers might find this a bit disruptive, but it does allow the Vulcan TKL Pro to still have full-sized keyboard capabilities. And it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll get used to in no time, especially if you do a lot of remapping and program a lot of macros for gaming.",
    "Speaking of which, you can do so on this keyboard via the Roccat Swarm software. It\u2019s a decently extensive one, touting three tabs that group customizations to General Features (for the keyboard\u2019s general settings), Key Assignment (for remapping and macros), and Key Illumination (for RGB lighting).",
    "On it, there\u2019s a lot you can do to truly personalize the keyboard and make it your own, from setting keypress sound feedback to per-key and pre-set zone RGB lighting customizations. Though these aren\u2019t as involved as the Key Assignment section where you can set remaps and program macros to your heart\u2019s content \u2013 or at least a whole bunch of macros to fill five onboard profiles. If you\u2019re feeling a little lazy, you can also put off creating macros to a later time, and use Roccat\u2019s catalog of 27 pre-set game macros.",
    "The Swarm is not the most extensive customization software out there, but there\u2019s definitely a lot you can do here to maximize the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro. Our only complaint is that it is a little finicky. We have found ourselves needing to use the Recover Tool as it refused to save any of the macros we set onto the keyboard at one point.",
    "The Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro\u2019s performance is impeccable. It\u2019s easy for new users to mistake that feeling of extra resistance as a sign that those keys require harder and deeper pressing. But, with a 1.4mm actuation, there\u2019s certainly no need for such finger workouts. The keyboard is responsive and speedy enough to register any light intentional presses.",
    "For a gaming keyboard this pricey, some might expect a bit more than just the standard 1,000Hz polling rate. After all, there are some compact keyboards out there with higher polling rates \u2013 namely, Corsair\u2019s K65 RGB Mini, which delivers a speedier 4,000Hz. However, most gamers won\u2019t notice a difference in performance.",
    "Testing the Roccat Vulkan TKL on games like Sayonara Wild Hearts and Rocket League where you\u2019re expected to react quickly and accurately, it has proven itself a dream to use. Gamers with light fingers will appreciate the fact that they don\u2019t have to press all the way down for the keys to register.",
    "Come to think of it, all gamers will. It reduces the force your fingers need to exert, minimizing fatigue, and it helps ensure that every key is registered in the most intense moments. Button mashers need not worry either, as it\u2019s also built to last.",
    "The Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro\u2019s performance is beautifully consistent as well. No matter whether we\u2019re playing something more laidback like Firewatch or something more intense like Doom: Eternal and Cyberpunk 2077, response times are fast and accurate with no missed presses or glaring latency.",
    "And, while this is a gaming keyboard, typing up documents and emails on it is also a great experience, thanks to that extra bit of bounce and quiet operation."
