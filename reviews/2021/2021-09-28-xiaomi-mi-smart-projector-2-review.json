  "verdict": "With its sleek compact design, in-built smart features, and decent picture performance there is a lot to love about the Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 if you have a dark enough room to use it in. However, its similarity to its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector makes this a sequel in name only.",

    "If you\u2019re looking for a compact projector (or outdoor projector) which can output a decent image and won\u2019t break the bank, the Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 ticks all of those boxes. However its similarity to its Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector predecessor has us confused about what's new about this new model.",
    "The design and features of both projectors match up exactly, offering you a Full HD (1080p) image in sizes from 60-inch to 120-inch \u2013 provided you have the wall space. The end result is a decent image that offers brilliant colors thanks to HDR10, but struggles with detail during darker scenes.",
    "To achieve the best picture quality you\u2019ll want to be in a pitch black room (or at least make it as dark as you can make it) as the 500 lumens bulb struggles to compete against other light sources. This means you\u2019ll be forced to watch at night or install black-out curtains, but you\u2019ll be happy with the results you can achieve.",
    "You\u2019ll also find the projector\u2019s built-in speakers offer a good audio performance that means external options might not be necessary.",
    "With the Mi Smart Projector 2\u2019s Android TV OS and Google Assistant support, you can watch (almost) any program or film from your favorite streaming services or can cast video straight from your smartphone.",
    "As there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an upgrade from the previous model, though, we\u2019d recommend keeping an eye on deals for the Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector, as with a new version now released you might find it offers much the same performance at a discount.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 launches in October in the UK, US and Australia. It\u2019s set to have a price tag of \u00a3549 in the UK (around $750 / AU$1035 according to current exchange rates). We\u2019ll update this review when we have more accurate pricing info across the other regions.",
    "The Mi Smart Projector 2 is nearly identical to the original Xiaomi Mi smart compact projector, from the shape, dimensions, color scheme and wraparound casing.",
    "That said, what you\u2019re getting is once again a decent compact projector that is small enough to easily carry around with you if you\u2019re looking for something a little more portable. The device measures 4.5 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches (115 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 150mm) and weighs just 2.8lbs (1.3kg).",
    "The only color option for the Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 sees it come in a white plastic shell, with a front face covered in a gray fabric. It\u2019s not ugly, nor is the projector stunning, so it shouldn\u2019t upstage the image it outputs \u2013 and it could blend in well with your home\u2019s d\u00e9cor.",
    "Ports wise the Mi Smart Projector 2 has the bare minimum to get by with one HDMI 2.0, one USB 2.0 and one audio output for headphones. With and Android TV OS and the ability to wirelessly cast to the projector, you\u2019ll probably be okay for basic connectivity \u2013 but if you like using a range of entertainment devices that rely on HDMI you\u2019ll need a splitter or a different device.",
    "The remote for the projector is incredibly simple, offering you just enough buttons for the basic functions and little else. You can activate the Google assistant, change the volume, go to the menu, navigate and select, and have a shortcut for Netflix.",
    "Our only issue with the controller is the lack of backlighting \u2013 an issue we found on the original Xiaomi Mi smart compact projector too. As you\u2019ll want to be in near darkness when using the projector, it can be difficult to make out the symbols on the all-black handset meaning you\u2019re forced to go by feel alone a lot of the time.",
    "The feature set is much the same as the previous projector too. The projector uses the Android TV OS to deliver many of your favorite streaming services. Apps and games from the Google Play Store. The built-in Google Assistant will also let you command the speaker with your voice, and search for content across all the different services that are available.",
    "During testing we did find that some apps weren\u2019t yet supported on the projector \u2013 such as Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and Apple Music. It's easy enough to cast videos to the projector from a smartphone, though. It seems like it might be an update issue, and we can update this review if an update does bring these services to the projector.",
    "It also has great focus and keystone controls so we were able to easily set up this projector to give us a great looking image from multiple different angles and locations around our testing room. The auto-focus and auto-keystone works best for a projector that is straight on to a screen, but manual controls take moments to sort out.",
    "Audio wise, this projector packs in two 5W speakers that support Dolby Audio that bring a decent sound. You almost certainly won\u2019t be blown away by the performance \u2013 and we\u2019d recommend using external speakers if you have them \u2013 but for built-in speakers they do a very good job.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 offers a decent picture quality and an absolutely enormous screen size if you have the space for it to accommodate its maximum 120-inch display \u2013 which it can achieve at a distance of three meters from a large enough surface.",
    "To put this projector through its paces we tested it out using the Marvel film Spider-Man: Homecoming. The projector dazzled us with its handling of bright colors (such as the superhero\u2019s bold red and blue suit) thanks to its four-channel LED RGB+BP and HDR10 technology.",
    "However, as with many other projectors at this price, it struggles during darker scenes. In Spider-Man: Homecoming this meant Vulture\u2019s dark suit and wings weren\u2019t as detailed as we might have liked, and the whole final act of the film (which is set at night) was harder to follow than moments set during the day.",
    "We also found the projector wasn\u2019t generally bright enough to combat ambient light; if the room wasn\u2019t in pitch darkness (or very near) the projected image could be difficult to see. If you want to get the most out of this projector you\u2019ll definitely want to use it at night or in a room where you can block out sunlight coming in through the windows.",
    "The last thing to note is that this projector can only output a Full HD image (1920 x 1080 pixels) rather than 4K. At this price you would struggle to find a higher quality image from a projector, but if you\u2019re weighing this up against a TV it\u2019s something you\u2019ll want to consider (as even budget sets can offer 4K at this price)."
