  "summary": "The Epos H3 Hybrid is the versatility king",
  "verdict": "The Epos H3 Hybrid headset is an excellent option for those who want the versatility of a wired pair of headphones and the freedom that wireless connectivity can offer. It\u2019s another solid headset from Epos, but some questionable design decisions and audio qualms hold it back. Still, it\u2019s one of the best headsets Nintendo Switch owners can buy, as you can listen to game audio when wired and chat on Discord or the Nintendo Online app via Bluetooth at the same time.",
  "pros": [
    "Works with all your devices",
    "Detachable boom mic",
    "Listen to Bluetooth and game audio simultaneously"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Noticeable audible hiss",
    "They can sound a little harsh",
    "Easy to drain the battery by mistake"

    "The Epos H3 Hybrid will undoubtedly appeal to those who want a great-sounding headset that can work on practically every device. The ability to use it wired and wireless simultaneously provides a level of freedom that helps justify the admittedly slightly higher price than we expect.",
    "The audio quality of the Epos H3 Hybrid is excellent, albeit hampered by slightly sharp high-end frequencies and an audible hiss when a 3.5 mm cable is connected. It\u2019s also frustratingly easy to drain the battery if you forget to turn the headset off, as it only powers down when disconnected from Bluetooth devices.",
    "Still, the Epos H3 Hybrid is incredibly comfortable to wear, offers great flexibility, and has an impressive overall sound that will please most users. We\u2019d wait until it\u2019s available on sale before picking it up, however.",
    "The Epos H3 Hybrid was released on September 14, 2021, for $179 / \u00a3160 / AU$259. That means it\u2019s noticeably more expensive than the Epos H3 at almost double the price, which retails for $119 / \u00a3109 / AU$179 but can often be found for less.",
    "The Epos H3 Hybrid comes in two color options: Ghost White and Onyx Black, and we\u2019re particularly fond of the white pair, which look fantastic alongside the Nintendo Switch OLED.",
    "At a glance, you probably think the Epos H3 Hybrid is identical to the Epos H3; however, it differs in several subtle ways. You\u2019ll find a physical button on the left earcup \u2013 which turns on the headset \u2013 as well as an LED indicator. A small in-built microphone rests above the power button. The built-in pinhole microphone lets you answer calls using the headset via Bluetooth. However, the audio quality isn\u2019t as good as the dedicated boom mic, as you might expect.",
    "On the right earcup, you\u2019ll find a Smart button for Bluetooth pairing and switching between EQs and surround sound when connecting to a PC. It also functions as a button to accept or reject calls when connected to a mobile device.",
    "The Epos H3 Hybrid also shares many design similarities with the excellent Epos H3. They\u2019re a closed-back pair of headphones, and you get the same super soft, enveloping angled earcups, flush volume dial, and flip-to-mute boom arm microphone as the cheaper Epos H3. They\u2019re also pleasingly lightweight at just 298 grams.",
    "However, the most notable design change that the Epos H3 Hybrid offers over the Epos H3 is that you can now remove the headset\u2019s boom mic, which attaches to the headset magnetically. The fact you couldn\u2019t remove the microphone was one of our biggest criticisms of the Epos H3, as it made wearing the headset outside the home a complete non-starter. Now that the microphone can be removed and reattached easily, it means you could feasibly wear the Epos H3 Hybrid headset while on your daily commute or when traveling. You also get a little plastic cover to pop over the exposed connector when the mic is detached, which is handy.",
    "The Epos H3 Hybrid delivers the same exceptional audio performance we\u2019ve grown to love from Epos\u2019 line of gaming headsets. You can expect incredibly detailed and clear sound, which means you can hear all the incidental details that other headsets can often muddy. The mids and lows are also expertly balanced, so you\u2019ll still get the satisfying thumps that accompany explosions and gunfire in games like Halo Infinite.",
    "Unfortunately, we found the Epos H3 Hybrid to be a touch too bright for our liking. For instance, Juliana\u2019s frequent radio calls in Deathloop tended to sound overly sharp, to the point where it caused some mild discomfort. We also disliked the fact the hybrid headphones give off a noticeable hiss whenever a 3.5 mm is connected. When using the headphones wirelessly, no hiss is detected, making the issue all the more curious. The hissing isn\u2019t particularly loud, but it could be a deal-breaker for those who may be sensitive to background noise.",
    "The Epos H3 Hybrid has impressive battery life at 41 hours when connected via Bluetooth, and we found that it generally met the manufacturer\u2019s claim. Every time you turn the headset on, a pleasant voice tells you how much battery remains; you\u2019ll also be alerted when it\u2019s time to charge the headset using the USB-C port.",
    "However, it\u2019s frustratingly easy to drain the headset\u2019s battery by accident, as it only powers down when disconnected from a Bluetooth device. The Epos H3 Hybrid must be powered on to function (they won\u2019t work when off), so if you forget to turn them off and the headset remains connected to your phone, it\u2019s possible to leave them on for hours by mistake.",
    "Thankfully, we had no issues with the headset\u2019s microphone. Our voice sounded crystal clear during voice chats and when chatting in online meetings. Again, we recommend using the boom mic where possible, as it\u2019s far superior to the built-in pinhole microphone."
