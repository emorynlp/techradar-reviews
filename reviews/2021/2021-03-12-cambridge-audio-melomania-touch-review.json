However, issues with connectivity and frustrating controls mean that they aren\u2019t the best true wireless earbuds you can buy today.",

    "Cambridge Audio is a brand best known for its high-end audio equipment \u2013 until it released the Melomania 1 true wireless earbuds, that is, which rivaled even the Sony WF-1000XM3 and Apple AirPods Pro with their excellent sound quality.",
    "Two years on, and the company has launched the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch, bringing touch-sensitive controls, upgraded battery life, and a new accompanying app to the wireless earbuds.",
    "Costing $149.95 / \u00a3129.95 (about AU$200), they\u2019re a little pricier than their predecessors, but still cheaper than the AirPods Pro \u2013 although there\u2019s no active noise cancellation here.",
    "The design of Cambridge Audio's Melomania Touch is vastly improved over the previous model, with ear fins to keep them securely in place. We found them to be supremely comfortable, and an IPX4 water-resistance rating means you can use them without fear of a little sweat or rain ending their life.",
    "While the touch-sensitive controls are the new earbuds\u2019 most-lauded feature, they don\u2019t work as seamlessly as we\u2019d have hoped. They aren\u2019t terribly laggy or overly sensitive, but the Melomania Touch sometimes register taps incorrectly, which can lead to your music being inadvertently paused or skipped to the next track.",
    "Connectivity isn\u2019t seamless, either. We\u2019d heard reports of users struggling to pair their Melomania Touch earbuds \u2013 and having tested two different pairs, we\u2019ve found performance to vary wildly. On pairing the earbuds for the first time, we were unable to connect them to our phone without performing a full factory reset first \u2013 which is frustrating, when you consider their price.",
    "However, where some users found these connectivity issues to persist even after a factory reset, the buds worked perfectly well for the remainder of our tests. It appears that whether or not your earbuds pair successfully is a bit of a lucky dip, which means we can\u2019t recommend them wholeheartedly.",
    "It\u2019s a shame, because audio performance is outstanding. Support for aptX, AAC, and SBC codecs means you can listen to Hi-Res Audio streams, with the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch certainly doing these higher-quality files justice thanks to their wide soundstage and agile rhythmic handling.",
    "The bass response is phenomenal, too. While some may find the low-end a little rich for their taste, bassheads will be delighted by the pumping sub-bass, which is far more powerful than we've heard from in-ear headphones before.",
    "The battery life is also impressive, coming in at a combined 50 hours, with nine hours of playback provided by the earbuds themselves. Meanwhile, the new Melomania app is easy to use, offers easy control of the EQ settings, and can help you locate your misplaced buds with a \u2018Find My Earphones\u2019 feature.",
    "If you do buy the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch, you won\u2019t be disappointed by the sound quality, battery life or design. Just beware of those lingering connectivity issues, and be prepared for potentially frustrating touch controls.",
    "[Update: Cambridge Audio has recently announced the Melomania 1+, which bring a new high-performance mode to the brand\u2019s first wireless earbuds, as well an app support and adjustable EQ settings.]",
    "The Cambridge Audio Melomania are available to buy now, having launched on January 1, 2021.",
    "They'll cost you $149.95 / \u00a3129.95 (about AU$200), which is a little pricier than their predecessors at $129.99 / \u00a3119.95 upon their release in 2019. It\u2019s worth noting that, if you're hoping to save some money, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 are often heavily discounted now that they\u2019re a little older.",
    "Saying that, the newer earbuds aren\u2019t particularly expensive, sitting smack-bang in the mid-range of the wireless earbuds price scale. They're cheaper than the Apple AirPods Pro, but not as budget-friendly as super-cheap models such as the Lypertek SoundFree S20.",
    "The Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch sport an entirely different design to their predecessors, eschewing the bullet-style build of housings that fill the outer part of your ear, with ear fins to keep them in place.",
    "It\u2019s a welcome change, and they certainly felt secure when we tested them \u2013 plus that snug fit does wonders for the audio quality (but more on that later). They\u2019re light, too, weighing only 6g. A choice of silicone ear tips and ear fins means you should be able to find a comfortable fit.",
    "Fitness fanatics will be pleased to learn that the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch sport an IPX4 water-resistance rating, which means they should happily withstand some rain, or a little sweat if you use them while working out \u2013 although you might want something a little more rugged if you\u2019re planning to put your earbuds through very intense exercise sessions.",
    "A leather-look, pebble-shaped charging case looks chic, and it\u2019s small enough to easily slip in your pocket. A row of five LEDs on the front of the case provides an indication of battery life, and round the back there's a USB-C charging port.",
    "As you may have guessed from the name, the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch feature touch-sensitive housings, allowing you to control your music playback with a series of taps.",
    "Now, touch-sensitive controls can be rather hit and miss. We\u2019ve often found ourselves frustrated with buds that don\u2019t register our taps, buds that lag, and buds that are so highly strung that a gust of wind is enough to engage a skip of your favorite song.",
    "Thankfully, the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch don\u2019t quite fall into that category, although the controls aren\u2019t seamless. A long tap to adjust the volume was often picked up as a short tap to pause our music, which quickly became frustrating, while simply placing the earbuds in the ears often resulted in unintended pauses and track skips.",
    "Since these buds place so much emphasis on touch control, it\u2019s disappointing that the feature doesn\u2019t work better. While it is possible to turn off the touch controls in the Melomania app, that\u2019s hardly the point.",
    "The audio quality displayed by the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch is outstanding, just like their predecessors.",
    "In part, this is thanks to an innovative High Performance Audio mode that uses hi-fi grade amplification technology \u2013 the same method of amplification found in the company\u2019s award-winning CX range of hi-fi amplifiers.",
    "Inside the buds sit 7mm drivers that have been enhanced with graphene, a material favored for its rigidity and strength, with its use contributing to the tightly controlled bass frequencies and agile rhythmic handling by the Melomania Touch.",
    "That agility became apparent as we listened to Adrianne Lenker\u2019s anything, with busily overlapping guitar ostinatos gently undulating below her childlike vocal, never overpowering it.",
    "As Lenker climbs to higher notes, the trebles never sound harsh, while the soundstage feels wide open, with every instrument placed naturally.",
    "Foo Fighters\u2019 Everlong feels similarly expansive, with Dave Grohl\u2019s vocal rising above the dirge of distorted guitars and thrashing drums.",
    "Moving on to Wesley\u2019s Theory by Kendrick Lamar, that sense of space remains, from the warm crackling sound of the sampled introduction to the chest-pumping sub-bass as the song kicks in.",
    "Now, that sub-bass may be a little much for some, particularly if you\u2019re looking for a natural soundstage \u2013 but for bassheads, the Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch offer an impressive low-end that belies their small size.",
    "And while that bass is seriously powerful, it doesn\u2019t bleed into the other frequencies. The earbuds actually revealed new details in the track that we hadn\u2019t noticed before, such as subtle backing vocals that often become lost in the mix with inferior headphones. It makes for an incredibly impressive listen; you\u2019ll almost forget you\u2019re not listening on a pair of studio quality over-ear headphones.",
    "While there\u2019s no active noise cancellation on offer here, the buds provide a good amount of passive noise cancellation thanks to their snug fit. The Transparency mode is decent, too, allowing a good amount of noise to pass through the earbuds while you\u2019re listening to music \u2013 this feature can be adjusted in the accompanying app (more on that later).",
    "Meanwhile, a cVc noise-cancelling mic inside each bud ensures calls sound crisp and clear.",
    "The Cambridge Audio Melomania Touch come with a whopping 50-hour battery life, with nine hours contained within the buds themselves and a further 41 hours provided by the charging case.",
    "This isn't quite as lengthy as the Lypertek Pure Play Z3 (Tevi)'s 70 hours, but the Melomania Touch are still far longer-lasting than most wireless earbuds on the market today.",
    "Pairing straight out of the box was a nightmare, however, with only one bud connecting at a time on the rare occasion we were able to hook one up to our phone.",
    "It wasn\u2019t until we carried out a factory reset that we were able to connect both earbuds to our phone simultaneously. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the two earbuds are designed to pair independently, so you can use one bud at a time, if you wish. However, we found that listening to music through both buds at the same time was impossible until that factory reset.",
    "We were surprised to encounter such issues. With reports of connectivity problems plaguing the bud\u2019s release earlier this year \u2013 that our friends at What Hi-Fi? detail in their review \u2013 Cambridge Audio issued a swift firmware upgrade and app update, which it claimed would fix the problem.",
    "While connectivity was fine after performing the factory reset, it\u2019s a shame that these buds didn\u2019t work straight out of the box \u2013 and it seems like a lucky dip as to whether your buds will pair immediately or you\u2019ll need to run a factory reset to use them.",
    "Codec support includes aptX, AAC, and SBC, and while there\u2019s no aptX HD support, you should be able to enjoy Hi-Res Audio files over a wireless connection.",
    "As for the app, it\u2019s easy to use, with a slick interface that displays the battery life of each earbud, allows you to use the \u2018Find My Earphones\u2019 feature if you\u2019ve lost them, and activate the Transparency mode with a slider, providing lots of control over how much environmental noise comes through the buds.",
    "There are also six EQ presets to play with, and the ability to create your own custom presets, allowing you to really tailor the sound to your tastes."
