  "summary": "Good looks are deceptive on this colorful device that\u2019s weighed down by a surprising weak point",
  "verdict": "Able to measure, calculate and colourfully display weight, heart rate, body fat, muscle mass, bone mass, body water percentage and even heart rate measurements, the MyKronoz MyScale has a decent app and syncs over Wi-Fi. However, its heart rate sensor misfires and there\u2019s a slight wobble to the scale when you stand on it. That\u2019s a surprising oversight on an otherwise attractive package.",
  "pros": [
    "Large colorful display",
    "Charges via USB-C",
    "Works with Apple Health and Google Fit",
    "Super-fast cloud sync"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "High price",
    "Not stable on a hard surface",
    "Heart-rate sensor not useful",
    "Overly large display"

    "Smart scales are everywhere, and the MyKronoz MyScale is among the best-looking, but do you need its bioelectrical impedance analysis?",
    "As well as measuring your weight and calculating your body mass index (BMI) this Swiss-designed scale sends a mild electrical current through your body to measure resistance. It then gives you stats on your weight, body fat, muscle mass, bone mass and body water percentage. They\u2019re just estimates, but they\u2019re useful for an insight into your body\u2019s composition.",
    "The MyScale also collects something that most smart scales don\u2019t \u2013 your heart rate \u2013 though we\u2019re not sure why. After all, after you've walked over to your scale, it\u2019s not going to be measuring your resting heart rate. Given that you can measure that more easily when using fitness trackers and smartwatches, we\u2019re not convinced MyScale needs a heart rate sensor.",
    "The MyScale is physically impressive, but not without flaws. Its attractive circular glass form comes with a hidden LED display that\u2019s large and shows all the data you need in large colourful characters. However, it\u2019s not as stable as it should be when placed on a flat surface and if you\u2019ve got big feet then you\u2019re probably going to obscure some of that large display with your toes.",
    "However, with its sleek look and a mostly clean app the MyScale is a good, albeit expensive, first effort from MyKronoz.",
    "The MyKronoz MyScale was released in April 2021, and costs $99.90 / \u00a399.90 (about AU$140) direct from MyKronoz.",
    "That puts it at the higher end of the price range for smart scales, sitting in between the Withings Body+ and the top-tier Garmin Index S2. Our current top-rated smart scale, the Xiaomi Mi Body Composition Scale 2, is a third of the price.",
    "The MyScale has a sleek look. Fashioned from black or white tempered and mirrored glass, this circular scale looks the part in a bathroom. Designed to be used on hard floors, it measures 340 x 340 x 270mm and weighs 4.6lb/2.1kg. There are four spring-loaded sensors on the underside. The mirrored effect is nice, but the black version does collect a lot of smudges, so plan on giving it a polish now and then.",
    "Unlike most smart scales, which for some reason tend to be battery-powered, the MyScale recharges via USB-C (there\u2019s a slot nestled into a recess on the underside). However, with a 3,000 mAh battery inside there shouldn\u2019t be much need to recharge it. MyKronoz says they\u2019ll last about a year, though obviously that depends on just how obsessed you get with your weight, BMI and fat/muscle/bone/water mass.",
    "The MyScale supports up to eight different user profiles, with the AI detecting which person is standing on the scale. You\u2019ll know if it\u2019s got that correct or not because the user\u2019s alias \u2013 a six-character name assigned to each user via the app \u2013 is displayed just after their weight is measured.",
    "We\u2019re not convinced MyScale needs a heart rate sensor. Not only do many fitness trackers and smartwatches now offer the same thing, but having walked to the scales it\u2019s likely that your heart rate is slightly raised. Ours definitely was, with readings consistently higher than our resting heart rate. It\u2019s consequently not a useful measurement.",
    "The MyScale isn\u2019t as rock solid as it should be. Put one foot on it and it not only rattles but feels unsteady, as it\u2019s going to tip over. However, once on its platform an impressive performance unfolds.",
    "The MyScale gets to work quickly, measuring weight and colorfully displaying it, with red or green arrows indicating whether you\u2019ve lost or gained weight since your last weigh-in. You then see a calculation of your BMI. After a short beep that confirms that your body composition stats have been compiled, you see readouts of your body fat, muscle mass, bone mass and body water percentage.",
    "Unlike some smart scales, this one also has a heart rate monitor built-in. Another beep confirms that your heart rate has been read, after which it's displayed. Then you get a very basic weather forecast (a graphic of a sun/cloud plus a temperature). It then visually syncs the new data with your account in the cloud, and within a few seconds a notification appears on your phone.",
    "The LED display uses large pixels, mostly while but sometimes blue, yellow or red. Trouble is, the display is so large that the readouts will be covered by your toes if you have big feet. We physically had to widen our stance to read the display properly.",
    "MyScale doesn\u2019t work well without the MyKronoz app largely because to calculate BMI it needs to know height, which is collected \u2013 along with age \u2013 from a series of in-app prompts that set-up MyScale. MyScale uses Wi-Fi to sync your data with the cloud (as well as to fetch the weather forecast) so you need to input your Wi-Fi network details.",
    "A dashboard page on the app contains all the essential details, with current weight and target weight up top, and body composition stats displayed below alongside icons. It saves all these measurements on a \u2018history\u2019 page, which you can see as a list or inspect by month and date.",
    "You can also use the MyKronoz app to customize exactly what measurements you want to be shown on the MyScale\u2019s LED display during each weigh-in.",
    "It can send data for all or some of four metrics \u2013 weight, body fat, BMI and heart rate \u2013 to Apple Health and Google Fit. There\u2019s a page in the app where you can tell it exactly what to upload and what not to (for example, if you have a smartwatch then you will probably have a more useful heart rate sensor already).",
