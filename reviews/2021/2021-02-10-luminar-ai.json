  "summary": "Is it time to let AI take the photo editing strain?",
  "verdict": "A terrific new option for photographers who know their images would benefit from some edits, but don't have the time or knowledge to make them happen. The lack of cataloguing and some occasionally iffy performance means pros will want to look elsewhere. But for everyone else the results and time saved will likely make Luminar AI worth the money.",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent quality results",
    "Easy to use",
    "Good value"

  "cons": [
    "Some effects can become very same-y",
    "Performance could improve"

    "Luminar AI claims to be the world's first photo editor to be fully powered by artificial intelligence \u2013 and it's here to fill the obvious gap between basic image editing apps and pro-leaning programs like Photoshop.",
    "So who is it for? It\u2019s not unusual for talent and ambition to be mis-matched, and there are few places that\u2019s truer than in photography. Want to take the perfect picture of the Milky Way, colorful and defined in an ink-black sky? Of course you do. Can you make it happen? Not without practice, the right gear and a good helping of luck. Want to make a portrait subject look cover-ready? Not without a makeup artist, a set of powerful lights and the knowledge to use both.",
    "This is where Luminar AI comes in. It offers a spectacular-sounding gamut of automatic edits that promise to take your photos from also-rans to prize-winners. That said, most of the images it\u2019s capable of producing will fall foul of the rules of most self-respecting photography competitions \u2013 more on that in a minute.",
    "The premise is simple \u2013 if you don\u2019t know your curves from your composition, simply point Luminar AI at an image and it will instantly understand what your picture is of, what\u2019s wrong with it, and apply a fix.",
    "Or, if you know what you want your picture to look like but don\u2019t know how to get it there, Luminar AI can do that too \u2013 drop in a new sky, change the weather, smooth skin blemishes, or automatically fix your images to be more pleasingly composed, fix color balance or selectively sharpen images to draw your viewers\u2019 eye to the subject.",
    "The main UI owes a passing nod to Lightroom, at least structurally. You don\u2019t open images one at a time; instead you add them to a catalog; a slightly flawed process because our version of Luminar (1.0.1) had a propensity for forgetting where images were, flagging them with a not-found warning icon and forcing us to re-import the original shot, losing any edits we\u2019ve made. Hopefully that's a bug that will be ironed out with a firmware fix.",
    "The way Luminar edits is broken down into Templates \u2013 which are one-click wonders that instantly spice up your photography \u2013 and Edits, where effects are automatically applied with your hand on the tiller, feathering in the changes Luminar thinks are best.",
    "In Templates, Luminar suggests what kind of image you have, and then gives you a series of recipes that spice it up, ranging from simple saturation-and-sharpening boosts to Instagram-friendly low-contrast filters.",
    "We tried Luminar with a set of unedited raw images and were pleased with the results. Using the suggested templates, we ended up with results which, much to this photographer\u2019s chagrin, were pretty close to the professional results arrived at via protracted Photoshop sessions.",
    "The tools are kept simple. Choose your effect (they\u2019re given unhelpfully non-descriptive names such as \u201cClean light\u201d and\u201cForest Stream\u201d), and then tailor how strongly its applied with a slider beneath. It works well, the results are good, and if you click the small ellipses icon just over the effect slider you\u2019re launched into Luminar\u2019s Edit panel, where you can adjust the nuts and bolts of your chosen effect.",
    "We enjoyed similarly good results editing portraits. Luminar AI does a nice job of detecting facial features and boosting them (whiter eyes and teeth, for instance), without damaging the rest of your image. More contentious-sounding tools, such as the skin blemish remover, are actually applied subtly, allowing Luminar to largely deliver on its claim of top-quality images in next to no time.",
    "It\u2019s worth treading carefully, though. We noticed, for instance, that one of the pre-built portrait templates included a nudge of the face-slimming slider; it\u2019s hard to imagine the mother of the bride feeling pleased that you\u2019ve taken her jowls down a notch.",
    "Some of the more Instagram-friendly templates, which apply lens-flare style overlays to your images, are also worth approaching with care. These lens-fare effects aren\u2019t applied dynamically \u2013 they\u2019re the same transparent overlay \u2013 so if you use the same effect for a number of images, people will spot the repetition.",
    "This is particularly true given Luminar AI\u2019s burgeoning (and understandable) popularity \u2013 suddenly the same handful of dramatic Milky Way shots are popping up all over the internet.",
    "Still, there are some solid fundamental tools. The inclusion of a before-and-after slider is appreciated, as it lets you keep a bit of perspective over exactly what\u2019s happening to your image. We also liked the ability to perform an edit on one image, and then synchronize the changes to other images in your catalogue.",
    "There are a few other niggles. Performance can be a little iffy. Zoom into an image and pan around, and Luminar takes a second to render your new view properly, showing you a pixellated preview for nearly two seconds in the interim. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but if you\u2019re scanning around an image to make sure your edits have been effectively and subtly applied, it\u2019s a nightmare.",
    "Worse, Luminar effectively deletes your 100% previews the second you click the mouse and drag somewhere else, re-rendering every time, even if you\u2019re inspecting an area of a shot you\u2019ve already looked at.",
    "We\u2019d also appreciate better previewing of whole-image effects. In Lightroom \u2013 the obvious competitor to Luminar AI \u2013 mousing over a preset triggers an instant preview of what will happen to your image, allowing you to quickly scan through a number of options before deciding one. Luminar feels decidedly stickier, forcing you to choose a template based only on its name, then laboriously applying it to the image before you can decide if you actually like it.",
    "Export options are reasonably good \u2013 the usual culprits are available, format-wise, and color-management options run the gamut (hah!) of sRGB, ProPhoto or Adobe RGB. CMYK would have been nice for those prepping for high-volume printers, but it\u2019s admittedly a touch niche, particularly with the option to export to PSD for more fine-grained color management.",
    "Luminar AI's print engine leaves a lot to be desired \u2013 there's no color management, no options for adding borders and no printing more than one image per page, which means serious photographers will need a different application to produce hard copies. It\u2019s also worth point out that, except for adding keywords when you export an image, Luminar AI makes no concessions in terms of catalogue organization. There\u2019s no keywording, and therefore no keyword search, no image flagging, no sorting by folder, and so on.",
    "All of which brings us to one of Luminar\u2019s great strengths, which is that it can be installed as a plug-in. Speaking of which, if you like Luminar AI\u2019s edits but not the application they come wrapped in, you can use it as a plugin in Lightroom Classic, Photoshop and macOS Photos.",
    "For our money, Luminar AI is at its most appealing as a powerful and effective upgrade from the photo editor that came bundled with your computer. If you don\u2019t know your curves from your contrast \u2013 and don\u2019t plan to learn \u2013 the ability to lean on its pre-built templates to produce some really good-looking images in a few seconds is worth the money, as well as being worth the few minor irritations the application brings.",
    "As a plug-in, we\u2019re a little less enamored \u2013 Lightroom offers better organizational tools, more fine-grained editing and better printing and export options. But if you want to generate some smashing-looking images with little effort, Luminar AI is easily up to the job."
