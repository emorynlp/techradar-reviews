    "LinkedIn is one of the biggest job sites on the internet, and it\u2019s been a huge deal ever since it launched way back in 2003. It\u2019s not your usual job website, though \u2013 it\u2019s a social network that focuses on the world of work.",
    "Its social underpinnings mean that LinkedIn relies on professional connections and networking. While job listings play a part in that, it\u2019s not the only thing you\u2019ll find here.",
    "That\u2019s not necessarily a problem. You can use LinkedIn to browse job listings, make an all-important connection with your new colleagues and research your prospective new place of work, and the site\u2019s social features mean that you can write posts, upload articles and boost your personal profile at the same time \u2013 as well as interact with friends and colleagues.",
    "Keep in mind that LinkedIn can also be used as a recruitment platform by recruiters and employers as well.",
    "More than three-quarters of a billion people use LinkedIn, so there\u2019s no shortage of professional connections on offer here \u2013 indeed, the site\u2019s main feed looks like Facebook, with status updates, articles being shared, and loads of likes, comments, and emojis. That\u2019s great, and the sheer number of people and businesses who use the site means that there are loads of job listings, too.",
    "If you\u2019re searching for jobs on LinkedIn then the site offers solid functionality. You can set up email alerts and filter job listings by all sorts of filters, from experience level and contract type to location, industry, company, and salary. You can also filter to only see jobs at companies where you\u2019ve already got contacts. There are more filters available here than on plenty of other sites.",
    "Job listings display all the information you\u2019d expect, but because it\u2019s LinkedIn you can also see if your contacts work there, if you\u2019ve got mutual connections at the company and how many people have applied for each position. Plenty of companies also rely on LinkedIn\u2019s Easy Apply function, which allows you to apply for a job with a couple of clicks.",
    "Because LinkedIn is a social network, that means your profile also functions as your CV. That\u2019s an effective way of applying for jobs quickly, and it also means that prospective colleagues, contacts and bosses can see your skills and experience.",
    "LinkedIn has loads of helpful features beyond its job listings. There are groups, events, skills assessment quizzes, interview preparation help and a resume builder. The wealth of features means LinkedIn can function as a one-stop-shop for professional purposes, but the dated interface is too busy, so this isn\u2019t the easiest site to use, especially for newcomers.",
    "LinkedIn is free to use, but a free account does have a restricted set of features. You can build your network of friends and colleagues, request and provide recommendations, view other people\u2019s profiles and receive messages. You can apply for jobs using LinkedIn\u2019s free tier, too.",
    "For work-based social networking and basic job applications, that\u2019s fine. But if you want to get the most out of LinkedIn, you\u2019d be better off paying for one of the premium options.",
    "The most affordable LinkedIn upgrade is Premium Career, and it costs $29.99. That grants you access to extra insights on job listings. They\u2019re superb: you can see salary information, company hiring trends, where other applicants live and their levels of education and experience. If you want a leg-up on other applicants, that\u2019s valuable information. Elsewhere, the Premium Career option allows unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning, and you can browse privately, message other people and see who\u2019s viewed your profile. You can also become a Featured Applicant, which means recruiters will see your promoted application.",
    "If you want to pay for the Premium Business option, you get those features alongside unlimited browsing and additional insights. There are other tiers for recruiters, sales professionals, and educators, and they have features like advanced searches, candidate tracking and more.",
    "LinkedIn is not cheap, but the premium options do supply loads of extra functionality. A free trial of Premium Career is also available if you\u2019d like to give it a go before you commit.",
    "The world\u2019s biggest professional social network has a robust recruitment package that covers virtually every aspect of recruitment.",
    "All of LinkedIn\u2019s recruitment products gather under the LinkedIn Talent Solutions umbrella, and here you\u2019ll find LinkedIn Recruiter and Recruiter Lite alongside other products, like LinkedIn\u2019s own ATS and strategic planning tools.",
    "LinkedIn Recruiter is one of the best and most powerful tools available for anyone who needs to find new employees. The unmatched talent database on LinkedIn is a great start, and you can use more than forty different filters and Boolean techniques to search for new talent \u2013 an ideal option if you\u2019d like to track down people and approach them using InMail before they\u2019ve seen or applied to your vacant positions.",
    "You can bulk-message likely candidates to help save time, and you can easily share profiles to other people in your HR team to get second and third opinions. Recruiter\u2019s reporting options also make it easy for you to manage and analyze your pipeline, no matter how many vacancies you\u2019ve listed and applications you\u2019ve received.",
    "Elsewhere, LinkedIn Recruiter can deliver AI-based recommendations for your open positions, and the software supplies users with smart reminders to help you stay on top of your hiring. Recruiter has Android and iOS apps, and it can connect with your existing ATS systems. It also works with other LinkedIn products, like Talent Insights and Talent Hub, so you can build a package to suit your recruitment needs.",
    "Two different levels of tool are available on LinkedIn. The Recruiter Lite package gives users access to limited database access, twenty search filters, and reduced numbers of monthly messages and alerts, and you don\u2019t get to use high-end features. It costs $140 per month and is suitable for smaller companies that don\u2019t have large HR teams, and you may be able to get away with paying less for Lite if you\u2019ve got a good ATS that you\u2019re happy to continue using.",
    "If you don\u2019t use a reliable and comprehensive ATS or if you just want full access to LinkedIn Recruiter\u2019s features and database, opt for the Professional or Corporate packages. You get full network access, more filtering, candidate and company insights, more job alerts and InMail messages, and a multi-user dashboard for large HR departments. This package has full integration with other LinkedIn products and third-party ATS systems, and you get more reporting and data analytics, too.",
    "The complete LinkedIn Recruiter package is the best option for any medium or large business, but LinkedIn\u2019s website doesn\u2019t have pricing \u2013 you\u2019ll have to contact them directly, and worth of mouth online suggests that it\u2019s one of the pricier recruitment products around. It\u2019s also a little disappointing that you still don\u2019t get unlimited InMail messages and search alerts with Recruiter.",
    "Nevertheless, LinkedIn Recruiter offers a good range of features and access to the world\u2019s biggest professional network, and that makes it essential for any enterprise that does plenty of hiring. Prepare for a potentially high cost, though, and consider if the cheaper Lite package is suitable first.",
    "The difference between LinkedIn\u2019s free and paid experiences are vast, and it almost makes the service feel like two different products.",
    "LinkedIn\u2019s free product is a great option for basic professional networking and applying for jobs, but it\u2019s not the best way to get the most out of the site. Unfortunately, if you want to make the most out of job-seeking here, you\u2019ll have to pay for LinkedIn Premium Career.",
    "LinkedIn might not be the easiest site to navigate and you\u2019ve got to pay to get the most out of it, but its sheer size and breadth of features mean that it\u2019s a vital addition for anyone who\u2019s serious about their job search.",
    "LinkedIn is a widely preferred platform with an 8.4 rating, while Glassdoor also does well with 7.1 overall.",
    "Features: LinkedIn\u2019s Applicant Tracking System lets you control access to private data, store and manage resumes strategically, use custom workflows for recruiting, track your candidates\u2019 progress, schedule meetings or interviews rapidly, and use email templates, among others. It\u2019s easy to develop an efficient hiring strategy with LinkedIn\u2019s tools.",
    "Glassdoor also offers custom email templates to speed up your process, as well as analyze site visits and engagement, customize your profile depending on which part of the world you\u2019re scouting, and personalize how candidate profiles view yours. Brand advertising lets you target qualified applicants, while Review Intelligence lets you understand what people are saying.",
    "Pricing: Flexible terms are available when you post on LinkedIn. The pay-per-click model is highly preferred, and the budget you set depends on how long you think your ad needs to run. When opting for monthly rates, Recruiter Lite and Recruiter+Job slots are offered for $99.95 and $825. These plans provide variations in inMail messages as you build a funnel of candidates.",
    "The three options for Glassdoor posting are Free (basic), Standard, and Select (premium). Standard goes for $219 and Premium for $599. These plans let you promote your brand and target the right candidates for your job posts and avail of add-ons. The Premium plan is also known as a branding bundle that provides Indeed pages access.",
    "Conclusion: Glassdoor and LinkedIn are two of the strongest competitors when it comes to job boards. LinkedIn\u2019s flexible terms and Glassdoor\u2019s comprehensive plans entice more users than any other platform out there.",
    "LinkedIn is the top leading job board with an 8.4 rating. Craigslist is the opposite with a 3.8 rating.",
    "Features: For limited visibility, LinkedIn lets you post jobs for free. Budgeted posts get three times more visibility, showing your job post at the top of search results and placed in front of qualified applicants who are browsing for employment. LinkedIn\u2019s matching algorithms at work will send you smart alerts for qualified applicants reaching out to you.",
    "Craigslist isn\u2019t as feature-rich, on the other hand, though it\u2019s been around longer and is often preferred by some. It has an extremely simple and basic interface where job posts are found. It\u2019s host to every category you can think of and posting is free.",
    "Pricing: With pay-per-click, LinkedIn lets you set a budget for a job post to promote it. Because of this, you can also close or end your post whenever you like. Doing so will give you mobile notifications and give it visibility to LinkedIn members who are a good fit. After the total budget you set is spent, the post will close automatically.",
    "Craigslist\u2019s job posts are free, although in some US and Canada areas, they\u2019re charged between $10-$75 per post. It\u2019s essentially an online classified ads site where you can sell or post about your job. The good news is that there are tons of categories and you can post on any of them.",
    "Conclusion: Both platforms let you post for free, Considering Craigslist has been around for decades, it\u2019s easy to tell posting there works. LinkedIn links you to millions of professionals for free."
