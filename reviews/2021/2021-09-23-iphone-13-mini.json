  "verdict": "The iPhone 13 mini hasn\u2019t changed a great deal compared to the iPhone 12 mini, but if it performs anything like the iPhone 13 in real-world use we\u2019re expecting some big improvements under the hood.",

    "Small but premium design",

    "Apple\u2019s miniature iPhone is back for 2021, with the iPhone mini 13 packing the same specs as the standard iPhone 13, but in a smaller package that\u2019s better suited to those who want a diminutive phone.",
    "It\u2019s not actually that small compared to the regular model, but it features a 5.4-inch screen in a more compact design than the other new iPhones introduced in 2021.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for premium specs, but you also don\u2019t want a 6.1-inch iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 mini may be the handset you should consider.",
    "Apple announced the new iPhone 13 mini on September 14, 2021, and it's available to buy online or in-person already. There are some great iPhone 13 mini deals already, despite its newness.",
    "The iPhone 13 mini price starts at $699 / \u00a3679 / AU$1,199 for the model with 128GB of storage \u2013 the 64GB days are, thankfully, gone, and the new iPhone 13 series starts with 128GB as standard.",
    "You can also get the iPhone 13 mini with 256GB of storage for $799 / \u00a3779 / AU$1,369, or a 512GB model for $999 / \u00a3979 / AU$1,719.",
    "The iPhone 13 mini is built to be premium, but with a smaller body screen. It\u2019s designed for those who want a smaller device, with Apple\u2019s smartphones having increased in size over the last five years.",
    "It features a 5.4-inch screen with a resolution of 1080 x 2340 \u2013 that means it has the highest pixels per inch figure \u2013 476ppi to be exact \u2013 of the entire iPhone 13 range.",
    "As the screen is smaller it\u2019s harder to appreciate this higher resolution, but it\u2019s a top-tier Super Retina XRDR OLED display with strong brightness levels; you\u2019re getting all the same screen tech as the iPhone 13 here, but with a little less real estate.",
    "The phone sits comfortably in the hand, and it\u2019s easy to use with just one hand as well. We found that we were able to easily type on the handset and reach all areas of the keyboard with our thumb.",
    "The power button is on the right edge of the phone, while the left edge is home to the silence switch, volume buttons and SIM tray. There\u2019s a Lightning port between the phone\u2019s speakers on the bottom of the handset.",
    "Apple has again included a screen notch on the iPhone 13 mini, and the rest of the iPhone 13 range \u2013 the company clearly wasn\u2019t ready to go with an under-display camera on its phones this year \u2013 but the notch here is 20% smaller than on the iPhone 12 mini.",
    "We can\u2019t say we\u2019ve really noticed the difference during our testing time, but it does give you a slight increase in screen area.",
    "The display has the \u2018standard\u2019 60Hz refresh rate, as on last year\u2019s mini. That means you won\u2019t get the more fluid experience you\u2019ll enjoy on the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max with their 120Hz screens, but it\u2019s unlikely to be something you notice unless you move from a smartphone with a high-refresh-rate display.",
    "Apple has included two cameras on the iPhone 13 mini \u2013 a 12MP f/1.6 wide camera with 1.7\u00b5m pixels for better low light performance, and a 12MP f/2.4 ultra-wide camera with 120-degree field of view.",
    "We\u2019ve yet to properly put these cameras through their paces, but they\u2019re exactly the same as the cameras on the iPhone 13, which we\u2019ve tested pretty extensively \u2013 you can read the camera section of our full iPhone 13 review to see our in-depth findings, but the short version is that you won\u2019t have any complaints with the image quality the cameras can produce",
    "Battery life is improved on the iPhone 13 mini, according to Apple. We can\u2019t verify that claim yet as we haven\u2019t tested the smartphone for long enough, but we have found that the battery life on the iPhone 13 is dramatically improved compared to the iPhone 12.",
    "That\u2019s thanks in part to improved optimizations of the chipset, while leaked information has also suggested that Apple has increased the size of the battery cells in every iPhone 13 model compared to its previous handsets.",
    "We\u2019ll bring you our full verdict on the iPhone 13 mini\u2019s battery life in our full review. The iPhone 12 mini fell down in our estimation because of its poorer battery life (likely because it has a smaller cell inside), so we\u2019re hoping for a big improvement here.",
    "The iPhone 13 mini is powered by Apple\u2019s own A15 Bionic chipset. That\u2019s the same processor as in the rest of the 2021 iPhones, and in the iPhone 13 we\u2019ve found it to be seriously powerful, and easily capable of loading and running multiple apps.",
    "We expect the chip to perform similarly well in the iPhone 13 mini, although again we haven\u2019t yet had enough time with the phone to test this thoroughly \u2013 check back for our full review to read our considered verdict on the phone\u2019s power and performance.",
    "Your storage options here are 128GB, 256GB or 512GB. If you want more storage than that you\u2019ll need to opt for the 1TB iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max.",
    "5G connectivity has also returned on the iPhone 13 mini, so you\u2019ll be able to easily connect to next-gen networks as long as your carrier and plan support them and you\u2019re in an area with 5G coverage.",
    "We can\u2019t yet make a final call on some of the iPhone 13 mini\u2019s features, but our experience with the iPhone 13 suggests that Apple\u2019s smaller iPhone will be a capable and powerful handset with strong battery life.",
    "If you\u2019re after an iPhone with a smaller screen, the improvement in battery life that we\u2019re expecting to see over the iPhone 12 mini may be the thing that sways you towards this handset.",
    "We\u2019re looking forward to testing this phone more extensively, but going on what we\u2019ve seen so far, Apple\u2019s smallest 2021 iPhone is shaping up to be another small wonder."
