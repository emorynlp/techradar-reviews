    "Tom Clancy-based movies have been in the midst of a barren spell recently. The 1990s saw the best-selling author\u2019s name become synonymous with award-winning film adaptations of his novels, including The Hunt for Red October, but mixed responses to movies like Jack Ryan seemed to put a stop to more being developed - until now, that is.",
    "Based on the novel of the same name, Without Remorse is the latest attempt to reignite the Clancy movie series. Despite being elevated by its stellar cast, solid pacing and thrilling set pieces, though, Without Remorse is a fairly standard revenge tale that suffers from some run-of-the-mill plot twists and hoary tropes.",
    "Without Remorse tells the story US Navy SEAL John Clark (Michael B. Jordan) as he seeks retribution for the murder of his pregnant wife Pam (Lauren London). After Clark\u2019s team conducts a rescue mission in war-torn Syria - one that sees his squad kill a number of ex-Russian armed forces personnel - Clark and his wife are attacked in their home by Russian mercenaries, who kill Pam and leave John for dead.",
    "Clark, who kills two intruders before being shot multiple times by another, survives and vows revenge on those responsible. With the help of fellow SEAL Karen Greer (Jodie Turner-Smith), shadowy CIA agent Robert Ritter (Jamie Bell) and US Secretary of Defense Thomas Clay (Guy Perace), Clark\u2019s bid to track down his wife\u2019s killers sees him become embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens all-out war between the US and Russia.",
    "Without Remorse\u2019s revenge plot is pretty unoriginal, then, and it isn\u2019t helped by some entirely predictable twists along the way.",
    "Sure, it can be fun to try and deduce who the real bad guys are in a revenge flick, and there are enough shady characters here for a Usual Suspects-style lineup. It\u2019s easy to work out who Without Remorse\u2019s big bad is, though, even without reading the book first. Viewers who crack the case early will feel that the rest of the movie is nothing more than a slow march to this major reveal, but even if the story doesn't maintain your attention, other parts of the movie will.",
    "For one, Without Remorse feels as timely in the present day as when the book was first written. Clancy\u2019s novel is set during the Cold War and follows Clark\u2019s revenge mission through the US and Vietnam, which includes an assault on a drug ring and rescuing prisoners of war.",
    "The movie adaptation alters these events to better reflect the world in 2021, such as replacing the Vietnam War with the ongoing Syrian conflict, and Russia and America's presently frosty relationship ensures that the story isn\u2019t one necessarily told out of time.",
    "It\u2019s also more globetrotting in its setting than the source material, which helps with the film\u2019s pacing and doesn\u2019t allow it to become bogged down in one particular location. This around-the-world adventure adds to the film\u2019s theme of globalization, too, and the potential consequences of the characters' actions. If the murder plot doesn't hook you, perhaps its exploration of hot-button topics - including the US and Russia\u2019s positions on the world stage - will.",
    "The movie\u2019s cast brings a bit more credibility to the film as it explores these subjects. Jordan excels as the purposeful Clark, and the emotional weight he brings to Without Remorse\u2019s protagonist heightens the impact of a familiar revenge story. It\u2019s a shame, though, that Jordan and London don\u2019t share more screen time as the Clarks, given how Pam's murder drives the plot.",
    "Turner-Smith, too, puts in a solid performance as the stoic-and-resourceful Greer, while Bell\u2019s abrasive CIA agent will make you bristle every time he\u2019s on screen. Add in Jordan\u2019s Clark and the trio\u2019s clashing personalities means that verbal fireworks are never far away, even when they\u2019re all pulling in the same direction.",
    "As for the action, there\u2019s plenty of it. Gunfights look and feel authentic, and one sequence involving snipers in a small Russian city is a particularly tense set piece that actually brings weight to how life and death is portrayed in the movie. The film\u2019s main close-quarters fight sequence is also excellent without being overly gratuitous, and offers a nice contrast to the movie's multiple firefights. There are some notable sequences that really put Jordan\u2019s Clark in harm\u2019s way, too, and show how much training the film\u2019s lead actor underwent to realistically portray a Navy SEAL.",
    "These sequences are impressive but, ultimately, it never feels like Jordan\u2019s Clark is in danger. He\u2019s the hero after all and, like so many other predictable elements of this movie, it\u2019s expected that he\u2019ll live to fight another day. But, the attack in his home aside, Clark\u2019s life doesn't feel in jeopardy at any point - and maybe more tension on that side of things would've resulted in a more exciting finished movie.",
    "Ultimately, Without Remorse is caught between a rock and a hard place. Sure, traditional revenge stories almost write themselves, but it feels like more could have been done to set it apart from similar movies.",
    "Leaning into the source material\u2019s R-rated content, or making the film\u2019s true villain less obvious, would\u2019ve helped to differentiate it from the usual \u2018person seeks vengeance for a loved one\u2019s death\u2019 story mechanic. As it is, Without Remorse won\u2019t trouble more recent critically-acclaimed revenge-led flicks, such as John Wick.",
    "It\u2019ll be interesting to see where the sequel goes - Jordan has already confirmed what it\u2019ll entail, but we won\u2019t spoil it here - from plot and character growth perspectives, and maybe Without Remorse will end up being a great primer for a potential Tom Clancy cinematic universe. As a standalone film, though, Without Remorse is fairly enjoyable without being outstanding.",
    "Without Remorse launches on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, April 30."
