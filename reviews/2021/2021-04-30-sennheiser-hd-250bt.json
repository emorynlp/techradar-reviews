  "summary": "Sennheiser puts the high-fidelity cat among the entry-level pigeons",
  "verdict": "Not luxurious, and not exactly stacked with features \u2013 but the Sennheiser HD 250BT have it where it counts. The fact that the HD 250BT don\u2019t look, or feel, any more costly than they are is more than compensated for by the sound they make. Yes, the headband is unpadded, but the soundstage is wide open and properly defined \u2013 and that's what counts.",
  "pros": [
    "Open, revealing and engaging sound",
    "Some EQ adjustment available",
    "Lighter and more comfortable than they look"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not what you\u2019d describe as \u2018plush\u2019",
    "Bass could sound heftier",
    "A little headband padding would be nice"
  ],

    "It seems a little odd to find Sennheiser competing in this market \u2013 but the company hasn\u2019t sacrificed any of its principles in bringing in the HD 250BT at such a startlingly low price. If sound quality is your be-all and end-all, these wireless on-ear headphones demand your attention.",
    "The fact that the HD 250BT don\u2019t look, or feel, any more costly than they are is more than compensated for by the sound they make.",
    "Yes, the headband is unpadded, but the soundstage is wide open and properly defined. Yes, they\u2019re built from plastics that feel hard and quite cheap, but they give music real detail and nuance. No, there\u2019s no noise-cancelling or voice control, but there\u2019s more realism to the HD 250BT than $70 / \u00a360 / AU$130 can buy anywhere else.",
    "So it really depends on what your priorities are. If you want to be pampered by your wireless headphones, look away now. But if you want a taste of what a company like Sennheiser is capable of without the price tag Sennheiser is capable of attaching, you\u2019re in luck.",
    "The Sennheiser HD 250BT are on sale now, and in the US, they\u2019re priced around $70, while UK and Australian customers can expect to pay around \u00a360 / AU$130.",
    "This makes them a) pretty affordable by the standard of wireless on-ear headphones in general, and b) staggeringly affordable by Sennheiser\u2019s usual standards. In fact, if you add a \u20181\u2019 to the front of the US and UK prices, the HD 250BT would still be pretty close to Sennheiser\u2019s entry level.",
    "You don\u2019t need to be any kind of deductive genius to work out where Sennheiser has found at least some cost-savings where the HD 250BT are concerned. If you\u2019re looking for headphones that aren\u2019t built from thin and unyielding plastic, that feature even a little padding underneath the headband, that don\u2019t have any exposed wiring, or that don\u2019t make an ostentatious clicking noise when you adjust the position of the earcups, well\u2026 look elsewhere.",
    "But just because the Sennheisers are made from hard, inexpensive-feeling plastic, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re in any way badly made. The padding of the earcups is soft and comfortable, and even those of us who have fallen victim to the curse of Male Pattern Baldness will find the unpadded headband isn\u2019t quite the instrument of torture it may at first appear. Getting the HD 250BT secure and comfy isn\u2019t difficult \u2013 and they\u2019ll stay that way for hours on end. An all-in weight of just 125g doesn\u2019t do any harm in this regard, either.",
    "And besides, it\u2019s not as if Sennheiser has tried to cut any obvious corners where specification is concerned. The HD 250BT use Bluetooth 5 for wireless connectivity, which means they\u2019ll cope with big hi-res digital audio files without problems. Codec support runs to SBC and AAC, naturally, with aptX Low Latency thrown in to guarantee synchronization between audio and video content. And once the audio stuff has been Bluetooth\u2019d aboard, it\u2019s served to your ears by a couple of 32mm dynamic transducers inside those closed-back earcups.",
    "Battery life is as much as 25 hours from a single charge, as long as you\u2019re a) not caning the volume and b) listening to bog-standard SBC content. Recharging is via the USB-C socket at the bottom of the right earcup, which is also where you\u2019ll find the extremely brief selection of physical controls. Arranged in the classic three-button strip, they cover \u2018power on/off/pairing\u2019, \u2018play/pause\u2019, \u2018skip forwards/backwards\u2019 and \u2018answer/end/reject call\u2019. The single telephony mic is here too.",
    "The HD 250BT are compatible with Sennheiser\u2019s splendid Smart Control app, which is free for iOS and Android. Admittedly functionality in this instance is restricted to updates and EQ adjustment, but nevertheless it\u2019s a step up from what you might have been expecting $70 / \u00a360 / AU130 to buy.",
    "Every review needs a headline, and here\u2019s one for the Sennheiser HD 250BT: they sound way more accomplished than seems credible at the price.",
    "Given the best stuff to work with \u2013 and in this instance that means an MQA-powered Tidal Master file of King by Lilith Czar \u2013 the HD 250BT impress in pretty much every respect. Most immediately notable are the sheer levels of detail the Sennheiser HD 250BT manage to extract \u2013 nothing is too remote or too transient to escape their notice.",
    "And the 250BT manage to pay attention to the minutiae without a) sound prissy about it or b) ignoring the bigger picture. They simply identify and reveal any fine detail lurking at the back or the edges of a recording, and then hand it over in proper context.",
    "The highest frequencies are crisp, and attacking with a level of drive that\u2019s just the right side of relentless. The midrange, always so crucial in making any pair of headphones sound realistic and convincing, is open and properly focused \u2013 so voices sound poised, naturalistic and character-packed. At the bottom end, Sennheiser has made an executive decision to prioritize momentum over out-and-out depth \u2013 which isn\u2019t to say they\u2019re lacking weight, but rather that they never drag at tempos. As a consequence, rhythmic expression is strong.",
    "Dynamically, the Sennheiser HD 250BT are rather understated \u2013 those who like the sonic fireworks of a \u2018quiet/loud/REALLY VERY LOUD\u2019 recording may find the 250BT can squash this expression just a little. The harmonic dynamics that differentiate one guitar strum, say, from another are made perfectly obvious, mind you.",
    "There\u2019s more than enough space on their soundstage for every element of a recording to happily coexist \u2013 Townes van Zandt\u2019s Pancho and Lefty sounds as wide-open as its subject-matter. This sensation of spacious doesn\u2019t affect integration, though \u2013 so there\u2019s a very agreeable unity to the HD 250BT presentation, and impressive stereo focus to go along with this separation."
