  "summary": "The only swimming headphones to stream any content from your phone underwater",
  "verdict": "A one-off audio product ideal for swimmers and anyone else who likes an aquatic workout, the Zygo Solo is the only pair of swimming headphones that can stream content from a phone when you\u2019re underwater. The headset is bulky and expensive, but its app full of coaching tips and tricks helps sink its rival Walkman swim players.",
  "pros": [
    "Streams content underwater",
    "App includes coaching tips and workouts",
    "Easy to set up",
    "Excellent sound",
    "FM transmitter also works as a walkie talkie"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Requires a lot of gear poolside",
    "Works best with earplugs",
    "Headset has no playback buttons",
    "Charging case has no battery"

    "Is this the Peloton of the pool? With the success of that workout streaming service clearly in its sights comes Zygo Solo, a unique audio gadget for swimmers.",
    "We\u2019ve seen waterproof headphones before, but not like this. Since Bluetooth can't penetrate water, all other swim headphones are little more than waterproof MP3 players (pretty much that music file format\u2019s last stand). The Zygo Solo is different, and is able to stream content from a smartphone through water using an FM transmitter that can penetrate water.",
    "It\u2019s something of a 'hallelujah!' moment for swimmers, many of whom have by now experimented with the Sony Walkman NW-WS413 and then the Aftershokz Xtrainerz, both of which are good at what they do, but only play MP3s. Does anyone even have any MP3s anymore?",
    "A four-piece set consisting of headset, FM transmitter, stand and charging case, the Zygo Solo has a lot more hardware than your average pair of super-slim swimming headphones.",
    "It works like this: your phone connects to the FM transmitter via Bluetooth and the transmitter to the headset via radio frequency. It\u2019s easy to set up, though there\u2019s definitely more physical equipment to deal with. It also means taking a lot of gear poolside. Fine in a private swimming pool, but not so great in a public pool where you\u2019ll have to keep one eye on your stuff while you swim.",
    "Nevertheless, committed swimmers with the right environment will adore the Zygo Solo. A long overdue audio upgrade for the pool, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to use, offers great FM-quality sound and has hundreds of excellent on-demand workouts that can really change how you approach your swimming fitness. Or you can just listen to your own music, audiobooks or podcasts without having to drag-and-drop MP3 files prior to a swim.",
    "How does Zygo Solo compare to its underwater MP3 player competitors? It blows them out of the water, of course \u2013 and it\u2019s priced accordingly.",
    "Available in the US, Canada and the UK in two sizes \u2013 standard and large \u2013 the Zygo Solo costs $299 / \u00a3218 (about AU$400) for the full package. A replacement headset costs $99 / \u00a372 (about AU$150), while an external mic costs US$30/UK\u00a322 (about AU$40), and is useful if a coach wants to use the FM transmitter as a hands-free walkie talkie.",
    "If you want Peloton-inspired streaming swim workouts (comprising short and long audio workouts delivered by instructors and paired with music) then you also need to take out a Zygo All Access Monthly Plan, which costs $14.99 / \u00a312.99 (about AU$20) per month after a 14-day trial.",
    "In future Zygo tells us it\u2019s planning metric tracking similar to that offered by the best running watches, leaderboards, and truly Peloton-style live classes. On Zygo\u2019s website you can purchase an app gift certificate for an entire year for $149 / \u00a3108 (about AU$200), which gives you two months free.",
    "The Zygo Solo is, technically speaking, by far the most ambitious set of swimming headphones available. Predictably that means it comes with some baggage. The package consists of an IP68-rated waterproof headset, an IP67-rated (waterproof for 30 minutes) FM transmitter and stand, a pair of earplugs and a charging case.",
    "While the Sony Walkman NW-WS413 and the Aftershokz Xtrainerz weigh 32g and 29g, respectively, the Zygo Solo headset weighs 66g. Why? It\u2019s got a radio receiver as well as a battery inside that makes it possible to receive audio from the FM transmitter connected wirelessly to a smartphone.",
    "The 101g FM transmitter itself is a figure of eight-shaped device that\u2019s also waterproof, so it\u2019s fine to leave it close to the water. Also included is a small 25g holder for the FM transmitter that keeps it upright, which extends its range.",
    "Meanwhile, the charging case itself weighs 450g, and 623g with both the headset and the transmitter inside. Resembling the kind of case you might find housing a pair of the best noise cancelling headphones, it\u2019s rounded and compact, and fairly easily fits inside a swim bag. The headset also has an accelerometer inside, so expect activity tracking soon.",
    "Despite a slightly convoluted hardware arrangement compared to MP3 swim players, the Zygo Solo is always easy to set-up. It takes a bit of getting used to. If you\u2019re used to entering the pool with just a pair of goggles, or even if you\u2019re used to donning an MP3 swim player, the Zygo Solo seems a lot to get used to.",
    "The headset feels reasonably solid and unwieldy at first \u2013 it is, after all, more substantial than a basic swim MP3 player \u2013 partly because it\u2019s designed to stay firmly in place during underwater turns. It\u2019s chunkier because it\u2019s got more hardware inside.",
    "What\u2019s really different about the Zygo Solo compared to MP3 swim players is that you have to have the FM transmitter and your smartphone poolside. That FM transmitter works to a range of 50 meters \u2013 so the size of an Olympic swimming pool \u2013 which is generous enough (it can also transmit to an unlimited number of headsets). However, if you\u2019re used to leaving your phone in a locker and entering a neighborhood pool deck with just a towel, having to take a smartphone and an FM transmitter is a bit of a change.",
    "The 50m limit applies only to swimming pools, with a half-mile range promised in the great outdoors. So you could get away with wearing a Zygo Solo while open water swimming, surfing, canoeing, kayaking, water skiing and even sailing.",
    "Make no mistake about what Zygo is trying to do here; streaming live audio underwater is not easy. In fact, the tech it took two years to perfect. The Zygo Solo\u2019s sound is good. Out of the pool it sounds a little tinny, but in the water it suddenly gets a lot of bass.",
    "Let\u2019s not overdo it; this is not audiophile quality, and overall the impression is (not surprisingly) of FM radio-like sound, with a little crackle and hiss now and again. However, at all times it sounds much better than any waterproof MP3 player. That is, if you remember to use the earplugs.",
    "Like the Aftershokz Xtrainerz the Zygo Solo are bone conduction headphones, using a technology that employs an open-ear design and transmits audio through vibrations in the cheekbones directly into the inner ear.",
    "You don\u2019t need to use the included earplugs, but if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll find that every time your ears are not immersed the quality of sound drastically changes. So for a more consistent experience it\u2019s best to use the earplugs.",
    "It\u2019s possible to tweak the volume using + and - buttons on the headset\u2019s right temple, and the FM transmitter has some too. It just about goes loud enough, but only the FM transmitter has skip track and play/pause controls, which is a shame. It means you have to make sure you have lots of songs/podcasts/content queued up, or keep the FM transmitter accessible by the side of the pool.",
    "We found the headset to be reasonably comfortable when worn for long periods, largely because the bone conduction design leaves your ears alone, though it did begin to feel slightly tight after about half an hour. The advice is to put the headset on, followed by a swim hat, goggles and then earplugs.",
    "As a nice bonus the transmitter doubles as a walkie talkie, so a coach can speak to a swimmer directly as they swim in the pool. What the headset doesn\u2019t have is a microphone, so you can\u2019t answer back \u2026 or make hands-free calls from the pool.",
    "The Zygo app for iOS and Android has had a lot of investment in it and is arguably the best reason to invest in Zygo Solo. It\u2019s not free, but there\u2019s a huge choice of classes and activities inside. As a few random examples we found a 20-minute beginner-level tutorial in learning backstroke, an intermediate 30-minute HIIT workout and a \u2018fun\u2019-grade 25 minute DJ drill set to music.",
    "Each one has excellent instructors and a lot of music, the latter the result of various licensing deals struck between Zygo and the music industry.",
    "We counted over 50 drills, which seems good value, which can be browsed on a timeline but also by specific genres, such as \u2018strengthen and lengthen\u2019, \u20185 days of fitness\u2019 and \u2018your first sprint triathlon\u2019. It\u2019s best to download them on WiFi within the app before hitting the pool.",
    "However, the app does need a queue so that lessons and drills can follow-on from each other. Since some are only a few minutes long you can easily find yourself completing a drill and then swimming in silence.",
    "In future Zygo tells us it\u2019s planning to go full-Peloton and add live classes and leaderboards, with new software incoming that will use the built-in accelerometer to track your activity in the pool.",
    "The app works independently of the device, so in theory you could just subscribe to the app and use all the workouts \u2026 though the Zygo Solo is so far the only way to stream content underwater.",
    "Inside the Zygo Solo headset is a battery that lasts for three hours, and the transmitter lasts for around six hours. Sadly the hard-sided charging case itself doesn\u2019t hold a charge, but if you snap both gadgets into place in its molded interior, both nestle up against precisely-placed connectors and begin charging automatically if the case is hooked up to power via a micro-USB cable.",
    "It\u2019s a shame the case doesn\u2019t contain a battery of some kind, and micro-USB also feels slightly outdated given the popularity of USB-C."
