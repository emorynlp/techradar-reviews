    "Meross may not be a name you\u2019re familiar with for smart home gadgets, but it\u2019s making headway in the market with its range of affordable, simple-to-use gadgets that work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple\u2019s HomeKit.",
    "The Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini MSS110 is the company\u2019s latest smart home device. This single socket can be plugged into a power outlet and controlled using Meross\u2019s own app, through Apple\u2019s Home app if you own an iPhone, and various voice assistants. If you often worry once you\u2019ve left the house that you may have left your coffee maker or hair straighteners switched on, this smart plug aims to provide peace of mind, giving you a way to turn them off if they have in fact been left on.",
    "Super-compact, the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini MSS110 connects to your home Wi-Fi network, and lets you set schedules and timers for the smart plug to switch on and off. As well as using set times, you can even use sunrise and sunset times to activate the schedule.",
    "At $14.99 / \u00a319.99 / AU$25.99, it\u2019s the most affordable smart plug we\u2019ve tested that supports the three major voice assistant based smart home systems. It\u2019s best suited to those looking for a compact, simple device. However, it\u2019s worth noting that it lacks features such as energy monitoring and an Away mode that randomizes when the smart plug turns on and off to imitate occupancy.",
    "The Meross Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini MSS110 is priced at $14.99 / \u00a319.99 / AU$25.99 and is available worldwide through Amazon. You can pick it up as a single device or in packs of two, three and four smart plugs.",
    "In the UK, Meross also offers a version that\u2019s compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant \u2013 but not HomeKit. Known as the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini MSS210, it comes in a twin-pack that costs \u00a330.99 (around $40 / AU$60).",
    "Like most smart plugs on the market, the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini MSS110 sports an inoffensive white design. In the US, the compact smart plug measures 2.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches / 6.8 x 3.8 x 3.8cm ( w x h x d), while in the UK and Australia, the plug sits vertically in the wall socket and measures 2.0 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches / 5.1 x 6.1 x 3.3cm.",
    "The front of the smart plug features a single socket, with a manual power button on the left-hand side. There\u2019s a pin-head-sized LED in the top right-hand corner that illuminates white when the plug is switched on, and alternates between green and orange when in set-up mode.",
    "The smart plug only works on the 2.4GHz band, which may mean you suffer connectivity issues if it\u2019s installed in a different room to your router.",
    "The MSS110 is extremely simple to set up if you\u2019re using an iPhone, either using Apple HomeKit or Meross\u2019s own app. The former is slightly quicker since it just involves scanning the QR code on the right-hand side of the plug. If you\u2019re using an Android device, then your only option is the Meross app, but the process still took only a couple of minutes.",
    "During testing, the plug responded instantly using either the Meross app or Alexa to switch it on and off. It made a reassuring click each time, with the LED in the right-hand corner of the plug illuminating green when it\u2019s on. It was just as responsive using the manual power button, too.",
    "Sadly, and unlike some other smart plugs, it doesn\u2019t offer any energy monitoring features. Nor is there an Away mode that simulates occupancy by turning the plug on or off at random times.",
    "The Meross app is very easy to navigate. A list of Meross devices installed in your home is displayed upon launch and, in the case of the smart plug, tapping the icon turns the device on or off. It\u2019s also possible to edit the image assigned to the smart plug, as well as its name. You can even access a user manual by selecting the pencil symbol to the right of the smart plug icon.",
    "Using the Routine tab in the app, we were able to set a schedule for when the plug should switch on or off automatically, both using a set time or sunrise or sunset. We were also offered the ability to create automations, where several Meross devices can be controlled at once, or choose to have a smart device turn off or on after a set duration has passed.",
    "As mentioned, the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini MSS110 offers integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple HomeKit.",
