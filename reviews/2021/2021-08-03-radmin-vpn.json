    "Launched by Famatech in 2016, Radmin VPN is software used to create virtual private networks (VPNs). Unlike most other VPN providers that protect your internet traffic from snooping by internet service providers (ISPs) and other external entities, Radmin VPN focuses on providing individuals with the ability to create a VPN-like connection to connect remote computers from anywhere in a virtual network. With a secured connection, users situated within different geographical locations can exchange confidential information.",
    "Since its launch, Radmin VPN has gained the trust of 7 million worldwide users. In this Radmin VPN review, we\u2019ll cover important aspects of its plans and pricing, features, interface, support, and security. We\u2019ll also see where the software stands in comparison to some of the best VPN services on the market.",
    "Radmin VPN is entirely free to download and use, but is only available to Windows 10, 8, or 7 users. You don\u2019t have to provide any personal or credit card details - just click the download button to get started.",
    "Even though Radmin VPN is free to use, it has a decent selection of features.",
    "Users can connect to remote computers and overcome external firewalls with Radmin VPN. Businesses may easily connect distributed teams to create one cohesive network regardless of the distance between users.",
    "Radmin VPN also easily integrates with Famatech's flagship program, Radmin\u2014a remote support solution designed for IT professionals. After a connection is established among remotely located computers, you can securely access files and documents, and work from any location\u2014particularly useful for those who often travel.",
    "Apart from business users, Radmin VPN is popular among gamers. The software enables you to play Local Area Network (LAN) games with your friends over the internet by facilitating virtual LAN activities.",
    "When connected to the same network created by Radmin VPN, you and your friends can host and connect to LAN servers freely. Additionally, there isn\u2019t a limit to the number of players on a given network.",
    "With connection speeds of up to 100Mbps, you\u2019ll be able to load sites and download data without annoying lags. Radmin VPN\u2019s high speeds also maximize the enjoyment for gamers. You won\u2019t be faced with throttling speeds that can be frustrating to deal with.",
    "Software compatibility is the largest drawback of Radmin VPN\u2014the VPN is only available for Windows 7, 8, and 10 users. Famatech hasn\u2019t released a version of Radmin VPN that is compatible with the Mac or Linux OS.",
    "Radmin VPN is extremely easy to use. To set it up, all you\u2019ll need is a username and password. You can then access the VPN provider\u2019s home page or dashboard.",
    "RadminVPN\u2019s dashboard sports a simple interface with two options to click on\u2014Create Network and Join Network. To create a network, simply enter a name and a password. The credentials can then be shared with others to enable them to connect to the network that you\u2019ve created.",
    "All the essentials you need are available on Radmin VPN\u2019s dashboard. You can get an overview of key information such as a list of available networks and your IP address as well as toggle the on and off switch on the dashboard.",
    "Radmin VPN\u2019s website lacks a live chat function for real-time support. Instead, on the website support page, you\u2019ll find an official contact form that you can use to communicate with its support team. Because responses to queries can take a while, most users choose to tap into community options like Radmin VPN\u2019s Discord server to chat with other users. Alternatively, there is a community forum, the Radmin Club, where you can find useful information for troubleshooting.",
    "Radmin VPN uses AES-156 encryption\u2014the standard in the VPN industry. Sensitive information gets scrambled such that only trusted parties can decipher it. But a closer look at Radmin VPN\u2019s privacy policy suggests that the provider collects information such as domain, IP address, browser type, and operating system for maintenance and statistical purposes.",
    "Even though your personal data is meant for internal use, it may be handed over to authorities when a request is made. So, if you prioritize privacy, you might want to look elsewhere.",
    "The VPN market is saturated. Movie junkies and serial torrenters would be better off with paid VPN providers such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN which allow users to bypass geo-restrictions to stream content. These providers also offer an added layer of security by protecting your day-to-day online traffic.",
    "As far as free VPNs are concerned, ProtonVPN is a great alternative with its comparably high speeds and ease of use. Unlike Radmin VPN, ProtonVPN offers clients for both Windows and macOS. In terms of privacy, this VPN provider has a strict no-logs policy, and offers paid plans in addition to its free plan.",
    "Businesses and gamers will love Radmin VPN for its speediness, LAN gaming capabilities, and support for access to remote resources. But Radmin VPN isn\u2019t the solution to reroute internet traffic, bypass geo-restrictions, or safeguard online privacy. Unlike popular VPNs like ExpressVPN and NordVPN, it\u2019s not used by individuals who\u2019d like to shield their activity or download torrents. Instead, its focus is on securing internal connections for its users. With an absence of live chat and its lax privacy policy, support and security are areas that Radmin VPN could work on. The free software\u2019s clean, intuitive and easy-to-use interface, however, means that you\u2019ll likely need little or no guidance."
