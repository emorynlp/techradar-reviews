  "summary": "The return of the miniature iPad",
  "verdict": "The new iPad mini 2021, also called the iPad mini 6, is a powerful device with a crisp smaller screen, 5G connectivity support, and a stylish and compact design that makes it easy to insert into bags and even larger pockets. It won\u2019t be the best iPad for everyone, but it\u2019s undeniably the best small tablet money can buy.",
  "pros": [
    "Stylish compact design",
    "Starts at 64GB storage",
    "Lots of power"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "5G connectivity is limited",
    "Battery life could be better",
    "Doesn\u2019t include stylus"

    "The defining feature of the iPad mini (2021) is its small stature, and like the iPhone 13 mini this is a device that marries a scaled-down design that will be popular with many users with top-end specs and power.",
    "Think of it like an iPad Air 4, but shrunk down and with a more powerful chipset inside. It inherits a similar design to the iPad Air 4, with square edges, no home button and a USB-C port on the bottom edge.",
    "The 8.3-inch display is crisp, and it\u2019s bright enough for outdoor use, as well as for everything you\u2019d want to do with your tablet indoors. Apple calls this an \u201call-screen design\u201d, but we\u2019d argue that the thicker bezels mean that\u2019s a rather bold claim.",
    "That said, this iPad mini is easier to hold because of these bezels, so they\u2019re not necessarily a negative. You\u2019ve got the choice of four colors \u2013 Purple, Pink, Space Gray or Starlight.",
    "Apple has ensured that the iPad mini shines in the specs department, thanks primarily to the new A15 Bionic chipset, which has impressed us with its performance during our testing time.",
    "There\u2019s also either 64GB or 256GB of storage, depending on which model you opt for.",
    "5G is also now available on the iPad mini, which is a first for Apple\u2019s smaller tablet. That means you can connect to next-gen networks, if you opt for the cellular version and have a supporting carrier.",
    "The changes here over the iPad mini 2019 are incremental, but the sixth iteration of the iPad mini brings improvements in a variety of areas. It isn\u2019t the absolute-best iPad, but it\u2019s out-and-out the best tablet you can buy if you\u2019re looking for a small device.",
    "The new iPad mini (iPad mini 6) was revealed alongside the iPhone 13 range at Apple\u2019s launch event on September 14, 2021 and it came out in the US, UK and Australia 10 days later.",
    "You can order it now from Apple\u2019s website, and we're seeing it in stock at a variety of other retailers too. The price for the iPad mini 6 starts at $499 / \u00a3479 / AU$749.",
    "You can see all the prices for the new iPad mini models below, for both the 64GB and 256GB storage sizes, and the Wi-Fi-only or Wi-Fi + cellular options. It\u2019s worth noting that the 2019 iPad mini came in 32GB or 128GB options, so storage has been doubled for the 2021 model.",
    "The new iPad mini isn\u2019t quite mini enough for one-handed use, but it\u2019s noticeably easier to use than even the iPad Air 4 because of its small size. This feels like the perfect compromise, in terms of form factor, between the iPhone 13 Pro Max and a larger tablet like the iPad Air 4.",
    "Its dimensions of 195.4 x 134.8 x 6.3mm (that\u2019s notably smaller than the last-gen mini) make it one of the smallest tablets we\u2019ve ever used, and it\u2019s an enjoyable experience for anyone who doesn\u2019t need a larger screen for watching video and more.",
    "The design here is more like the iPad Air 4 or the new iPhone 13 than the previous mini \u2013 it\u2019s a flat-edged design that looks and feels premium, with a brushed metal effect on the rear of the tablet.",
    "There are four color options: Purple, Pink, and Space Gray, plus a cream-like color that Apple is calling Starlight \u2013 you\u2019ll see the Purple model pictured throughout this review.",
    "The Purple and Pink colors are more bold and vibrant than the options for the iPad mini 2019 or the iPad Pro 2021, and we\u2019d recommend choosing one of those shades over the more conservative Space Gray if you\u2019re looking for a more eye-catching design.",
    "The iPad mini weighs 293 grams (a touch less than the 2019 model), which means it\u2019s easy to slide into a bag \u2013 and even a large jacket pocket \u2013 and not feel the extra weight.",
    "Apple has moved the buttons slightly on the new iPad mini, and you\u2019ll now find the volume buttons are on the top edge, at the top right-hand corner. On previous versions, you\u2019d find these on the right hand edge of the device.",
    "There\u2019s also no home button on the iPad mini 2021, which was a staple of past versions of this tablet. Instead, there\u2019s a power button on the top edge in the left hand corner, and this is also home to the Touch ID sensor that enables you to use your fingerprint to unlock the tablet. We\u2019d recommend setting up fingers on both hands so that the unlock button is always within easy reach of one of your digits, whether you're using the tablet in portrait or landscape orientation.",
    "On the bottom edge of the tablet is the USB-C port, which is used for recharging the device as well as for connecting accessories. The iPad mini supports a variety of accessories such as the Apple Pencil, although it\u2019s not as functional as the iPad Pro 2021 with its Thunderbolt connector.",
    "The right edge houses the charger / connector for the Apple Pencil (second-gen), as well as the SIM tray. Note that the Apple Pencil doesn\u2019t come with the tablet, so you\u2019ll be spending more if you want Apple\u2019s stylus.",
    "The iPad mini also gets upgraded stereo speakers, which we found gave full and clear audio when listening to music or watching video on the tablet.",
    "The iPad mini features an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, which offers good picture quality.",
    "Apple says it's an \u201call-screen design\u201d, but we\u2019d argue that that isn\u2019t strictly the case, as there are thick bezels around the outside of the screen. These bezels aren\u2019t necessarily an issue though, as they allow you to more easily hold the tablet without touching the screen. It\u2019s far from an \u201call-screen\u201d look, though.",
    "The resolution is 2266 x 1488, which works out to 326 pixels per inch. That\u2019s good for a tablet, but it isn\u2019t the best resolution we\u2019ve seen on a slate, and \u2013 most noticeably when you\u2019re watching video \u2013 the resolution isn\u2019t as strong as on some Android tablets or even the iPad Pro 2021 line.",
    "It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll find this is an issue though, and the screen is suitably bright and the picture quality is clear. Unlike the 120Hz iPad Pro line, the iPad mini features a standard 60Hz refresh-rate display, so you\u2019re not getting a super-smooth experience when scrolling social feeds or playing games.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for a tablet with a smaller screen, the panel here will suit you very well; we\u2019d have liked to see a 120Hz refresh rate, but it isn\u2019t too much of an issue.",
    "The iPad mini 2021 is powered by Apple\u2019s new A15 Bionic chipset \u2013 that\u2019s the same processor as in the iPhone 13 series, and it\u2019s powerful enough to run any app or game you\u2019ll find on the App Store, as well as for multi-tasking.",
    "It isn\u2019t as powerful as the iPad Pro\u2019s M1 chipset, but we found it to be more than capable for everything we wanted to do on the iPad mini. If you need top-tier power, you may want to opt for the iPad Pro line instead, but most people will be happy with what\u2019s on offer here.",
    "We don\u2019t yet know how much RAM is inside the iPad mini, but in our testing it proved more than adequate for everyday takes.",
    "The Geekbench 5 benchmarking software gave us a multi-core score of 4700, which is similar to what we\u2019ve seen for the iPhone 13. That\u2019s significantly better than the iPad mini (2019), which scored 2680, but nowhere near as high as the iPad Pro 2021 on 7297.",
    "That iPad Pro 2021 score is remarkably high, and we never expected the iPad mini to be able to compete with the M1 chipset \u2013 and the average user won\u2019t need that sort of performance, even if they\u2019re using a lot of power-hungry apps.",
    "You can buy the tablet with 64GB or 256GB of storage \u2013 as usual there\u2019s no microSD support, so you\u2019ll be using the built-in storage plus whatever iCloud storage you have. If you\u2019re planning to store a fair amount of media on your device you\u2019ll likely want to go for the 256GB model.",
    "That said, serious power users are likely to find that 256GB of storage isn\u2019t enough. The new iPad Pro goes up to 1TB of storage, so it may be worth looking at that model if you\u2019re intending to fill your tablet with apps and media.",
    "There\u2019s also 5G connectivity on the iPad mini for the first time \u2013 although the tablet won\u2019t be compatible with mmWave 5G, so if you\u2019re a Verizon customer you may want to look into this before you purchase the tablet.",
    "The rear camera on the iPad mini is a 12MP wide snapper with an f/1.8 aperture and digital zoom up to 5x. It\u2019s fine, and while it\u2019s no substitute for your smartphone camera, if you\u2019re using it for augmented reality experiences, or with other apps that need to use the rear camera, it\u2019ll be satisfactory.",
    "On the front of the tablet is a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 122-degree field of view and an f/2.4 aperture. This is a very effective camera for video calling, and we found the quality here is better than from the shooter on the rear of the device.",
    "Apple has also brought its Center Stage feature from the 2021 iPad Pro to the iPad mini. This enables the camera to track you when you\u2019re on video calls, and ensure that you\u2019re always in the center of the frame.",
    "We found this to work well, and it\u2019s especially useful when someone else enters the frame and you want them to be included in the video too.",
    "The iPad mini comes running iPadOS 15 out of the box, and Apple\u2019s tablet-optimized operating system works well on Apple\u2019s smaller-screen tablet.",
    "iPadOS 15 brings updates such as widgets for your home screen, which are welcome on the new iPad mini. There\u2019s also a new way to enable split-screen mode with just a tap, which is another nice improvement.",
    "Both the iPad mini 2015 and iPad mini 2019 are capable of upgrading to iPadOS 15, so it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll see many years of software support if you buy this tablet; that\u2019s not guaranteed, but Apple has a strong record in this area.",
    "Don\u2019t expect super-long battery life from the iPad mini 2021, but it\u2019s good enough to last you for a full day of typical use. We don\u2019t yet know the size of the cell inside the iPad mini as Apple doesn\u2019t reveal these details, although we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if an enterprising teardowner finds out before too long.",
    "Apple estimates that you\u2019ll get up to 10 hours of use when browsing the web or watching video over Wi-Fi, and we found that to be about right. Your iPad mini likely won\u2019t last that long if you\u2019re using the tablet on full brightness and swapping between multiple apps \u2013 we were getting around eight hours of battery life with more intensive use.",
    "So the battery life is okay, but it isn\u2019t going to blow your mind. We found that things like sketching with the Apple Pencil also drained the battery life more quickly, and it\u2019s likely to drop even faster if you\u2019re using mobile connections as well.",
    "A USB-C charger and cable are included in the box for recharging your tablet. There\u2019s 20W fast charging here, which we found was able to recharge the tablet pretty quickly, but it\u2019ll still take over an hour and a half to fully recharge your slate.",
    "In our testing, the iPad mini recharged from zero to 17% in 15 minutes, and after half an hour it was up to 36%.",
    "There\u2019s no wireless charging here, and the iPad mini isn\u2019t compatible with the company\u2019s MagSafe accessories that work with a variety of iPhone models.",
