  "summary": "An affordable, easy-to-use slow juicer that\u2019s a good entry level model",
  "verdict": "The Amzchef Slow Juicer ZM1501 is an affordable slow juicer that\u2019s simple to use. It\u2019s quick at extracting juice from fresh produce, but the yields are a little lower than you\u2019ll get from a more expensive model, and the juice wasn\u2019t as smooth either. That said, we think it's an acceptable compromise given the price difference.",

    "Good value for money",
    "Easy to assemble",
    "Parts are dishwasher safe"

    "Amzchef is a relatively new kitchen appliances brand, so you may not have heard the name before, but it\u2019s starting an assault on the small appliance market, with a range of affordable kitchen gadgets it hopes will give more expensive models from names such as Philips and Ninja a run for its money.",
    "Juicers are at the core of its current product range, with five different slow juicer models available. The Amzchef Slow Juicer ZM1501 is slightly more expensive than its entry-level model but is still very affordable.",
    "Slow juicers extract the juice by grinding fruits and vegetables in an action that\u2019s similar to chewing, the liquid is then extracted as it\u2019s passed through a strainer that separates out the pulp. The Amzchef Slow Juicer model comes with one strainer and offers two functions: on or reverse, along with a 0.74 quart/0.7-liter juice container.",
    "There\u2019s nothing over-complicated to get to grips with and it\u2019s quite intuitive to use. However, the Amzchef Slow Juicer extracts average juice yields, the performance is neither the best nor the worst that we\u2019ve seen.",
    "That said at $109.99/ \u00a399.99/ AUS $220, its a good option for those new to juicing who are looking for a slow juicer to start their journey into juicing, rather than opting for a centrifugal juicer. It\u2019s also suited to those on a budget, or who want an affordable device as they\u2019re unsure how often they will use a juicer.",
    "The Amzchef Slow Juicer ZM1501 will set you back $109.99/ \u00a399.99/ AUS $220 and is available from Amazon in the US and UK, as well the Amzchef website in the US. In Australia, it can be purchased through Ubuy.",
    "This is a budget slow juicer that\u2019s much more affordable than most other slow juicers so it\u2019s a good starter model.",
    "The Amzchef Slow Juicer ZM1501 comes in five different colors: white, gray, red, green and orange. So if you want a juicer that\u2019ll fit in with your kitchen color scheme, there are plenty of options to choose from. It\u2019s smaller and easier to store when disassembled, but when fully assembled measures 14.8 x 15 x 6.3 inch/ 37.5 x 38 x 16cm (H x W x D). It weighs around 6.6lbs/ 3kg so it\u2019s not too heavy to lift in and out of a cupboard when not in use, that said, it\u2019s not an ugly appliance so you won\u2019t feel it has to be hidden away.",
    "Assembly is simple and all of the parts click together easily, there\u2019s just one strainer so you don\u2019t get a choice of different sizes for different types of drink that you get with some of the more expensive slow juicers. It just comes with a brush for cleaning and a wrench tool to help with disassembling if you\u2019re struggling, but we didn\u2019t find disassembly difficult at all.",
    "The 0.74 quart/0.7-liter juice container is a good size, but if you\u2019re planning on doing lots of juicing in one go, it\u2019ll fill up quickly. The juice container doesn\u2019t come with a lid, so it can\u2019t be used for storing juice, you\u2019ll need to find an alternative jug with a lid for that. Annoyingly there\u2019s not a drip stop, so when the juice container is removed, juice drips onto the base of the juicer.",
    "The feed tube is just 1.8 inch / 4.8cm wide, so most larger fruits and vegetables need to be cut up before juicing. Although Amzchef does point out on its website that this small size stops children from putting their hands or fingers low enough into the juicer to get hurt, which is a plus. The large pulp container sits on the counter so it\u2019s really easy to empty without having to disassemble the juicer. Unfortunately, the instruction manual isn\u2019t particularly well written but the only settings to choose from are on or reverse so it\u2019s not tricky to get to grips with.",
    "For all the juices we made in the Amzchef Slow Juicer ZM1501, the juice yields were slightly below what we\u2019ve seen from more premium slow juicers but exceeded the results from its nearest competitor in terms of price, which is the more expensive Ninja Cold Press Juicer.",
    "First off, we made a mixed juice from broccoli, parsley, apple, pear, ginger, and celery. We noticed quite quickly that if you try to put too much in the feed tube it can get jammed, so slow and steady works best. Our mixed juice had some froth on top and the texture was slightly grainy rather than completely smooth, the juice yield was 66%. Our decibel meter registered 84dB (along with the kale test which registered the same sound level), which is equivalent to the noise from a diesel truck traveling at 40 mph. That said, it\u2019s still not the loudest juicer we\u2019ve ever tested, and as the noise level is only experienced for a short period at a time, we think this is acceptable.",
    "Juicing kale produced a yield of 43% which although not as good as you\u2019ll get from more expensive slow juicers, is much better than you\u2019ll get if you try to juice kale in a centrifugal juicer. The kale juice had quite a lot of froth on top and a slightly powdery mouthfeel.",
    "The yield of 35% when juicing carrots isn\u2019t great, it means there\u2019s quite a lot of waste, the juice itself had no froth on top but the texture was gritty. The result from juicing five oranges was a good orange juice that was virtually completely smooth with no pulp and a 69% yield.",
    "As we mentioned earlier, you\u2019ll have to cut larger fruits and vegetables into pieces to fit them in the small feed tube and despite being cut up it took quite a slow 36 seconds to juice a whole apple. All parts are dishwasher safe, but if you don\u2019t have a dishwasher, they clean easily with little more than a quick rinse.",
