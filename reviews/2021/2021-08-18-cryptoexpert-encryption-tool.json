    "The best encryption software is designed to help you securely store files and other data on your computer. In the modern world, it\u2019s not all that uncommon for hackers and other malicious third-parties to gain access to personal and business computers. If files aren\u2019t protected, it\u2019s extremely easy for these people to steal them, which can raise serious problems if you\u2019re dealing with sensitive personal or financial information.",
    "Our CryptoExpert review takes a close look at a popular encryption program. It\u2019s designed for Windows users who are looking for a simple yet powerful encryption solution. We analyze every aspect of the program to help you decide whether it\u2019s as good as it appears on the surface.",
    "A 30-day free trial is available for those who would like to test CryptoExpert and its encryption solutions. There\u2019s also the CryptoExpert 8 Lite option available for home users. It\u2019s free forever, but it lacks 256-bit AES encryption.",
    "A premium CryptoExpert lifetime license comes in at $59.95, adding full AES encryption capabilities. Significant discounts are available with bulk license purchases, with more than 25% off in some cases. Educational and non-profit organizations will also benefit from a special discount, with prices starting from 30% lower than the base price.",
    "One thing worth noting here is that there aren\u2019t any site or enterprise licenses available. Instead, you will need to speak with the CryptoExpert team about further bulk discounts if you require more than 100 licenses.",
    "At its simplest, CryptoExpert provides simple file encryption solutions for everyone from personal to business users. However, it also boasts a few neat features, the most noteworthy of which we\u2019ve listed below.",
    "One particularly useful feature is the ability to store your file unlock keys on a USB flash drive. This removes them completely from your computer, providing an extra layer of security if anyone does gain access. All keys can be protected with a master password on your USB drive, reducing the risk of them being stolen even if your USB is compromised.",
    "Another neat feature is CryptoExpert\u2019s secure vaults. Basically, you can create virtual local drives on your computer that you can use to store all files. These can be as big as you need them to be, which makes them particularly useful for storing and organizing large files.",
    "CryptoExpert also enables you to modify encrypted files in a fast and efficient manner. You don\u2019t need to decrypt files before you edit them, which is a handy little time-saving feature.",
    "To get started with CryptoExpert, simply follow the links on the website to download the program. Enter a license key or take advantage of the 30-day free trial to get started.",
    "Actually using CryptoExpert was very straightforward\u2014once we finally figured out how it worked. There\u2019s no getting started guide and we couldn\u2019t even find a simple user manual on the company website, so learning how the program worked basically involved trial and error.",
    "Create a new vault to store encrypted files in, set a solid password to ensure unauthorized users can\u2019t access it, and add files to protect them. When you want to access your files, head to your vault, enter your password, and there they will be.",
    "Unfortunately, CryptoExpert offers very limited support services. You can reach out to the team via email, but there\u2019s no live chat, phone, or even online ticket support. The company doesn\u2019t even have social media accounts that you could use to get in contact. There aren\u2019t any notable self-help resources to speak of, and you will basically need to troubleshoot any problems on your own.",
    "As a popular file encryption program, CryptoExpert naturally provides excellent security services across the board. For one, you can choose to use AES, BLOWFISH, CAST, or 3DES encryption to protect your files. Only those with your passphrase can access your secure vaults.",
    "You can also specify an automatic locking time for your vaults. There\u2019s even an option to have all vaults lock when your computer hibernates.",
    "CryptoExpert is a surprisingly popular file encryption program, especially considering the fact that there\u2019s no user guide or tutorial resources.",
    "If you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s a little easier to get started with, we\u2019d recommend giving CryptoForge a try. It also offers a free trial, and is extremely straightforward to download and set up.",
    "Alternatively, you might like to try AxCrypt, which is one of the most popular premium encryption programs in the world. It\u2019s mainly targeted at mobile users, and it uses full 256-bit AES encryption where required. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s available in numerous different languages and can be used to protect files on cloud storage platforms such as Dropbox or Google Drive.",
    "At the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing particularly bad to note about the CryptoExpert file encryption software. But there\u2019s nothing that stands out as particularly noteworthy either.",
    "You will be able to protect files by placing them in CryptoExpert\u2019s secure vaults. Unlock keys can be stored securely on a USB flash drive for added security. However, the platform is quite confusing to get started with, and there are no self-help resources or tutorials to speak of."
