  "verdict": "The Valve Index is the next-generation VR headset we\u2019ve been waiting for, but the Steam VR platform on which the headset depends is still capricious, and painfully hard to troubleshoot. At $999 / \u00a3919 (about AU$1,425) for the full package, Valve\u2019s high-powered headset is an expensive portal to the future \u2013 and one that we\u2019ll use almost exclusively going forward \u2013 but it\u2019s powered by decades-old software.",

    "Valve has played a huge and important part in pushing virtual reality forwards over the years with its tracking system and SteamVR platform. But it didn\u2019t launch its own VR headset until 2019, the Valve Index.",
    "Even today, nearly two years after it launched, the Valve Index is one of the best virtual reality headsets money can buy. It has an ultra-crisp display that runs fairly well even with older GPUs, a wide field of view, a high refresh rate and Valve\u2019s 'knuckle' controllers, which can track the movement of each and everyone one of your fingers.",
    "It\u2019s the complete VR package that we\u2019ve been waiting for.",
    "But the kind of next-generation VR on offer from the Valve Index is inevitably expensive \u2013 the Valve Index headset is $999 / \u00a3919 (about AU$1,425). And, before we hail Valve\u2019s hardware as our VR savior, it\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s not without some issues, including a lack of compelling VR games on Steam and SteamVR\u2019s problematic troubleshooting process.",
    "More recently, there's also a Valve Index problem that has little to do with actual performance: it's tricky to find one. In many regions, stock can be frustratingly hard to come by. Valve CEO Gabe Newell has stated that necessary components for the headset manufactured in Wuhan, China haven't been readily available during the pandemic, so that doesn't look to be changing anytime soon.",
    "But are any of these issues deal-breakers for getting your own Valve VR headset, assuming you can find one? Not at all.",
    "It\u2019s easy to write off the Valve Index as another nondescript VR headset in the same vein as any Oculus Rift or HTC Vive headset \u2013 but the devil\u2019s all in the detail here.",
    "On the front, there\u2019s a glossy plastic faceplate above two front-facing cameras that can be used for passthrough video and, potentially, AR applications. Go to put the headset on and you\u2019ll feel the stone gray pads that line the inside; it\u2019s a similar Halo design to what Oculus is doing on the Rift S, and it feels both comfortable and snug.",
    "To keep it that way, there are two dials you\u2019ll need to use \u2013 one on the left side that changes the physical distance from the lens to your eyes, and the one on that back that makes the headband tighter or looser. While the second is definitely important, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s the first dial that\u2019s actually groundbreaking, as that\u2019s what allows the Index to achieve its industry-leading field of view spec.",
    "How does it do that? The science of this is pretty self-explanatory, but basically the closer a screen is to your face, the wider the field of view. The problem here is that, for folks who wear glasses, you won\u2019t be able to get the lenses right up to your eyes \u2013 and that means you'll see a similar field of view to what you'd get with the other headsets out there.",
    "In terms of hard numbers, the Valve Index uses a dual LCD display with a 1440 x 1600 resolution per eye. Unlike Oculus, which has actually dropped the refresh rate of its displays for the Oculus Rift S, the Valve Index has a 120Hz display, with the option to bump this up to 144Hz. For comparison, the more-expensive Vive Pro has a lower refresh rate and smaller field of view, so this actually feels like a big upgrade.",
    "Inside the box you\u2019ll find the headset itself, the new Valve Index Controllers (colloquially referred to as \u2018knuckle\u2019 controllers), and the Version 2.0 Base Stations, which need to be set up around your room. Now, if you have a Vive or Vive Pro headset already, the first-gen base stations are compatible with the Valve Index, but you\u2019ll probably want to start with the second-gen stations if you don\u2019t have a pair already.",
    "We won\u2019t dwell on this aspect, but the fact that the Vive Index uses base stations at all feels like a step backwards, even if the end result it a good one \u2013 the Valve Index does a much better job of tracking behind-the-back hand movements (a rare use case, we know) than any other headset. Case in point: at no point during our hands-on time did the system lose track of the controllers. Obviously, that could change with more use, but so far so good.",
    "Still, its reliance on external trackers puts the Index behind the Oculus Rift S, which does room-scale VR without any external tracking sensors that need to sit on a shelf. It\u2019s a trade-off you\u2019ll make by choosing the Valve Index over the Oculus Rift S, but it\u2019s a worthwhile one.",
    "Amazingly, while all these features would seem to require extra horsepower under the hood of your PC, they actually worked fine with our much older Nvidia GTX 980 GPU. That\u2019s a boon for folks who don\u2019t have the money to upgrade their GPU after buying a $1,000 VR headset, and it could allow for more people to get into VR.",
    "That last bit is important, because as more people adopt VR, more developers will see a business case for making VR games \u2013 right now, Steam\u2019s VR selection is a bit bare compared to the ever-expanding main store, and even the top titles selected by Valve to show off the new hardware are really just a lot of old titles that play better with the Knuckle controllers (see: Space Pirate Trainer, Fruit Ninja, Beat Saber and Arizona Sunshine).",
    "That said, when we played some newer titles, like Valve\u2019s Moondust demo, we couldn\u2019t help but smile. Not only do the games look great on the high-resolution screen, and play without any hitches even on our less-than-ideal hardware, but they feel more interactive with the Index Controller. Being able to release items by opening your hand \u2013 a completely natural experience here in the real world \u2013 feels unnatural at first after using regular VR controllers for the last two years, but once you adapt to it, it once again becomes second nature.",
    "Unfortunately, not all titles will do something extra with the new Valve Index Controllers. In fact, during our testing we found a number of games that actually didn\u2019t work, period. According to Valve, more games will be optimized for the headset in the future, but right now there are only about three dozen such titles \u2013 a decent number before launch, but still just a fraction of the VR games available on Steam.",
    "When talking about virtual reality, there\u2019s also sound quality to consider. The Valve Index uses a built-in solution that, to all intents and purposes, works incredibly well. You\u2019re able to hear a great number of details without distortion, and even though it\u2019s an inch from the ear, it can still get reasonably loud. It also feels a bit more hygienic when it comes time to pass the headset to another person \u2013 as your ears never make contact with the pads, although that\u2019s a fairly minor detail.",
    "Over the course of several sessions we were able to get a lot accomplished - we played a bit of Beat Saber\u2019s campaign, chopped some fruit in Fruit Ninja and wrecked some robots in Space Pirate Trainer \u2013 and through it all the controllers held their charge. At the end of the last day the controllers dropped down to a single bar of life, but a safe assumption is to expect around five hours of playtime before you need to recharge the controllers, and about an hour on the charger to bring them back to full juice.",
    "The biggest fault we found with the headset after using it for more than a month is that SteamVR can be capricious\u2026 and, occasionally, a malicious, dastardly platform.",
    "As anyone who\u2019s used an HTC Vive or Vive Pro can tell you, SteamVR doesn\u2019t always like running properly the first time, telling you that something is disconnected, or that your firmware is out of date despite just being updated, or simply telling you the hardware can\u2019t be found. And that\u2019s frustrating when you just want to jump in and play this week\u2019s latest release.",
    "This happened to us a few times throughout our testing, and it gave us a real sense of deja vu \u2013 we can remember testing the Vive Pro just over a year ago and having the same problem. Friends and readers have also complained about the original Vive\u2019s lengthy and unwieldy setup process, only to find a number of errors the next time they go to play it.",
    "In Valve\u2019s defense, the setup process has gotten a bit smoother over the years. The headset does appear to work right out of the box without much hassle, and setting up the 2.0 base station appears to be a bit faster than before. But there\u2019s still the problem that if anything in the room changes \u2013 the base stations get moved because you\u2019re cleaning the shelf, for example \u2013 you\u2019ll need to recalibrate and go through the whole setup process again.",
    "The Valve Index might be one of the best VR headsets currently on the market, but it\u2019s brought some of VR\u2019s most annoying aspects along for the ride. Setting it up can be time-consuming and irritating, updates can cause connection issues, and you may find a new error the next time you go to use it.",
    "However, if you can look past those issues, this is a really good VR headset. Its higher-resolution screen and better refresh rate allowed us to use it for longer periods of time without discomfort compared to most other VR headsets, and the Index Controllers are a real step up from the ones that ship with the Vive.",
    "But square all of these performance improvements against the headset\u2019s price tag, and it's a lot of money to pay for a piece of hardware that isn\u2019t absolutely perfect \u2013 especially when Oculus has a great VR headset of its own. The Oculus Quest and now the Oculus Quest 2 are both available at less than half the cost of the Index.",
    "Around the house, there\u2019s no doubt the Valve Index will be our default VR headset going forward. It\u2019s a significant upgrade to the HTC Vive, and runs much smoother than the Vive Pro, a powerful VR headset that really struggled to deliver on the promise of high-end VR. Whether it\u2019s a better all-around headset than the Oculus Quest, however, is up for debate; the Valve Index has the better specs, but Quest has the convenience and is bound to be more appealing to anyone who doesn't have the time, high-tech set-up or budget to opt for the Vive Index. Ultimately, which one you choose depends on the experience you want and how much money you have in the bank."
