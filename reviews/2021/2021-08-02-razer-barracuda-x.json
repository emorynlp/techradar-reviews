  "verdict": "Gamers looking for an affordable wireless gaming headset with compatibility across PC, Android and a handful of major consoles should look no further than the Barracuda X.

    "There are more than enough options for quality mid-range gaming headsets with wireless capabilities including the Elo 7.1 Air Wireless RGB PC Gaming Headset, Corsair HS70BT, SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless and HyperX Cloud Alpha. Now, gamers looking for an affordable wire-free solution can add the comparable Razer Barracuda X to the mix. The $99.99 (\u00a399.99, AU$149.99) gaming headset differentiates itself from the pack by offering wireless compatibility across PC, Playstation 5, Nintendo Switch and Android via a USB-C dongle.",
    "While it only weighs 250g the ultra-lightweight Barracuda X doesn\u2019t slack on the audio. Razer\u2019s Triforce titanium drivers allow the headset to provide 7.1 surround sound compatible with both Spatial Audio for Playstation 5 and PC through THX. Add a promised battery life of up to 20 hours and the Barracuda X definitely deserves consideration among its similarly priced rivals. There are some dubious trade-offs made for those who may use the gaming headset on PC such as the lack of Razer Synapse support and extra fee for using THX Spatial Audio.",
    "Available for half-off the $20 price with purchase of the Barracuda, the THX Spatial Audio app allows users to customize their audio experience. Alongside various EQ presets and calibration tools, there\u2019s even an Application Mixer option that grants the ability to utilize THX Spatial Audio on a per-app basis.",
    "Also, Xbox console users get no love on the wireless front.",
    "Out of the box, the Barracuda X maintains Razer\u2019s signature all black aesthetic with green accents on the microphone on/off switch and LED light once fully charged. Holding the headset , it feels nearly weightless yet it\u2019s built to take a bit of punishment.",
    "Wearing the headset, the Barracuda X is comfortable thanks to the Oval FlowKnit Ear Cushions, Ultra-soft FlowKnit Memory Foam and cushioned headband. During testing, there were moments where it was so comfortable and light enough to forget it was on our head. Everything from the power button, 3.5 wired jack, USB-C charging port, detachable mic port, volume roller and mic switch are easy to reach on the right ear cup.",
    "The Razer Barracuda X shines regardless of platform, whether you\u2019re playing games or just listening to music. Nintendo Switch gamers will be happy to know that it works in both handheld and docked modes which is a huge plus considering its price. This makes the headset seriously versatile during sessions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild or Astral Chain.",
    "And because the headset supports Spatial Audio on PS5, audio in games like Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Returnal really pop, boosting situational awareness. On Android devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, the USB-C dongle fits snuggly despite being housed in a protective case. Other Android devices\u2019 mileage on that may vary, but it sounds great when playing Xbox Game Pass games on our phone.",
    "Things get tricky on PC, though. For some strange reason, the Barracuda X doesn\u2019t have support from Razer\u2019s Synapse app which means there isn\u2019t any audio customization, app-based firmware updating or even battery level indicator outside of the LED light on the headset itself. The only way to adjust audio to a user\u2019s liking is through the THX Spatial Audio app that costs an extra dub. This also opens up the ability to have a better experience with compatible games like Doom Eternal. THX Spatial Audio does enhance atmosphere alongside situational awareness which is crucial in games like Metro: Exodus.",
    "Though the detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone isn\u2019t the clearest out of the other headsets mentioned, it does have some decent passive noise cancellation. Communication during games and phone calls on Android devices were clear enough but not the best. Probably best to keep this headset indoors when using the mic.",
    "During general music listening sessions, the Barracuda X offers great performance. Bass gets deep without cracking while treble and mid-tones are more than serviceable. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the ultra pop standards of Kylie Minogue, old-school sounds like Willie Hutch or modern Trap stylings by artists like Lil Baby, the headset handles multiple genres quite well.",
    "Despite Razer\u2019s promised 20 hours of battery life, the Barracuda X did pump out a few extra hours between charges. This places the gaming headset on par with rivals there as well. Charging to full via USB-C took a few hours and you can use the headset on PC while it\u2019s charging.",
    "The Barracuda X is definitely the one of the best headsets for gamers looking to switch it up between multiple platforms. That doesn\u2019t even take into account the audio quality, battery life and comfortability. Razer\u2019s Barracuda X should be on the top of anyone\u2019s list for those who need an affordable headset with serious versatility alongside usability \u2013 though the need to buy extra software dampens that value a bit."
