  "author": "lewis-leong",
  "summary": "Bigger and better sounding ... but still not a smart speaker",
  "verdict": "The Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is an excellent-sounding wireless speaker. While we\u2019d like to see a higher IP rating, it\u2019s splash-proofing is good enough for most people. Combined with the optional charging base, the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is a great speaker to use at home and on the go.",
  "pros": [
    "Full and balanced sound",
    "16-hour battery life",
    "Multi-device pairing"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Only splash-proof",
    "Charging dock sold separately",
    "No smart assistant onboard"

    "Bose has always impressed us with its Bluetooth speakers. Both the Bose SoundLink Mini II and its spiritual successor, the SoundLink Revolve, impressed with excellent sound that is wonderfully balanced and expansive. But, for those looking for more volume and better battery life, there\u2019s the larger Bose SoundLink Revolve+.",
    "After spending several weeks with the speaker, we came away impressed with its build and sound quality. While it's certainly not the cheapest Bluetooth speaker at $300 (\u00a3280, AU$430), it\u2019s well worth the extra $100 over the smaller Revolve if you\u2019re looking for slightly better sound quality and better battery life.",
    "All that said, though, while we liked the speaker, we can\u2019t help but feel that the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is a bit expensive for what you get: The competition - the UE Blast and JBL Link 20 smart speakers - both have voice assistant chops while the SoundLink Revolve doesn't.",
    "If you don\u2019t care about its lack of a voice assistant, the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is an excellent speaker at home and on the go, but if you like your speakers with a bit of intellect, you'll have to look elsewhere.",
    "[Update: Bose has unveiled two new Bluetooth speakers for 2021: the Bose Soundlink Revolve II and the Bose Soundlink Revolve+ II.",
    "The successors to the Soundlink Revolve and Revolve+ portable speakers, the new models are nearly identical to the brand's popular speakers, albeit with a few important upgrades.",
    "The new Revolve II now comes with a 13-hour battery life, a modest upgrade from its predecessor's 12-hour charge. Meanwhile, the battery life of the Revolve+ II has been increased from 16 to 17 hours.",
    "Both Bluetooth speakers have been given an IP55 rating, increasing their water-resistance, and adding protection from dust.]",
    "The design of the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is nearly identical to the smaller Bose SoundLink revolve. Both feature aluminum chassis with rubberized bases and buttons. The only difference is that the SoundLink+ gains a handy handle for taking on the go. Although it looks like it will weigh a ton, the speaker is surprisingly light for its size, making it easy to take with you to a party.",
    "On top of the speaker you\u2019ll find all of the controls for power, pairing, volume, aux switch, and multifunction button that works to control playback as well as activating the voice assistant on your phone. The buttons are easy to press and the multifunction button is slightly raised, making it easy to use by feel. There\u2019s also a mic that\u2019s great at picking up your voice for calling.",
    "On the back of the speaker you\u2019ll find the microUSB port and 3.5mm aux port for legacy devices. We\u2019re disappointed that Bose didn\u2019t choose to update the speaker with USB type-C as most devices today have moved to the new connector which supports fast charging and the lack of one means that the SoundLink Revolve+ takes ages to fully charge if you run it dry.",
    "On the bottom you\u2019ll find a standard tripod mount and you\u2019ll also notice four metal contacts for using with the charging dock, which is sold separately. The dock makes it easy to dock when at home and really should be included with the speaker, seeing as the older Bose SoundLink Mini II ships with one.",
    "If you read our Bose SoundLink Revolve review, you\u2019ll already know that we\u2019re big fans of its sound.",
    "The good news is that the bigger SoundLink Revolve+ improves on the sound quality of the smaller Revolve in just about every way, though the tonal balance is identical between the two. The overall balance is slightly warm, which make the Bose very forgiving with compressed music from streaming services.",
    "The biggest difference between the two is that the bigger Revolve+ gets much louder and throws and even more expansive soundstage. While music still plays in mono, there\u2019s a sense of air around individual instruments and vocals.",
    "Bass is controlled and provides good impact. Like with its smaller sibling, you can increase the bass response by placing the speaker next to a wall. However, the Revolve+ does a better job of rendering bass in the center of the room than the smaller Revolve, which is unsurprising since the speaker is much bigger.",
    "Battery life is rated at 16-hours and we saw around 10 to 12 hours listening to medium to high volume. If you listen at a more reasonable volume, you should be able to hit Bose\u2019s 16-hour rating. But if you\u2019re planning on bumping some tunes at a friend's house party, you may want to bring its charger.",
    "The Bose SoundLink Revolve+ is a great speaker, albeit expensive and a bit dated compared to the competition. It may not have a smart assistant built in for voice controls, but for those who don\u2019t care about that, the Revolve+ is a pleasure to use, especially if you pair it with the dock ... which, unfortunately, is sold separately. (Yes, the user experience and sound quality are so good we can overlook its missing features.)",
    "However, if you\u2019re looking for a connected speaker, the JBL Link 20 is an excellent value that packs Google Assistant into a portable weatherproof speaker. If you don\u2019t plan to take your speaker outside, the Sonos One is a better value at $200 and comes with Amazon's Alexa smart assistant on-board (Google Assistant is coming to the Sonos One some time this year, too).",
    "If you're looking for a brilliant-sounding-but-basic Bluetooth speaker, look no further."
