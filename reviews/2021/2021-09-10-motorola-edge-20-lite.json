  "summary": "Budget specs from a premium range",
  "verdict": "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite is a decent, reasonably affordable 5G Android phone in most respects. It has a large OLED screen, clean software and good day-to-day performance. However, it costs more than the best of the value-packed competition, the camera fumbles its dynamic range processing, and battery life is shorter than expected.",
  "pros": [
    "Punchy and large OLED screen",
    "Has a headphone socket",
    "Clean-looking software"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Weak/unreliable camera HDR",
    "Surprisingly short battery life",
    "Mono speaker"

    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite is the most affordable member of the Edge family, which sits above Motorola\u2019s G-series phones. So while the Edge 20 Lite may seem a budget Android to some, it's not part of a full-on budget line-up.",
    "This only really exhibits in one way in the phone itself. The Motorola Edge 20 Lite has an OLED screen, not the LCD type used in many upper entry-level Androids like this.",
    "There\u2019s a lot of competition from Xiaomi and Realme in this area, and a few of their phones are better value. You could even argue the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G is pretty similar in several ways, and it's a bunch cheaper.",
    "An above average screen is the main Motorola Edge 20 Lite draw, then, but we\u2019d like to see higher peak brightness to make this a true killer display.",
    "Battery life is the real surprise here. A 5,000mAh cell feels like the right size for the Motorola Edge 20 Lite, but on all test days it has struggled. It would be easy to blame the MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G chipset, but the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G has the same processor and lasts a long time between charges.",
    "It\u2019s a bit of a mystery.",
    "Ultimately, the Motorola Edge 20 Lite is a decent affordable 5G phone with fair cameras and a big, good-looking screen. However, it doesn\u2019t hold up well enough against the best of the more affordable competition to earn a full recommendation.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite is part of the first wave of the expanded Edge range. It\u2019s the cheapest in a trio, costing $415.99 / \u00a3299.99 / AU$565.",
    "What do you lose out on? There are no glass backs or metal sides, no zoom cameras or high-end processors here.",
    "The aim is to get you good-quality basics, and 5G mobile internet, without a huge outlay.",
    "The Edge series\u2019s job is to class-up the Motorola brand a bit. We have recommended many of its Moto G phones for almost a decade now, and these Edge ones are a step above.",
    "This isn\u2019t hugely apparent in this lower-end Motorola Edge 20 Lite, though. It has a plastic back and plastic sides. You can tell immediately it\u2019s not a flagship phone. And considering the cost, that's probably okay.",
    "The only thing we can identify that separates it from the no-nonsense Moto G-series phones is thickness. At 8.25mm the Motorola Edge 20 Lite is slightly thinner than most of the cheaper Motos.",
    "Motorola has also done a good job of making the plastic back look like glass. It has a textured top surface and a shimmery light reactive layer that has an effect similar to some matte finish glass phones.",
    "You get to shrug off the slightly chunky feel of a Moto G30, although the Motorola Edge 20 Lite comes with a decent silicone case and we\u2019d think you should use it if you want to keep the bodywork pristine.",
    "There\u2019s no factory applied screen protector here, though, and we\u2019d recommend one. While the more expensive Motorola Edge 20 and Motorola Edge 20 Pro phones have Corning Gorilla Glass screen protection, this one uses another unspecified kind of glass. And it\u2019s likely not as hard or strong.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s outer parts bring no real surprises or stand-out features. It has a reasonably loud speaker, but it uses a single driver on the bottom of the phone rather than a stereo array. It can sound slightly brash at high volumes.",
    "Motorola uses a side-mounted fingerprint scanner rather than an under-screen one. It\u2019s fractionally slower than the fastest around, but we bedded into its rhythm within about 24 hours. The Motorola Edge 20 Lite also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, unlike the higher-end Motorola Edge 20 Pro.",
    "There\u2019s also a Google Assistant button on the left side of the phone. We\u2019ve pressed this accidentally a few times because - again unlike the Edge 20 Pro - it doesn\u2019t have a deliberately harder-to-press mechanism. We didn\u2019t find it goes off regularly in a pocket, though, and that\u2019s the main thing.",
    "Water resistance is rated at IP52, about as low as you can go while still having an IP rating. It means the Motorola Edge 20 Lite should be able to handle light rain, but that\u2019s about it.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite has a large 6.7-inch OLED display with a 1080 x 2400 resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. It is a step above the many slightly cheaper LCD alternatives in terms of contrast and color.",
    "OLED screens have self-lit pixels, so the black areas of an image can stay perfectly black even if other parts of the picture are very bright. You won\u2019t notice this all the time, only when in a darker room, but OLED contrast is always valuable.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite also has deep color saturation, another typical OLED trait. Motorola says it\u2019s intended to fulfil the DCI-P3 color gamut, but to our eyes the \u2018Saturated\u2019 display mode seems to overshoot a bit. This is likely because Saturated uses the OLED panel\u2019s native color gamut, the widest range of colors it can display.",
    "Many of you may like this ultra-saturated look, but there\u2019s also a Natural mode. This seems to track closer to the sRGB standard, which renders Google app icons in pastel-like tones. It\u2019s the mode we chose to use.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s OLED screen isn\u2019t nearly as bright as some of the top OLED phones. Peak brightness of well over 1000 nits is quite common these days but this phone goes up to 427 nits according to our colorimeter.",
    "This is just about enough to make the display seem reasonably clear outdoors, but higher brightness would make shooting photos outside on a sunny day a bit more comfortable. Considering the screen is a key draw here, a little extra screen power would have been nice.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite has three rear cameras. Its primary one has a 108MP Samsung HM2 sensor, the same used in the higher-end Edge 20 Pro. That\u2019s a pretty good start.",
    "Its other cameras are an 8MP ultra-wide with a Samsung sensor and a basic little 2MP OmniVision sensor for depth mapping. This is used in the Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s portrait mode, where the background is deliberately blurred out.",
    "The main camera can take very pleasant photos, with largely natural-looking greens in nature shots and a respectable amount of detail. However, we need to calibrate your expectations. Don\u2019t expect miracles just because the megapixel count is so high.",
    "The Samsung HM2 sensor was basically designed to make the most of these 108MP expectations. It\u2019s a lower-spec sensor than the Samsung HMX, HM1 and HM3 sensors we\u2019ve seen in phones since 2019. Its sensor area is smaller, resulting in lesser light sensitivity, and we don\u2019t think Motorola has absolutely nailed its handling of the hardware either.",
    "Dynamic range is the recurring issue, and the same problem affects the Motorola Edge 20 Pro, perhaps to a lesser extent. Its HDR processing is a bit too lax, resulting in blown highlights in scenes of high light contrast. And, more often, a dull-looking foreground.",
    "The annoying part is the detail is often there. We took a bunch of the more drab-looking Motorola Edge 20 Lite shots into Photoshop, lifted up the shadows, and found plenty of clean-looking detail and color information that the phone\u2019s processing profile does not bring out.",
    "This isn\u2019t the case for all scenes, far from it. In the more even-looking exposures, lifting the shadows just results in exactly the sort of flattened appearance you\u2019d expect from \u2018too much\u2019 HDR. But it\u2019s as if the Motorola Edge 20 Lite gives up when HDR is needed most, for sunrises, sunsets, and any time you shoot directly into the sun.",
    "Detail is also not appreciably better than that of a solid 12MP or 48MP camera, and often worse because the fine detail processing sometimes has a painted-on appearance down at pixel level. This is quite common in entry-level and mid-range phones that use a lot of pixel binning, where multiple sensor pixels are combined to create a single pixel in the final image.",
    "There are other predictable image quality issues in indoors lighting and low light. Photos start to lose contrast, clarity and detail more quickly than, for example, the Google Pixel 4a. And while there is a Night Vision low-light mode that brings some of the strength back to the color and improves edge contrast noticeably, it doesn\u2019t have the miraculous kind of effect you get with killer low-light processing.",
    "Once again the Motorola Edge 20 Lite performs at a similar level to decent performers in the $200-250 bracket. But we wish its approach to HDR was more reliable and consistent. As is, the prevalence of bad or unusable photos is a little too high.",
    "The secondary camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, is not particularly impressive. There\u2019s an unmistakable drop in color saturation, and geometric distortion is quite obvious in big chunks of the outer parts of the frame. Contrast also drops and the lens\u2019s limited optics don\u2019t handle stark light contrast - like leaves against a bright sky \u2013 too well.",
    "All this stuff is pretty typical of the wide cameras of entry-level 5G phones, but plenty of those are at least a bit cheaper than the Motorola Edge 20 Lite.",
    "The ultra-wide camera does have one neat feature, though. It can focus on objects just a centimeter or two away from the lens. This is why the camera is used for the Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s macro mode.",
    "Few budget phones let you get this close to your subject, and the results are better than the dreadful 2MP macro cameras put into a lot of affordable triple and quad-lens rear camera arrays. However, we don\u2019t find macro shooting particularly fun here. The ultra-wide\u2019s autofocus is slow, so actually getting flowers, berries and bees to look sharp is a bit of a pain.",
    "Xiaomi probably does best in this area, with phones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro. It has a dedicated 5MP macro camera with a more \u2018zoomed in\u2019 view. It\u2019s fun to use and is able to capture far more ultra-close detail than the Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s technique of cropping into an 8MP ultra-wide lens.",
    "Finally, there\u2019s the Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s 2MP depth cam. The sensor and lens on this little thing are probably junk, but it\u2019s still useful. A dedicated depth camera lets you take background-blurred photos of any subject, not just people.",
    "Want to shoot videos? The Motorola Edge 20 Lite can handle 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, and up to 60fps at 1080p. This is a typical ceiling for a budget 5G phone, but its stabilization could be better. While it does crop into the view to use electronic/software stabilization, footage still ends up looking a bit juddery when you use the phone handheld.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite has a 32MP OmniVision selfie camera up front. And after all the complaints levelled at the other cameras, this one comes across pretty well.",
    "It doesn't have autofocus but the depth of field is so wide it doesn\u2019t seem a big issue. Detail in good lighting is solid, if not class-leading, and you can even get decent results in bad light as long as you use the Night Vision mode. It firms up detail well, and it isn\u2019t immediately obvious Night Vision is even an option for the front camera.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite is a textbook example of how we\u2019d like manufacturers to approach Android. It\u2019s so clean you could mistake it for an unadulterated version of the software, but it does have a few tweaks that give it a character of its own.",
    "For example, there\u2019s Motorola\u2019s long-standing Glance lock screen, which appears when you move the phone or a new notification comes in. There are optional motion gestures to fire up the torch or jump to the camera app. And if you dig a little deeper you\u2019ll find the Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s Styles area. This lets you change system fonts and icon shapes.",
    "There are no third-party app stores, no Motorola fitness apps. The one piece of app bloat is Motorola Notifications, which is basically just there to get you to sign up for Motorola push notifications.",
    "Motorola also says the Edge 20 Lite will get at least two major Android updates, so that's two years\u2019 worth, similar to an Android One phone.",
    "No complaints about the software, then, but the hardware that powers it is arguably less than ideal. The Motorola Edge 20 Lite has a MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G chipset, the same seen in the cheaper Samsung Galaxy A32 5G.",
    "It\u2019s roughly a match for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 performance-wise, with slightly better GPU performance in some situations, and that processor is used in Motorola\u2019s lower-end Moto G50. We weren\u2019t able to do some of the testing we usually put Android phones through, because Epic Games currently won\u2019t let the Motorola Edge 20 Lite play Fortnite at all.",
    "It simply refuses to load, showing a \u2018device not supported\u2019 error message. This is one of the key reasons to buy a Qualcomm Snapdragon phone instead of a MediaTek one. You\u2019re more likely to run into issues like this with MediaTek, although we expect the Motorola Edge 20 Lite should be able to handle the game okay at medium graphics.",
    "This is an area where value-led brands like Xiaomi and Realme pull ahead. The Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro is far better for gaming, and if you can afford to spend a little more the Realme GT is even better, as it has a flagship Snapdragon 888 chipset.",
    "The Motorola Edge 20 Lite is a bit closer to the Pixel 4a in performance, but it also has 5G. It\u2019s a good step below the Pixel 4a 5G, as that version of the phone has a better processor. Motorola pulls some focus away from the processor by giving us 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, both good, but it also needs a slightly better chipset to stand out.",
    "Time for some context. The main issue we\u2019ve run into here is that Fortnite is not supported (yet). Asphalt 9 runs well with some micro-stutters we often see in phones at this level, caused by the game\u2019s dense environments and exuberant use of particle and damage effects.",
    "There\u2019s no obvious lag in Android, and while ARK: Survival Evolved is less than perfectly smooth if you crank up the graphics to their maximum settings, that\u2019s pretty normal at this level.",
    "Our beef with the Motorola Edge 20 Lite isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve come across major performance issues, just that quite a few phones up to $100/\u00a350 less get you very similar results.",
    "We have not had a good time with the Motorola Edge 20 Lite\u2019s battery, and this was a surprise.",
    "Like most of the Moto G-series phones, the Motorola Edge 20 Lite has a 5,000mAh battery, which usually guarantees a solid day of reasonably heavy use. Or even up to two days for those who don\u2019t use their phone too much.",
    "Our results here have been a lot worse. Take the Sunday before we published this review as an example. By 14:30 the Motorola Edge 20 Lite had just 39% battery left. We\u2019d used it to stream a podcast during a run, to watch a YouTube video or two in bed in the morning, and for a WhatsApp video call. Other than that, we\u2019d just streamed some audio via Google Podcasts. And yet it was on the road to a flat battery by early afternoon.",
    "This is a completely different experience to that of the very long-lasting Moto G30 and G50. On other days it has fared better, making it to bedtime, but still only with single figures of battery charge left. This doesn\u2019t match up with our expectations of a 5,000mAh battery at all.",
    "So what\u2019s going on? The obvious difference is the Motorola Edge 20 Lite has a MediaTek processor, while most other Motorolas have Qualcomm chipsets. However, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G has the same chipset and entirely decent battery life, pointing the finger at Motorola\u2019s power management rather than the chipset itself.",
    "The good news is that if this is a software issue, it may improve with an update. However, we have to review phones based on what they are, not what they might be in future.",
    "Charging speed is notably better than that of some of the cheaper Motos, though. The Motorola Edge 20 Lite comes with a 30W charger. This takes you from totally flat to 23% in 15 minutes, and to 47% in 30 minutes.",
    "You\u2019ll actually see slightly better results if you don\u2019t let the phone die completely. We hooked it up to a power meter and, as usual, the charger feeds it power at a lower rate until it has enough juice to boot up fully.",
