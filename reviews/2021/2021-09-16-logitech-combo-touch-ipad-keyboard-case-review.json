  "pros": [
    "Offers good protection for iPad",
    "A good sized keyboard and trackpad",

    "They\u2019ve not quite yet replaced the MacBook, but with the inclusion of the M1 chip in this year\u2019s iPad Pro models, Apple\u2019s tablets are getting pretty close to replacing traditional laptops.",
    "A key missing part of the puzzle is a lack of built-in physical keyboard and mouse input for the touchscreen-native devices, but options like the stellar Logitech Combo Touch iPad keyboard case, reviewed here, make a much more compelling argument when it comes to considering ditching a laptop entirely.",
    "We\u2019re taking a look at the version of the Combo Touch designed for the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation), but we expect our impressions to remain relevant to the other models in the range, designed for iPad Pro 11-inch (1st, 2nd, 3rd gen) and iPad Air (4th gen).",
    "The Logitech Combo Touch is available now, with prices starting at $199.99 / \u00a3179.99, and going up to $229.99 / \u00a3199.99 for the iPad Pro 12.9-inch model.",
    "That\u2019s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination for neither a keyboard, nor a case. But when compared to the first-party Apple alternative, it\u2019s actually pocket change.",
    "Apple\u2019s own offerings start at $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 for the keyboard-only Smart Keyboard Folio and go up to $299.99 / \u00a3279.99 for the iPad Magic Keyboard, which is more closely related to Logitech\u2019s item here. They\u2019re not like-for-like \u2013 Apple\u2019s magnetic case stand is impressive, if not over engineered. But in terms of core functionality \u2013 simply letting a case act as a keyboard and trackpad too, the Logitech Combo Touch comfortably has you covered.",
    "Unlike some folio keyboard cases which come as one single piece, the Logitech Combo Touch is in fact two separate parts that make one whole case.",
    "Coming in \u201csand\u201d and \u201cOxford grey\u201d shades, one part acts as a protective shell for the back and sides of your iPad, using a stiff, rubber-like bumper to protect the edges and corners of your device. This includes an opening along the top edge to magnetically hold an official Apple Pencil in place for charging, even with the case attached.",
    "There are gaps for the USB-C port, as well as openings for speakers, mics and the rear camera module (protected by being inset in the case).",
    "The other side is your keyboard element, which magnetically snaps onto your iPad\u2019s Smart Connector, automatically pairing and drawing power from the tablet\u2019s battery, meaning the case itself never needs charging so long as your iPad is ready to go. Together, the sides of the case (which have a nice fabric-like textured feel), wrap around the entirety of your tablet, keeping it safe.",
    "Before we get onto performance itself, it\u2019s worth noting how good the stand is on the Combo Touch. It\u2019s a rigid, fold-out flap from the key-less half of the case, and can be orientated in a number of different ways \u2013 a laptop-like Typing mode, with the kickstand at an upright viewing angle; a View mode like the Typing mode but with the keyboard detached; and a Sketch mode, angling your iPad just a few degrees from flush with a surface for easy Apple Pencil sketching.",
    "Of course, you can just flatten the stand and remove the keyboard entirely for a simple reading mode.",
    "It\u2019s versatile and it never seemed in danger of falling over, even on an uneven surface like a bed. However, unless you pull off and reverse the keyboard, it wont fold around the back of the case for one-handed use. Be prepared to carry the second half around with you, detached. Note also that this case can make your iPad considerably heavier too \u2013 780g for the Pro version \u2013 though if you\u2019re using the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, like I was here, it\u2019s a heavy tablet anyway.",
    "Onto the keyboard itself, it\u2019s a real delight to use. There\u2019s 19mm of key pitch and 1mm of travel to the keys, all well spaced for quick typing. The trackpad is a good size too at 55mm x 110mm. There are 16 backlight levels to the keys, and a row along the top for 14 function shortcuts.",
    "iPadOS works really well with a trackpad these days, and the Combo Touch takes full advantage of it. Hold the CMD key for in-app shortcuts, while the clickable trackpad supports one, two and three finger swipes and gestures.",
    "Sensitivity and functions can be customized in Apple\u2019s own Trackpad settings area, while it\u2019s worth grabbing the Logitech Control app too in order to keep the keyboard up to date with any OS changes Apple makes.",
    "It\u2019s a really comfortable typing experience \u2013 this whole review was written using the Combo Touch \u2013 and while iPadOS isn\u2019t quite yet a replacement for macOS, the Logitech Combo Touch makes the iPad a genuinely useful workhorse."
