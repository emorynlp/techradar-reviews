  "summary": "An affordable fitness watch wrapped in a retro rugged design",
  "verdict": "If you\u2019re after a rugged smartwatch to accurately track and map your exercise while measuring your heart-rate, and also your sleep this is a great value option. However, its flurry of data is often meaningless and it doesn\u2019t talk to third-party apps.",
  "pros": [
    "Heart rate and SpO2 tracking",
    "Clear data readouts",
    "Week-long battery life",
    "Waterproof to 100m",
    "Color display"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "No GPS navigation",
    "No third-party app integration",
    "Lackluster design",
    "Confusing \u2018PAI\u2019 scores"

    "You\u2019ve started running and going on hikes, and you plan to go skiing and swimming. Now you want to start mapping your adventures, collecting data and measuring your heart rate, and for high-altitude hikes, even your SpO2 (oxygen saturation) levels. It may have a rather uninspiring, industrial design, but Amazfit\u2019s T-Rex Pro can do all that \u2013 and more.",
    "It\u2019s got 100 sports modes \u2013 from running and hiking to snowboarding, rock climbing and cross-country skiing \u2013 and it can auto-detect most of them. It\u2019s got GPS so can map your run (though it won\u2019t help you navigate). It\u2019s also waterproof down to 100m. Its battery life can stretch to 18 days \u2013 and that\u2019s despite it having a bright, colourful 1.3-inch AMOLED display.",
    "For its low price that\u2019s quite an achievement, but is it a rugged fitness tracker or a smartwatch? It\u2019s actually both, also able to funnel through notifications from your smartphone and control music via Bluetooth 5.0. You can even switch-up watch faces. The T-Rex Pro will also give you a finely textured read-out of your night\u2019s sleep.",
    "So why are we not totally convinced by the T-Rex Pro? Created by Chinese brand Zepp Health \u2013 formerly Huami \u2013 the T-Rex Pro collects a lot of data, but then what? Sure, it\u2019s available in the Zepp app, but aside from being able to post your latest workout to social media, there\u2019s not much you can do with that data. So if you\u2019re currently using smartphone apps like Strava or MyFitnessPal to track your activity and/or your diet, you\u2019ll have to live with two silos of data that don\u2019t integrate. And that just seems like a barrier to wanting extra activity data in the first place.",
    "You'll be hard-pressed to find a better value rugged sports watch that covers the basics for running, cycling, hiking and more. But despite its many good points we\u2019re not totally convinced the T-Rex Pro is generous enough with its data to be considered best-in-class.",
    "The T-Rex Pro was released in March 2021 for $179.99 / \u00a3139 / AU$249. In the US it\u2019s available directly from Amazfit while in the UK it can be purchased either from Argos or Amazon. It\u2019s initially available in three colours: Meteorite Black, Desert Green and Steel Blue.",
    "You get a lot of features for your money with the T-Rex Pro, but a \u2018wow factor\u2019 isn\u2019t one of them. The T-Rex Pro looks almost exactly like the original Amazfit T-Rex. This new version also has four screws in the bezel for a practical, industrial and slightly plasticky look.",
    "There are also four metal buttons (mode, back, up and down) on the edge of the casing that are big enough to easily press while running or when wearing gloves. Too easily, in fact, making accidental presses inevitable.",
    "A 47.7mm radius watch that\u2019s 13.5mm thick, the T-Rex Pro is a chunky polycarbonate product that has a relatively masculine look, but its paltry 59.4g means it never feels heavy when being worn. Zepp says that the T-Rex Pro is shock-resistant, can withstand -40\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C, copes with salt spray and meets the MIL-STD-810G standard, though by far its most important rugged feature is that it\u2019s waterproof down to 100m. That\u2019s double what the original version was capable of.",
    "The T-Rex Pro is built around a 1.3-inch AMOLED touchscreen display that has a 360 x 360 pixel resolution (again, just like its forbear). It\u2019s easily visible in bright sunlight, though only if you set it to its top brightness level. Of course, that affects its battery life, which Zepp rates at 18 days. In practice, its 390mAh battery goes for about a week, which is still impressive.",
    "It ships with a silicone rubber 22mm-wide wrist strap that\u2019s comfortable and stays in place when running. The only other accessory in the box is a proprietary charger that magnetically attaches to the case back. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the flashing LEDs of Zepp\u2019s new-for-2021 Bio-Tracking 2 PPG optical sensor, which measures heart rate and SpO2 (oxygen saturation). Inside is also an accelerometer, a gyroscope, altimeter, geomagnetic sensor and an ambient light sensor.",
    "In short, it\u2019s a data-gathering monster.",
    "Although the T-Rex Pro is ostensibly a fitness-orientated watch it also has a few smartwatch-like features. It\u2019s nowhere near being the \u2018ultimate personal assistant\u2019, as claimed by the maker, but it can be set to haptically buzz for incoming text messages, calls and reminders. It can also exert basic control of the music on your phone.",
    "Hook it up to a smartphone via Bluetooth \u2013 a simple task \u2013 and you\u2019ll also get a weather forecast, sunrise and sunset times, and the current moon phase.",
    "The tempered glass touchscreen is plenty responsive enough, which makes the T-Rex Pro a pleasure to use while on the move. Small swipes up and down swap between the watch face and the shortcut control panel, where you do everything from turn on the flashlight (which is not bright enough for any practical purpose!) and engage power-saving/do-not-disturb modes, to choosing a screensaver and setting the screen\u2019s brightness. It\u2019s also possible to set the display to be \u2018always-on\u2019 during set times.",
    "Although Zepp state that the T-Rex Pro has an \u2018up to\u2019 18-day battery, it became clear that this applies only if you don\u2019t really do any exercise. However, if you take an hour\u2019s exercise each day and purposefully track it then you can expect the T-Rex Pro to run for about a week. Slightly less if you customize the T-Rex Pro to say, emit a haptic buzz every time you run a mile, or you set the display to be at maximum brightness and \u2018always-on\u2019 (though it does need to be on maximum brightness to be read easily during strong sunlight).",
    "Although a more capable version of the original T-Rex which we reviewed last year, like its forbear the T-Rex Pro is a good performing and great value smartwatch option that isn\u2019t without its limitations.",
    "The T-Rex Pro arguably includes more features than it should at its low price. For day-to-day use, its GPS and heart rate monitoring are probably the most important, and both worked well during our fortnight-long test. It picks up your heart rate every 10 minutes while at rest, and constantly during an activity. GPS tracking \u2013 which uses GPS, GLONASS, Galileo or BeiDou satellite positioning \u2013 was immaculate during our tests.",
    "So during and after a run, you\u2019ll get at-a-glance data on the time elapsed, calories burned, your average heart rate, and even finer detail like cadence, average stride, speed, elevation changes, and heart rate zones. As soon as you finish a run the T-Rex Pro will give you a recommended recovery time.",
    "It also gives you a readout for VO2 max. Huh? That\u2019s the maximum amount of oxygen in millilitres one can use in one minute per kilogram of body weight. So what? Ditto its data on Aerobic Training Effect, Anaerobic Training Effect and Training Load, which will also mean nothing to the most people.",
    "We also consider SpO2 (oxygen saturation) readings more of a novelty and not really relevant unless you\u2019re hiking at altitude and wary of altitude sickness. There\u2019s too much data here and not enough interpretation and goal-setting/virtual coaching.",
    "There are two ways to track your activity; let the T-Rex Pro auto-detect it, or physically hit the mode button and scroll down until you get to your intended activity \u2013 such as outdoor running, walking, treadmill, trail running, indoor walking (to mention just five of 24 activities in the list \u2013 though you can manually add more).",
    "In our tests, when left to make its own mind up the T-Rex Pro maxed out at deciphering between outdoor running and walking, but proved less adept with the other activities. So it\u2019s best to tell it exactly what you\u2019re about to do.",
    "One frustrating issue we had was how impractical the button layout is for hiking. The \u2018select\u2019 button on the watch\u2019s right-hand side is too easy to press accidentally while wearing a sleeve over the T-Rex Pro, which pauses your workout. You\u2019re unlikely to be wearing the T-Rex Pro under a sleeve while running, sports it\u2019s not a huge problem day-to-day, but while hiking in a jacket it\u2019s almost inevitable. The result is incomplete data \u2013 and there\u2019s no easy fix.",
    "The T-Rex Pro is also not the perfect bedfellow. It does have a vibrating watch alarm, but instead of a gentle haptic buzz or two, you get heavy-duty bursts that don\u2019t let up for 20 seconds. So everyone else in your bed is also going to get woken.",
    "The T-Rex Pro links to the brand\u2019s free Zepp app, which it syncs to soon after you complete an activity and bring it close to your smartphone. It\u2019s a cinch to see your current heart rate, step count, SpO2 levels and previous workout records, which are clearly and colourfully presented.",
    "However, we were also disappointed by the \u2018my goals\u2019 section of the app, which is merely a target steps per day, target weight, target calories burned, and a target sleep. That\u2019s all a bit basic given how esoteric is the data it seems obsessed with collecting.",
    "Like most such devices and apps there\u2019s an attempt at simplicity and \u2018gamification\u2019 in which you\u2019re awarded Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) points. It\u2019s a commendable effort to give users a single numerical value to represent that day\u2019s physical efforts, but in practice a \u2018congratulations you just reached 30 PAI!\u2019 has no practical meaning. It\u2019s yet another notification to ignore.",
    "While it collects a lot of data, the T-Rex Pro doesn\u2019t do much with it. It\u2019s not going to coach you to make you run faster. Its \u2018workout assistant\u2019 section does include a \u2018virtual rabbit\u2019 mode so you can race against your time at a previous workout, but it doesn\u2019t alert you if you\u2019re behind the pace.",
    "More seriously, the T-Rex Pro doesn\u2019t link up to third-party apps, so if you\u2019re already in a groove with a fitness tracking app like Strava, MyFitnessPal or RunKeeper and merely wanted to use it to improve on the data your collecting then you\u2019re out of luck.",
