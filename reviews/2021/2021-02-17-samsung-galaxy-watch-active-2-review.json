  "verdict": "The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a minor upgrade on its predecessor, adding a digital rotating dial, bigger version, currently inactive ECG, and LTE option. But it's also considerably more costly, putting a hefty price on only a few extra features.",
  "pros": [
    "Digital haptic dial control is great",
    "Still decent 2-day battery life",
    "Attractive minimalist design"

    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is barely an upgrade on its predecessor, which came out earlier in 2020 but lacked the rotating bezel that made its beefier sibling, the Samsung Galaxy Watch, such a hit. But the refined version of Samsung\u2019s sporty smartwatch comes with a digital bezel and a few other tricks to become the best wearable in the company\u2019s lineup.",
    "The similarities to its predecessor are probably for the best \u2013 the Active 2 retains its predecessor\u2019s slimmer, minimal, modern look. It\u2019s almost certainly a more broadly-appealing setup than the Galaxy Watch\u2019s girthy form, akin to the more 'masculine' style of traditional watches.",
    "It\u2019s manageable and rigorous enough to take on runs, yet packing enough features and capabilities to rival the Apple Watch 6. But the Active 2\u2019s extra features come at a literal cost \u2013 it\u2019s nominally pricier than its predecessor, shrinking the watch\u2019s affordability edge over Apple\u2019s watches.",
    "Still, the Active 2 is a solid choice for consumers on the hunt for a smartwatch to take on runs and into the office, especially for Android users outside the iOS ecosystem. Yes, it can be used with an iPhone, but with limited functionality - and for the same price you could pick up the new Apple Watch SE or an older Apple Watch.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 will likely be reduced in the Black Friday deals, so it\u2019s worth looking at the best smartwatch Black Friday deals out there. We\u2019ll be conducting a re-review in the future. However, we\u2019ve updated references within our review to highlight new features that have emerged since our tests to give you a better idea of what you might be buying.",
    "When the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 launched, it started at $279.99 / \u00a3269 for the 40mm version or $299 / \u00a3289 / AU$549 for the 44mm version. The 40mm model isn't available in Australia.",
    "The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is also available in an LTE model in stainless steel, which in the US is offered through Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Verizon. In the UK and Australia you can buy this version outright, at \u00a3399 / AU$749 for the 40mm version and \u00a3419 / AU$799 for the 44mm one.",
    "That launch price puts it between the Apple Watch 5 and the now-discounted Apple Watch 3 - which, while not reaching the high cost of the latest Apple smartwatch, still offers firm competition.",
    "Since then, it's been trickier to find stock of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 thanks to the focus being on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 range. On the plus side, it's often more heavily discounted when you do find it.",
    "The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is a dead ringer for its predecessor - the 40mm version, anyway, since the new smartwatch is also available in 44mm, which is more manageable than the Galaxy Watch\u2019s hefty 46mm bigger model.",
    "As it stands, both options are pretty light, starting at 26g for the smaller aluminum (without a strap) and 30g for the larger - present but not weighty when worn during a run.",
    "Like the original Active, the basic Watch Active 2 has an aluminum body. It comes in cloud silver, aqua black and pink gold colors. You can also get it in stainless steel (which is what the LTE model comes in) for a higher price, which comes in silver, black and gold.",
    "The cheaper model comes with a rubberized Fluoroelastomer band, which you\u2019ll recognize if you\u2019ve ever worn an Apple Watch - material that felt natural through casual and sweaty activity, and would be fine worn sunup to sundown (and beyond).",
    "If you want a classier look and feel, you can opt for the heavier (by about 11g) stainless steel body with a leather strap - but you can also swap out any Samsung-sold or aftermarket 20mm band if you so desire.",
    "In either case, the watch\u2019s back has a heart rate monitor with eight photodiodes - double the amount of its predecessor. In our tests it gave reasonably accurate readings.",
    "The two side buttons are also the same as before - a \u2018back\u2019 button on top, which is now outlined in some case colors, and a \u2018home\u2019 button below, which brings up your apps. While double-tapping the latter brings up Samsung\u2019s smart assistant Bixby by default, you can (and should) set it to something more useful, such as a shortcut to a frequent favorite.",
    "The Active 2\u2019s 360 x 360 resolution Super AMOLED screen is slightly (as in, 0.1 inches) expanded to 1.2-inches over its predecessor for the smaller 40mm model - meaning less bezel this time around - while the larger 44mm option has a 1.4-inch screen of the same resolution.",
    "That\u2019s about standard for smartwatches, and it\u2019s enough screen real estate to filter through essential information, though sorting through any text meatier than a notification (like, say, an email) is a chore.",
    "Most of Samsung\u2019s first-party apps are optimized for this tiny display, but some third-party options are as audacious as they are spectacularly unsuccessful. By which we mean: we downloaded a YouTube-watching app on a lark, and it went about as expected.",
    "Thankfully, the new digital dial makes navigating around menus a lot more precise. Yes, it\u2019s not as exact or as satisfying as the tactile bezel wheel on the original Galaxy Watch, but it\u2019s the next best thing, with a vibrating tic every time you switch to the next app or setting.",
    "It\u2019s a lot less loose than swiping on the screen, which you can still do if you prefer. In fact, swiping is the only control method when you boot up the watch, as Samsung bafflingly didn\u2019t turn on the digital dial by default.",
    "The dial is worth trying out for ease of use - plus, it keeps your finger on the outer edge of the screen, and out of the way. It\u2019s obviously something that crowns also do (like on the sides of Apple Watches), but it\u2019s nice to see a touch-based alternative method of navigation done well.",
    "The Active 2 has an Exynos 9110 dual-core chipset, the same as its predecessor - and the original Galaxy Watch, for that matter - but at 1.15Ghz, it\u2019s fast enough. The smartwatch\u2019s 768MB of RAM is fine for switching in and out of apps, though that\u2019s upgraded to 1.5GB for the LTE model.",
    "That\u2019s enough power to zoom around the interface, though we still wish Samsung had been able to fit more than 4GB of storage in there - especially since, once the operating system and baseline apps have been loaded up, you\u2019re left with 1.5GB to fiddle with. Enough for plenty of songs and apps (most of which take up barely a megabyte apiece), but not leaving much room for bigger, bolder software.",
    "Like its predecessor, the Active 2 runs on Samsung\u2019s One UI overlay over Samsung\u2019s trusty Tizen operating system, and not much has changed since the original Active. The rotating dial makes it noticeably easier to sift through apps on your home page or notifications on the main \u2018watch face\u2019 screen, though it will take a little getting used to for precision navigation (i.e. not zooming past the right stop).",
    "There are other new integrations Samsung is championing - like taking a photo on a phone with the Samsung Wearables app and creating an algorithmically-chosen color-and-pattern watch face design. Ostensibly, this is to sync your Active 2 with whatever you\u2019re wearing, but you could also snap photos of a particular hue or natural color, if you fancy.",
    "Unfortunately, Tizen hasn\u2019t gotten much in the way of third-party app support in the interim since the original Active. Aside from flashlights, calorie counters and run-mapping, you\u2019re likely relying on first-party apps to carry most of your interactivity. Tizen is still behind Apple watchOS and even Wear OS in this regard.",
    "The included apps are still useful, though iOS users still won\u2019t be able to access all the best benefits, like replying to messages or interacting with email beyond notifications. Some things have improved - Find My Phone now buzzes your iPhone even if Do Not Disturb is on - but you simply won\u2019t get the full functionality of the watch without an Android phone.",
    "The Watch Active 2\u2019s fitness apps and features haven\u2019t changed much: there\u2019s still 39 workout-tracking modes, like running, walking, cycling and swimming.",
    "The exercise modes generally work fine for the cardio-related routines, but struggle with those defined by motion.",
    "The \u2018Crunches\u2019 mode, for example, only counted reps when the hand (and thus the Active 2) was extended far over the knees...meaning anyone performing a crunch with arms crossed over their chest is out of luck. It\u2019s an odd specificity that extends to other workouts, like Arm Extensions and Jumping Jacks, which were similarly finicky.",
    "But we didn\u2019t have any problems when taking the Active 2 for a jog, where it tracked our runs and gently vibrated when it sensed we\u2019d stopped moving and might be done with the workout (or was just telling us to wrap up our break). The smartwatch also connected effortlessly with Bluetooth headphones, which made it easier to hear the Active 2's occasional vocal updates on our workout progress.",
    "Listening to music was more of a chore, especially when connected to an iPhone, for which adding music is a multi-step process. Syncing up a Spotify account is easy enough, though the frequent alerts and notifications momentarily muted audio, with multiple disruptions per song. It\u2019s odd, especially when a non-interruption feature seems like such a logical addition for a workout mode.",
    "The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, and can survive being submerged up to 5 meters in liquid and getting a little grimy. There\u2019s even a \u2018water lock\u2019 mode that disables touchscreen functionality and vibrates to shake out excess water.",
    "The watch also has an ECG (electrocardiogram), which can be used to detect the electrical activity and rhythm of your heart. It's a feature we've already seen on the Apple Watch 4 and upwards, and can be used to detect the likes of atrial fibrillation.",
    "However, while the hardware is present here, the feature isn't available at launch, as Samsung needs approval for its use in each country. As such we haven't been able to test this.",
    "If anything lives up to Samsung\u2019s claims about the Galaxy Watch Active 2, it\u2019s battery life. With typical use, our Active 2 lasted through two full days. While that\u2019s not quite the four days that our original Galaxy Watch survived for, it\u2019s more than can be said of the Apple Watch line.",
    "That battery life diminishes with lots of activity: playing music or running the GPS (through those workouts, say) can drain capacity at a more rapid pace. It all depends how much you use it, and there\u2019s a battery-saving setting (switching on grayscale, switching off Wi-Fi) to eke out more life between charges.",
    "The actual capacity of the 40mm model is 247mAh, slightly larger than the 230mAh of its predecessor. The 44mm\u2019s 340mAh capacity might give it the edge over its smaller sibling (the only one we tested), though that\u2019s also powering a larger screen.",
    "Android phone owners looking to pick up a quality smartwatch from a known brand should consider the Active 2 - especially if they\u2019re, well, active. This is especially true for lovers of the original Galaxy Watch who were wary of a dial-less watch. And since we might never get a Samsung Galaxy Watch 2, this might be the closest we\u2019ll get.",
    "Anyone locked into Apple\u2019s iOS ecosystem won\u2019t get the most out of this smartwatch, and with a still-competitive Apple Watch 3 on the market, it\u2019s tough to recommend what\u2019s undeniably an inferior wearable OS. Likewise, any serious fans of Wear OS might be unimpressed by the smaller app library.",
    "As we\u2019ve said repeatedly, the Apple Watch 3 is identically priced, proven, and likely discounted even more during deals seasons. watchOS is more robust and beloved for good reason. While you\u2019ll miss out on the Active 2\u2019s haptic dial and demonstrably better battery, the tighter integration with iOS is more compelling.",

    "We\u2019ve made the case throughout this review, but the original Watch Active has most of the bells and loses out on few of the new whistles in its successor. You\u2019ll still get a quality smartwatch to take on runs and into the office - but at a lower price (which is primed to drop more during deals seasons).",
