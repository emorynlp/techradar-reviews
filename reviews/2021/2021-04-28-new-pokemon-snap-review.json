  "verdict": "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap feels antiquated by today\u2019s standards. Your enjoyment of the game will ultimately come down to whether you enjoy taking hundreds of pictures of virtual creatures, as you slowly chug along predetermined paths multiple times in the hopes of spotting something new. It\u2019ll probably pass muster with Pok\u00e9mon-loving kids, who will delight in seeing Pikachu scamper across the screen for perhaps the very first time. But for anyone aged 10 or above, this eclectic safari park isn\u2019t worth the price of admission.",

    "New Pok\u00e9mon Snap is yet another example of Nintendo reviving a beloved title for a new audience, and one that will undoubtedly attract the attention of those who played the original game back in 1999. Resurrecting past titles is something that Nintendo does incredibly well, mostly owing to the fact it has a rich library of classic games that appeal to young and older audiences alike. Everyone has their favorites and a personal list of older Nintendo games they\u2019d love to see remade (give us a new F-Zero, please!).",
    "The problem is, though, not every title stands the test of time. Once the warm and fuzzy feelings of nostalgia fade away, New Pok\u00e9mon Snap feels rudimentary by today\u2019s standard, and we found it extremely monotonous to play. There\u2019s simply not enough variation on offer, and only fleeting moments of enjoyment to be found that make it hard to justify the price tag.",
    "Of course, there\u2019s no denying that New Pok\u00e9mon Snap may rekindle fond memories for those who played the original Pok\u00e9mon Snap game on the N64. But it\u2019s hard to fathom how anyone but a child could seriously enjoy this shallow safari park-style experience for more than a couple of hours.",
    "You begin New Pok\u00e9mon Snap by choosing from a selection of premade characters \u2013 there aren\u2019t any customization options available \u2013 who acts as your silent avatar for the game. The player is introduced to two main characters shortly after, Rita and Professor Mirror, who have enlisted your help in photographing Pok\u00e9mon across the Lental region, which is made up of various unknown islands.",
    "Your main goal, apart from filling up your Photodex with countless pics of generations worth of cutesy Pok\u00e9mon, is to hop across the various islands in a bid to learn more about the Illumina phenomenon, which can make Pok\u00e9mon give off an otherworldly glow. Essentially, you\u2019re on a research mission, and your camera is the key to making discoveries.",
    "A quick tutorial walks you through the game\u2019s controls, which are super easy to pick up. You control the camera by using the analog sticks or, if you\u2019d like a more realistic experience, by using the Nintendo Switch\u2019s built-in gyro controls. You can zoom in using the ZL button, and snap pictures by pressing A. It\u2019s intuitive, and we really appreciate being able to fine-tune our shots using the Nintendo Switch\u2019s gyro controls.",
    "The tutorial also explains how to take a perfect picture, and that\u2019s where the game\u2019s main challenge lies. It\u2019s not enough to fire through a reel of film without any care or attention. You\u2019ll need to take into account a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s pose, direction, what\u2019s happening in the background, and the size of your subject when they\u2019re lined up in your lens. Everyone knows how to take a good photo, and the same basic rules apply in New Pok\u00e9mon Snap.",
    "Thankfully, however, there\u2019s more to the game than simply pointing your camera at Pok\u00e9mon and shouting \u201ccheese!\u201d. As you progress through the game, which is done by raising your research level from the scores you receive from Professor Mirror, you\u2019ll be given upgrades to your research camera and the ability to throw Fluffruit towards any nearby Pok\u00e9mon. This is the crux of how you\u2019ll discover more types of Pok\u00e9mon that may be hidden away, and also how to prompt unique reactions. It\u2019s these snaps which will score you the highest points.",
    "Speaking of points, each photo you take is given a rating between one to four stars, and Professor Mirror will rate them accordingly after each outing. You can select the photos yourself, which are handily organized into folders of each Pok\u00e9mon you snapped, or have the game automatically select the best ones for you. This auto-select feature is a life saver, as the idea of sifting through countless photos of a Magikarp is not our idea of a good time, and the game will sometimes surprise you by what it considers to be a \u201cgood\u201d photo.",
    "If you want to hit the four star ratings, you\u2019ll need to try to capture Pok\u00e9mon in the middle of a candid moment, which again, can be done by using the right tool for the job. Some Pok\u00e9mon may require a Fluffruit to coax them out of hiding, or a melody played to wake them from their slumber. You\u2019ll also unlock a scan function early on that can sometimes reveal new routes, and there are mini-missions to complete that earn your titles (in-game achievements basically) and more items for the editing suite. It\u2019s a nice puzzle-solving element that makes each journey to your destination slightly more interesting.",
    "As the game progresses, you\u2019ll be tasked with regularly revisiting routes on the various islands you need to frequent as you slowly raise your research level. The Pok\u00e9mon you discover and the actions you see will change in subtle ways the higher your research level becomes, but honestly, the thrill of seeing Pok\u00e9mon roaming around the lush and sometimes beautiful scenery wears off extremely fast.",
    "Yes, we smiled when an Emolga flew directly towards us after perching in a nearby tree the first time, and there are different locations like a desert, beach or jungle that are inhabited by new Pok\u00e9mon types to snap away to your heart\u2019s content. But it\u2019s often the same exact route you\u2019ll have to sit through, the same Pokemon you need to photograph, all with the prospect of getting a slightly better rating. That cute and cuddly Emolga soon lost its charm the fourth time it flew over our heads, and New Pok\u00e9mon Snap doesn\u2019t feel organic enough to make retreading the same steps worth it. It can often feel like groundhog day.",
    "But what awaits players when they\u2019re not snapping pictures of Pok\u00e9mon? Photo editing and community sharing, basically. You can connect to the internet and share your favorite photos with other New Pok\u00e9mon Snap players, who can award the pics they like best with a Sweet! medal. You can also edit your photos in a pleasing number of ways using the Re-Snap feature and Photo Editing options, which let you add filters, change the exposure or place fun stickers on your pictures. You need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to access the online functionality, sadly, but you can still share your Pok\u00e9mon pics the standard way: take a screenshot on the Switch and share it to social media.",
    "You can also sift through your burgeoning album of Pok\u00e9mon photos in your Photodex, if you like, which shows 3D models of your various subjects, along with information on their vital statistics like height, weight and type. But there\u2019s not much else to do outside of the main game, sadly.",
    "A real life safari park is fun the first time around, but imagine if someone asked you to do it five times in a row, with the slight chance that you\u2019ll discover something new? Sounds pretty laborious, right? Well, that\u2019s what New Pok\u00e9mon Snap feels like. It\u2019s a real grind to play, and the rewards simply aren\u2019t great enough to justify the investment of time it requires. If you love Pok\u00e9mon and have always dreamed of capturing them all through the lens of a camera, it at least lives up to that promise. Just keep your expectations in check as to how fun photographing Pok\u00e9mon over and over again really is."
