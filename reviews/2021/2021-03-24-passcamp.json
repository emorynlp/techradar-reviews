    "If you\u2019re not already using a password manager, you probably should be. Not only will it increase your levels of password security, but it will also make it easier to share passwords amongst teams.",
    "PassCamp is a relative newcomer to the market, but since day one its mission has been to top the list of the best password managers based in the cloud.",
    "To find out whether it has succeeded in its goal, in this PassCamp password manager review, we take a close look at its plans and pricing, features, performance, security, and support.",
    "PassCamp comes with three plans: two personal and one business. All plans feature secure sharing, a browser extension, autofill and autosave, and a mobile app.",
    "For personal users, there is the free Basic plan, but you can only store 25 passwords. With the Personal Premium plan, for \u20ac2,50/month (approx. $2.97), you can save an unlimited number of passwords and assign tags to them.",
    "Meanwhile, pricing for the Teams plan is \u20ac3,50/month (approx. $4.16). It has the same features as the Personal Premium plan with the addition of team management functionality and unlimited guests.",
    "PassCamp is a web app, which means that all your passwords are stored securely in the cloud. It features login autofill so that your usernames and passwords are automatically entered into the login fields when you visit websites for which you\u2019ve created credentials.",
    "For teams, you can share passwords with anyone else who also has a PassCamp account. In addition, you can get notifications of password updates, contact invites, and items that have been shared or unshared. There is a history log too, with which you can keep track of all the changes made to any password or note either by you or contacts with sharing access.",
    "Different roles and permissions can also be assigned to team members. What\u2019s more, you can add people outside your organization as guests, giving them the ability to access passwords without editing or management abilities.",
    "Setting up PassCamp is very simple and only requires a few steps. First, enter your email address. You\u2019ll then be sent an email with a link to verify the address.",
    "Once you\u2019ve completed the verification step, you have to set up a master password for your PassCamp account. You won\u2019t be able to store this password in PassCamp, so it will need to be a strong password, something secure, but also something you can remember. This is how most password managers work.",
    "Once you\u2019ve created the master password, you\u2019ll be logged into your account. While it\u2019s not mandatory to use the service, you should install a browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) to get the best out of the app. The link to get the extension is available from the dropdown menu under your username after you\u2019ve logged into the dashboard.",
    "When you log into PassCamp you\u2019re presented with a list of all your items, either passwords or notes. Passwords will be added to the list as you start to use PassCamp and sign up for new websites. Or, you can click on the + button in the bottom right corner of the window to add passwords or notes manually.",
    "You can also add new contacts by clicking on the + next to the Contacts heading in the left column and then entering the person\u2019s email address.",
    "You can review activity on your account by clicking on the bell icon in the top right corner of the window, which will show you a list of all the notifications received.",
    "When you sign up for a new website, the PassCamp browser extension will offer to save the details in your account. If you need help creating a strong password, you can also use the extension's built-in password generator which will generate a password for you.",
    "PassCamp has a wide range of security features to ensure your data is kept safe. For starters, your data is encrypted with AES-256 symmetric and RSA-4096 asymmetric encryption, as well as hashing and two-factor authentication.",
    "PassCamp also implements the zero-knowledge protocol, which means only you can access your password information. Even though your data is stored online using cloud storage, with zero-knowledge password proof, not even the PassCamp service providers can access your information.",
    "Centralized blockchain technology is also used to track the history of all passwords and notes so you can always view a log of every change made to the item, whether by you or someone with whom you shared it.",
    "PassCamp offers support in the form of a dedicated email address, a chat widget on the website, and a Help Center with links to frequently asked questions and a YouTube video channel.",
    "The chat widget doesn\u2019t indicate whether it\u2019s 24/7, but as it said \u201cLast active recently\u201d when we tested it and we didn\u2019t get a reply for two hours, it seems like it\u2019s probably not. There\u2019s no telephone number or indication of operating hours.",
    "PassCamp is made by a web development firm with offices in the US, Lithuania, and Sweden, so it\u2019s likely that hours of operation will align with those offices.",
    "PassCamp is a relative newcomer to the password management market and there are many alternatives from which to choose.",
    "Zoho Vault, for example, has plans for teams starting at $1/month per user and includes similar features to PassCamp. However, it also comes with integrations with third-party apps like Gmail, Dropbox, and Office 365.",
    "Bitwarden has free and paid plans for both personal and business users, with the Team plan costing $5/month for five users. Premium plans include reports highlighting weak passwords and unsecured websites, and whether an email address has been compromised in a known data breach.",
    "PassCamp is easy to set up and use and boasts impressive security features. Being completely browser-based means it\u2019s a cross-platform solution. And its sharing features, history log, and the ability to have unlimited guests will be great for teams. But in general, PassCamp doesn\u2019t have as many features as other password managers."
