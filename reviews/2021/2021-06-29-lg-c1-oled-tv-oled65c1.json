  "summary": "The C1 OLED is one of the best TVs we\u2019ve seen in 2021",
  "verdict": "As a follow-up to one of the best TVs from last year, the LG C1 OLED remains one of the best TVs at any price. It\u2019s missing the new OLED evo panels going into the G1 OLED, but even in their absence the C1 produces colorful, bright and rich pictures with support for most types of HDR. There might be one or two areas for improvement, but otherwise the LG C1 OLED is the gold standard for 2021 OLED TVs.",
  "pros": [
    "Beautiful 4K/HDR picture",
    "Four HDMI 2.1 ports",
    "WebOS is fantastic"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Reflective glass surface",
    "Reddish hues in faces",
    "No HDR10+"

    "The LG C1 OLED is the follow up to TechRadar\u2019s best TV of 2020, the LG CX OLED. You can understand, then, why our expectations for the C1 OLED were immense \u2013 and yet, it has managed to deliver on all of them, pushing the LG CX further down the ever changing list.",
    "That\u2019s because LG has made a number of small tweaks to last year\u2019s model. It\u2019s now using LG\u2019s Alpha a9 Gen. 4 processor for better upscaling and virtual surround sound audio, and with four separate HDMI 2.1 ports, it\u2019s ready for the PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and whatever next-gen consoles can throw at it. Gamers will also appreciate the new Game Optimiser menu that gives you the option to quickly adjust brightness, contrast and VRR on the fly.",
    "As with the previous model, you\u2019ll find support for both Google Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, who can be summoned using buttons on your remote, and a near-complete repository of streaming services that includes Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and many more.",
    "The LG C1 isn\u2019t flawless, as we did encounter issues around how the new Alpha a9 Gen. 4 upscales faces, and how reflective the all-glass screen is in the daylight, but the issues are few and far between.",
    "There are, of course, higher resolution TVs out there right now like the LG Z1 OLED, which offers 8K resolution, and the LG G1 Gallery Series that uses the coveted OLED evo panels that offer better brightness. However, we feel that the LG C1 OLED offers the best blend of price and performance and should be high up on your list for potential TVs to buy in 2021 and beyond.",
    "UPDATE: Some of LG's gaming TVs have had an upgrade, including the LG C1 OLED TV that we're reviewing here.",
    "Both the LG C1 and LG G1 OLED TVs now support Dolby Vision HDR at 4K/120Hz, after the latest firmware update for these 2021 OLED screens, and it spells good news for gamers.",
    "Firmware version 03.15.27 is now \"rolling out,\" we're told, making the two flagship 2021 LG OLEDs the first TVs in the world to support Dolby Vision HDR at such a high specification.",
    "The LG C1 OLED is part of the LG 2021 TV lineup that includes the new LG A1 OLED, LG G1 OLED and LG Z1 OLED, as well as the new QNED TVs like the QNED99, QNED95, QNED90 and QNED85. The LG C1 is the cheapest OLED in the lineup that uses the new Alpha a9 Gen. 4 processor (the A1 OLED will be cheaper but uses the a7 processor), however it\u2019s still not exactly what we\u2019d consider cheap:",
    "US pricing and release date",
    "UK pricing and release date",
    "Australia pricing and release date",
    "If you compare those prices to last year, the LG C1 OLED costs the exact same as the LG CX OLED cost when it first came out last year, though you can now find the latter at a discount now that the LG C1 is readily available. Because there\u2019s not a significant difference between the two other than the processor, it\u2019s probably worth picking up last year\u2019s model at a steep discount if you can find one.",
    "It makes sense that last year\u2019s TV is now cheaper, but how does the C1 OLED\u2019s price compare to other OLED TVs? Compared to the new Sony A80J OLED that costs $2,799 for the 65-inch version, the C1 OLED is a bit cheaper for US buyers, but UK buyers will be paying \u00a34,199 for the 65-inch Sony A80J so the \u00a32,499 C1 OLED is a steal in comparison.",
    "There are cheaper alternatives, however, like the Vizio OLED TV that starts at just $1,199 for a 55-inch model or the Panasonic HZ980 that costs just \u00a31,098 from Currys. There are some drawbacks to both those TVs (starting with the lack of HDMI 2.1 ports) but they are cheaper and provide similarly deep black levels.",
    "It can feel silly to talk about how a TV looks on the outside \u2013 it\u2019s the picture that matters most, after all \u2013 but you can\u2019t ignore how nice the LG C1 OLED is design-wise. The front of the TV is pure minimalism \u2013 there\u2019s a long silver stand that holds the TV upright and only a millimeter or two between the picture and the edge of the display.",
    "If you were to mount it, pretty much all you\u2019d see is the screen, but putting it on its (quite hefty) stand still looks great. That extra heft prevents the TV from wobbling and gives the C1 a low center of gravity.",
    "Spin the TV around to the side and you\u2019ll see the razor-thin OLED screen; it\u2019s thinner than your smartphone and it looks a lot nicer, too. Toward the bottom of the TV, near where the stand screws in, the TV\u2019s a bit thicker to house the components and the speakers, but even that section isn\u2019t larger than most full array LED-LCD TVs.",
    "In fact, the only real problem with the C1\u2019s design is that the front all-glass screen is fairly reflective. Put it in a moderately lit room with streams of light coming in and it\u2019s easy to catch a glare. Sure, that glare subsides some when you\u2019ve got bright and colorful content playing on the screen, but any night or space scene will have a glare if you can\u2019t close the blinds.",
    "Outside of that one sore spot, however, the rest of the design gets full marks. In terms of ports, the C1 has four full-spec HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 144Hz, plus you\u2019ve got three USBs, RF tuner, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and optical digital audio output. Last but not least, one of the HDMI ports supports eARC/ARC, which is great for folks with an AVR or soundbar who don\u2019t like to have more than one remote in use.",
    "Speaking of remotes, the LG C1 OLED comes with the wonderful LG Magic Remote that\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled and has a built-in microphone for voice searches. The remote feels great in the hand and runs off two AA batteries. What we love most is that the UI can either be controlled using Wii-style motion controls or the directional pad, or you can use the four quick launch buttons down at the bottom to the most popular apps.",
    "If you\u2019ve used an LG TV in pretty much the past decade, you\u2019ll know what to expect with the C1 OLED \u2013 yep, it\u2019s WebOS. What makes WebOS an old staple of LG TVs is its flexibility to add new channels as soon as they arise, and support of multiple partners. Put simply, because it doesn\u2019t have any allegiances to Google, Amazon or Apple, WebOS supports all of the above simultaneously with a zippy UI and robust customization system.",
    "The only major change this year is that there\u2019s more of a focus on the actual ThinQ AI home screen that you\u2019ll see every time you press the home button. Here, you\u2019ll find your most frequently used apps as well as any devices you\u2019ve connected to ThinQ AI.",
    "Speaking of apps, nearly every major app is presented and accounted for, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Vudu, Sling TV, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and Apple TV. For music streaming your options are slightly more limited, but you can still pick from Spotify, Plex, Pandora, Amazon Music and more. Apple Music is now available through the TV too.",
    "While WebOS hasn\u2019t added many new features this year outside of the new homescreen with more rows, there are still some nice additions from last year worth calling attention to. Chief among them is Sports integration where, if you tell the C1 what your favorite sports teams are, WebOS will give you score updates and remind you when your teams are playing.",
    "More useful, however, is the support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant built right into the TV that can be accessed by pressing the corresponding buttons on the remote, as well as support for AirPlay and Casting from your phone or tablet. We had a bit of problems getting AirPlay to work properly during our testing \u2013 but Casting worked perfectly.",
    "LG\u2019s 2021 OLED TV lineup is divided into two categories this year: OLED TVs with LG\u2019s new OLED evo panels and those without it. For those wondering, the LG C1 doesn\u2019t have it \u2013 and yet, even without the new panel it\u2019s still one of the best OLED TVs we\u2019ve seen.",
    "What the OLED evo panel adds is additional brightness through a new lighting element in the self-emissive pixels. That\u2019s absent from the LG C1 OLED, but we found that it isn\u2019t really lacking in brightness. In our moderately bright (i.e. some ambient light) living room, the picture looked gorgeous. Sure, the reflective glare ate into the inky black levels, but we found the brightness of the screen to compensate nicely for the ambient light.",
    "The reason the C1 is able to do that is because the light sensor built into the TV measures levels of ambient light and calibrates the picture accordingly. If the TV sees that there\u2019s more light in the room, it adds extra brightness to the screen. That peak brightness still isn\u2019t as high as, say, the peak luminance on the new Samsung QN900A QLED, but it\u2019s getting closer to the 1,000-nit mark that rival LED-LCD TVs shoot for.",
    "Speaking of brightness and contrast, the C1 OLED supports most major flavors of HDR \u2013 including HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG \u2013 with the minor exception being HDR10+. That last bit means you won\u2019t see shows from Amazon Prime live up to their full potential, but services like Netflix, Vudu and Disney will all have Dolby Vision content enabled.",
    "Watching the opening of Falcon and The Winter Soldier, the crimson reds of Captain America\u2019s shield and the deep blues of the sky looked outstanding. And while no part of the show blinded us with bright HDR highlights \u2013 again the LG C1 OLED doesn\u2019t use the new OLED evo panels like the LG G1 OLED \u2013 any dark scene looked significantly richer on the C1 OLED than on any LED-LCD we tried in the last 12 months.",
    "Because the pixels themselves are self-emissive, there\u2019s little to no light bleed and objects moving across the screen look cleaner than on LED-LCD TVs. There\u2019s still a bit of motion blur, but LG\u2019s motion processing has seen a real improvement in the last few years.",
    "In fact, the only area that could stand to be improved in terms of picture quality is the way the Alpha a9 Gen 4 processor handles faces \u2013 leaving a bit of a reddish hue and graininess. Watching shows like The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime, you\u2019ll see a dash of redness in the hosts\u2019 faces while faces on characters in HD content upscaled to 4K can have some noticeable grain. LG is aware of that fact, clearly, as that\u2019s a major focus for the Alpha a9 Gen 4 processor, but there\u2019s still a little more work to be done in that area.",
    "Thankfully, the processor does an excellent job at upscaling. Films from the mid-2000s look like they were shot and distributed in 4K despite being streamed in HD, as does content from an HD OTA antenna \u2013 which is a real feat of engineering.",
    "Speaking of engineering, it\u2019s definitely worth talking about the new gaming features on this year\u2019s C-Series OLED as that\u2019s where the majority of the innovation is this year. For starters, there\u2019s that new Game Optimiser setting that allows you to quickly adjust the White Stabilizer, Black Stabilizer and VRR. You\u2019ve also got support for ALLM when the OLED detects an incoming game signal through any one of the four HDMI 2.1 ports and a Prevent Input Delay feature that drops input latency to sub-10ms.",
    "Of course, not every game is going to play at 4K/120Hz right now \u2013 few even play at 1440p/120Hz or 1080p/120Hz \u2013 but you\u2019ll appreciate those that do. Forza Horizon 4 is among the chosen few, though, and it looks incredible on the C1 OLED. Taking cars out on the backcountry roads feels slick and responsive without compromising on visual fidelity.",
    "Long story short, if you\u2019re a gamer-turned-cinephile or vice versa, the LG C1 OLED is competent enough to please both camps in the visual department and is well worth the upgrade from an LED-LCD TV.",
    "Last but not least, it\u2019s worth noting that the LG C1 is totally customizable and great for calibration. If you\u2019re someone who loves tweaking picture settings, the C1 has deep customization options for white point balancing and individual color calibration. If that sounds too challenging, however, we found the default Calibrated settings with a neutral color tone instead of warm really makes the TV look great.",
    "Picture enhancements aren\u2019t the only tricks up the LG C1 OLED\u2019s sleeve this year \u2013 it\u2019s also got a pretty neat AI Sound upscaling feature that transforms basic stereo audio tracks into virtual 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos sound with a fair amount of verticality and that makes the LG C1 OLED sounds a heck of a lot better than your standard TV speakers.",
    "Admittedly, it\u2019s not quite better than a standalone soundbar \u2013 especially if you pit it against one of the best soundbars like the Sonos Arc \u2013 but out-of-the-box sound should be more than adequate for most people.",
    "The only real issue we noticed is that, if you don\u2019t have sound leveling turned on, audio can be a bit all over the place \u2013 meaning you\u2019ll hear booming bass and nearly sibilant highs with weaker dialogue when watching that big new Hollywood blockbuster. For us, it happened during Falcon and The Winter Soldier where the sound effects were fantastic but the actual actors\u2019 voices were getting lost in the mix.",
    "Thankfully, if you notice the same issue, you can tweak that by either setting the default sound profile to Enhanced Dialogue or turn on volume leveling. Both might mean forgoing some of the booming bass, but the result is a more balanced sound that\u2019s easier to listen to for extended periods of time.",
    "However, if you are a soundbar owner or will become one in the near future, the LG C1 supports ARC and eARC through one of the four HDMI ports. That will allow you to pass Dolby Atmos sound from the TV to the soundbar and use a single remote to control the volume. It\u2019s extremely convenient, and worth taking advantage of if you don\u2019t already."
