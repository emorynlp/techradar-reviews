    "Last time we looked at Adobe Spark, it was a service that had recently merged three Adobe properties: Adobe Post, Adobe Slate and Adobe Voice. They were then known as Adobe Spark Post, Adobe Spark Page, and Adobe Spark Video respectively.",
    "Although you can still access apps bearing these manes for your mobile or tablets, the web version of the service has received a major overhaul.",
    "This service is part of Adobe, but you don\u2019t actually need a Creative Cloud account and therefore don\u2019t need to fork out a monthly subscription in order to use this service - well there\u2019s a proviso to this (more on that later). However, you do need to login somehow which you can do using your Google, Facebook or Apple accounts, or just your email if you prefer. Teachers and students have a separate login option.",
    "Once you\u2019ve created an account, you\u2019re graced with your front page. From there, you\u2019re offered a series of templates, depending on where your project is destined for: an Instagram story or a post, a Facebook post, a photo collage, a presentation, a slideshow, or a custom sized project, for instance. Mouse over each thumbnail though and you\u2019ll see the three original options are still very much present: graphic, web page, and video, depending on which Spark you\u2019ll be creating.",
    "The whole concept is there to make content creation as easy and as quick as possible for those who need to advertise and promote their work but don\u2019t have the time nor the skill to do this. We\u2019ll look at each in turn.",
    "Select any graphic option and you\u2019re greeted with a good number of templates to choose from. This is where you may encounter a bit of a pickle: not all templates are available for free. Any with a little yellow tag top right of the thumbnail can only be accessed if you have a Creative Cloud subscription.",
    "What\u2019s annoying is that this yellow tag isn\u2019t immediately obvious when scrolling through brightly coloured templates, and they\u2019re sprinkled throughout the list - they\u2019re not sorted between free, and paid for. However, there are still a good number of free templates to work with should you wish to remain in the free section.",
    "Once you\u2019ve made your selection, this is where the fun begins.",
    "The template is fully customisable. You can obviously select any text box and alter the wording - that\u2019s a given - but you also have access to dozens of fonts, alter the spacing, and have resize and rotate options.",
    "There\u2019s a handy representation of all the layers that make up your creation, making it easy to see what\u2019s on each and to alter their order, and as there\u2019s also an Opacity slider, you have the ability to make selected objects semi-transparent.",
    "Perhaps the most imaginative - but also quite frustrating - feature is the \u2018Find a new style\u2019 button. It allows you to go through a huge number of different styles for your text box, changing font, colour, shape, you name it. As long as you keep clicking on that button, Spark will keep offering you new options.",
    "Although this is fun to start with, there\u2019s no option to go back in reverse should a previous random design you liked was the one you wanted to use. Thankfully there\u2019s a multiple undo feature which you access through your computer\u2019s usual keyboard shortcut. However, it would\u2019ve been good to perhaps have a way to tag styles you like as you see them, or at the very least go back to your original selection without hitting Undo until you eventually get back to it manually.",
    "If you need to add photos, you have access to any stored on your hard drive or your Lightroom libraries of course. Connecting to your Dropbox, Google Photos or Google Drive accounts is also supported. Spark\u2019s search field is quite powerful, scouring sites for any images tagged as \u2018Creative Commons-licensed\u2019. You also have access to Adobe Stock for images as well. The inclusion of image enhancing tools and filters is most welcome.",
    "You start with a blank page and a couple of text boxes. Click on \u2018Themes\u2019 to get a few font and colour options, but you\u2019re much more on your own with Web Pages than you are with Graphics. These themes help give your page a consistent look. You have no control over those presets however, but at least you can switch themes at any time until to find the one that works best for you.",
    "As you scroll down you\u2019ll see that you can add photos, text boxes, create a photo grid or a slideshow, even add a video, or make a section with a split layout. In a way, this is the basis for many website builder services out there, only simplified. Creating links to other pages or other websites is done with the use of buttons - you have no say in the shape and style of them, as this is determined by the theme you chose.",
    "Although your options are very limited, the end result does look crisp and fresh, giving you a nice-looking web presence in minutes.",
    "Creating a video starts by giving your project a title. Once you\u2019ve done this, you\u2019re offered a selection of templates. You\u2019re then granted access to a basic video editing layout based around the concept of slides. Each slide is an edit, and each one is represented by a rectangular thumbnail, irrespective of the length of the video contained within it.",
    "Unlike with images and photos, Adobe Spark doesn\u2019t provide you with a video library to select clips from; you have to provide your own.",
    "You\u2019re offered trimming tools to select just the section you need, and you can choose from four different types of slides - one offering your clip full screen, another splitting the screen between your video and text, one with an animated caption over the screen, and lastly, a large title over the screen.",
    "As with Webpages, your creative options are much more limited than for Graphics: you can\u2019t select your font, and you don\u2019t even have access to a full colour palette - just the ones offered by whichever Theme you\u2019ve chosen.",
    "You can\u2019t colour correct your videos, and the most you can do aside from trimming them, is zooming into them. Barely worth writing home about.",
    "You can also add photos and the import process is the same as for the Graphics or Web Page sections above, but as with videos, you have no image enhancing options, and although you can zoom in or out, you can\u2019t set it to pan and zoom across your photo.",
    "By default, a musical score is added to your project, which you can change in the Music section - you have just under three dozen tracks to choose from, but if none of these appeal, it\u2019s possible for you to upload your own.",
    "Should you choose to, you can add a voice over to your project, although your narration is confined within a slide. It\u2019s good that the slide\u2019s duration will automatically lengthen should you overrun on its originally set length, but you have no editing control over your recording. You can\u2019t trim it, or cut out portions you didn\u2019t need. It\u2019s got to be a perfect take, or nothing. At least you can overwrite that recording with another.",
    "A welcome addition is the ability to invite others to your projects. Not only can they see your work in progress, they also have full editing control.",
    "People you invite can only see the project you\u2019ve granted them access to, and you can rescind that invitation at any time.",
    "Once your work is complete, you can share it in one of two ways. The first is by uploading it to spark.adobe.com - you\u2019re given a unique URL for your creation. Alternatively, you can download your work and be free to share it anywhere you choose.",
    "Wepages can\u2019t be downloaded, and are solely hosted by Spark.",
    "Even though Spark merges three services into one, they are clearly still three separate services. There\u2019s a lot to like here, and the features will help you create a graphic, a webpage or a video very quickly. For a free service, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out."
