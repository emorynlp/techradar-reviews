    "The Sonos IKEA Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker is a superb device that succeeds at blending together both style and function. If you want a wireless speaker that will impress but won\u2019t disturb the layout of your room, this is an excellent solution.",
    "For the price ($199 / \u00a3179 / around AU$270) you\u2019ll get a great-sounding device that delivers exciting audio, thumping bass, and clarity that\u2019s unmatched by most cheaper options. You can turn the volume up without fear of distortion, and preset volume limits are there to help keep your neighbors happy.",
    "Thanks to its sleek form factor, the Picture Frame can fit almost anywhere, from hanging on your wall to resting on your mantlepiece \u2013 and the 3.5m power cable almost guarantees that it\u2019ll be near enough to a socket to fire it up.",
    "Through the Sonos app, you can integrate this speaker seamlessly with your pre-existing Sonos sound system \u2013 but newcomers to the platform will find it easy to set up the speaker, too. The app also acts as a one stop shop for all your audio streaming needs, allowing you to effortlessly switch between your favorite songs, podcasts, and audiobooks from your smartphone.",
    "Unfortunately there's no Bluetooth on board, but thanks to the app you won\u2019t miss it. Additionally, Apple users can always use Airplay to cast music if they need to, as well as taking advantage of Trueplay to tune their speaker perfectly to its new home (sorry Android users \u2013 but you\u2019re out of luck here).",
    "Sure, the design of the Symfonisk Picture Frame won\u2019t be for everyone, but if you can look past that (or choose to snag an alternative print design in the future) you\u2019ll still be left with a wireless speaker that\u2019s sure to dazzle you and any guests thanks to its fantastic audio performance.",
    "You can find the Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker exclusively at IKEA for $199 / \u00a3179 \u2013 that works out at around AU$270, though Australian availability is still to be confirmed. If you aren\u2019t a fan of the print that comes with it by default, you can purchase alternatives for $19.99 / \u00a317 (about AU$30).",
    "For a speaker that\u2019s comparable to the Sonos One in terms of audio performance this isn\u2019t a bad price, though it will make the Picture Frame a little out of reach for users on a budget.",
    "Calling it the Symfonisk Picture Frame is perhaps a little confusing, as you won\u2019t be able to display your family portrait or favourite snap with this device. Instead the Picture Frame features a print created by IKEA designers.",
    "Creating a default print that appeals to everyone was always going to be tough, but we think the design chosen by IKEA and Sonos (which is meant to be a visual representation of music and sound) looks neat. If you aren\u2019t a fan though, other options are available for purchase, including a paint splatter design and one that resembles a turntable.",
    "You can also choose to purchase the Symfonisk Picture Frame in either white or black, which again, will come down to personal preference. Whatever option you choose, we\u2019re sure the plastic frame and canvas-like fabric grille won\u2019t look out of place wherever you decided to hang it \u2013 and the Symfonisk Picture Frame is just as practical as it is pretty.",
    "The Symfonisk range of speakers \u2013 which also includes a lamp speaker and bookshelf speaker \u2013 is designed to suit audiophiles who don\u2019t have space for a dedicated sound system. The flat form factor of the Picture Frame, which measures 22 x 16 x 2 inches (H x W x D), means you\u2019ll most likely be able to find space for this in your home.",
    "A lot of care has been taken to ensure the Picture Frame can suit most spaces: it can hang vertically or horizontally, and you can swap between these orientations easily. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t want to hang it up (or aren\u2019t allowed to drill into your walls) you can instead use the two rubber feet included in the box that allow this speaker to lean comfortably against a wall.",
    "The 3.5m power cable is long and flexible, meaning it should be able to reach an outlet from nearly anywhere you might want to place this speaker. In addition, a sizeable cutout in the back of the device ensures you have plenty of space to hide any excess wire to keep your room looking neat.",
    "Along the side of the speaker, you\u2019ll find some basic controls that allow you to change the volume or play / pause the current track, though we almost never used them. That\u2019s because most of the speaker controls are handled in the Sonos App.",
    "To interact with the Symfonisk Speaker you\u2019ll need to first download the Sonos App and connect your speaker to your Wi-Fi (the typical IKEA instruction manual will explain this to you in case you forget).",
    "The Sonos app works very similarly to the Google Home app, allowing you to virtually assign speakers to specific rooms. You can then control where your music plays, activating all your devices, just those in one place, or even an individual speaker. If you have multiple Sonos speakers already, you can take advantage of each speaker\u2019s specific qualities to deliver great sounding music in a wireless setup \u2013 for instance, by using a pair of Sonos Ones as rear speakers.",
    "To play music \u2013 or podcasts and audiobooks \u2013 you\u2019ll have to log into your streaming service of choice through the Sonos app. This may feel tedious at first, but the result is a one stop shop for all your audio needs; in the long run it makes for a much improved experience.",
    "Unfortunately though, there\u2019s no Bluetooth, meaning that there are some limits on what this device can do. However, we didn\u2019t find this to be a very significant drawback given how comprehensive the Sonos app is.",
    "Apple users will notice the lack of Bluetooth even less, as the Symfonisk Picture Frame supports AirPlay 2. This gives you a little more freedom on what can play through the speaker \u2013 and that\u2019s not all you can do with your iPhone and iPad. If you\u2019re using a device that runs the latest version of iOS (except those listed on the official Sonos website) you can access Trueplay, a system that will automatically tune your speaker to make it sound as good as possible in its current environment.",
    "Android users will instead be stuck with a manual EQ control in the Sonos app. We didn't spend a long time setting up the speaker this way, so it shouldn't pose too much of an inconvenience.",
    "While every picture frame should look aesthetically pleasing, this Picture Frame needs to deliver a great sound performance too \u2013 and it\u2019s safe to say that the Symfonisk Picture Frame succeeds in both.",
    "No matter what you enjoy listening to, be it a heavy rock track, a classical symphony, or your favorite podcast, this device offers a fantastic listening experience. For tunes that need to be turned up to 11, this Symfonisk speaker can deliver chest thumping noise, all while keeping the sound clear and free from distortion. The bass is powerful but never muddy, even when you crank it up.",
    "Even for more subdued soundscapes, this speaker offers tremendous clarity to each and every instrument being played in a song. You\u2019ll be able to pick out distinct playing styles and sounds that you wouldn't usually hear from less accomplished speakers or headphones.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about disturbing your neighbors too much, either. We found the Symfonisk Picture Frame did a great job of not vibrating the wall it\u2019s placed against; when we went into the room behind it, we couldn\u2019t hear what was playing at moderate volumes. That means you should be able to get away turning your music up a decibel or two more before you get any noise complaints.",
    "If you are worried about this though, the Sonos app allows you to set up volume limits, so you\u2019ll never have to worry about disturbing your neighbors again."
