  "summary": "One small step, or one giant leap?",
  "verdict": "The OnePlus 9 Pro offers phenomenal performance, a vastly superior camera to the brand\u2019s previous smartphones, and a variety of top-end features that make this a serious contender for anyone who\u2019s in the market for a premium Android handset. It won\u2019t be for everyone though as the price is high for this smartphone.",

    "The best OnePlus camera phone",
    "Great power",

    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is a culmination of the company\u2019s efforts over the past couple of years, and it\u2019s the first time a smartphone from the company has felt like the complete package.",
    "It offers top-end power, a great camera experience and all the bells and whistles you\u2019d expect from a flagship smartphone right now. This is a handset that can genuinely compete with the very best phones from the biggest brands.",
    "However, it also comes with a high-end price tag, and there\u2019s no denying that the OnePlus 9 Pro is an expensive choice for your next phone.",
    "There\u2019s very little missing here, with the lack of microSD support being one of the few features this smartphone doesn\u2019t offer when compared to other handsets.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro has a premium design, with a handsome 6.7-inch QHD display that delivers strong brightness levels and top-notch detail, while a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate adds to the top-tier feel.",
    "The handset itself may be too big for some, but the design feels worth the money, with a glass rear and the choice of three colors to ensure that your new OnePlus matches your style \u2013 we think the Morning Mist shade pictured throughout this review is particularly good-looking.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro\u2019s biggest upgrade is in the camera department. The company is putting a strong emphasis on photography here, which includes partnering with legendary camera brand Hasselblad to improve how colors are processed.",
    "We were impressed by the cameras throughout our time with the OnePlus 9 Pro \u2013 the versatile setup delivers great results in auto mode, and can produce some stunning images to rival those from the very best camera phones.",
    "Photography-wise it may not be the absolute best choice for everyone, but OnePlus has made notable improvements and it\u2019s now an option that can compete with the likes of the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S21.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, and the phone is well capable of doing everything you need it to. Battery life isn\u2019t the absolute best we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone, but it\u2019ll mostly last you a full day, and there are a couple of fast-charging options.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is the best smartphone the brand has ever made, and while it\u2019s an expensive handset, it can comfortably compete with other high-end options, such as the Galaxy S21 Ultra or the iPhone 12 Pro Max, to justify that price.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro was revealed on March 23, 2021 in a virtual event from the company, and preorders went live immediately after the event finished. The phone is now available in the UK and the US.",
    "We don\u2019t expect the OnePlus 9 Pro to be on sale in Australia as the company doesn't often sell its phones there. In the US, you'll only be able to buy the higher storage variant of the OnePlus 9 Pro while both variants are available in the UK.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro price isn\u2019t as low as some might have hoped, and if you want the 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage variant you\u2019ll be spending \u00a3829 (about $969, AU$1,250).",
    "Want more storage and extra RAM? There\u2019s also a 12GB / 256GB model of the OnePlus 9 Pro, which costs $1,069 / \u00a3929 (about AU$1,400). If those prices sound a bit steep, there\u2019s also the OnePlus 9, which was unveiled alongside the 9 Pro and which starts at $729 / \u00a3629 (about AU$950).",
    "US carrier T-Mobile sells the phone, while it will be supported on Verizon (LTE and 5G, including mmWave) and AT&T (LTE only so far). If you're in the UK, you'll find the phone is on sale through Three.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro isn\u2019t a big departure from the company\u2019s last few handsets, and if you\u2019ve owned a phone from the company since the OnePlus 7 you won\u2019t be particularly surprised by the design here.",
    "It looks premium, and when you handle the device it feels premium. The OnePlus 9 Pro has a glass rear, and you\u2019ve got the choice of three colors: Morning Mist (the silver shade pictured throughout this review), Forest Green and Stellar Black. You may be restricted to certain colors depending on where you are, so don\u2019t set your heart on one particular color until you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s available.",
    "The phone has metal edges. On the right edge is the power button, and above this is a silence slider that enables you to quickly mute your phone when you want to. The volume rocker is on the left edge.",
    "The bottom edge of the phone is home to the USB-C charging slot, along with the SIM card drawer and a speaker grille.",
    "OnePlus has trimmed down the camera bump on the OnePlus 9 Pro compared to its previous handsets, but it still juts out from the rear of the phone. You\u2019ll find the Hasselblad logo emblazoned on the camera alongside four shooters (you\u2019ll learn more about the cameras, and about the Hasselblad connection, in the Cameras section of this review).",
    "The rear of the phone curves gently at the edges, and we found that helped the handset to sit nicely in our hands. Note, though, that this isn\u2019t a small phone by any means: it measures 163.2 x 73.6 x 8.7mm, and weighs 197 grams which is about typical for a phone of this kind.",
    "Overall, the OnePlus 9 Pro has a premium look and feel that can rival any other top-end phone you\u2019ll find on the market right now. Not much has changed here compared to previous OnePlus Pro phones, and that\u2019s just fine with us.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a large and high-resolution display befitting its Pro status. It\u2019s 6.7 inches from corner to corner, with a QHD resolution of 1440 x 3216 \u2013 that equals 525 pixels per inch. That resolution on this AMOLED display is noticeable from the moment you first turn on the display with images jumping out of the screen and text appearing razor-sharp.",
    "Brightness is good, although the auto brightness mode can sometimes struggle to go bright enough in some scenarios. If you\u2019re in direct sunlight, you\u2019ll likely want to play around with the brightness features to ensure you can see the screen.",
    "As on 2020\u2019s OnePlus 8 Pro, the display has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is starting to become the norm on top-end Android phones. This means the display refreshes 120 times a second, rather than 60 times on older smartphones and some current flagships, like the iPhone 12, which have a 60Hz refresh rate.",
    "Essentially means that you\u2019ll enjoy a smoother on-screen image, whether you\u2019re playing games \u2013 it\u2019s particularly welcome when you\u2019re playing fast-paced action games such as Call of Duty: Mobile \u2013 or scrolling your social media feeds.",
    "The refresh rate is adaptive so certain apps, such as an eBook, will offer a 1Hz refresh rate while others run at up to 120Hz, which saves battery. We found the adaptive setting worked well, adjusting the display seamlessly, and we didn\u2019t notice when the screen was running at a lower refresh rate.",
    "There's also a fingerprint scanner in the screen, and we found this technology to work similarly fast to most other flagship phones that feature this tech in 2021.",
    "OnePlus smartphones have always struggled to keep up with other top-end Android phones in the camera department, but the OnePlus 9 Pro has the best camera we\u2019ve seen on a handset from the company.",
    "OnePlus has stepped up its game here by including new sensors with at least one of them made in combination with Sony, and by teaming up with famed camera maker Hasselblad to improve color calibration, so that the colors you see are reproduced as accurately as possible.",
    "The main camera is a 48MP rear shooter, and it uses a Sony IMX789 sensor that was made in collaboration with Sony. There are three other cameras on the rear, including a 50MP ultra-wide camera that uses a Sony IMX766 sensor.",
    "There\u2019s also an 8MP telephoto shooter that can shoot at up to 3x optical zoom, while the final element is a 2MP monochrome shooter that essentially allows you to get higher quality black and white imagery.",
    "The main sensor on the OnePlus 9 Pro is a cut above what OnePlus has made before, and we found that it could take fantastic images, with great-looking colors and masses of detail.",
    "If you compare images to those taken with previous OnePlus phones, you\u2019ll find that colors look far more natural, which we presume is the result of the aforementioned collaboration with Hasselblad. The image quality here is more like what you get from Apple\u2019s iPhones, rather than what you\u2019d see from a Samsung phone, for example.",
    "We\u2019ve also been impressed with how the OnePlus 9 Pro can produce great results even when you\u2019re using its automatic mode, when you want to just point and shoot with the minimum of fuss.",
    "You can switch to the ultra-wide camera with a quick tap of a virtual button, and the results here are similarly good, with a new distortion-correction technology working behind the scenes to minimize the \u2018barrel\u2019 distortion that typically appears at the edges of ultra-wide shots.",
    "We found this to work well within our shooting, but it's not the type of feature that will impress you unless you're looking out for it.",
    "The telephoto zoom camera on the OnePlus 9 Pro is capable of shooting at up to 3x optical zoom, beyond which it\u2019ll switch to a digital zoom for anything up to 30x zoom.",
    "Images taken using the optical zoom looked good, and are usable for sending to your friends on messaging apps or posting to social media accounts. As you\u2019d likely expect, things get worse as you zoom in further, with images looking dramatically inferior to those from the outstanding telephoto camera on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.",
    "For video, you\u2019re able to record in 8K at up to 30 frames per second, which is one of the highest resolution/frame rate combinations we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone. This quality is largely unnecessary if this is a video you\u2019ll be watching back on the phone, however, and note too that shooting at this top setting will eat up a lot of storage.",
    "Other video options include 4K at 30, 60 or even 120 frames per second for slow-motion footage, and there are also slow-mo options for 720p at 480fps or Full HD at 240fps. We found all of these to work well, and these settings are comparable to other Android phones you\u2019d find on the market right now.",
    "The main camera has both optical and electronic image stabilization to ensure that footage is shake-free and overall you\u2019ll likely be happy with the quality of video shot on the OnePlus 9 Pro",
    "On the front of the phone is a selfie shooter with a 16MP Sony IMX741 sensor and an aperture of f/2.4. This isn\u2019t the highest-end selfie camera we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone, but we were happy enough with the photos and video it captured.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, and as has been the case with other Android phones using this chip, we\u2019ve been impressed with the top-end performance it enables, with the phone loading apps almost instantaneously.",
    "You get either 8GB or 12GB of RAM depending on which variant of the phone you opt for, and while an extra 4GB won\u2019t make a huge difference to most users, it\u2019s worth noting that the amount of RAM you choose dictates how much storage you get.",
    "The 8GB model of the OnePlus 9 Pro comes with 128GB of storage, while if you opt for the 12GB phone you get 256GB. Those in the US are currently only able to buy the 12GB of RAM option, while those in the UK have the choice of these two variants.",
    "As with other OnePlus devices there\u2019s no microSD support here, so you\u2019ll be restricted to the built-in storage of whichever variant you buy. If you think you\u2019ll be using your phone for a good few years, we\u2019d recommend opting for the larger-capacity option.",
    "We\u2019ve reviewed the 12GB version of the OnePlus 9 Pro, and we found its benchmark scores to be particularly strong. We haven\u2019t seen any reason to doubt that the 8GB variant is also a strong performer, although we\u2019ve yet to test that phone.",
    "We found the 12GB of RAM variant had an average Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 3630. That's just behind the Asus ROG Phone 5, and beats results we've seen on other top-end phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro is also a 5G-ready handset, so you\u2019ll be equipped to take advantage of next-gen internet connectivity even if you don\u2019t expect to be using it in the near future.",
    "The phone comes running Android 11 right out of the box, with OnePlus\u2019s own OxygenOS look over the top, which brings with it a variety of features such as an always-on display and the brand\u2019s own unique look and feel.",
    "We found the phone did suffer from some Bluetooth connectivity issues, but we're hoping these will be solved in a final software update from the company. We'll update this review when we hear more.",
    "There isn\u2019t much bloatware on the OnePlus 9 Pro, and those who like OnePlus\u2019s signature look will enjoy the way the software works on the handset.",
    "The OnePlus 9 Pro isn\u2019t going to offer game-changing battery life, but it\u2019ll reliably see you through a full day on a full charge with typical use. Only on one or two occasions during our testing time did we need to give OnePlus 9 Pro a top-up at around 10pm.",
    "The 4,500mAh battery is large, and the OnePlus 9 Pro can hold its own against most of our best smartphones right now in this department, but it won\u2019t last you two days if you\u2019re using the phone regularly.",
    "With particularly intensive use we found the phone wouldn\u2019t make it through a full day, but helpfully there\u2019s some impressive fast-charging tech here to enable you to top up your handset quickly when you need to.",
    "There\u2019s 65-watt wired charging, and, perhaps more impressively, the OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50 watt wireless charging, which is some of the highest spec we\u2019ve seen for this technology, and which is particularly impressive given that OnePlus didn\u2019t embrace wireless charging until 2020\u2019s OnePlus 8 series.",
    "Unlike competing phones from Apple, Samsung and a handful of other Android manufacturers, the OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a new charger in the box. Several manufacturers have removed chargers from the box, citing the need to cut down on e-waste, but OnePlus has seen fit to include one here.",
