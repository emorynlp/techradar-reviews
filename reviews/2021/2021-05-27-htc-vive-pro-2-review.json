    "Looking for a high-spec VR headset? The HTC Vive Pro 2 will whisk you off to super-hi-res virtual reality worlds with its 5K display, which is simply the best VR screen available to the average person today. But that incredible screen is paired with some other hardware elements that need to be considered caveats to the otherwise premium experience.",
    "The original HTC Vive put at-home virtual reality on the map, with its spot-on tracking and high resolution screen. The competition has heated up since its 2016 debut, with the Oculus Quest 2 and Valve Index impressing VR gamers. But with the HTC Vive Pro 2, HTC is ready to re-stake its claim as the premium VR headset manufacturer to beat when it comes to PC virtual reality. And, in terms of its spec sheet, the HTC Vive Pro 2 is easily one of the most powerful, high-end VR headsets out there.",
    "With a 5K (2.5K to each eye) display targeting a silky-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, it\u2019s the most visually impressive VR headset we\u2019ve ever put on our heads. It\u2019s also one of the richest sounding, thanks to its over-ear headphones and hi-res audio capabilities.",
    "But it\u2019s not the most comfortable \u2013 HTC has done well to make the Vive Pro 2 easily adjustable to fit many head shapes and glasses-wearers, but there\u2019s still a lot of weight to the headset, and a lot of bulk to the design, not to mention the restrictions naturally brought on by its tethered-to-a-computer nature. Also, that high resolution screen generates a lot of heat \u2013 so much so that we struggled to play without fogging the lenses up very quickly.",
    "The HTC Vive Pro 2 is also still using an outside-in tracking system. In the right environment, it\u2019s a very accurate method of spotting the player in the VR world, but it does lead to a more complicated set up procedure, requires more cabling and wall outlets, and limits the locations where play is feasible. Finally, the wand-like controller design of the Vive family is starting to show its age \u2013 large and weighty, the trackpad design may be better suited to commercial applications, but often now feels at odds with the control schemes that current VR titles lean towards, which usually now favour the presence of traditional control sticks, alongside motion movements.",
    "There are caveats, then. But this headset still comes highly recommended \u2013 that screen is going to blow the minds of VR gamers that have only experienced virtual reality hardware of a generation or two ago. If HTC can address the other parts of the package, it\u2019ll regain its position as the best-in-class VR manufacturer.",
    "Pre-orders for the HTC Vive Pro 2 are open now, with general sale starting June 4, 2021. The headset-only variant will start at a special discounted price of \u00a3659 / $749 / \u20ac739. The full kit, which includes Base Station 2.0 and VIVE Controllers, is available from 4 June, for \u00a31299 / $1399 / \u20ac1399.",
    "This is definitely a premium-priced VR device, similarly positioned as the Valve Index, and considerably more than the Oculus Quest 2 (which has lesser specs to match its lower price). Keep in mind you\u2019ll also need a high-end PC to see the HTC Vive Pro 2 working at its best.",
    "Some money-saving can be achieved thanks to the fact existing HTC Vive accessories can be paired with the Vive Pro 2, including tracking stations and earlier generation controllers. But you\u2019ll need to stump up a good chunk of change if you\u2019re a VR newcomer.",
    "Rather than going for an all-in-one, wireless headset design for the HTC Vive Pro 2, HTC is instead targeting the high-end capabilities of virtual reality that can only be reached by hooking up to a well-spec\u2019d PC.",
    "And the numbers it is targeting are very impressive. It\u2019s offering a 5K resolution display (2.5k to each eye), and is aiming to maintain a silky-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. That\u2019s a much sharper display than is present with the Oculus Quest 2, with the Quest 2 also only capable of targeting 120Hz refresh rates on selected titles.",
    "It\u2019s not just about resolution with the screen though, but also the quality of the panels in use. The headset is packing a fast-switch LCD with RGB sub-pixels, and IPD-adjustable goggles that support a 120-degree field of view. That\u2019s wide enough to catch action out of the corner of your eye, thanks to a dual-stacked lens design. It\u2019s a very advanced optics system, with the LCD display shrunk compared to previous models, supposedly for improved heat management \u2013 though in practice this isn\u2019t quite the case.",
    "Pushing this many pixels may make your rig rightly quiver at what\u2019s going to be expected of your PC, and HTC is focussing primarily on enthusiast (and business) users here. You\u2019re going to need a powerful machine to get the most out of the Vive Pro 2.",
    "But HTC has done what it can to take the strain off your components as best as possible \u2013 it\u2019s worked alongside Nvidia and AMD to make Display Stream Compression optimised for the VR headset. It allows for faster compiling and recompiling of visual data between the PC and headset when crunching down the large assets needed to make the 4K screen shine. DisplayPort 1.2 is still supported too, even with DisplayPort Compression active. HTC\u2019s Vive Wireless adapter will also be supported \u2013 though users will not be able to hit the native 4896 x 2448 / 120Hz resolution and frame rate target that the tethered set up delivers.",
    "Those opting to purchase the complete HTC Vive Pro 2 package will also receive a pair of cuboid, powered tracking stations, and a pair of wand-style controllers. The controllers are essentially the same design HTC has used now for years \u2013 dependable and durable, they have a circular touchpad, trigger and pressure-sensitive grip handles, below a large tracking ring. They track well and are compatible and recognized by almost every VR game you can find on Steam, but they\u2019re starting to feel a little old fashioned in comparison to the Valve Index\u2019s \u201cknuckle\u201d controllers, and the more compact Oculus Touch controllers.",
    "HTC has made some adjustments to its headsets to improve upon the ergonomics for the HTC Vive Pro 2. As well as the fine-tunable IPD slider, it\u2019s ensured that its headstrap is quick to adjust and lock thanks to a dial system, while its facial interface is wide enough to accommodate glasses wearers. Weight is evenly distributed to avoid strain on your neck, but this is still a chunky headset. You very much feel encased in its design \u2013 especially once you flip down its over-ear, built-in headphones.",
    "Those 3D spatial sound speakers hover over the user's ears, meaning you still have a sense of what\u2019s going on in their real-world surroundings. But they can be cranked up loud thanks to on-cup volume controls. The audio delivery is another highlight here, with rich and deep bass sounds meaning you won\u2019t necessarily need to bring your own headphones to the party \u2013 the audio interface is also Hi-Res certified though, meaning you can hook up audiophile-grade headphones to the headset and appreciate a more richly-detailed sound experience if you want.",
    "Where the HTC Vive Pro 2 is at its least comfortable is in the amount of heat that its screen generates. With the screen wrapped close to your face, it gets very hot and steamy. We struggled to find a fit that kept the headset tight and secure to our face, and prevented lens fogging at the same time, a problem that was exacerbated by glasses. It\u2019s a problem that will vary from person to person, but better ventilation around the goggles could have prevented the issue altogether \u2013 I\u2019d personally accept a little exterior light bleed if it counteracted steamy lenses.",
    "Those looking for an untethered, all-in-one headset from HTC should look towards the newly-revealed HTC Vive Focus 3 \u2013 though that\u2019s primarily being targeted at business users. Existing HTC Vive owners can find some solace in the fact that all existing HTC VR accessories will be compatible with the new HTC Vive Pro 2 however, meaning you won\u2019t need to buy additional gear other than the headset if you\u2019re already rocking VIVE Trackers of any generation, the VIVE Facial Tracker, Vive \u2018wand\u2019 controllers, or Steam VR accessories such as the Valve Index \u2018knuckle\u2019 controllers. Oculus controllers are not compatible.",
    "If there\u2019s one thing that may not be quite so accommodating for the budding VR gamer, that\u2019ll be the continued reliance on base stations for tracking with the HTC Vive Pro 2. Along with the tethered connection to the PC, it\u2019s another obstacle to quick, hassle-free VR engagement, meaning you\u2019re going to need to find space to house two small tracking cubes around your play space so that the Vive Pro 2 knows where you are. Along with the cable tether, that\u2019s the trade off to get the highest-possible visual quality from a VR headset at present \u2013 though the gap is closing with inside-out tracking systems as seen in use with the Oculus Quest 2.",
    "The HTC Vive Pro 2 connects to your PC using a breakaway Vive Link box. It requires a power outlet, USB 3 connection and DisplayPort connection to your PC. From there, you can plug in the cable running from the headset into the Link Box, giving you a total of about 5m distance to roam from your PC.",
    "HTC Vive Pro 2 uses Steam VR as its underlying platform (and Valve\u2019s base stations), so if you\u2019ve experience setting up a VR headset through that, you\u2019ll know what to expect. You\u2019ll need to put the base stations high up in opposite corners of your play space \u2013 ideally above head height, and angled slightly downwards. Ideally, you\u2019ll have a minimum of 2m x 1.5m for \u2018room-scale\u2019 walk-around play, though you can get away with smaller spaces if you\u2019re playing seated instead of just standing.",
    "The Steam VR set up software does a good job of holding your hand through the set-up process, asking you to place the Bluetooth-connected controllers on the floor to establish the ground level and tracing the corners of your digital play space. Note though that it is important to angle those base stations just right \u2013 initially, Steam VR thought I was about 3 foot high as I\u2019d not properly established my height. The base stations can be wall mounted or placed on a tripod, but with each needing a power outlet, finding a permanent space for your VR sessions will be best, or you\u2019ll have to go through the set-up rigamarole each time you move the kit.",
    "If you can get past some of the comfort and heat issues we experienced with the Vive Pro 2, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy an unparalleled VR experience from a visual standpoint. The high resolution screen and fast refresh rate is jaw-dropping, with an incredible sense of presence and realism able to shine through on the headset. Provided you\u2019ve got the high-end PC to power it, it really is the very best-looking VR headset you can use at home.",
    "We regularly wax lyrical on the likes of Half-Life Alyx and Lone Echo in VR circles and, as you\u2019d imagine, these sorts of titles enjoy an additional sense of polish, fidelity and atmosphere through the combination of the Valve\u2019s class-leading optics and audio.",
    "But what was even more striking was going back to earlier VR titles, and seeing them benefit from an upscaled resolution. For instance, the environments in Batman Arkham VR appeared far more detailed than remembered, with Wayne Manor, the Bat Cave and the assorted crime scenes oozing with gothic wonder. As anticipated however, it\u2019s hard to go back to HTC\u2019s wand controllers after spending extended time with the wonderfully ergonomic Oculus or Valve Index options. At around 5 hours of play, the battery life of the controllers could be better, too.",
    "There\u2019s a huge amount of games available to Vive Pro 2 players through the Steam store front, while HTC offers its own store with at Viveport. Half-Life Alyx, Superhot VR, Beat Saber and The Room VR represent just a taste of what\u2019s on offer. It also offers an all you can eat Viveport Infinity subscription, opening up unlimited access to a number of big titles for a monthly fee. Note there are also unofficial workarounds that can be found online to access games pushed through the Oculus storefront too, though neither Oculus owners Facebook nor HTC officially supports them."
