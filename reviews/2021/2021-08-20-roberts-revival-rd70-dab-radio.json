  "summary": "Great DAB radio, so-so Bluetooth speaker",
  "verdict": "Buy the RD70 if you want a great sounding, 1950s-styled \u2018wireless\u2019 for your kitchen. It also works as a portable Bluetooth speaker, though only on AA batteries when away from the mains. Better in the kitchen than the bedroom, this is nevertheless an excellent attempt at a DAB radio with extras.",

    "The best DAB radios are all about the simple things in life. Classic tunes while you create in the kitchen, football commentary in the bath and Test Match Special in the garden.",
    "Cue the Roberts Revival RD70, a retro-styled DAB/FM radio that attempts to bring the \u2018wireless\u2019 bang up to date by adding a large colour LCD display and Bluetooth streaming from smartphones.",
    "Since it can also run on battery power, the RD70 is also a well-disguised portable Bluetooth speaker. Is this the go-anywhere all-in-one of your dreams? Well, perhaps not. The RD70 is great as a DAB and FM radio. It\u2019s faux leather-covered wooden speaker cabinet gives plenty of mid-range and bass (a tad too much, even) and it looks good on a kitchen counter or in a bathroom.",
    "However, it\u2019s not as portable as you might think, thanks to its use of four AA batteries \u2013 no easily rechargeable battery here. It\u2019s also not waterproof and its Bluetooth streaming is also quiet and underwhelming.",
    "So what should we make of the RD70? Well, don\u2019t buy it for its portability or for its basic Bluetooth features \u2013 both of which are the wrong side of retro \u2013 and focus on its core skill as a DAB radio for a kitchen or bathroom. Yes, it\u2019s expensive and misfires on a couple of features, but the vintage-styled RD70 is one of the best-looking, easiest to use DAB radios for the home.",
    "The original Revival had been around for years and was one of the UK\u2019s best-selling portable radios.",
    "This new version originally launched in 2018 updates the tech inside, but barely touches the retro design. It\u2019s available in red, black, dove grey, duck egg blue, leaf green and pastel cream.",
    "If there is an iconic design in the world of DAB radios, it\u2019s Roberts\u2019 Revival. Styled as a 1950s \u2018wireless\u2019 in the old sense of the word, the RD70 now tackles the modern meaning of that phrase to add Bluetooth streaming from smartphones.",
    "Do you remember what radios were like in the 1950s? Nope. Nor us. In fact, you could argue the vintage styling is a tad overdone, and the RD70 more museum piece than truly retro \u2013 but either way there are few more design-led DAB radios out there, save for the Ruark R1 Mk4.",
    "It\u2019s mostly aimed at kitchen sides, window sills, bathrooms and bedside tables. The latter is obvious from its provision of a sleep timer (for up to 90 minutes), two alarms and a snooze function (you just hit the right-hand knob), though we think its bulky size is a little too much for the average bedside table.",
    "There is another reason to keep it away from the bedroom; its 36 x 48mm colour LCD display is ranged on the top of the device so it makes for a less than perfect clock radio.",
    "Measuring 106 x 250 x 160mm and weighing 1.7kg, the RD70 looks like it\u2019s covered in leather. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s merely a synthetic faux-leather \u2013 and on older incarnations of the Revival this layer hasn\u2019t aged well. Cracks and tears have appeared in the covering after a few years. We\u2019re hoping that has been addressed on the RD70, though only time will tell.",
    "It\u2019s an eye-catching look and the designers have gone all-in on the 1950s look, right down to a soft faux-leather carry handle, bronze-coloured speaker grille and knobs that turn and click to navigate menus. It will probably appeal more to older users than younger.",
    "However, there are plenty of contemporary touches on its top-mounted control panel, from that great-looking colour LCD display to playback buttons that let you control your music when streaming from a smartphone. Also on that panel is a headphones jack and a 3.5mm line-in for attaching other audio devices.",
    "The RD70 has a telescopic aerial extending to a maximum of 60cm, but it only feeds upwards. While that adds a little stability (side-ranging aerials tend to droop after a while), it\u2019s not great news for anyone wanting to put the product on a kitchen surface underneath cupboards. That goes doubly so because in our tests the aerial was mostly required to get a stable signal.",
    "We managed to tune-in myriad DAB radio stations using the auto-tune function and found the combination of clicks and turns of the left-hand knob fairly intuitive. We were then able to set specific stations as presets and easily navigate between stations, though the RD70 lacks dedicated preset buttons that take you straight to a specific radio station.",
    "A colour display is pretty advanced for retro products like this and it comes with some interesting options. It offers six display themes to choose from, including ruby, emerald and sapphire-coloured backlights. It makes use of the sheer size of its color display to show a digital version of a clock face. In theory you get album artwork on the display from DAB and via Bluetooth, but this didn\u2019t work in our tests. It\u2019s hardly a necessary feature, anyway.",
    "Bluetooth streaming is easy enough. You just toggle to Bluetooth on the source button and find the RD70 in your phone\u2019s settings. Does the RD70 work well as a portable Bluetooth radio? It can, but it comes with a catch. In place of a built-in lithium-ion battery that\u2019s easy to recharge, the RD70\u2019s undercarriage includes a slip-off hatch for four AA batteries.",
    "They\u2019ll add up to 25 hours of portability. If you only plan to use them irregularly that\u2019s fine, but think twice before you buy the RD70 intending to take it everywhere, since you\u2019ll need a stash of rechargeable AA batteries and the patience to frequently replenish them. We would expect the next version of the RD70 to be a rechargeable unit. The RD70 is also not waterproof, so be careful taking it outside.",
    "FM and DAB broadcasts sound excellent on the RD70, but it won\u2019t be for everyone. A result of its wooden cabinet housing a mid-size driver, the sound quality is warm, detailed and has plenty of bass, but isn\u2019t designed for high volumes.",
    "As its styling suggests, you\u2019ll hear warm, round tones perfect for voice, and for music radio, too. However, it will be a little bassy for some; in our test a DJs with a low voice did sound rather boomy.",
    "You can dive into the RD70\u2019s EQ settings if it\u2019s too much; here you\u2019ll find classic / jazz / pop / rock / news sound presets (though none are standout) alongside basic tweaks to treble and bass.",
    "We found that for DAB radio \u2013 music and voice \u2013 the bass needs to be at -4. For Bluetooth streaming we settled on -2 for bass and +3 for treble, though the major issue we had with this mode was volume.",
    "It\u2019s just so quiet when you swap to playing podcasts or music from a smartphone, even with the smartphone on full volume. As well as lacking volume, the sound appears slightly muffled, too. This unfortunately isn\u2019t rare on DAB radios, which roundly fail to treat Bluetooth streaming with any kind of skill.",
    "If you want a \u2018new\u2019 wireless speaker, go elsewhere, but if you want a good \u2018old\u2019 wireless, the RD70 impresses."
