    "Zettle POS options continue to expand and now cover all manner of payment processing, with the added backup of being part of PayPal.",
    "Being under the PayPal umbrella gets you off to a good start too, as if you\u2019re keen to sign up with Zettle and already possess an account you can use your PayPal details and be registered in minutes.",
    "Along with the convenience of that option you also get an excellent collection of Zettle POS products and services designed to let your business take payments, no matter what it specializes in or, in fact, where it trades from.",
    "There\u2019s Zettle Go, a neat app that\u2019s brilliant for dynamic businesses that need to keep on being productive. You can also opt for the Zettle Pro app, which works brilliantly by combining a sophisticated app with a till-based POS that\u2019s designed with bars, cafes and restaurants in mind.",
    "Add in the Zettle 2 card reader and you\u2019ve got a great and inexpensive POS solution at your disposal.",
    "Like this? Also see our recommendations for the best POS systems.",
    "Getting a taste of the Zettle appeal is very straightforward with trials and no contract being just two positive points that draw you into its appeal. The Zettle Pro package for example, can be experienced for 7 days, for free and without the need to sign on the dotted line.",
    "What\u2019s more, Zettle Go fees are nice and simple, with the app itself being free, a card payment fee of 1.75%, invoice payments being 2.5% per transaction while the Pro hospitality app comes in at \u00a339 per month.",
    "Handy add-ons, such as accounting software integration is free, as is inventory management.",
    "Zettle also suggests that if your business processes over \u00a310,000 in card payments every month then you should contact them to discuss a custom rate plan. Adding to the appeal is the Zettle 2 card reader, which costs just \u00a329.",
    "The current Zettle setup offers flexible product options depending on how you want to use the service in your business. For example, the Zettle Go is a dedicated POS app that comes with all of the tools you\u2019ll need, but with the added convenience factor of being able to process payments whenever and wherever you want.",
    "The Zettle Go allows you to take both cash and card payments, along with Apple and Google Pay. What\u2019s more, the app is boosted with lots of added functionality that enables the organization of products, stock tracking and sales monitoring, all within the confines of the secure software.",
    "Zettle Go is scalable too, as with their own login staff can switch between accounts on the same device. In addition, the app can be used to monitor performance, with detailed reports all being accessible on the go.",
    "A big part of the appeal of Zettle Go is the way that it stores all of your data in the cloud, which means it\u2019s a real boon if you\u2019re catching up with business activities on the move. The app has been nicely designed and responds well, even when you\u2019ve got lots of data to deal with.",
    "Indeed, Zettle Go proves very useful when you\u2019re picking through multiple receipts of sales, perhaps when you need to tackle a session of issuing refunds or handling returns.",
    "Zettle Go seems very adept at tackling chores like this with ease, while its lean and mean interface makes performance even more zesty. The other part of the equation, meanwhile, is the Zettle Reader 2, a card reader that has improved over its earlier incarnation and one that, quite simply, works a treat.",
    "One of the best things about Zettle is its ease of use, with all of its products and services working well on their own. Join them all together and you\u2019ve got a fine suite of hardware and software that really gel.",
    "Being able to manage all of your businesses activities from within the Zettle dashboard gets everything into one place, allowing you to monitor all aspects of your day-to-day workload within a single interface.",
    "So if you\u2019ve got Zettle Go and also the Zettle Pro apps you should find everything works together to boost your productivity. Top it all off with the Zettle card reader and you\u2019ve got a formidable collection of kit that doesn't require much in the way of effort to master.",
    "There\u2019s a similarly impressive supply of help available if you're signed up with Zettle too. Much like the rest of its setup, Zettle has done a sterling job with its online help center, with many different resources at your disposal.",
    "There are more obvious examples, such as an online help repository with many different articles to pick through. You also get useful video tutorials and the opportunity to contact someone on the support team if you need to go into more detail about an issue.",
    "All things considered, the support side of the Zettle experience gets another thumbs up.",
    "There\u2019s much to like about PayPal's Zettle POS system and its flexible user\u2013friendly range of options for boosting your business. You\u2019ll find that it has something to offer any kind of outlet, from food and drink or retail establishments to health and wellness, or those in the service industries.",
    "Everyday usability of Zettle\u2019s Go app is excellent, and this is a high-powered solution too considering it can be used on a mobile device. It gives you the freedom to keep on working and processing payments, even outside of regular business hours.",
    "Meanwhile, Zettle Pro is a really impressive app-based point of sale system that is super sophisticated while remaining easy to use. Add in that great little Zettle 2 card reader plus a very competitive pricing structure and you\u2019ve got an extremely appealing option for your business."
