  "summary": "This iconic-looking one-box hi-fi impresses for smarts and sonics",
  "verdict": "A resurrected Braun Audio\u2019s new flagship one-box hi-fi offers impressively bassy yet detailed audio, plus excellent build quality to complement its smart speaker status. The need to use Google Home for setup and Google Assistant-only compatibility might annoy some, but Apple AirPlay 2 and Chromecast streaming is easily capable of challenging Sonos on sound quality.",

    "Don\u2019t mistake the Braun LE01 for one of the best soundbars. It may outwardly resemble the Sonos Arc or the Sennheiser Ambeo 3D, but this hunk of machined aluminum is all and only about high-end hi-fi. In fact, it is a one-box solution to the problem of how to build the Hi-Fi system of your dreams. Or is it?",
    "Sure, it\u2019s smart enough. This wireless speaker can be controlled using Google Assistant (although not Alexa or Siri). It\u2019s also compatible with both Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 and Google Chromecast, so users of either smartphone platform can stream to it without having to compress music. That\u2019s a good thing, because the LE01 smart speaker comes with only Bluetooth 4.2; there\u2019s no sign of aptX hi-res audio streaming. Nor does this dual-band Wi-Fi speaker allow streaming directly from Tidal Connect or Spotify Connect, and it doesn\u2019t operate as an access-all-areas UPnP speaker either.",
    "Thankfully, it\u2019s pretty versatile, if a little large. You can put the LE01 on a table or shelf, or partner it with a speaker stand at added cost and position it as a freestanding speaker, either in the landscape or portrait orientation. If you\u2019re feeling really flush then you can buy two units and use them as the right and left channels in a stereo setup, or even daisy-chain them together for a multiform array. No matter which option you choose, one thing remains: you have to use Google Home to set it up.",
    "However, as mentioned, the LE01 isn\u2019t a soundbar; it lacks both HDMI and optical audio connectivity, which is a bit of a shame given that it\u2019s a great-sounding speaker and would be ideal for occasional home cinema duties.",
    "Either way, with an involving stereo soundstage boasting lots of detail and bags of bass, the LE01 is a sleek, convenient and great-sounding smart speaker that proves an enjoyable entry into the world of digital hi-fi.",
    "Originally launched in November 2020 by the owners of the Braun Audio brand \u2013 the UK\u2019s Pure Audio \u2013 the Braun LE01 costs $1,299 / \u00a31,099 / AU$2,080. In the UK, it\u2019s sold on the Braun Audio website and in the US by New York City\u2019s Museum Of Modern Art store.",
    "A take on the brand\u2019s classic LE speakers of the late 1950s, the LE01 is the flagship product in a three-strong lineup that also includes the LE02 (essentially a smaller version of the LE01) and the square LE03 \u2013 a Sonos One and Sonos One SL challenger.",
    "The LE01 has the kind of iconic look that appears so simple yet remains rare in hi-fi. It\u2019s actually a re-imagining of the iconic minimalist LE1 speaker from 1959, which was sold by German brand Braun Audio. It\u2019s no longer German, and the LE01 now comes with digital innards and a focus on streaming \u2013 but the looks (only) have been preserved. You get machined aluminium and cloth-covered speaker grilles, with eight low-profile playback buttons on the top. Both a 3.5mm auxiliary input and an Ethernet LAN port can be found on the speaker\u2019s rear. It\u2019s a sleek look and a high-end build indeed.",
    "Measuring 700 x 271 x 99mm, it arrives with a couple of large, wraparound stainless steel supports that can be used to prop up the LE01 and keep it from touching any surface. That extends its footprint to 700 x 323 x 159mm.",
    "Although the LE01 is most likely to be placed either on its own on a bookshelf or on a table using the feet in the box, you can also purchase a stainless steel floor stand that puts the speaker into either landscape or portrait positions (it also hides all of the cables). The latter is most likely to be of use if you buy two speakers and use them as a stereo pair.",
    "You can also create a multi-room system, using the LE01 not only with its stablemates, but \u2013 via the Google Home app \u2013 with any of the best smart speakers that support AirPlay 2 and/or Chromecast.",
    "Whatever position and orientation you choose for the LE01, there are configuration procedures to complete using the Braun Audio app. The first is to set up the LE01 on your home Wi-Fi network using the Google Home app \u2013 this isn\u2019t optional. Through the Braun app you can tweak bass and treble levels, but that\u2019s it; there aren\u2019t even any basic playback or volume controls. Once that\u2019s done you can simply select the LE01 \u2013 or, rather, whatever you have chosen to name it in the Google Home app \u2013 on your phone as the output device when playing Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music and Deezer.",
    "It\u2019s then easy to control the speaker using the Google Assistant. It has four far-field microphones, which means you won\u2019t have to scream any instructions at it.",
    "Other ways of playing music through the LE01 include via a direct Bluetooth connection or the 3.5mm jack on the rear, which is ideal if you want to connect a record player. There\u2019s an Ethernet LAN port there, too, if your Wi-Fi is a bit iffy.",
    "The LE01\u2019s iconic look is matched by its warm and detailed sound. It just about manages to push its soundstage forward into a room, although you\u2019ll always know where the music is coming from \u2013 there are no virtual surround sound modes or excessive stereo effects here.",
    "What the 32-bit ARM audio processor-equipped LE01 does have in droves is bass. The passive radiators pay dividends here, with plenty of bass effects on show that are always punchy. During a run-through of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Utopia, we even found that bass was best toned down a little in the Braun app. It\u2019s a shame that the EQ settings are so basic \u2013 you only get simple treble and bass sliders; there aren\u2019t any pre-tuned settings for different kinds of music \u2013 but the LE01 is hardly in dire need of tuning.",
    "Different genres are given lots of clarity: we heard basslines, riffs and instruments in familiar pop, acoustic, jazz and classical songs that we just hadn\u2019t noticed before. The LE01 can happily hit high volumes without distortion, and there\u2019s a luscious depth in a warm soundstage that has plenty of brightness in the mids and highs."
