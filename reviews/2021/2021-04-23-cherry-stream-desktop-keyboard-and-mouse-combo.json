    "Looks aren\u2019t everything, and the Cherry Stream Desktop keyboard and mouse is proof. While most peripherals out there clamor for your attention with their modern design or flashy RGB lighting, this keyboard and mouse combo goes for the simple yet functional approach. As thus, it\u2019s incredibly easy to overlook.",
    "Give the Cherry Stream Desktop keyboard and mouse combo a chance, however, and it\u2019ll surprise you. Front and center is the keyboard, which boasts Cherry's SX scissor switch that simply elevates your typing experience. It might not be the most good-looking or the most compact keyboard out there, but it\u2019s fast, accurate presses and exquisite bounce and tactile feedback will make a convert out of anyone. That\u2019s without mentioning its unbelievably easy setup.",
    "As with most peripherals, these are hardly perfect accessories. In terms of connectivity options and mouse buttons, some tweaks could have been made on the drawing board. And, the mouse is never going to win the best mouse award. Still, the Cherry Stream Desktop keyboard and mouse combo is already pretty impressive as it is now, especially considering the price.",
    "At $63 (about \u00a345, AU$80), this peripheral set is incredibly cheap. It\u2019s not only much less than most of the best keyboards \u2013 or about the same price or slightly cheaper than many of the best wireless mice, but you\u2019re also getting two great devices in one. That\u2019s a bargain that most businesses and casual home users will appreciate.",
    "Sadly, it doesn\u2019t seem to be readily available in Australia at the time of writing. However, if you\u2019re in the US or UK, you\u2019ll find it on hand at most major retail stores online.",
    "When we say looks aren\u2019t everything to the Cherry Stream Desktop keyboard and mouse combo, we don\u2019t mean it\u2019s unattractive. More of the side of plain-looking, especially the black version, these peripherals remind us of those early keyboards in the 90s that are trying to keep up with the latest fads.",
    "That\u2019s especially true of the keyboard, which has thick borders that only add to its overall footprint. Luckily, while it does take up a lot of space on your desk, both this keyboard and the mouse on the thin side. Still, that doesn\u2019t make this combo travel friendly, which is a shame considering their wireless design.",
    "The setup is surprisingly simple \u2013 so simple we honestly thought at first we were doing something wrong. With just a plug-and-play setup, the Cherry Stream Desktop keyboard and mouse combo is a boon for offices with multiple computers and multiple users, as well as casual home users who aren\u2019t necessarily well-versed in technology.",
    "All you need to do is insert the batteries, plug the USB wireless receiver that connects both devices to your PC\u2019s USB 2.0 port, switch both on, and you\u2019re good to go. This is honestly incredibly refreshing. We spend a lot of time testing different peripherals loaded with features and a boatload of customizations, and reviewing one that\u2019s simple and straightforward feels like a nice and relaxing vacation.",
    "While it does come with the free Cherry Keys software, key and button remaps are limited and just enough for the typical general user. We only wish that it offered more than one connectivity option \u2013 having Bluetooth connectivity, for example, seems the standard of wireless keyboards at this point \u2013 and that it came with rechargeable batteries.",
    "If you like that setup, you\u2019ll love the feel of the keyboard\u2019s keys. Because it is a sizable keyboard, the keys are nice and big so your fingers won\u2019t feel cramped or claustrophobic. More importantly, each press feels like a dream. According to Cherry, its SX scissor technology is designed to make those switches precise and quiet, and the high quality really shows during use. Each press is not only very comfortable, but also extremely satisfying.",
    "There\u2019s also a shorter travel distance, which should help reduce fatigue when you\u2019re typing all day. It\u2019s still not the quietest keyboard we\u2019ve tested, but it\u2019s quiet enough to not disturb your closest co-workers if you\u2019re in a busy office.",
    "The mouse, as we mentioned earlier, could be better. It feels great in your hand, and it offers support for palm grippers with its curved palm rest. However, the buttons aren\u2019t satisfying enough to click. There\u2019s less travel there, which is nice, and they\u2019re really quiet.",
    "At the same time, the feedback is more of a thud rather than a click. That might bother some users who are used to that clicking feel. More to the point, there\u2019s a lot less resistance, making it more prone to accidental clicks. That\u2019s especially true of the rear side button, which has an unfortunate placement of being in the way of the thumb.",
    "The sad truth is that we\u2019ve accidentally clicked that button more times than we\u2019ve ever used the side buttons of all the productivity mice we\u2019ve ever tested. All those accidental presses have actually gotten in the way of our workflow.",
    "But that also shows just how responsive, fast, and accurate the Cherry Stream Desktop keyboard and mouse are. During our tests, we have not experienced any lags nor missed presses, even when we\u2019re in the zone and typing very fast. There is no mention of features like N-key rollover or anti-ghosting, but they don\u2019t seem necessary here with the keyboard performance. As far as the mouse, it has a DPI button that will let you cycle through 3 DPI settings: 1000, 1600, and 2400 \u2013 and they are more than enough for everyday tasks.",
    "We\u2019d probably use a different set of peripherals for gaming or creative tasks. But, as far as getting a whole lot of work done \u2013 whether you\u2019re typing up that term paper, penning long emails to friends and family, or writing reports for work, this is perhaps the ultimate keyboard-and-mouse combo."
