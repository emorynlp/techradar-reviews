Roku\u2019s main user interface isn\u2019t aging as gracefully as it should and it has some audio syncing issues, but for half the cost of an Apple TV 4K, the new Roku Ultra is a great value.",

    "In the war of the streaming devices, the Roku Ultra is an old veteran. It has taken on the likes of Apple, Amazon and Google with a flagship-level specs and a competitive price over the last five years (the original Ultra launched in 2016), and has since seen a number of software and hardware improvements while retaining that 'Ultra' namesake.",
    "Roku Ultra 2020 isn't exactly new, but it still offers great perks like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos streaming to the system \u2013 two major previously missing components for Hi-Fi enthusiasts like ourselves \u2013 while the latest software patch brings support for HBO Max, fully rounding out Roku\u2019s robust collection of streaming apps.",
    "Inside, the streaming set-top box has an improved Wi-Fi antenna for longer reach, and there\u2019s been some improvements to the overall responsiveness of the player \u2013 though, it doesn\u2019t feel miles ahead of older Roku models.",
    "While there are some better streaming devices out there \u2013 namely the Apple TV 4K and Chromecast with Google TV \u2013 the Roku Ultra has an incredibly competitive sticker price of $99.99.",
    "Ultimately, if you only have $100 set aside for a new streaming player and you want it to have access to nearly every major streaming service plus new formats Dolby Atmos/Vision and one of the best universal search functions anywhere, the Roku Ultra is a phenomenal value.",
    "The newest Roku Ultra came out at the tail-end of 2020 for $99.99 (around \u00a370, AU$130 \u2013 though it\u2019s not available in either territory), and will be available throughout 2021 in the US until Roku inevitably announces its new slate of streaming devices toward the end of year.",
    "So where does the Roku Ultra sit in Roku\u2019s streaming player lineup? Well, currently it\u2019s the top player, both in terms of performance and price \u2013 unless, of course, you count the new Roku Streambar and Roku Smart Soundbar that build a Roku streaming device into a two-channel soundbar.",
    "Underneath the Roku Ultra are the Roku Premiere, Roku Streaming Stick+ and Roku Express. So what's the difference between them all? The Premiere and Streaming Stick+ both do 4K HDR streaming \u2013 but don\u2019t use Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos \u2013 while the Express and SE only stream in HD.",
    "Design-wise, the Roku Ultra is a flat streaming video box that inconspicuously blends in with all your other AV equipment. At just a few inches wide by a few inches deep it\u2019s obviously much smaller than, say, a Blu-ray player, and closer in size to the actual Blu-ray itself.",
    "The outside of the box doesn\u2019t have much going on. There\u2019s an IR receiver on the front, a remote finder on the right side, plus the distinctive purple Roku tag on the left side. Otherwise, there\u2019s nothing else there that calls attention to itself.",
    "Spin it around to the back and you\u2019ll find an HDCP 2.2 HDMI 2.0a port for video out \u2013 plus an ethernet port that we\u2019ve already talked about \u2013 as well the power connector. This model doesn\u2019t have the MicroSD card slot that can be used to store additional channels, however it does a USB port located on the back of the player that could be used as a connector for a USB drive like last year\u2019s model. Losing the MicroSD slot is a bummer, but it's not exactly a deal-breaker.",
    "The Roku Ultra specs include a quad-core processor and 802.11ac dual-band wireless antenna that, according to Roku, helps expand the range of the player by twice the distance. What sets the Ultra apart from other models in Roku\u2019s lineup is that it comes with the voice remote with two programmable buttons that can be set for any button sequence.",
    "Probably the coolest feature about the remote is that it has a 3.5mm auxiliary jack on the side of it that allows you to connect a pair of headphones for private listening. This is a hugely handy feature when the family goes to bed and you don\u2019t want to wake them up, and it\u2019s something that very few other streaming devices have.",
    "In previous years, we had real concerns about how hot the player got while it was in use, but we haven't had any issues with that with this year's model. That said, we wouldn't place it on top of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X for fear that the two combined would produce too much heat, but otherwise it should be fine.",
    "Lastly, thanks to the use of HDMI-CEC, the remote can be used to turn on and off your TV, and control the volume. This is a nice touch, especially for cord-cutters who can then safely put away the TV remote and will even work with an external soundbar if you connect it via ARC or eARC to your TV.",
    "If there\u2019s a more fully featured app store on a set-top box, we\u2019d like to see it. Roku may not have literally everything, but this is as close as it\u2019s going to get. Roku boasts more than 4,500 channels ranging from the streaming mainstays, like Netflix, HBO and Vudu, to the obscure \u2013 there's actually a station called \"The Fireworks Channel\" \u2013 so finding something to watch is rarely a problem.",
    "For US viewers, all the big names are here: Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney Plus, Apple TV, Peacock, YouTube, Crunchyroll, Plex and Pandora and Spotify. You can rent and buy individual movies and TV through Vudu and Fandango, the latter of which is the de facto rental service on the streamer.",
    "The newest addition to Roku\u2019s channel lineup is HBO Max, which finally made its appearance after a lengthy contract negotiation process. To download the app, go into the 'Featured' section of the channel store or search for 'HBO Max' through the Roku voice remote or Roku app on your mobile device. Once it\u2019s downloaded, follow the on-screen directions to log in through your provider or enter your username and password.",
    "Cord cutters who live in the US will also have access to Sling TV and YouTube TV, plus The Roku Channel, which offers its own selection of TV shows and movies. If you ever struggle to find something to watch, there\u2019s the Featured Free section of the homepage that shows you what's available for free on the different services. These are invaluable resources for cord-cutters, and a great alternative to channel surfing for folks who still have a box.",
    "What\u2019s missing here, however, is a competent, built-in smart assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant. What Roku does offer is its new Roku Assistant, which can understand and answer basic queries like \u2018what time is it?\u2019 or \u2018what\u2019s today\u2019s date?\u2019 but can\u2019t interact with your smart home or any of your smart gadgets in a meaningful way. Both the Amazon Fire TV Cube and Nvidia Shield come with Alexa and Google Assistant, respectively, so for both to be missing here on Roku\u2019s high-end player feels like another misstep.",
    "Where we\u2019re willing to give Roku some credit, though, is for its integration with Amazon and Google smart devices. While Roku can\u2019t control either platform, both platforms can be used to control your Roku \u2013 which is handy if you don\u2019t want to walk over and grab the remote. (Though, admittedly, we often just opt to use Roku\u2019s mobile app in that case.)",
    "In terms of additional codecs, the Roku Ultra supports H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, VP9 video codecs and AAC, MP3, WMA, FLAC, PCM, AC3/EAC3, DTS, ALAC audio codecs. That\u2019s not an exhaustive list of everything out there, obviously, but the most popular codecs are all present and accounted for.",
    "The Roku Ultra also supports screen casting \u2013 not a codec per se, but definitely a useful feature when you have a roomful of friends who all want to share their favorite YouTube clip \u2013 as well as HomeKit and AirPlay 2 support.",
    "While you could save yourself some money by picking up the more affordable Roku Streaming Stick+ or Roku Premiere \u2013 both of which stream in 4K HDR \u2013 only the new Roku Ultra is capable of streaming in Dolby Vision and passing along Dolby Atmos audio... well, sometimes.",
    "Support for Dolby Vision streaming on apps like Netflix requires you to have a 4K TV that supports Dolby Vision, obviously, but also has HDCP 2.2 with HDR10 at 60 frames per second as well. If you don\u2019t have it, Netflix defaults to standard HDR10 instead of Dolby Vision\u2026 which defeats the whole purpose of getting a Roku Ultra.",
    "If you have a capable TV, that\u2019s not a problem, but as it stands only a few 4K TVs support Dolby Vision (all Samsung TVs do not, for example) and any ones made before 2017 might not be capable of HDR10 at 60 frames per second. Be sure to check before you plunk down.",
    "That said, even if you are stuck with HDR10 instead of Dolby Vision, it\u2019s not the worst picture in the world \u2013 it\u2019s much better than 4K without HDR, and miles ahead of standard 1080p streaming. Watching 4K HDR video means getting more details in the picture with better contrast and better color saturation. It really brings an added layer of visual flair to nature documentaries like Our Planet on Netflix and some reach panache to movies like Ready Player One.",
    "Of course, not everything is going to be available in 4K HDR, especially when you leave the confines of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Thankfully, though, even when shows and movies didn\u2019t stream in 4K, they still looked fine. HD/SDR content looked slightly subdued in terms of color and contrast but still relatively crisp in terms of resolution.",
    "Admittedly, the Roku Ultra doesn\u2019t do much in the way of upscaling in the same way that an Apple TV or the Nvidia Shield TV do, but it doesn\u2019t make content look any worse either. But that means if you\u2019re looking for real high-end upscaling, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.",
    "The other issue we noticed, and it only popped up a few times, was that the Roku Ultra did introduce some audio glitches occasionally. We noticed it when we were streaming Mulan on Disney Plus and then again while watching Rick and Morty Season 4 on HBO Max on a separate TV. This is a problem some users have been complaining about for years on Roku\u2019s forums, but until now we\u2019ve never had a problem with it. Regardless, these problems are worth reporting for your awareness, if nothing else.",
    "To end on a positive note, general browsing speed \u2013 like the time it takes to jump from one app to another, or to start a TV show or movie \u2013 was surprisingly speedy. We were able to get Netflix to start faster on the Roku Ultra than on our 2020 Vizio smart TV, which was a pleasant surprise, and we never once had the player stop to buffer. The last part will largely depend on your internet speeds and distance between the player and your wireless router, but in our testing conditions we never had a problem."
