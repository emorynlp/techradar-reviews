    "Jimbo\u2019s website builder service is targeted largely at the novice user, marketing itself on simplicity rather than features. For example, the Jimdo website entices you with statements like \u201cEffortlessly create your professional website or store with the website builder made for the self-employed.\u201d There\u2019s certainly nothing intimidating sounding there.",
    "The Jimdo range starts with its free plan, \u2018Play\u2019. This has some notable limits, including 500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth, 5 pages, Jimdo branding, no possibility of using your own domain name, and no customer support.",
    "But it's not all bad news. You also get HTTPS access, contact forms, and access to an image library. It\u2019s all pretty basic, but it\u2019s also all free.",
    "The \u2018Start\u2019 account drops the branding, and lifts your storage allowance to 5GB, bandwidth to 10GB, and lets you create up to 10 pages. There's a free domain, more SEO and site management tools, customer support. It's currently priced at $9 (\u00a39) a month (billed annually).",
    "\u2018Grow' raises your allowance to 15GB for storage, 20GB for bandwidth, and 50 pages, with faster customer support, all for $15 (\u00a315) per month.",
    "\u2018Grow Legal\u2019 includes a \u2018Legal Text Generator\u2019, which makes personalised legal text, compliant with the usual regulations, including GDPR, for $20 (\u00a320) per month. Finally, we have \u2018Unlimited\u2019. As the name states, there is no limit with this one: unlimited storage, bandwidth, or pages - but you\u2019ll need to fork out $39 (\u00a339) a month to enjoy it.",
    "If you\u2019re interested in e-commerce, you\u2019ll need to switch to the \u2018Online Store\u2019 plans. These are Basic, Business and VIP for $15 (\u00a315), $19 (\u00a319) and $39 (\u00a339) a month respectively.",
    "As above, the more you pay, the more features you gain access to, like Product Variants for Business, or Unlimited Storage and Business Listing for VIP.",
    "Once you\u2019ve signed up, you\u2019re asked your level of expertise: do you need to design a site but have no experience, or are you a coding expert? We chose the former, as most customers are likely to go down that road. You\u2019re then asked a series of questions: is the site you\u2019re creating for you or for a team or organisation, is your website for your personal use, a hobby, a business, that kind of thing (you can skip it all if you prefer).",
    "Next, you get to choose your style (from a choice of 6), a shade of colour to complement it, and you\u2019re offered a couple of templates to choose from to get you started.",
    "If you\u2019re used to website builders, you\u2019ll feel right at home with Jimdo as the process is remarkably similar: you build your pages by adding, removing and reordering blocks. These are broken down into categories, and each category offers a series of templates for you to choose from. To reposition the blocks you already have, click on the \u2018\u2026\u2019 button in the sidebar where the relevant tools are located.",
    "Editing the content of each block is done by clicking on the section you wish to change. If it\u2019s text, you\u2019re offered basic formatting tools, like alignment, bold, underline, changing the heading, turning selected text into a list, or adding a hyperlink. We did say it was basic. If you want to change the default fonts, that option can be found in the \u2018Design\u2019 menu, top left of the page.",
    "Jimdo\u2019s media capabilities feel slim compared to big names like Wix and Weebly. There are two different blocks you can use to populate your page: Image or Slideshow.",
    "The Image block offers you various templates you can use to add photos on your site, either a single image, or rows and columns of differing dimensions.",
    "Your options are pretty limited: click a placeholder image for instance, and you can zoom in or out of it, dragging the image to select the segment you wish. You\u2019ve also got six filters should you wish to apply one of them, and that\u2019s pretty much it for editing. You do have the ability to turn any image into a hyperlink should you wish, but that\u2019s about the extent of your abilities.",
    "Changing those placeholder images is pretty easy: click on its image icon to gain access to your Image Library. You can find all the ones currently used on your site, have the option to upload additional ones, or link to your Facebook or Google Place accounts to grab them from there instead.",
    "If you\u2019re on the lookout for stock images, Jimdo offers you some, but the way the system operates feels overly complicated: you\u2019re given ten categories, and have to browse through them manually without even the benefit of a search field. But the fun doesn\u2019t stop there: once you\u2019ve selected one, you can either add it to your site, or you\u2019re taken to Unsplash to get it from there. Sometimes, you get a 404 (image not found) which is always fun. The advantage of being taken to Unsplash is finally getting a search field, but you then have to download the image to your computer and upload it from there back to Jimdo. It feels incredibly convoluted. Worse still, sometimes clicking on the same image either takes you to Unsplash or just allows you to select it and add it straight to your page, and there\u2019s no way of knowing what will happen when.",
    "There isn\u2019t a video player per se, but the images inside a slideshow or gallery can be replaced with a video link from either YouTube or Vimeo. And yes, your slideshow can be filled with video after video.",
    "Everything you need to create your online store can be found in the \u2018Store\u2019 menu, top left of the web page. This is where you can fill in your business details (address, contact info, etc), set up PayPal or Stripe business accounts, and build your product inventory. It\u2019s all very simple and straightforward.",
    "There doesn\u2019t appear to be a way to import a whole list of items (via a CSV file or similar), so you\u2019ll need to add them all one at a time. We also couldn\u2019t find a way to sell digital goods which was disappointing.",
    "If you feel lost in your website building endeavours, Jimdo\u2019s \u2018Help\u2019 menu is always there to provide answers. Click on it to be taken to the Help Centre where you can browse through one of nine categories, or use the search field at the top to narrow down your search. There aren\u2019t that many articles, and everything feels pretty basic, but at least if an article is found, it\u2019s clear and easy to understand.",
    "imdo offers a simple interface to help you create an online presence quickly and easily. There aren\u2019t that many options, but in a way that\u2019s what makes it easy to use. If you can accept such limitations, it\u2019s worth checking it out.",
