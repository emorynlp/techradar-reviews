  "summary": "Dyson's latest cordless stick is large and in charge",
  "verdict": "Aiming to prove that bigger is better, Dyson's V11 Outsize carries across all the technological advancements offered by its normal-sized V11 and V11 Absolute siblings, only with a much larger bin and a wider cleaning head to cover more ground in bigger households. That said, it's significantly heavier than the normal V11, and its higher price point may lead people to choose the regular V11 instead.",

    "Covers more ground",
    "Much larger bin",
    "Helpful LCD screen",
    "Removable battery"

    "The Dyson V11 Outsize goes one step further than the Dyson V11 Absolute, which reached near perfection with its powerful suction, by adding a larger dust bin and a wider cleaning head to reduce the number of interruptions to your dust-busting session. Simply put, the V11 is huge, and best suited to large homes.",
    "Dyson's V11 range already offers some substantial advancements over its predecessor, the Dyson Cyclone V10 range, including increased battery life, 20% more suction power - that\u2019s an incredible 185AW (Air Watts) - and a handy rear-mounted LCD display that lets you cycle through modes and see exactly how much vacuuming time you have left. Now you also get a cleaning head that covers 25% more of the floor and a super-sized dust bin with a capacity 0f 1.9-liters.",
    "Like all other Dyson V11 cordless vacuum cleaners, the Dyson V11 Outsize also has a High Torque cleaner head, which when the vacuum is used on Auto mode can detect different types of surface and adjust the suction power accordingly. As a result, in testing, we found the vacuum effortlessly glides across different floor types without needing the head to be changed.",
    "Initially, the Dyson V11 Outsize was only available in the US and Australia, but it\u2019s since been launched in the UK as well. However, at $799.99 / \u00a3649.99 / AU$1,299.99 it\u2019s the most expensive cordless vacuum Dyson sells. So, while bigger is undeniably often better when it comes to tech products \u2013 few people would turn down a mammoth-sized television, for instance \u2013 with numerous options already available in the V11 range, it's important to make sure that the bigger, and crucially more expensive Dyson V11 Outsize is actually necessary for your home.",
    "It will probably come as no surprise that Dyson's V11 Outsize is more expensive than the regular-sized V11 model. Thankfully, the jump in price between models isn't as big as the Outsize itself.",
    "The Dyson V11 Outsize is priced at $799.99 / \u00a3649.99 / AU$ 1,299.99, which is $100 / \u00a349.99 / AU$100 more than the V11 Absolute or V11 Torque Drive as it\u2019s known in the US.",
    "In the UK and Australia, the Dyson V11 Outsize comes with two cleaner heads and five tools, as well as a wall-mountable dock and charger. In the US, however, the V11 Outsize only has one cleaning head, but it does have two swappable batteries.",
    "In the US there\u2019s also the option of the V11 Outsize Origin, which is cheaper at $729.99, but has one less battery and one accessory (no room for you, wand storage clip). In Australia, the Dyson V11 Outsize Pro is also available for AU$1,349.99 and has two swappable batteries along with three extra tools and a gold-colored tube and trimmings.",
    "It\u2019s also possible to purchase an additional battery for the vacuum cleaner for $149.99 / \u00a385 / AU$199.99.",
    "With the Dyson V11 Outsize inheriting all of the standard V11's technological features, the main point of difference is in its design. More specifically, its weight, size and the inclusion of a handy new design choice which allows you to extend the Outsize's battery life.",
    "You'll still get a 20% increase in suction over the V10 series, along with a battery that will last up to 60 minutes on its lowest setting despite the aforementioned suction surge.",
    "Once again, Dyson has employed 'Radial Cyclone' technology, with an array of 18 cyclones which are said to generate forces up to 79,000g of suction in order to collect dirt. Meanwhile, the standard V11's six-layer filtration system also returns, with Dyson claiming that it's able to trap \"99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns\" in its detachable filter, though we'll have to take its word on that.",
    "And, as mentioned earlier, the Outsize has the ability to detach its battery, allowing the user to swap it out for a spare via a one button click-in system at the base of its handle. Of course, additional batteries are sold separately.",
    "The Dyson V11 Outsize still offers the choice of three power settings, which can be accessed from a single mode button on the device's rear. Eco, as the name implies, offers the longest battery life and the lowest amount of suction (which is still fairly strong, all things considered), while Boost offers the highest amount of suction but will empty the battery super quick.",
    "Nestled between the two is the Medium / Auto setting, which offers a perfect middle-ground of sucking power and longevity. So why the distinction between Medium and Auto? That all depends on which cleaning tool is attached, but more on that later.",
    "Each of the modes can be cycled through using the button on the V11 Outsize's rear-mounted display, which also provides real-time information on how much battery is left along with intelligent reports on blockages and other things you need to know, such as when the filter needs cleaning.",
    "Of course, the V11 Outsize's main selling point is obviously its increased capacity, providing a much bigger bin that can hold significantly more dirt than the standard V11, making it a more attractive prospect for those with larger homes.",
    "But how much bigger is the V11 Outsize really? If you know Dyson, you know the company doesn't do anything by half measures, which is why the V11 Outsize has seen a whopping 150% increase in bin size, bringing its total volume up from 0.76 liters to 1.9 liters.",
    "Of course, with an increase in size comes an increase in weight, and make no mistake \u2013 the Dyson V11 Outsize is a hefty boy indeed. That said, the added weight isn't quite as drastic as you might think.",
    "At 3.56kg (sans attachments), the V11 Outsize is only 470 grams heavier than the standard V11, though admittedly you will feel that added heft when holding the vacuum up above your head for those hard-to-reach areas.",
    "The V11's bin isn't the only part of the package that's been upsized \u2013 Dyson's V11 Outsize comes with a new High Torque XL cleaner head that's 25% wider than the standard High Torque version that comes with other V11 models.",
    "As the tool is motorized, plugging it in on the Medium setting will switch it to Auto mode, allowing the V11 Outsize to automatically adjust its power depending on the type of surface it's being used on.",
    "Also included in the box is the standard fluffy head cleaner, a combination tool, a crevice tool, a mini motorized tool, a soft dusting brush, and a stubborn dirt brush, along with a drop-in dock, which can be wall-mounted.",
    "Emptying the V11 Outsize is simple, and hasn't really changed since the last major redesign on the Cyclone V10 series. A forward-facing bin door means you simply have to remove any tubes or attachments from the main unit, point the V11 Outsize at your chosen garbage receptacle, then push the lever on the device's underside down to empty your collected dirt.",
    "Just like the other V11 models before it, the Outsize is a dream to use. Despite the extra power afforded by the V11 Outsize's supercharged Hyperdymium motor (which is able to spin at up to 125,000 revolutions per minute) the vacuum itself feels totally under control at all times, with a pleasing hum that only really gets loud on the highest Boost setting.",
    "As we alluded to earlier, the Dyson V11 Outsize is heavier than all other Dyson handsticks that have come before it. For general use (i.e. vacuuming the floor), this won't be much of a problem, as the attached tube and cleaning head help offset and balance the unit's weight.",
    "However, you will likely feel a fair bit of strain whenever you don't have something to rest on \u2013 especially if you have to aim the vacuum towards those up high corners of your home.",
    "Switching between modes, there's a clear difference between each one in terms of battery life, with the LCD screen offering accurate information with regards to how much vacuum time we had left \u2013 the one exception being the Auto setting, with its battery life entirely dependant on the varying surfaces in your home, whether they involve hard wood floors, tiles, concrete or carpet.",
    "During our tests, we found that all three settings were able to pick up whatever we threw in front of the V11 Outsize. This includes TechRadar's usual go-tos of oats and talcum powder, along with generous amounts of pet hair, which our house cats were happy to donate solely for the purposes of this test (at least that's what we're telling ourselves).",
    "We're just going to come right out and say it: we absolutely love the High Torque XL cleaner head. Not only does its added width allow you to cover more ground in less time, its articulated head also means it will keep rolling forward, no matter which angle you're pushing it from.",
    "This gives the Dyson V11 Outsize an incredible amount of maneuverability, making it quite easy to roll the vacuum under sofas, tables, beds and other areas which are usually tough to access.",
    "Seriously, the High Torque XL's swivel joint means you can practically lie the entire V11 Outsize right down on its side and still keep vacuuming without any problems (see the image below for proof).",
    "Of course, the High Torque XL cleaner is just one of several attachments that are included with the V11 Outsize, many of which will be familiar to anyone who has used a Dyson vacuum in the last few years.",
    "As mentioned earlier, the Outsize also comes with a number of additional tools for crevices, dusting, brushing and the removal of stubborn dirt.",
    "The mini motorized tool is particularly useful for vacuuming furniture, such as chairs and sofas, and is ideal for use on stairs where full-sized cleaning heads might be too big and unwieldy. Removing the tube and attaching the mini motorized tool directly to the V11's cylinder makes it perfectly suited to the vacuuming of car interiors, too.",
    "That said, the V11 Outsize's larger bin does make it somewhat unwieldy to use in handheld mode \u2013 especially when smaller attachments are connected directly to its massive barrel. Used in this way, it quickly becomes evident that the larger Outsize will have a harder time fitting in tighter spaces, like a car's floor section, for instance.",
    "With that in mind, it's worth noting that while the V11 Outsize is undoubtedly great for wide open areas in your home, that improved floor-cleaning capability does come at the cost of handheld maneuverability.",
    "Dyson claims the battery will last up to 60 minutes on Eco mode, and during testing we managed 58 minutes from a full charge in Eco mode. However when using Boost Mode, a full charge only lasted 19 minutes during testing. The runtime on Auto mode fluctuates depending upon the type of floors you\u2019re cleaning and how much suction power the vacuum requires. The Dyson V11 outsize has a swappable battery, so if you do find one full charge isn\u2019t enough consider purchasing an additional battery for $149.99 / \u00a385 / AU$199.99, although in the US and Australia the Dyson V11 Outsize is available in an option that includes two batteries. We found the battery took around four and a half to recharge using the bundled charger."
