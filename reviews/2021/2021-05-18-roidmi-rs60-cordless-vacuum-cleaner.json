  "verdict": "The Roidmi RS60 is a powerful cordless vacuum cleaner that can mop hard floors at the same time as sucking up dust and debris. It\u2019s compact and lightweight and can be converted into a handheld cleaner too, but despite its hefty price tag we were disappointed by the battery life, as you\u2019ll only get 10 minutes of cleaning on the highest power level.",

    "Roidmi is a relative newcomer to the floorcare market, having been founded in China in 2015, and thanks to investment from smartphone brand Xiaomi, it\u2019s fast becoming a rival to the big hitters such as Dyson and Miele by offering robot vacuums and some of the best cordless vacuums, with high-end specs at more affordable price points.",
    "According to Roidmi the RS60, which is its latest cordless vacuum cleaner, offers 65% more suction power than its previous top-of-the-range cleaner, the Roidmi S1E (although that doesn\u2019t have a mopping function), and has a 50W brushless motor that\u2019s more energy-efficient than those in previous models. As well as an arsenal of attachments, including an electric mattress brush and an extension hose, the vacuum cleaner also comes with a clip-on mopping attachment complete with a small water tank, enabling you to vacuum and wash hard floors at the same time.",
    "Like many of the best vacuum cleaners, the Roidmi RS60 has three levels of suction power, although you\u2019ll have to manually switch between these, unlike on some rivals which automatically adjust the power level to suit the type of floor you\u2019re cleaning. The roller on the cleaning head also has a new V-shaped design, which Roidmi claims improves dust pick-up by 30% and helps to prevent hair from getting tangled around it. The RS60 uses an antibacterial sterilizing system, along with six levels of filtration, to help eliminate bacteria in your home, and Roidmi says the battery will last up to 70 minutes between charges, depending on the power settings used.",
    "Compared to Roidmi\u2019s other vacuums, the RS60 is expensive, priced at $661 / \u00a3579 / AU$966 \u2013 so is the wet and dry function really that invaluable, and worth the extra money? We put it to the test to find out.",
    "The Roidmi RS60 cordless vacuum cleaner is priced at $661 / \u00a3579 / AU$966, and is available worldwide from Harrods. In the UK it\u2019s also available through Amazon, and from Rodimi\u2019s own website.",
    "The RS60 is Roidmi\u2019s top-of-the-range model, but it also offers a more affordable version, called the RS40. However, its battery life isn\u2019t as long, and its suction isn\u2019t as powerful, which is reflected in its lower price of $540 / \u00a3449 / AU$790.",
    "The Roidmi RS60 is a compact and lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner that can wash as well as suck up dust when used on hard floors. Measuring 46.9 x 10.2 x 6.5 inches / 119.1 x 25.9 x 16.4cm (h x w x d), it\u2019s one of the more compact cordless vacuums we\u2019ve tested. It weighs 6lb / 2.7kg, making it one of the lighter cordless vacuums on the market too.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, the RS60 has three power levels, which you can switch between using the button closest to the top of the vacuum\u2019s handle, while the power button sits on the front of the handle. There\u2019s also a 0.4-inch / 4cm color OLED screen that shows which power setting has been selected, the remaining battery, and \u2013 if you need some motivation to do the housework \u2013 the number of calories you\u2019ve burned during a cleaning session.",
    "The Roidmi RS60 has a magnetic add-on to its main cleaning head that can be used for mopping, with a 5 fl oz / 150ml water tank within the attachment, and the dust canister has a 0.12-gallon / 0.55-liter capacity, which Roidmi says is 35% larger than the ones on its previous cordless vacuum cleaners.",
    "Like many of its rivals, you can convert RS60 into a handheld vacuum by detaching the canister from the main wand and cleaning head and attaching one of the many tools, which include an extension hose, a crevice tool, a pet hair attachment and even an electronic mattress brush, to the bottom of the canister.",
    "We\u2019ve mentioned that the battery lasts up to 70 minutes between charges, but that\u2019s on the lowest power setting; if the cleaner is used on the most powerful setting the battery life drops to just 10 minutes. The RS60 comes with a wall charger to make powering-up the vacuum easier.",
    "When it comes to suction power, the Roidmi RS60 easily rivaled cleaners from the likes of Dyson and Miele in our tests, hoovering up fine dust, biscuit crumbs and cereal in seconds on the most powerful setting. It glided easily on both carpets and hard floors, and we found it simple to boost or reduce the suction power using the button on the handle. Meanwhile, the OLED display offered a handy color-coded indicator, making it easy to see which level we were using, along with the battery level as a percentage, although we\u2019d also have liked to see the remaining run-time in minutes, as on the rival Dyson V11 Absolute.",
    "The RS60 was also good for giving floors a quick mop, although as there\u2019s no scrubbing action it unsurprisingly struggled to remove embedded stains.",
    "When the mopping attachment is placed close to the back of the cleaning head it quickly snaps into place and is ready to mop. We were impressed that the mopping pads could simply be pressed onto the attachment, and stayed in place during our mopping session, but we did find the water tank a little fiddly to fill. The mopping pads can also be put in the washing machine after each use to keep them clean.",
    "The RS60 is a little fiddly to empty, as the wand and attachments need to be removed and the canister disconnected from the handle and main unit. However, once this has been done, a single button press opens the canister and ejects the dirt.",
    "Converting the vacuum into handheld mode and back again was simple, thanks to the click-in design of the various components, although in handheld mode we found it too heavy to hold for a long time when cleaning up high. We also found that it was fiddly to insert the charging cable into the top of the vacuum, but using the wall charger made it much easier to juice the vacuum when it was running low.",
    "While the vacuum was pleasingly quiet when used on lower power settings, averaging around 72db, when we switched to the most powerful setting our decibel meter hit 81db, which is similar to a truck traveling down the road at 40mph, making it one of the loudest cordless vacuums we\u2019ve tested.",
    "As we\u2019ve mentioned, Roidmi claims the battery will last up to 70 minutes on the lowest power setting, and in our testing we managed 67 minutes before the vacuum needed recharging. It took around 2.5 hours to fully recharge the battery using the bundled battery charger.",
    "As well as a charging cable, the cordless vacuum comes with a magnetic wall charger that enables it to be wirelessly charged, and helpfully this has an adhesive pad on the back, so there\u2019s no need for drilling and screwing to install it.",
