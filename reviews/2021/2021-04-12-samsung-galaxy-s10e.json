  "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy S10e is still one of the best affordable flagships",
  "verdict": "The 'e' in Samsung Galaxy S10e stands for 'essential', which means it packs almost everything the S10 and S10 Plus have, at a lower price. You get a 5.8-inch screen, the same two primary cameras, and all-day battery life, but you\u2019ll miss out on a third lens, the curved display edges, and the in-screen fingerprint sensor. That's the tempting compromise offered by Samsung's 'budget flagship' and answer to Apple's iPhone XR.",
  "pros": [
    "Fast phone you can use one-handed",
    "Superb camera for the size and price",
    "Wireless PowerShare is useful"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Dual-camera compromise",
    "No in-screen fingerprint scanner",
    "Noticeably thicker than the S10"

    "The Samsung Galaxy S10e was the company's flagship phone with 2019 specs and features at 2016 prices, giving consumers the opportunity to nab top features form the Galaxy S10 at a solid discount.",
    "The handset is no longer one of Samsung's newest smartphones, as it has been succeeded by two generations of flagship phones. While the newest Galaxy S21 lineup doesn't include an affordable 'Lite' phone equivalent, the Galaxy S20 Fan Edition released later in 2020 fills that role for an update on the S10e. We'll leave our reviews for the main S21 phones here to compare specs.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 has also been released, but if you want the absolute top-tier stylus handset, you'll want to go with the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. We didn't receive another budget flagship in the Note 20 line, so the S10e's biggest competition is the aforementioned S20 Fan Edition \u2013 though its larger sizes mean the S10e remains the affordable pick in a smaller form factor.",
    "In such a way, the S10e (\u2018e\u2019 for \u2018essential\u2019) has plenty in common with the Apple iPhone 12 mini, and it\u2019s easy to see it as the Samsung budget flagship for its line: both pack the standout perks of their generation while shaving off a few extras present in their costlier siblings. While Apple's new compact flagship has better specs and 5G connectivity, the S10e is still a cheaper option.",
    "But you probably won't be picking between either less-expensive device - you'll be eyeballing those handsets compared to their costlier siblings. We found the S10e to a robust phone that's worth forgoing the extra perks in the S10 (which is $150/\u00a3113/AU$210 more) or the S10 Plus ($250/\u00a3189/AU$350 more). As a bonus, the S10e\u2019s smaller dimensions will certainly appeal to folks who don't appreciate the increasing size of flagship phones.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S10e may pale in comparison to the company's later flagships, but if you're looking for a useful 2019 smartphone that's still better than its contemporary Galaxy A phones, you're in luck.",
    "Naturally, there are compromises for that lower cost. The S10e doesn\u2019t get some of some of the neat features packed in its pricier siblings, like an in-screen fingerprint sensor, curved screen sides or a telephoto lens. These perks have indeed appeared in more handsets in 2019, like the Huawei P30 and OnePlus 7 Pro, so it\u2019ll be curious to see if their exclusion gives you flagship phone envy.",
    "But we doubt you\u2019ll be too jealous. The Galaxy S10e is a one-hand-friendly phone with outstanding specs to match - a combo that will endear the handset to you. Its 5.8-inch all-screen display is easy to hold and its chipset is fast enough that it\u2019ll compete with other flagships for years to come, even if its compromises in display resolution and camera fall short of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus.",
    "The Samsung Galaxy S10e came out on March 8, 2019 in the US, Canada, Europe, India, China, and other select countries. It\u2019ll roll out to a total of 130 markets by the end of March, though the company hasn\u2019t specified exactly which countries it\u2019ll be available in by then.",
    "Now that the S20 line has launched, the Galaxy S10e has a discounted pricetag of $599 / \u00a3499 / AU$1,199 / AED 2,699 for the 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage version, and that price goes even lower during deals seasons.",
    "If you want the slightly more powerful 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, at this point, it seems like it\u2019s only available on the US Samsung online store, and you\u2019ll pay $699 (prices aren\u2019t available outside the US) for it. It\u2019s unclear if this means the higher-priced model isn\u2019t available in other regions.",
    "As previously stated, one of the Galaxy S10e\u2019s more attractive features might, ironically, be its smaller size. As main flagships get ever-larger, a contingent of consumers have steadily gone for smaller phones \u2013 just look at the popularity of the iPhone SE (RIP) - and the S10e is as manageable as top-tier phones get with a width of 2.75 inches. (Curiously, the iPhone XS is the smallest of its generation, and the S10e is smaller than that phone by a hair.)",
    "The S10e otherwise looks like a shrunken version of its pricier siblings, with a few exceptions. Samsung didn\u2019t include the Galaxy line\u2019s Infinity Edge tapered display in this less expensive model, so you\u2019ll have to accept a flat front screen with more noticeable bezels. As it\u2019s the smallest of the S10 line, the S10e is also the lightest, coming in at 150g - which is another feather in its cap when compared to the 208g iPhone XR.",
    "While the S10e doesn\u2019t have its pricier siblings\u2019 fancy in-screen fingerprint scanner, Samsung didn\u2019t leave a biometric fingerprint pad on the back, opting instead to put a small capacitive sensor within an enlarged power button on the top-right side. It\u2019s surprisingly responsive, though it works far better with thumbs. Why? Because you have to cover the whole sensor with your digit, and mashing your fingertip flat enough to envelop the button is tough from any angle. Just use a thumb.",
    "Otherwise, the phone looks flagship, with a chromed aluminum case sandwiched by attractive glass and the elegant rounded corners we\u2019ve come to love in the Galaxy S line. The rear has a narrower camera bump than its pricier siblings due to the lack of a third camera and the absence of a heartbeat sensor (which might be an admission that folks weren\u2019t using it much anyway).",
    "The phone officially comes in six colors, though only four are available in the US: Prism Black, The pearlescent Prism White, shimmering Prism Blue, and the new punchy pastel Flamingo Pink. Sadly, Prism Green and Canary Yellow are restricted to other regions.",
    "The S10e\u2019s left edge has the volume rocker, which is responsive and functional. Below it sits the much-disliked Bixby button, but fear not: Samsung has gamely allowed you to finally use it to activate other apps. There is a caveat: the button functionality has been split into single and double presses, and one of those must activate Bixby.",
    "Luckily, it\u2019s easy to cordons Bixby to double-press and set single-press to whatever your heart desires. Considering how much Samsung has fought to keep third-party apps from remapping Bixby out of the picture, we\u2019ll take this compromise.",
    "On the bottom edge, you\u2019ll find a center-mounted USB-C port, microphone port, speaker grille and...a 3.5mm headphone jack. Samsung has kept its trash-talking high ground.",
    "The 5.8-inch AMOLED display lives up to the Galaxy S name, with bright colors and crisp detail. If you don\u2019t quite like the color balance, you can tinker with an easy fix called Vivid Mode, which does what it says on the box and lets you further tweak it to be a warmer (more red) or cooler (more blue) picture. If even that isn\u2019t enough, you can tinker with the RGB levels individually.",
    "Side-by-side with an iPhone XS Max, the S10e\u2019s screen kept up gamely, losing out only on the darkest scenes in a media comparison (the \u2018Blackwater\u2019 episode of Game of Thrones is good fodder for this. Just saying), where backgrounds of varying blacks average out into dark gray smudges.",
    "This is somewhat expected, as the S10e has a single 2280 x 1080 (438 ppi) resolution setting. Samsung sets this as the default for its flagship phones, but both the S10 and S10 Plus max out at 3040 x 1440 for a higher ~550 ppi. One other minor difference between the models: the S10e has Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back, while its bigger siblings have had their front display\u2019s glass upgraded to Gorilla 6.",
    "What the whole S10 line has in common, however, is the punch-hole in the top-right corner of the screen, the source of the Samsung-termed \u2018Infinity-O\u2019 display. It\u2019s noticeable, like the notches before it, though far less an eyesore than the wider camera tabs found in the likes of the iPhone XS and XS Max.",
    "In some ways, dropping the hole within the display looks more attractive than tucking it into a corner, as the eye naturally gravitates toward the uninterrupted borders of the lit screen rather than the circular cutout. But it also feels like Samsung\u2019s flexing its design and manufacturing chops here rather than offering a dynamic solution to the front-facing camera issue. Whether you like it or not will probably come down to personal taste \u2013 we like it, but wouldn\u2019t hold it against you to dismiss the punch-hole as a stopgap stunt.",
    "In any case, most media apps will automatically black-bar the top and bottom of the display to fit their aspect ratio, which envelops the punch-hole. Don\u2019t worry about it getting in the way of your binge sessions."
