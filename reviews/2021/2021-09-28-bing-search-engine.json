    "Bing is Microsoft\u2019s search engine, and it\u2019s most commonly paired with Edge, the company\u2019s browser.",
    "While Bing can hold its own in terms of search results, often returning the same items as other leading browsers, you\u2019ll want to use the rest of the Microsoft world of products to get the most out of it. Here\u2019s what we found.",
    "If you have a Microsoft account (or create one), you can sign in via Bing. When you do, you may notice that the Rewards icon on the top right of the page goes up in number.",
    "You earn rewards by searching with Bing (you get more if you use Microsoft Edge), shopping at the Microsoft Store, playing Xbox, taking quizzes and polls, etc. You can redeem your rewards by doing things like donating to a cause, entering a sweepstakes, or ordering a gift card.",
    "Another feature of Bing that competing search engines don\u2019t tend to have is the ability to add notifications to your homepage. Select a topic, and when something new is published about it, you\u2019ll get a notification that there\u2019s an update on what you\u2019re interested in.",
    "The best way to maintain control over your privacy when you use Bing is to sign in to your Microsoft account when using the search engine \u2013 and it\u2019s recommended that you use Microsoft Edge along with Bing.",
    "It\u2019s unclear how much you can see and manage if you use Bing on another browser. At Bing.com, you can click the Three Horizontal Lines menu on the top right of the page, then click Search History and see the option to view and clear your search history. But Microsoft\u2019s privacy page says that you can \u201cclear browse data that we collect when you use Cortana and Microsoft Edge.\u201d So while you may be able to clear your search history with just Bing.com, you may need to use Edge to see and clear the collected search data \u2013 which makes a difference.",
    "You can access your privacy controls by going to that link above and clicking Sign In With Microsoft. The Browsing History section talks about how Edge saves information about the websites you visit using the browser, and it shows you how to view and delete that browser history. Again, it doesn\u2019t clarify what happens to your data if you just use Bing.com, even if you\u2019re signed in to your Microsoft account. To be as safe as possible, we suggest using Bing along with Edge.",
    "Bing\u2019s search results can be richer than Google\u2019s. For example, when searching for, \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather today?\u201d this is what Bing returned:",
    "While this is what Google returned when searching for the weather:",
    "The same happened when searching for \u201cbest movies\u201d \u2013 Bing\u2019s results were a bit more rich than Google\u2019s and Yahoo\u2019s:",
    "We also tested Bing versus Google when searching for \u201cTechRadar.\u201d Both search engines returned TechRadar.com as the first result, followed by three of the site\u2019s latest headlines, with the option to scroll through more. And both search engines had a TechRadar info box on the right side of the results page. Moving down each page and on to the next, results were almost identical \u2013 mostly links to TechRadar\u2019s social profiles, aggregate sites, and reviews.",
    "You can use Bing by going to Bing.com, or you can change your default search engine to Bing. Here\u2019s how you change your default for Safari and Chrome. If you use a different browser that doesn\u2019t offer Bing, you can still use the search engine by going to the dedicated website.",
    "On Safari, go to Safari > Preferences > Search. Then, from the Search Engine drop-down menu, select Bing.",
    "On Chrome, go to Chrome > Preferences > Search Engine > Search Engine Used in the Address Bar. Select Bing from the drop-down menu.",
    "You can also install Bing Search apps for Android and iOS. With the mobile app, you can sign in to your Microsoft account on your computer without using a password.",
    "It\u2019s difficult to fully assess Bing without considering the Edge browser because the two are designed to work together. Edge is a contender in the browser market, especially if you do a lot of online shopping \u2013 its e-commerce features are excellent. But even with Bing plus Edge, security features feel limited, and there are other search engines, browsers, and hybrids that are much safer.",
    "That said, Bing\u2019s results are aligned with those from leading search engines (namely Safari and Chrome) and much better when compared to Yahoo. That\u2019s a major improvement from the Bing of years past, which fell under scrutiny for poor, outdated, and even inappropriate search results.",
    "Bing has a couple of extras that other search engines don\u2019t have (or don\u2019t have front-and-center), but the rewards take so much time to accrue and have such high trade-in rates that a lot of users may just forget about them. The on-page updates about your tagged topic are undeniably nice, though.",
    "Most importantly, Bing\u2019s privacy settings are their most powerful when you sign in to your Microsoft account and use the Edge browser \u00ad\u2013 and even then, we\u2019ve found that the security features can feel minimal. Since Bing doesn\u2019t have many bells and whistles or search results superior to other (safer) search engines, we\u2019re not sure what its draw and competing differentiator is.",
    "We don\u2019t want to deter you completely, though. Take a look at our article about Bing\u2019s new bots, which may help you with your searches."
