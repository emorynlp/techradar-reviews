  "summary": "A great entry-level RGB gaming keyboard",
  "verdict": "The Roccat Magma doesn\u2019t make the best first impression with its cheap feeling build and overwhelming RGB effects. But once you\u2019re used to it, you\u2019ll find an incredibly competent and delightfully punchy gaming keyboard that won\u2019t break the bank, and while it\u2019s missing some of the cooler features of pricier mechanical keyboards, the Magma is still a great entry-level choice.",
  "pros": [
    "Fast, accurate keys",
    "Impressively quiet keystrokes",
    "Great for its price"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Build feels a little cheap",
    "RGB can be overwhelming",
    "Relatively lacking in features"

    "Out of the box, the Roccat Magma RGB gaming keyboard doesn\u2019t exactly make for the best first impression. When paired with the included palm rest, the Roccat Magma will take up a fair amount of real estate on your desk. The build quality also feels a bit of the cheap side initially, being made of much lighter, hollow feeling material than we anticipated.",
    "Our mixed feelings only continued once the Roccat Magma was connected. The keyboard\u2019s RGB lighting is made visible through a large membrane plate that sits under the keys. The effect is honestly quite overwhelming at first, and may be a bit much for some who prefer a more subtle RGB profile.",
    "On the other hand, the quality of the RGB lighting is admittedly great. By default, the Roccat Magma uses the company\u2019s AIMO lighting feature. This setting dynamically alters the RGB lighting\u2019s colors and patterns based on the programs you\u2019re using. It\u2019s honestly pretty mesmerizing and does allow the Magma to stand out in the RGB crowd.",
    "That initial impression of the Roccat Magma feeling cheap also washes away as soon as you start typing on the keyboard. Keystrokes are impressively quiet, and the individual keys are spaced enough that inaccuracy is actually quite rare. This makes the Magma a solid alternative to noisier mechanical keyboards, and is also a fine choice if you\u2019re a fast typer.",
    "At \u00a349.99 (around $70 / AU$90), the Roccat Magma also won\u2019t break the bank. This makes it a superb choice as an entry level keyboard, especially if you\u2019re choosing peripherals for your first gaming PC build, for example.",
    "This is much more affordable than the Roccat Vulcan TKL Pro, which retails for \u00a3149 ($159, AU$239), and while the Magma misses out on the Vulcan\u2019s premium features like its gorgeous gunmetal finish and tactile floating keys, the overall typing experience is superb on the Magma for its relatively low price point.",
    "Moving over to gaming, the Roccat Magma performs admirably. Individual keys don\u2019t give any unnecessary resistance. As such, moving and performing actions was swift and responsive, which provided a boon during intense multiplayer gameplay.",
    "The Magma does miss out on the satisfying feel of a mechanical keyboard, however. That tactile, clicky feedback missing from the Magma might turn more experienced PC players away. On the other hand, keystrokes are relatively quiet, making the Magma pretty ideal if you like to game well into the night without waking up housemates, your significant other, or the kids.",
    "What you might not get from the Roccat Magma, though, is a significant competitive edge. Unlike more specialized gaming keyboards like the Corsair K70 TKL, the Magma\u2019s WASD keys aren\u2019t raised or textured, a physical feature that often helps with competitive shooters like Valorant or Overwatch.",
    "The Magma also doesn\u2019t feature more bespoke gaming keyboard options that could help it stand out from the crowd, like a dedicated tournament mode to comply with esports play. It also lacks the tight form factor of tenkeyless gaming keyboards - that bulky numpad and RGB faceplate adding significant real estate to the build.",
    "That being said, the fact the Magma is lacking the finer features of more advanced gaming keyboards by no means makes it a bad choice. On the contrary, the simplicity of the Magma makes it a perfect choice for entry-level PC gamers, especially if you\u2019re on a tight budget after shelling out on a brand new gaming rig.",
    "What the Magma does boast is its nifty Game Mode feature. As an example of its use, Game Mode converts the Caps Lock to an Easy-Shift feature by default. This prevents the Caps Lock from activating while in Game Mode, eliminating those all-caps chat box mishaps we\u2019ve all experienced in multiplayer games. This combines with 26-key rollover, which should eliminate most possibilities of ghosting to give an overall solid gameplay experience.",
    "If you\u2019re into customizing your keyboard experience, the Magma is supported by Roccat Swarm, all-in-one customization software that allows you to alter RGB effects, individual key bindings, shortcuts and character repeat delay when holding down a key, among many other options. Multiple profile slots are also supported, as well as a range of key press sound effects, if that\u2019s your thing.",
    "Swarm, unfortunately, isn\u2019t quite as robust as Corsair\u2019s iCUE software, and there are some gimmicky options it could have done without, such as the aforementioned sound effect option. However, it\u2019s still a good bit of software for beginners to have a play around with, and the ability to change default keybinds is certainly a very welcome accessibility option."
