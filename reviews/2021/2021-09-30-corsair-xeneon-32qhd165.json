  "summary": "A cracker of a gaming panel",
  "verdict": "The new Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 gets nearly everything right for an all-round gaming panel. Decent resolution, high refresh, fast response, great image quality, good build, strong feature set, the works. It\u2019s just a pity it\u2019s quite so pricey.",
  "pros": [
    "Fab all-round image quality",
    "Plenty quick enough",
    "Good build quality and feature set"

  "cons": [
    "Painfully pricey",
    "Not a true HDR panel"

    "If you\u2019re pondering the question of what makes for the best all-round gaming monitor, the new Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 might just be the answer. On paper, at least.",
    "With a 32-inch 1440p panel running at up to 165Hz refresh, it arguably nails exactly the right balance between performance and graphical detail. Sure, there are gaming monitors with more pixels than the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165. Others hum along at even higher refresh rates or offer more overall inches. But you quickly run into one obvious issue with ever-higher spec screens. How, precisely, are you going to drive the thing, what with graphics cards prices currently as crisis point?",
    "Those headline specs aside, what do you need to know about the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165? Corsair rates it at 1ms for MPRT pixel response and \u2018below\u2019 3ms for the more demanding grey-to-grey metric. So, it\u2019s quick but not among the very fastest IPS gaming panels in terms of pure response.",
    "However, it is one of the most accurate gaming panels you can currently buy. Thanks in part to quantum dot technology in the Xeneon\u2019s LED backlight, it\u2019s good for fully 100% of the Adobe RGB gamut and 98% of the even more demanding DCI-P3 color space.",
    "There\u2019s also VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification, plus AMD FreeSync Premium support and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. Just note this isn\u2019t a true HDR display and lacks features like local dimming.",
    "Interface-wise, you get a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports, a single DisplayPort 1.4 socket, plus USB Type-C connectivity complete with device charging for single-cable connectivity to a laptop.",
    "For the record, the HDMI ports only support a maximum refresh of 144Hz. That said, Corsair is pitching the 32QHD165 as a console-friendly panel courtesy of support for 4K input, which is then downscaled to 1440p. Hopefully the PS5 will soon match the Xbox Series X in natively supporting 1440p, as that would be a much better solution.",
    "Anyway, this is also a very nicely engineered screen, with a widely adjustable die-cast aluminium stand and one of the cleanest, clearest and most user-friendly OSD menus we\u2019ve ever seen.",
    "But how does the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 actually look? Its core image quality is frankly fab. It\u2019s bright, vibrant and punchy, while also being natural looking and nicely calibrated right out of the box.",
    "As for pixel response, Corsair has included three levels of user-configurable overdrive and even in the fastest setting, there\u2019s almost no visible overshoot or inverse ghosting.",
    "Granted, the subjective experience is of a very quick screen, rather than the absolute fastest we\u2019ve ever seen. But overall, there\u2019s minimal blurring. The same goes for latency. There are screens with higher refresh. But you\u2019d have to be a very committed esports addict to take issue with the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 running at 165Hz.",
    "Less impressive is HDR performance, which scarcely looks any punchier than SDR content. That said, it will correctly decode an HDR signal and, with a little tweaking, SDR content looks good in HDR mode. So you have the option of running the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 in HDR mode all the time to make your life that little bit simpler.",
    "Whatever, pretty much every kind of game looks great on the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165. Shooters like Call of Duty and Apex Legends look sharp. Graphical fests like Cyberpunk 2077 and the Forza racing games have plenty of punch. And there\u2019s enough detail to do justice to a strategy title like one of the Total War series.",
    "All of which means the Corsair Xeneon 32QHD165 is a very nicely executed gaming panel with no major flaws, super image quality, plenty of speed and a great feature set.",
    "We just wish it didn\u2019t cost quite so much, as $799 (\u00a3699, AU$999) sure is punchy for a 1440p panel. In fact, it\u2019s pretty much 4K money. If that arguably isn\u2019t the point, what certainly is relevant is that you can have similar on-paper specs for around half the money. Ouch."
