  "summary": "The Beoplay Portal is a premium gaming headset with one too many caveats",
  "verdict": "The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal is a beautifully crafted headset that offers supreme comfort and excellent audio quality. It\u2019s also one of the few gaming headsets to offer active noise cancellation, and doesn\u2019t look out of place when worn outside of the home. However, it\u2019s hard to excuse the intermittent connection issues we encountered at this price, and the inability to play Bluetooth and Xbox audio simultaneously is also a glaring omission.",
  "pros": [
    "Extremely comfortable",
    "Fantastic audio quality",
    "Wired or wireless options"

  "cons": [
    "Connection issues",

    "The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal is a luxury product aimed at those who want a headset that can basically do it all. It can connect to your Xbox console directly or to your smartphone via Bluetooth, and it can also connect to devices using a 3.5mm headphone jack (though the headset needs to be turned on). Unfortunately, we never found the Beoplay Portal held a completely rock-solid connection when connecting to Xbox, with intermitted issues often cropping up during our play sessions.",
    "Unlike the majority of gaming headsets, the Beoplay Portal is built using high-end materials, like super soft lambskin on the earcups and a knitted bamboo fiber textile on the headband. Weighing in at just 282 grams, the Beoplay Portal is also incredibly light, which means the headset can be worn comfortably for hours on end. These premium materials warrant a premium price point, however. At $499 / \u00a3449 (about AU$690), the Beoplay Portal is an extremely expensive pair of headphones.",
    "Another advantage the Beoplay Portal has over its competitors is active noise cancellation. While the feature is probably superfluous for most households, the ANC comes into its own when you take the headphones on the move. It\u2019s not the most powerful ANC solution we\u2019ve tested, but the upshot is that Bang and Olufsen\u2019s solution doesn\u2019t create any noticeable pressure or that \u2018underwater\u2019 feeling that some ANC headphones can create.",
    "You can adjust the ANC, volume, and \u2018Own Voice\u2019 technology using the headset\u2019s touch controls, which work exceptionally well. Double-tapping one of the earcups can also mute your microphone or stop the playback of your music.",
    "For more granular control, the Bang & Olufsen App can be downloaded from the iOS or Google Play Store. The app lets you change and store various EQ settings, volume and ANC quickly and effectively. We did find that the B&O app could sometimes fail to detect our headset, though, which can be frustrating.",
    "The Beoplay Portal is feature-rich, then, but one glaring omission is the headset\u2019s inability to play Bluetooth and Xbox audio simultaneously. You can only listen to one active sound connection at a time, which feels noticeably restrictive when other, cheaper headsets have this option.",
    "That being said, few rival gaming headsets sound as arresting as the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal. We did find that the default EQ needed some serious tweaking to create the type of listening experience we desired when gaming, but we expect most will be pleased with the headset\u2019s immersive sound. When listening to music, the Beoplay Portal sounds even better, something that we don\u2019t often say about other gaming headsets.",
    "The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal gaming headset is a compelling product if you\u2019re looking for a pair of do-it-all headphones that you can comfortably wear at home or on the go. However, the frequent connection issues we encountered, lack of simultaneous Bluetooth playback, and the average battery life make the Beoplay Portal hard to justify for its high price point.",
    "The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal was released on May 12, 2021, and comes in three colors: Navy, Grey Mist, and Black Anthracite. It costs the same as an Xbox Series X at $499.99 / \u00a3449.99 (about AU$690), which is significantly more expensive than other high-end gaming headsets for Xbox consoles like the Audeze Penrose X and Astro A50 Gaming Headset, which both cost $299 / \u00a3249 (about AU$550) respectively. The headset does come with a license to Dolby Atmos, though, which usually costs $15 / \u00a315 / AU$20.",
    "One of the most appealing aspects of the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal\u2019s meticulous design is that the headset doesn\u2019t look like a pair of gaming headphones at all. There\u2019s no flamboyant logos, searingly bright-colored accents, or a big microphone attached. Instead, the Beoplay Portal is refreshingly understated and exudes quality. You\u2019ll turn heads for the right reasons when wearing this outside the home.",
    "With lambskin leather earcups, finely milled aluminum, and composite polymer, the Beoplay Portal\u2019s exceptional build quality is noticeable from the moment you pick it up. It feels completely effortless to wear, too, thanks to its lightweight design and breathable materials, and the left and right earcups are clearly marked thanks to large \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 letters printed inside.",
    "The Beoplay Portal can be controlled using the Bang & Olufsen app or by using the headset\u2019s two touch bars on either side of the headset. Even though a regular volume dial would suffice, there\u2019s something rather appealing about the Beoplay Portal\u2019s touch bar controls, which work exceptionally well. Further functionality is also offered by tapping the outside of the earcups, which can pause music or mute your mic.",
    "The app lets you adjust, select and save various EQ settings, and also adjust the intensity of the active noise cancelling feature. Sometimes the app can fail to connect, which is frustrating, but overall we found it to be a decent companion to the Beoplay Portal with enough functionality on offer that it didn\u2019t feel burdensome to use.",
    "While it might go underappreciated by some, we enjoyed how quickly the Beoplay Portal headset turns on, and the two-button system that controls power and also lets you switch between devices. It\u2019s simple and elegant, though it\u2019s a shame there aren\u2019t any spoken audio cues that let you know how much battery remains and to which device you\u2019re connected.",
    "With a rich history of delivering high-end audio products, it\u2019s perhaps somewhat unsurprising to hear that the Beoplay Portal headset sounds excellent. We were particularly impressed by just how detailed and energetic the sound was when listening to music, with all our favorite genres faring equally well when listening via Bluetooth or using the headphone\u2019s 3.5mm jack.",
    "However, when gaming on Xbox, the Beoplay Portal lacks the sort of wider soundstage we\u2019ve come to appreciate from other headphones. This can be rectified somewhat by fiddling with the EQ settings and using Dolby Atmos, which thankfully did let us tailor the audio more to our liking, but they still don\u2019t sound quite as lively or engaging when playing games when compared to listening to music. We also wouldn\u2019t recommend them for keen competitive gamers, though again, you can tweak the EQ to focus on footsteps, etc.",
    "While we found ANC to be a slightly superfluous addition when gaming in our living room, the Beoplay Portal\u2019s active noise cancelling did a fine job at reducing the amount of audible fan noise we could hear when PC gaming. It\u2019s more a feature for when you\u2019re commuting or wearing the headphones outside, but we\u2019re glad it\u2019s included nonetheless.",
    "The Beoplay Portal thankfully doesn\u2019t disappoint when it comes to audio quality, then, but just bear in mind that it might not sound quite as compelling as some dedicated gaming headset. The upside, though, is the Beoplay Portal really makes music come to life.",
    "The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal\u2019s microphone uses clever beam-array technology to create a virtual boom mic. The result is a mic that sounds perfectly acceptable but isn\u2019t exactly broadcast quality. It does make your voice sound slightly echoey, as though you\u2019re speaking in an empty room, but we never heard any complaints during Xbox party chats or when taking phone calls.",
    "Wireless connectivity is where the Beoplay Portal unexpectedly struggles, sadly. We found that when connected to an Xbox Series X, we encountered interference and the odd disconnect during a week of testing. Sometimes our experience would be flawless, but moving around and raising our hands closer to the headset seemed to exacerbate the issue. Bluetooth was less of an issue, but even then, we\u2019d sometimes hear the odd skip during music playback.",
    "This can hopefully be fixed with a future firmware update, but when so many cheaper headsets don\u2019t struggle with this issue, it\u2019s disappointing that the Beoplay Portal does.",
    "In terms of battery life, the Beoplay Portal offers 12 hours of wireless performance and lasts up to 24 hours if you\u2019re utilizing Bluetooth only with ANC on. We found the headset hit those numbers during our testing but would have liked to see a little bit more longevity when using the Beoplay Portal when gaming. A lengthy USB C cable is provided for charging, and the headset takes approximately three hours to fully charge."
