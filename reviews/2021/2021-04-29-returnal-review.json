    "Returnal is challenging. A pop-up before you start the game warns you of that, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be prepared. Developer Housemarque has blended the ever-changing levels and permadeath of roguelikes into a game that is otherwise a blockbuster third-person shooter, but what makes Returnal challenging isn\u2019t simply the fact that it\u2019s a \u2018difficult\u2019 roguelike, it\u2019s the game's sheer unpredictability.",
    "Returnal is a game full of risky encounters that can mean the difference between a successful run and a more testing one, while players are constantly at the mercy of the loot they may \u2013 or may not \u2013 pick up, thanks to random generation. A lucky run with the right loot can mean the difference between success and failure, especially given that you have few persistent upgrades between runs (particularly in the earlier biomes, as the game\u2019s six distinct environments are called), which can make it feel like you\u2019re simultaneously grinding and starting from scratch at the same time.",
    "But each death in Returnal \u2013 and you will die, a lot \u2013 is not entirely pointless, as it unearths more of the story, uncovers secrets you may have missed before, and potentially offers better loot (but sometimes you\u2019re just unlucky). The constantly changing environment keeps things fresh so that, even when you have died for the twentieth time, there\u2019s a possibility you may stumble upon a room you\u2019ve never seen before \u2013 and may not find again.",
    "Whether or not Returnal\u2019s gameplay is for you will depend on your gaming preferences, but it\u2019s hard for anyone to deny how stunningly immersive the game is as a whole. The combination of the subtle utilization of the DualSense PS5 controller\u2019s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, Sony 3D audio tech, and the downright mesmerizing environment make for one of the most immersive gaming experiences we\u2019ve enjoyed to date, outside of VR. This immersion adds significant depth to the game\u2019s somewhat bizarre and intriguing story, and sees Returnal earning its place as a truly next-gen PS5 exclusive.",
    "Returnal is centered around space pilot Selene, who crashes her ship, Helios, on an alien planet called Atropos. But Atropos is stuck in a time loop, meaning that each time Selene dies \u2013 and she will die frequently \u2013 she begins a new life cycle starting at the crash site. Equipped with a high-tech suit, Selene sets out to battle her way across Atropos and break the loop, which will allow her to escape.",
    "But this isn\u2019t a simple case of Selene having to work her way through the same map again and again; instead, with each reset cycle, the world changes. Each of the six biomes has a different environment, including ancient forest ruins and desert plains, and is made up of \u2018rooms\u2019 much like dungeons. But when the cycle resets the order of these rooms changes \u2013 sometimes a room you visited last cycle isn\u2019t available this cycle. In addition, the enemies in those rooms change too, which keeps you on your toes, as you never quite know which room you\u2019re about to wander into \u2013 or what lurks there.",
    "Considering how much you die in Returnal, it\u2019s a smart move for keeping things fresh with each run; and, in some cases, resetting the cycle allows Selene to pick up pieces of story information she may have missed, like Scout logs that Selene previously recorded and which give hints about the (intriguing but bizarre) story. Even when you think you\u2019ve seen everything in a biome, you could be surprised. After nearly 20 hours with the game, we came across a room with a log that we had never encountered previously, despite running through the biome countless times before. On other occasions we uncovered destructible walls and gates, hiding secrets within, that we had previously missed; or, on a rarer occasion, found that the 20th-century house that sits perfectly preserved (and completely out of place) in the ruins of one room is actually accessible.",
    "This house is a key part of Returnal\u2019s story. Each time the house\u2019s porch light flickers on, Selene can enter, allowing her to uncover a fragment of the overall narrative which may explain why she\u2019s landed on Atropos, and why she\u2019s haunted by a mysterious astronaut figure. There are six house sequences in total, one for the completion of each of Returnal\u2019s six biomes. While these sequences are surreal, and are initially a bit confusing, the more you unlock, the more you begin to piece together the psychological thriller at the heart of Returnal.",
    "Between the scout logs and the house sequences, Returnal purposely drip-feeds you pieces of the game\u2019s story. It\u2019s a brilliant way of motivating you to keep playing when you're struggling to make it to the next biome, giving you just enough to let you know that there\u2019s something more to Selene\u2019s adventure than initially meets the eye, but making you work to find out what that is.",
    "Selene begins each cycle armed with just a low-powered pistol and melee blade, and it\u2019s up to you to find weapon proficiency upgrades that unlock higher-level weapons as you progress. Fortunately, as you unlock more biomes, once you enter later ones after a cycle reset you\u2019re greeted with a high-proficiency upgrade, so you can just crack on with that biome without having to increase your weapon proficiency from scratch.",
    "For example, when we died in biome three and started again at the crash site, we used biome one\u2019s shortcut to get straight to biome three, where there was a weapon proficiency upgrade at the beginning, allowing us to use weapons at a higher level immediately \u2013 so we didn\u2019t have to build up that weapon proficiency again. However, it\u2019s still worth trying to pick up any upgrades you can before you get there.",
    "Housemarque has confirmed that there are 10 base weapons, more than 90 weapon traits (each with three levels) and 10 alt-fires in Returnal. These weapons generally replicate in-game weapon staples like a pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher and assault rifle, and a melee blade. But these base weapons have different traits that suit a variety of playstyles and enemies; for example, you could be looking at two different Spitmaw Blasters, one of which generates acid pools while the other fires exploding shells. As you progress, you unlock new weapon traits, and then later can add on new ones, and you\u2019ll also be able to pick up higher-level versions of weapons.",
    "All the weapons feel smooth and weighty thanks to Returnal\u2019s utilization of the DualSense controller\u2019s adaptive triggers, enabling you to hold down the left trigger halfway for a focus shot, or all the way for an alt-fire (more powerful) shot. This utilization adds layers to combat, making you think about the movement of your trigger finger, and allowing you to immediately feel the feedback from a powerful shot. It\u2019s worth noting that this feature can be turned off if you wish.",
    "We found it took a lot of trial and error to find the type of weapon that suited us; and which weapon you use also depends on which enemy you\u2019re going up against. Often, particularly as you progress, Returnal\u2019s rooms are a bullet frenzy that sees you utilizing a combination of your gun, melee weapon and a ferocious amount of dash on enemies that range from tentacle-clad aliens to legless exploding robots \u2013 and that\u2019s not even including the bosses, which have a variety of combat styles that, at some point, will likely find a weakness in your playstyle.",
    "Firefights are intense and, while they can be mostly avoided (apart from \u2018lockdown\u2019 rooms, all the exits from which are sealed), it\u2019s worth taking advantage of the resources and loot that these fallen enemies drop when possible. Pro tip: sprinting to a boss fight isn\u2019t necessarily going to work in your favor.",
    "With each reset cycle, enemies become more hostile, adding more ferocity to these fights. But, over time, you begin to be able to identify an enemy\u2019s \u2018tell\u2019 before it attacks, making these fights a more fluid dance. We did find, however, that the combat scenarios with non-boss enemies do begin to get quite repetitive \u2013 especially when you run through the same biome again and again.",
    "In addition to the weapons, some of Returnal\u2019s most key items are artefacts. Artefacts grant upgrades to Selene, such as improving melee damage or increasing protection. While artefacts are super-handy, most don\u2019t persist through cycles \u2013 and which ones you get on your run is, again, random. This means that, if you die, you lose all the artefacts and weapons you\u2019ve gathered up in that cycle. There\u2019s a serious lack of persistent upgrades in Returnal, and it sometimes makes progression feel like a thankless task.",
    "A bit of flexibility here could have done wonders. While beating a really tough boss feels amazing, you\u2019re brought crashing back down to earth when after your next death you realize that you lost the good loot you got from them.",
    "As you progress through the game and defeat more bosses, more permanent tech and upgrades become available, which make it slightly easier to get through biomes. But, to get to that point, you kind of need to make do with what\u2019s at your disposal.",
    "Grabbing as many artefacts as you can in your run is advised, and some can be created using a fabricator. Fabricators turn Obolites, a glowing yellow resource that you find in-game, into specific artefacts (exactly what artefacts a Fabricator can create changes with each run) \u2013 although broken Fabricators create random artefacts. You can harvest Obolites by killing enemies and, on occasion, in containers or statues with glowing yellow eyes.",
    "Obolite- and loot-harvesting are elements of Returnal that almost encourage you to do a clean sweep of each biome on your way to your objective, as there\u2019s a finite amount of Obolites to collect per biome, and they\u2019re extremely useful as they also enable you to buy artefacts at Fabricators instead of having to solely rely on the game\u2019s randomly-generated loot. It\u2019s a matter of weighing up if you think it\u2019s worth it.",
    "Risky encounters are a big part of Returnal. For example, it\u2019s possible to use a rarer resource called Ether to get artefacts from an alien device, called the Cthonos, at Selene\u2019s crash site, by depositing a certain amount of the Ether into the Cthonos and receiving a random artefact in return \u2013 unlocking that artefact for inclusion in future cycles.",
    "But Ether is also super-useful for a number of other purposes. You can instead use it to cleanse containers, keys or health resin infected with Malignancy, which \u2013 when left uncleansed \u2013 carry the risk of causing your suit to malfunction. By using the Ether to cleanse the Malignancy, Selene can safely pick up or open these items without any risk. But if you choose not to cleanse these items, then there\u2019s a chance (ranging from low to high probability) that you\u2019ll suffer a suit malfunction as a result of opening or picking up items regardless \u2013 though, these malfunctions can be removed by completing certain tasks. It\u2019s impossible to tell if using your Ether, or even risking a possible malfunction, will be worth it \u2013 particularly with containers, which could hold great loot or something altogether useless.",
    "Ether can also be used to scavenge the bodies of other fallen scouts (if online is enabled), as you may be able to pick up some of their loot. Alternatively, you can avenge a fallen scout in order to try and get Ether \u2013 but that\u2019s a bit riskier. Avenging a scout means that a large enemy will spawn, and needs to be killed in order for you to gain your Ether reward; but, in some cases, the dead scout will turn into a parasitic monster creature that simply needs to be killed. Sorry, buddy.",
    "With Ether being a fairly rare resource, it\u2019s up to players to decide which scenario is most likely to pay off long term \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s not an easy decision to make when your back is against a wall.",
    "Even riskier is picking up a Parasite, which gives Selene both a buff and a de-buff (granting both positive and negative effects) \u2013 for example, you may get higher weapon power, but only if you\u2019re standing still. It\u2019s a constant game of weighing up risk against reward, and sometimes being too greedy can hurt you in the long run.",
    "Navigating Returnal\u2019s world is pretty straightforward, and makes what could be a laborious task much easier. A map helps you keep tabs on which rooms you\u2019ve been in, and indicates which upcoming rooms are simply side paths \u2013 likely containing loot \u2013 and which are main gateways leading towards the objective (highlighted in orange on the map). This is a helpful feature, especially as you unlock more biomes, as it enables you to quickly make your way through the biomes that stand in the way of you reaching the biome (and objective) you actually need to get to \u2013 highlighting shortcuts that make that journey easier in later biomes.",
    "A source of frustration for us with the first two biomes was the fact that Returnal\u2019s cycle doesn\u2019t reset from the most recently unlocked biome; instead you respawn back at the crash site, and have to make your way through all the previously unlocked biomes before making it to the point at which you died. So, for example, when we made it to the middle of the second biome and died, we would respawn at the crash site, and have to go through biome one to get into biome two.",
    "While this may put some players off, causing them to think this will be the case for every biome, we can assure you it\u2019s not. As more biomes unlock, it becomes increasingly easier to access your most recently unlocked biome \u2013 through both tech and story progression \u2013 although how easily you\u2019re able to traverse shortcuts still relies on how close to you the room containing that shortcut is generated in the next cycle.",
    "However, even when you start unlocking these shortcuts, runs are still long. With each run, players are typically looking at having to complete both the biome they reset from and the one they\u2019re actually trying to complete. While in some instances this is useful, as it allows you to pick up some extra gear or health, often it\u2019s more of an unnecessary annoyance, which drains your time more than anything. And, with enemies getting increasingly more hostile each cycle, oftentimes you may find yourself not even getting to the point you need to.",
    "Returnal is understandably a PS5 exclusive. While PS4 players will be wanting to get their hands on Sony\u2019s upcoming first-party offering, we feel that the game simply wouldn\u2019t have worked on last-gen hardware.",
    "Given that gameplay is based around constant death and respawning, the PS5\u2019s super-fast SSD makes this ritual much less frustrating than it could have been on PS4. Loading times are extremely fast, and transitions are seamless, making you more inclined to come back for more.",
    "In addition, Returnal is a brilliant showcase for PS5 tech. The DualSense haptic feedback is fairly subtle, gently reacting to on-screen events in a way that doesn\u2019t break your attention but adds to the experience. And if you\u2019re playing with headphones, which allow for PS5 3D spatial audio, Returnal\u2019s environment truly comes to life \u2013 you can hear the slithering of the world\u2019s creatures in the background, the rumble of a storm in the distance, and the raindrops falling on Selene\u2019s helmet.",
    "All this immersion made us a bit motion sick at times, but Housemarque offers a selection of accessibility options that include removing motion blur, adjustments for color blindness and more.",
    "Returnal is the perfect game for those who love a challenge with a bit extra behind it. It\u2019s a game of risk, with its unpredictability defining the degree of challenge more than the enemies themselves. When Returnal is challenging, it\u2019s punishingly so, and we often found ourselves stuck for hours on end at certain points - with the unpredictability meaning strategy could only get us so far, we had to just hope that our next run of loot was luckier than the last.",
    "But it\u2019s hard to deny that Housemarque has done something different with Returnal, blending a roguelike with a blockbuster third-person shooter \u2013 and creating an arcade bullet hell that\u2019s different to anything we\u2019ve seen from Sony before.",
    "Returnal is a PS5 exclusive that emphatically meets the standards of what we\u2019ve been crying out for from the new console, and it\u2019s a fantastic showcase for what this new hardware is actually capable of.",
    "While Returnal\u2019s formula may be something that frustrates many players, others will adore its fast-paced action, psychologically thrilling narrative, and risky endeavors \u2013 and with a price tag of $69.99 / \u00a369.99 / AU$124.95, it\u2019s worth identifying which of those camps you\u2019re likely to fall into before you pick this game up."
