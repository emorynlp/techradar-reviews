  "summary": "A solid piece of kit, let down by its keyboard and screen",
  "verdict": "The Core i7 processor and AMD graphics make this a powerful all-rounder, and it's got good looks and reasonable build quality. The keyboard isn't great, though, and the Inspiron's screen lacks resolution and quality.",
  "pros": [
    "Core i7 processor",
    "Dedicated AMD graphics",
    "Smart exterior design",
    "Decent build quality"

    "Dell's range of Inspiron laptops has been around for what feels like eons, so was about time the line was refreshed with more recent, superior Intel hardware. This 2018 laptop remains an attractive computer, too, with a brushed metal finish across the lid.",
    "Immediately, the metallic lid and attractive Dell logo make a strong first impression, and the aesthetic spreads to the sides and base, where more metal is layered over the Dell\u2019s plastic skeleton to add a bit of sheen.",
    "Build quality is very consistent, too. The wrist-rest barely budges, the screen feels sturdy, and the underside has a little give \u2013 but all the components inside are well protected. We wouldn\u2019t really have a problem with slinging the Dell Inspiron 15 inside a backpack and expecting it to survive our travels. You\u2019ll only need to use a protective sleeve if you\u2019re concerned about aesthetic damage.",
    "This isn't a particularly expensive notebook, though, so don't expect metal draped over every surface. The underside of the base is only covered in metal on areas where it'll be visible, and the keyboard, wrist-rest and screen bezel are all finished with underwhelming matte black plastic.",
    "The port situation is pretty standard here, too, with a trio of USB connections, a HDMI output and Gigabit Ethernet alongside an SD card reader. Interior access is decent: the base panel lifts away after just two screws have been removed, and the memory, hard drive, battery, processor and wireless card are all easily reachable. That\u2019s great news for anyone that wants to be able to repair or upgrade their own laptop.",
    "This isn't an Ultrabook or a convertible machine, which means it's chunkier than both of its main rivals. At 0.9in (23mm) thick it's a tad broader than the 0.78in (20mm) Lenovo ThinkPad X250 and the 0.86in (22mm) Asus Transformer Book Flip TP300LA, and it tips the scales at 4.4lbs (2kg) \u2013 almost 2lb more than the Lenovo and around half a pound more than the Asus.",
    "The Scrabble-tile keyboard has a number pad, which is a boon for productivity, and its layout is mostly fine \u2013 we're not thrilled to a see a single-height Return key, but that's our only quibble.",
    "It\u2019s a decent jumping off point, but the keys themselves aren\u2019t great for serious typing. The base isn\u2019t firm enough, and the keys don\u2019t have enough travel \u2013 a combination of issues that can make the keyboard feel unsatisfying, without the movement and conviction of better, more expensive laptops. It\u2019s perfect for browsing, instant messaging and the occasional email, but that\u2019s really it.",
    "The trackpad is initially too sensitive, which can be fixed in the Control Panel, and it's fine elsewhere \u2013 the surface is smooth and responsive, and the buttons are light and consistent."
