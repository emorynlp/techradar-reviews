    "Lightspeed is a Canadian company that offers point of sale (POS) solutions for retail and restaurant businesses. It has been delivering custom e-commerce solutions for the last 15 years or so.",
    "While it does have off-the-shelf packages to choose from on its website, Lightspeed is most appealing as a POS provider because it can tailor individual POS systems to suit your business. Lightspeed are a company who care about providing the best POS solution for your business needs.",
    "Get a quote for a POS system today.",
    "That ultimately means you get a more personalized and bespoke technical setup. Equally, it also requires you to invest time talking to the company about how best to configure it.",
    "Depending on your staffing resources, Lightspeed POS might not be for the smaller business but it has the potential to add real benefit for any ventures that are growing at pace. Lightspeed has recently released a new product called Payments, which is a fully integrated system that protects business owners against fraudulent payments, and provides everything a merchant needs to process sales and get paid in one place.",
    "Competitor products include AirPOS, Shopify, EposNow and Square POS.",
    "Lightspeed's user-friendly website makes it pretty simple to pick one of their POS systems to support your business operations. The company divides its packages down the middle, with either retail or restaurant options to choose from.",
    "However, dip into these two choices and you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s a little more to getting set up with a Lightspeed POS system than meets the eye. Although that\u2019s not a bad thing, as Lightspeed POS packages can be carefully tailored to meet the needs of individual businesses.",
    "Therefore, for restaurant focused POS systems the price currently starts at $59 / \u00a359 per month, but you\u2019ll need to speak to them in order to get a more personalized price.",
    "Retail pricing follows a similar theme, which currently equates to these monthly baseline charges:",
    "Basic $69 /\u00a369",
    "Starter $99 / \u00a399,",
    "Standard $119",
    "Advanced $169 / \u00a3129",
    "Pro $229 / \u00a3199",
    "You can make savings by paying annually rather than monthly and bear in mind there will be other incidental charges due to the more custom approach of Lightspeed.",
    "Check out the Lightspeed POS website to find the right POS system for your business (link is for US-based business only).",
    "A Lightspeed tailored POS software solution will come configured with everything you need: from getting your business up and running, to transforming it into a scalable, efficient business venture.",

    "Hospitality benefits",
    "Restaurant's in need of a flexible POS system are presented with multiple benefits for customers and both front of house and back of house staff alike when it comes to Lightspeed POS. Below are just a few of their hospitality POS business features:",

    "Lightspeed has invested a lot of time in having some very decent Mac-based kit available to help your business get the best from its systems. There\u2019s an iPad POS hardware option for example, with a PG cash drawer.",
    "Indeed, all of the Lightspeed POS software has been engineered to run on:",

    "Due to Lightspeed being a more bespoke design, this might be more challenging than some basic off-the-shelf solutions. But the trade-off for getting to grips with Lightspeed's more complex POS hardware, is you\u2019ll have a much more potent POS solution at your disposal.",
    "Support is plentiful once you\u2019re signed up with Lightspeed POS, and forms part of the package that comes with having an account with them. With healthy Trustpilot Lightspeed POS reviews, you can see the many satisfied induvial caf\u00e9, hospitality and retail writeups.",
    "One reviewer specifically references a favourite feature: \"What's nice is that their \"call you back\" function works. You don't have to spend ages on the phone. You can request that they call you and get on with other tasks while you wait. It works. They call you back rather quickly.\"",
    "A modern business, Lightspeed have the expected POS customer help center on their website for you to reference. It is divided into different core sections, based on individual POS packages.",

    "Personalized packages can help you squeeze more out of your Lightspeed POS system and you\u2019ll find that they pack in lots of reporting and analytics to further beef up their POS offering.",
