    "Zoom has established itself as one of the best video conferencing solutions on the market, to the extent that a Google search will land you several articles about it becoming so popular it\u2019s now used as a verb. This isn\u2019t surprising considering it has over 300 million daily meeting participants.",
    "In this Zoom review, we go over several aspects of the software, including its plans and pricing, main features, customer support, and security, to help you determine whether it\u2019s right for you.",
    "Zoom offers four plans, and the pricing per plan is for a single license. To host meetings simultaneously, you\u2019ll need more than one license.",
    "The free plan enables you to host 100 participants but has a 40-minute time limit on group meetings. One-to-one meetings, however, are unlimited. Paid plans increase the group meeting time limit to 30 hours.",
    "The Pro plan, at $149.90/year, gives you the ability to host 100 participants, stream on social media, 1GB of cloud storage for recordings, and real-time transcription.",
    "You can get all this and host up to 300 participants with the Business plan ($199.90/year), and if you fork out $240/year for the Enterprise plan, you can host up to 500 participants and access Zoom\u2019s best features.",
    "For the advanced plans, you can utilize the Large Meetings add-on to host up to 1,000 participants. If you choose annual billing, you\u2019ll save around 15% on charges.",
    "Zoom is a powerhouse of features, supporting HD video and audio calling, social media streaming, screen sharing, integration with essential apps, and much more. Let\u2019s look at some of the most important.",
    "All of Zoom\u2019s plans enable you to record meetings locally, and there\u2019s cloud recording on all the paid plans, with the Enterprise plan offering unlimited cloud storage.",
    "Audio transcription is available on the Business and Enterprise plans. This feature transcribes the audio of cloud-recorded meeting files and saves it, so you can focus on the meeting rather than worry about note-taking. You can also display the transcript in a video, like captions.",
    "The paid plans now have live audio transcription, which creates a real-time transcript of the audio while the meeting is ongoing. However, the version at time of writing (5.5.0) only supports English language for both transcription features.",
    "Video conferences may feel uncomfortable for people because of unpleasant surroundings. With Zoom\u2019s Virtual Backgrounds, you can change your background to any other image of your preference, and you\u2019ll find backgrounds for downloading on Zoom\u2019s library. With the latest version, you can blur your background if you don\u2019t want a virtual background.",
    "Zoom suppresses distracting background noises to give you a focused experience. You can adjust the noise cancellation depending on your environment. On the low setting, it\u2019ll suppress faint background noises. On the high setting, it\u2019ll clear louder sounds, like keyboard typing or a dog barking.",
    "With the advanced plans, you can use the admin portal to track meetings and participants, receive usage insights, and manage all your company\u2019s users on one account for simplified billing.",
    "Zoom has a neat, uniform interface on both the mobile and desktop app. The home screen has four large icons to fulfill all your meeting needs: New Meeting, Join, Schedule, and Share Screen. You can use Zoom on the browser, but it lacks some features like meeting recording. Downloading the desktop client takes a few minutes and doesn\u2019t have any restrictions.",
    "With a strong internet connection, audio and video relaying were smooth. Zoom\u2019s latest version is well optimized and used around 15\u201320% CPU on a 2.20 GHz 4-Core Intel Core i7 device. This is a tremendous upgrade, considering the application used around 50% CPU in 2020 on devices with similar specs. Overall, Zoom uses resources efficiently and performs quite well.",
    "Support is limited with Zoom\u2019s free plan: you only have access to the Help Center, which has easy-to-follow video tutorials and guides. There is also a simple chatbot that connects you to the relevant resources.",
    "Pro plan users enjoy better support, with live chat and ticketing, while those on the Business and Enterprise plans can also avail of phone support.",
    "A support ticket\u2019s response time depends on its priority grade. Urgent tickets receive a response in one hour and high priority tickets receive a response in four hours. The normal and low priority tickets get a response within 24 hours. All the advanced plans have 24/7 support across phone, chat, and web, even on public holidays.",
    "Zoom\u2019s security has improved considerably since 2020. Meetings are secured with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256, which is practically unbreakable by brute computing force. With AES-256, a one-time encryption key is created and managed on Zoom\u2019s servers for every session. But this means the keys can be compromised if Zoom comes under a cybersecurity attack.",
    "To provide enhanced protection, Zoom has launched end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for both free and paid accounts, and users can opt to enable or disable this feature. With E2EE turned on, the encrypted keys are created on the participants\u2019 machines, so only they have access to them. This data can\u2019t be accessed by anyone else, including Zoom. However, activating E2EE disables features like streaming and cloud recording.",
    "There are many video conferencing applications with incredible features, but the best software for you will meet your needs perfectly.",
    "Google Meet, for instance, doesn\u2019t have advanced features like Zoom, but it\u2019s optimized for smaller teams. As part of Google Workspace, it integrates excellently with other Google applications, like Calendar and Docs.",
    "When it comes to security, Webex\u2019s default settings enhance data privacy, so customers aren\u2019t responsible for securing their accounts. Similarly, Lifesize\u2019s meetings are end-to-end encrypted by default. With Zoom, you have to adjust your security settings yourself to avail of additional protection. If security is paramount for you, then Webex and Lifesize won\u2019t disappoint.",
    "Zoom is packed with great features and has a clean, user-friendly interface. It has optimized its performance to improve quality and reduce system load, and now offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for its meetings. Although Zoom\u2019s default settings don\u2019t bolster account security and privacy, it makes up for this with its advanced features and ease of use.",
    "Zoom is perfect for businesses with rigorous video conferencing needs. But if you only require simple features, then a quick setup web app, like Google Meet, will be more convenient. With a 60-minute limit on meetings and features like screen share, whiteboard, and virtual background, Meet\u2019s free plan is perfect for basic use."
