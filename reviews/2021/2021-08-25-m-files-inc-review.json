    "Document management programs are designed to help businesses store, organize, and secure a wide range of important documents and document types, eliminating the need for paper copies. Selecting the best document management software will help you improve daily workflows and business efficiency.",
    "In our full M-Files Inc review, we explore the ins and outs of using one of the world\u2019s top-rated document management programs. We look at the platform\u2019s purchase options, user interface, support, main features, and an array of other information to help you decide whether this is the right option for your business.",
    "Unfortunately, M-Files doesn\u2019t provide any information about its plans, prices, or purchase options. Although this isn\u2019t unusual in the world of document management software, it would still be nice if an indication of the cost were provided.",
    "However, we can only assume that M-Files does this because it specializes in custom document management solutions tailored to an individual business\u2019s needs. Because of this, the price you pay will likely depend on the level of service and features you require, as well as the scale of your requirements.",
    "Fortunately, there is both a free trial and an in-depth demo available to help you decide whether this program brings what you need to the table. To download the 30-day trial, simply fill in the online form. For a demo, however, you will have to reach out to the M-Files team and arrange an appointment.",
    "Like all high-end document management software providers, M-Files is backed by a suite of advanced features. These are too numerous to list individually, but we\u2019ve touched on a few of our favorites below.",
    "One thing that really stood out to us was M-Files\u2019 innovative document organization system. Rather than relying on a traditional, folder-based system, it uses metadata to organize content by keywords, tags, categories, and more. This also makes it very easy to search for and manage documents of all types.",
    "Another impressive feature is M-Files\u2019 offline mobile support. With this, you can essentially access documents from your mobile device, even if you don\u2019t have an internet connection.",
    "Finally, M-Files supports straightforward integration with a wide range of third-party apps and platforms, including Microsoft Office, Google G Suite, Salesforce, and more. These should help you streamline daily workflows and improve long-term business efficiency.",
    "To get started with M-Files, you will need to download the program and log in to your account. Follow the instructions provided by the onboarding team at the time of purchase and configure your account as required.",
    "M-Files is available via both desktop and mobile devices. The desktop application is very tidy, with a clear document hierarchy, useful search panels, and various tools to help you manage your content. There is also a great filter system to help you find and manage specific groups of documents.",
    "The mobile app is available across both iOS and Android devices. Simply log in to your vault with your server address, username, and password and manage your documents on the go. Although the apps aren\u2019t quite as powerful as the desktop version, they are still very useful.",
    "M-Files provides local phone support in eight countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Australia. You can also contact the support team via email or through the company\u2019s social media accounts.",
    "Alternatively, you may find the answers to your questions via the M-Files User Guide, which contains a wealth of information about getting started and ongoing use. On top of this, you can access more detailed information via the blog section of the website, which contains webinars, white papers, community guides, and more. There are also numerous FAQs touching on common questions and a huge video library available via the company\u2019s YouTube channel.",
    "As expected from an industry-leading document management software provider, M-Files places a strong emphasis on security. It implements a wide range of privacy and data protection tools to ensure your information and content is safe at all times. The company is even able to work alongside you to ensure you\u2019re complying with any regulatory and legal requirements you may be subject to.",
    "M-Files\u2019 security features are too numerous to mention individually, but one thing that really stood out was the company\u2019s ISO 27001 international security management certification. Alongside various access controls and other powerful tools, it also uses end-to-end and at-rest encryption to reduce the risk of data leaks.",
    "M-Files is one of the top-rated document management software providers in the world, but there are still plenty of very similar alternatives worth considering.",
    "One of our favorites is Templafy, which focuses on streamlined integration with popular third-party platforms. Like M-Files, it uses a cloud-based platform and custom pricing. And it\u2019s backed by attractive mobile apps and a range of powerful features. It\u2019s very easy to use, making it a great option for those with little tech knowledge or experience.",
    "Another attractive option is DocuWare, which aims to provide paperless solutions for offices of all shapes and sizes. Its services are highly customizable, and small-scale use is supported. It\u2019s backed by impressive mobile apps and various specialized features, and it\u2019s definitely worth considering if you\u2019re looking for a full paperless approach.",
    "All things considered, M-Files is one of the best document management platforms we\u2019ve used. It\u2019s backed by a wide range of advanced features and powerful security integrations.",
    "And although the lack of transparency surrounding the company\u2019s price structures is a little frustrating, there\u2019s little else to fault. Ultimately, we\u2019d recommend having a chat with the M-Files team if you\u2019re looking for an advanced document management solution you can rely on."
