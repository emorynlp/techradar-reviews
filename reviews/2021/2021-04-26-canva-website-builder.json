    "We\u2019ve explored Canva Video, Canva's video editing feature a while back, an interesting and unusual way to create and share videos online, but would you believe that this highly versatile company also offers a website builder service? Well, they do, and we\u2019ll be exploring it in detail here.",
    "In order to use Canva, you must create an account, but all they need from you is your name and an email address to set one up. Once logged in, go to the website creation section of Canva\u2019s website and you\u2019ll be presented with 162 templates, which you can narrow down not by category, but by their principal colour. It\u2019s a little unusual, but it appears to be your only option, aside from scrolling through them all. You also have the choice of starting with a blank website, should you prefer.",
    "As you click on various templates, you\u2019ll notice that some state that they are \u201cFree to edit and download\u201d while others are \u201cIncluded in Canva Pro\u201d. Sadly, there\u2019s no way to find out which are which aside from clicking on them. Don\u2019t worry too much though: if you\u2019re testing the service out, you can still select and experiment with a \u2018Canva Pro\u2019 template - you\u2019ll just have to pay for it prior to publishing it.",
    "Once you\u2019ve chosen the one you like, you\u2019ll enter the editing process proper.",
    "The interface is broken down into sections. The main one shows the currently selected page. You have thumbnails at the bottom, representing all your site\u2019s pages, to the right are available pages for the selected template, and on the far left is a sidebar, giving you access to all the tools you need to customise your website.",
    "You\u2019ll notice that just because you chose a particular template, you\u2019re actually not restricted to it: you\u2019re able to choose another template and add one or more of its pages to your project, allowing you to design something truly unique.",
    "All placeholder text and images can be altered or replaced. Click on a text box and relevant editing tools appear at the top, allowing you to change the font, size, colour, alignment, etc. You can apply different styles, or even place your text on a curve. There are also animation options to make your selection appear on the screen in a particular way (the premium effects have a small crown logo on their thumbnail).",
    "When it comes to images, you have a host of tools to alter, modify and otherwise improve them, straight from within the application. These range from basic image adjustment tools such as brightness, contrast, saturation, etc, to 20 filters whose intensities can be altered, to a long list of effects.",
    "Every item (aside from background images) can be repositioned wherever you need them to be with an easy drag and drop.",
    "This is where you get to add more items to your pages. The Uploads stores all the personal media you\u2019ve uploaded, be it photos, video or audio. Photos grants you access to thousands of stock images (not all of them are free though: some come with a fee attached to them - more on this later).",
    "The rest of the sidebar is pretty self explanatory. There\u2019s a category to add Elements like lines, shapes, animated stickers, and the like, Text lets you add additional text boxes to your pages, or specially designed text effects to add a little extra pizzazz, Audio is where you get background mood music, Videos is a selection of stock clips, and Background are stylistic images. There\u2019s also an app section where you can embed Google Maps, Instagram, and many more.",
    "There\u2019s a nice feature which allows you to share your creation with others, allowing them to edit and otherwise collaborate with you on your work.",
    "When it comes time to publish your design, Canva offers an interesting list of choices, including turning all your pages into a single scrolling page, or adding a navigation bar for visitors to click through each of them, for instance. There are four choices open to you which you can preview one after the other if you like, to help you select the one that works best for you.",
    "You\u2019ll notice that contrary to most website builders available nowadays, Canva\u2019s offering aren\u2019t responsive, meaning the design doesn\u2019t alter depending on the screen your site is viewed on (be it from a desktop, tablet or phone), which makes the service feel somewhat behind the times.",
    "This section is also where you\u2019ll find how much you\u2019ll have to pay before you can publish your creation, depending on how many premium stock images, videos, or templates you\u2019ve used. This is the case if you\u2019re working with the free plan.",
    "Should you elect to go with Pro for $12.99 (\u00a311.99) per month, or $119.99 (\u00a399.99) per year, all the premium templates, and stock media are available at no extra charge. You\u2019re also given 100GB of online storage (quite a jump from the 5GB for the free plan) to store your own media.",
    "The Enterprise plan is aimed at the professional company and is made to accommodate a team of designers. As such, that plan will cost $30 (\u00a324) per month per person, and includes the ability to add your own logos, colours and fonts to your design palette, a workflow so designs can be approved prior to publishing, for instance, and you even get unlimited online storage.",
    "Of note, both paid plans can be tried free for 30 days, and classrooms and non-profits can use Canva for free.",
    "Canva has some interesting features. We liked the ability to collaborate with others for instance, as well as some of the text options, and all the image editing tools on offer. The fact the service is free to education establishments and charities is very generous, and you can design good looking pages with it. But there\u2019s no blogging tool nor ecommerce facilities - the service isn\u2019t designed that way, and the fact the end result isn\u2019t responsive is disappointing."
