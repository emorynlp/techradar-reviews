  "verdict": "The Wacaco Picopress is a hand-pump espresso machine that produces smooth, intense coffee with a lovely crema on top. Compact and lightweight, it\u2019s ideal for those who work in various locations, or often find themselves away for the weekend. It\u2019s a little fiddly and time-consuming to use, but those with a passion for coffee will enjoy experimenting to create a shot of espresso that suits them.",

    "Enjoying a smooth espresso is one of life\u2019s little pleasures, but while there\u2019s a wide array of static coffee machines available for your home, when you\u2019re out and about you're more likely to need to head to the nearest coffee shop for that much-needed espresso. Unless you have a portable hand-pump coffee maker with you, that is.",
    "Wacaco has specialized in creating portable coffee makers that use hand-pump power \u2013 rather than batteries or mains power \u2013 since 2013, after the brand\u2019s founder was left disappointed by an espresso shot he purchased in a hotel. The Picopress is the firm\u2019s latest release, and is its smallest and most compact portable espresso maker to date.",
    "Earning a spot in our best espresso machines list, the Wacaco Picopress is aimed at coffee enthusiasts, and is one of the best coffee makers we\u2019ve tested. Not only does it feature a 2-inch / 5.2cm double basket, which is the same size as that found on espresso machines, it can also take up to 18g of ground coffee, meaning it can make double espressos.",
    "All you need is coffee grounds and boiling water to create smooth espresso. The Picopress also has a portafilter that can be used naked (without the spout), which helps to ensure a crema \u2013 the hazelnut-colored froth that sits on top of your coffee once it\u2019s been brewed \u2013 that completely covers the top of the coffee.",
    "For those who find themselves switching between working locations throughout the day, or if you regularly take weekends away, this is a handy unit to have tucked in your bag.",
    "The Wacaco Picopress will set you back $129.90 / \u00a3109.90 / AU$189.90, and is available globally from Wacaco\u2019s site as well as Amazon.",
    "Wacaco also offers the Nanopresso, which has a smaller basket and subsequently holds just 8g of coffee, requiring an add-on to make double espresso. It\u2019s priced at $69.90 / \u00a358.90 / AU$109.90",
    "The Picopress really is a portable coffee maker, measuring just 4.17 x 3.07 x 2.8 inches / 10.6 x 7.8 x 7.1cm (h x w x d) and weighing 0.77lb / 350g. As such, it\u2019s no chore to slip this into your bag each day. It\u2019s smaller and more compact than Wacaco\u2019s previous hand-pump espresso maker, the Nanopresso.",
    "All of the accessories that come with the unit, including a coffee-grind scoop, a distribution tool, and metal tamper to help create a perfect coffee puck (the name for the disc of compacted coffee grounds), and a brush for cleaning the coffee maker sit neatly inside the appliance. The Picopress even comes with a carry case to protect the coffee maker when it\u2019s in your bag.",
    "The Picopress doesn\u2019t require batteries to brew your espresso. Instead, it features a piston, which can be pumped by hand to create 18 bars of pressure to force the hot water through the coffee grounds. It comes with a standard 2-inch / 5.2cm double basket, similar to those found on mains-powered espresso machines. It can hold 18g of coffee, and also features a 2.7fl oz / 80ml water tank, so you can brew a double espresso no matter where you are \u2013 as long as you have access to boiling water and a cup.",
    "The main unit is made from plastic, but the portafilter, basket, and the tamper are all made from aluminum. As a result, the whole appliance feels extremely durable, and it comes with a two-year warranty too.",
    "Using the Picopress is time-consuming, especially since Wacaco recommends freshly grinding beans for each use. That said, following use of the coffee maker each day for a week, we became much faster at creating a smooth coffee puck and assembling the coffee maker ready to start hand-pumping an espresso.",
    "Wacaco suggests you pump boiling water through the espresso maker and into your cup before brewing your espresso; including this step resulted in it taking 90 seconds to brew a shot of espresso. While this may seem long in comparison to powered espresso makers \u2013 the Breville Bambino Plus takes just 21 seconds, for example \u2013 it's certainly worth the wait.",
    "The coffee was wonderfully smooth, with an intense flavor. Thanks to the ability to use the portafilter naked, where the spout is removed so the bottom of the basket is exposed, the coffee also had a complete crema on top. When we added sugar and gave the drink a stir, the crema formed again, which is exactly as we\u2019d hoped.",
    "How fast you pump the Picopress affects the level of pressure created: the more quickly you pump, the higher the pressure. However, if you pump too quickly and the pressure becomes too high, a safety valve will open, sending the water back into the tank. This will result in the flow of coffee reducing, or potentially even stopping, so you\u2019ll need to use the Picopress several times to find the right speed at which to pump.",
    "Unlike the Nanopresso, the Picopress doesn\u2019t come with an add-on kit that allows the use of single-serve coffee capsules, such as those that would be used in a Nespresso machine.",
    "If we\u2019re being really picky, we were disappointed by the lack of a maximum mark in the water tank \u2013 so if you\u2019re a stickler for the rules, you\u2019ll need a set of scales to ensure you get the perfect espresso every time.",
