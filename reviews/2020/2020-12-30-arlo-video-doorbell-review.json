    "Dollar for dollar, the Arlo Video Doorbell is probably the best video doorbell out there. While it is pricier than the standard Ring Video Doorbell, it offers a higher resolution and smarter features, and it\u2019s significantly cheaper than the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, despite offering a similar camera quality and feature-set.",
    "If you already have other Arlo devices, the Video Doorbell is a no-brainer - but even if not, it\u2019s our favorite option on the market.",
    "Of course, while it beats the Ring Video Doorbell Pro in price, it doesn\u2019t undercut the standard Ring Video Doorbell - so if you\u2019re really on a budget and don\u2019t mind taking a slight hit in some smart features and video quality, that's still a great option.",
    "It\u2019s also not worth considering the Arlo Video Doorbell unless you\u2019re willing to subscribe to the Arlo Smart subscription. The subscription doesn\u2019t cost much, but not everyone is willing to deal with a monthly fee.",
    "Still, Arlo makes a compelling case for its entry into the video doorbell category - and provided you\u2019re happy to pay the subscription and want those smart features - this is the way to go.",
    "The Arlo Video Doorbell was released back in 2019, and is available to buy now for $149.99 / \u00a3179.99/ AU$289.99 - but you can often find it for under $100 / \u00a3125 / AU$200 during big sales. The Ring Video Doorbell Pro, which matches Arlo in overall design and features, $169.99 / \u00a3159 / AU$279.",
    "The Arlo Video Doorbell may not cost quite as much as the competition, but it still looks just as premium: it has a white exterior with a black front, and it looks great.",
    "At 5.0 x 1.7 x 1.0 inches (H x W x D), it\u2019s not too big and chunky, like the traditional Ring Video Doorbell is, though it is a little taller than the Nest Hello, but not much, and it should still look great next to any door.",
    "On the front of the doorbell, there\u2019s a big button on the bottom, while the camera is located on the top of the front. It\u2019s a good look, and pretty friendly overall. The button is nice and big, so you probably won\u2019t guests not knowing how to use it. It\u2019s even easier to figure out where the button is given the fact that the ring of LED lights around it light up when they detect motion. Those lights are also used to indicate status during the setup process.",
    "While you won\u2019t really see the back after the device is set up, it\u2019s also very simple. There are two screws, which you\u2019ll use to wire the device in, but that\u2019s about it.",
    "Generally speaking, the Arlo Video Doorbell offers a simple, stylish design.",
    "Setting up to Arlo Video Doorbell is very easy to do, and the Arlo app makes it even easier. Unlike some other video doorbells, this one does have to be hard-wired - so it's not suitable for renters or for anyone who doesn't have the pre-existing wiring in their house for a doorbell.",
    "To set the Arlo Video Doorbell up, you\u2019ll simply download the app and select \u201cAdd New Device\u201d, after which the app will guide you through the whole process.",
    "There are a number of steps to go through, depending on how your home is set up and you should expect that it will take a solid 30 minutes or so to get everything up and running, but it\u2019s not too complicated.",
    "Physically setting the camera up will involve screwing a base plate into the outside of your home, and that may present some challenges if you want to screw it into brick or something like that. If you\u2019re not confident in doing so, it may be worth getting a professional to install the camera. Alternatively, the doorbell may be thin enough to fit on some door frames.",
    "After everything is set up, the camera is super easy to use - and it offers an excellent image quality for a camera in this price range.",
    "When someone presses the button on the doorbell, you\u2019ll immediately get a call on your phone, which you can pick up to activate two-way audio - or you can decline to allow the visitor to leave a message. It\u2019s a very immediate response in the app, which is a good thing, but when speaking to the person outside your door, we did experience a delay of a second or so. It\u2019s really not a big deal, but still something to note. You can also set up a message to play when someone rings the bell if you don\u2019t want to talk to them, or use one of the pre-recorded messages.",
    "The camera on the Arlo Video Doorbell is very good, especially for a camera in this price range. The aspect ratio is 1:1 with a 180-degree field-of-view, which is actually quite nice, and allows you to see more than you otherwise would. And, with a 1,536 x 1,536 resolution, details are relatively crisp and clear. There is a bit of a fisheye effect, but it\u2019s not bad by any means, and it certainly doesn\u2019t result in not being able to properly see what\u2019s going on.",
    "As you would expect in 2020, the camera offers some great smart features too. For example, you can set custom motion zones, and the device is smart enough to tell you what\u2019s being detected - whether it be a person, animal, package, and so on.",
    "Arlo isn\u2019t shy about promoting its subscription, and you\u2019re really going to need one if you want to take full advantage of the features on offer by the camera. It comes at $3 per month, and you\u2019ll get a three-month trial of it for free, and without it you won\u2019t get features like object detection, activity zones, and intelligent alerts. We recommend factoring it into your budget.",
    "The Arlo app was redesigned last year, and it\u2019s great. Generally speaking, it\u2019s very easy to navigate, even if you have multiple Arlo devices set up. It\u2019s split into four different sections, including a \u201cDevices\u201d section, where you\u2019ll see an overview of all your Arlo security devices; a \u201cLibrary\u201d section, which allows you to see recordings; a \u201cMode\u201d tab, where you can easily arm and disarm devices; and a \u201cSettings\u201d section.",
    "One of the first things you might want to do is set up how the app manages different modes. Sure, you could switch modes manually, but perhaps the easiest option is to switch modes automatically. This way, when you\u2019re at home you won\u2019t get calls every time someone rings the doorbell - only when you\u2019re away. It does require location access, but it\u2019s a very handy feature. You can also create custom modes, which is pretty handy, too.",
    "The Arlo Video Doorbell can integrate with your other smart home devices, but not as deeply as some might like. You\u2019ll get support for Google Assistant and Alexa, but there\u2019s no HomeKit support, despite the fact that other Arlo devices work with HomeKit. Hopefully HomeKit integration will come at some point."
