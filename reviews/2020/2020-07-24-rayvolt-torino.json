  "summary": "A head-turning e-bike with serious pedal power",
  "verdict": "The Rayvolt Torino is an intuitive commuter bike with enough presence and pedal power for you to carve your way through the city without breaking a sweat. The clever tech, customizable ride and great range make it a premium e-bike worthy of the price tag, but the hefty 35kg and chunky 26-inch wheels could be a deal-breaker for some.",
  "pros": [
    "Attention-grabbing design",
    "Smooth pedal assist power transfer",
    "Impressive range"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Weighty (not easy to store)",
    "Stiff ride",
    "Ride settings are only changeable via an app"

    "The Rayvolt Torino is one of the most high-tech, head-turning e-bikes out there. The intelligent pedal assist system, E-Regenerative braking, electronic torque sensors and an EIVA app that allows you to customise the ride to your liking, all adds up to an impressive and exhilarating experience.",
    "The Torino's standard 48V 504Wh battery pack offers a range of up to 25 miles, or when upgraded to a more powerful 48V 936Wh can breeze along for up to 50 miles, depending on the terrain. Take into account that the average daily driving distance is 25 miles and you\u2019ve got enough juice to get around the city, with no need to charge it on the daily.",
    "Designed in Barcelona, this e-bike has a bold, retro style. The 26-inch tyres, steel frame and combined weight of 35kg make for a sturdy ride (very reassuring for e-bike newbies). The pedal assist helps all this extra weight disappear, but if you\u2019re after something you can lift more easily, try the equally stylish Cruzer (24kg) or Ambassador (20kg).",
    "Best-suited for on-road cruising, the Torino makes light work of hill climbs and glides effortlessly alongside traffic. It\u2019s also great for leisurely rides across town with a handy accelerator mode to help you weave around runners and dog walkers, though venture too far off track and you\u2019ll be in for a bumpy ride as this e-bike has no suspension.",
    "The entry-level Torino will set you back \u00a33,360 (about $4,250 / AU$6060). Increase the battery and customize your design and you\u2019ll be looking north of \u00a33,900. This is a premium e-bike and you get what you pay for, including Rayvolt\u2019s bespoke \u2018white-glove\u2019 handover experience \u2013 personal delivery of your e-bike and an in-depth rundown of the features.",
    "Overall, the Rayvolt Torino is an intelligently designed e-bike that will bring excitement to your commute. With plenty of zip, it\u2019s agile enough to stand up against city traffic, but not one for a sharp turn or for lugging up stairs. If you\u2019re looking for a statement e-bike with performance to match, then the stylish Torino will suit you very well.",
    "The Torino was launched in Europe last year and came to the UK for summer 2020 \u2013 so this is one of the newest rides on the block. The brand\u2019s HQ is in Barcelona and there are hundreds of global dealers.",
    "You can choose from a 200-400w or 250-1000w motor, and a standard 504Wh or upgraded 936Wh lithium-ion battery to give you a range of up to 50 miles. Depending on the power you choose, the price ranges from \u00a33,360 (about $4,250 / AU$6,060) to \u00a33,960 (about $5,010 / AU$7,145).",
    "With hump-backed tubing, retro-style front light and chunky tyres, the Spanish-designed Torino feels more vintage cafe racer than e-bike. The handcrafted steel frame is accented with flashes of copper and leatherwork and you can choose from standard colour ways, or put your own stamp on the design with bespoke colour options and accessories.",
    "It\u2019s easy to set up thanks to the personal delivery service. With all this integrated tech and no gears to worry about, it\u2019s also pretty low maintenance \u2013 just a splash of oil on the chain from time to time. Rayvolt recommends an annual check and offers a free first-year check to riders.",
    "The Torino really stands out from the competition because of its lithium-ion battery pack options and its battery management system. Concealed in a leather-bound holder, opt for the larger battery pack and you\u2019ll get a consistent and high power output that lasts for double the range of the average modern plugin-hybrid car.",
    "The charging process is simple, but you\u2019ll need a socket near to where you store the bike as the battery isn\u2019t removable. The Torino comes armed with a 54V 4A Li ion smart charger, which plugs straight into the mains and into the battery compartment on the bike \u2013 charging from flat in around six hours.",
    "Dubbed \u2018the getaway bike\u2019, the Rayvolt Torino has near-silent power and impressive acceleration, guaranteed to put a smile on your face. One of the best electric bikes for urban commutes and leisurely weekend cruising, it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time as many of our travel and commuting habits are changing.",
    "The sheer power is down to its bespoke brushless three-phase DC motor, which delivers its oomph via a handy thumb throttle (dependent on your country\u2019s legislation) or through a sophisticated pedal assist system. Combining a gyroscopic sensor and a load sensor within the crankset it effortlessly measures your incline, the torque applied through the pedal and the crank\u2019s rotary speed. The result is seamless power delivery, no matter how intense \u2013 or lazy \u2013 your cycle.",
    "The wide tyres, low centre of gravity and rigid steel forks means you\u2019ll feel the bike biting reassuringly into the tarmac. However, the lack of suspension makes you keen to avoid the potholes and less-established paths. For a more comfortable ride, you can always drop the PSI in the tyres.",
    "When you need to stop in a hurry (hello, rogue pedestrian), the high-quality sealed mineral oil discs with E-Regenerative braking brings you to a smooth and controlled halt. This E-Gen tech \u2013 more often seen in electric cars \u2013 means that a subtle depression of the brake turns the smart hub motor into a generator that recharges your battery using the kinetic energy lost. Smart stuff.",
    "The EIVA app is a tech lover\u2019s dream, empowering you to fully customize the settings of your ride. Acceleration, top speed, braking power, pedal assist drive mode, throttle usage \u2013 you name it, you can tweak it. The only downside is this can be a bit fiddly if you want to switch up the settings mid-ride \u2013 you\u2019ll definitely make good use of the solid kickstand."
