  "summary": "This 8K camera outguns its 360 rivals for image quality, if not convenience...",
  "verdict": "8K is here, and it\u2019s going to be hard to settle for less from a 360 camera once you've seen what the Qoocam 8K can do. The first consumer 360 shooter where cut-down widescreen videos retain enough resolution to look impressive, the QooCam 8K is heavy and its app is somewhat lacking in polish. It may not be perfect, but peerless video quality means it outguns the GoPro Max and Insta360 One X for outright image quality. In the 360 action camera market, the ante just got upped.",
  "pros": [
    "Hi-res 360 video",
    "4K slo-mo",
    "Strong image stabilisation",
    "OLED preview touchscreen"

  "cons": [
    "Pricey",
    "Lacks waterproofing",
    "Relatively large size and weight",
    "Basic app"

    "8K video in a consumer 360 camera? It might sound like a vision of the future, but Hong Kong-based Kandao\u2019s QooCam 8K (US$589/UK\u00a3529/AUS$940) is here to change everything you know about 360 cameras.",
    "Can it create virtual reality (VR)-grade video? Sure, but it\u2019s big advantage over its rivals \u2013 the GoPro Max and the Insta360 One X \u2013 is that it allows 360-degree footage to be cut down to widescreen size without a horrendous loss in resolution.",
    "There are downsides to this added power \u2013 including the Qoocam 8K's size, price and lack of native waterproofing \u2013 but if you're prepared to compromise on those features, it more than gives the GoPro Max a run for its money.",
    "There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that the QooCam 8K is much larger than its 360 camera rivals.",
    "At 144x56x23mm and 228g, it\u2019s significantly bigger and more cumbersome. Inside is a large 3,000mAh built-in battery that has to work hard when the QooCam 8K is switched on. You can hear its processor buzzing away constantly.",
    "On both sides of the camera is a fisheye lens with f/2.0 aperture. One side hosts that OLED touchscreen, with the edges bearing a microSD card slot, a USB-C slot for recharging, and an output for attaching a microphone \u2013 on a 360 camera where the action may be taking place a long way from the camera, that\u2019s key.",
    "Also included in the box is a \u2018bumper\u2019-style protective style case. That\u2019s useful because the QooCam 8K is not natively drop-proof or waterproof. Also available is a waterproof case, which is an underwater housing for scuba diving.",
    "An essential add-on is Kandao\u2019s \u2018invisible\u2019 selfie stick (US$35/UK\u00a330/AUS$50), which comes complete with a small, spider-style tripod. It\u2019s a must-have if you want to take advantage of the QooCam 8K for vlogger-style video.",
    "The QooCam 8K does a lot of things that other 360 cameras don\u2019t. The first is obvious; it captures 8K video at 30fps and takes photos \u2013 in JPEG and the Raw format DNG \u2013 in 29.4MP thanks to its two 1/1.7-inch CMOS sensors.",
    "That\u2019s 7680x3840 pixels, though note that the extra resolution \u2013 while impressive \u2013 is spread throughout a 360-degree sphere. Its purpose is to increase the resolution of 360 video, of course, but in practice it enables filmmakers to video everything and re-frame in widescreen later without losing sharpness. Just as importantly, its big sensors mean more light and dynamic range.",
    "It can also shoot in a 4K/120 fps mode, which produces super-slo mo videos. All videos can be captured in 8-bit MP4 (H.264) and 10-bit ProRes formats.",
    "Yet another advantage over other most 360 cameras is its 2.4-inch color OLED touchscreen, which gives real-time previews of photos and videos (though that can also be done via the QooCam app). It\u2019s also got 64GB of built-in storage in addition to a microSD card slot (up to 256GB).",
    "The photos and videos coming out of the QooCam 8K are unequalled by any other consumer-grade 360 camera.",
    "Resolutions are limited to just two choices: 8K at 30fps and 4K at 120 fps mode for slo-mo. The results from both are sharp and imbued with plenty of dynamic contrast and color.",
    "Would we like more choices of resolutions? Yes, plus there\u2019s no easy way to reverse the slo-mo effect in 4K mode, which is a shame. However, we have no complaints about the extra resolution on offer, which vastly improves the quality of widescreen photos and videos cut-down from the 360 master.",
    "Powered by a built-in six-axis gyro, QooCam\u2019s \u2018SuperSteady\u2019 image stabilization works wonders and it\u2019s easy to produce smooth-looking vlogger-style videos using the selfie stick. The stick\u2019s use is automatically detected and it thus vanishes from the finished videos and photos.",
    "A slight issue is processing power; the QooCam 8K\u2019s processor is hungry, and despite having a large internal battery, it lasts little more than an hour. If you\u2019re out for a day shooting and using it only occasionally, practically speaking, that\u2019s about enough. As a bonus, its internal battery can be recharged via USB-C from a portable battery, so longer shoots are possible.",
    "Editing 8K video files on a phone? It might not sound fun, but luckily the QooCam 8K includes a nifty \u20184K Express Edit\u2019, which downscales everything for much easier workflow. Easier, yes, but not particularly quick.",
    "In the box are a bunch of cables to hook the QooCam 8K up to a variety of phones, though unless you have one of the latest phones with a big processor, you may encounter problems. Our Huawei Mate 20 X (5G) did fine, but transferring the files even via a cable proved slow work.",
    "The mostly impressive QooCam app enables some pretty comprehensive editing options, including \u2018SmartTrack\u2019 for keeping a subject in the middle of the frame. There are also options to trim videos, use various filters, and add music. Its long list of \u2018SmartClip\u2019 templates are initially tempting.",
    "Templates like \u2018Orbiting Hyperlapse\u2019, \u2018Surround Me\u2019, \u2018Rabbit Hole\u2019, \u2018Dolly Zoom\u2019 and even a basic \u2018Clip Merging\u2019 each come with a short tutorial and suggest that creating polished-looking novelty 360 videos \u2013 all as shareable widescreen videos \u2013 is very easy.",
    "In practice, even when we followed the tutorials, some of the templates did little more than kick-in manual editing mode. It\u2019s also very challenging to see which video clips in a library might be suitable for the various templates. However, producing short, edited videos in manual mode is not particularly difficult.",
    "Does the QooCam 8K trump the GoPro Max, GoPro Fusion, Insta360 One X and Insta360 One R? Yes, absolutely; once you\u2019ve filmed 360 footage in 8K resolution, it\u2019s impossible to go back.",
    "The downside is that it\u2019s not as convenient as any of those much smaller, niftier cameras, but 8K resolution gives you so much more quality to play with when editing.",
    "It\u2019s the first 360 camera where cut-down widescreen videos retain enough resolution to look good, and it does all that with excellent dynamic range, color and contrast for 8K photos as well as videos.",
    "The QooCam 8K is not perfect, but in the 360 video niche, the ante just got upped."
