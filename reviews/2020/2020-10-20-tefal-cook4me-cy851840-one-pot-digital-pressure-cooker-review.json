    "If you\u2019re stuck for meal inspiration, the Tefal Cook4Me+ CY851840 One-Pot Digital Pressure Cooker provides a fun and convenient solution. It comes with a host of recipe ideas to give you inspiration on what to cook for a mid-week speedy supper or lazy weekend meal, and recipes are accessible on both the built-in digital display and accompanying Cook4Me app \u2013 simply pop ingredients in and follow the step-by-step guides.",
    "Just like some of the best Instant Pots, its fast pressure-cooking functionality, you can conjure up impressive main courses and restaurant-worthy starters in half the time it would take you to traditionally cook \u2013 you\u2019ll find 50 on-board recipe ideas that can be cooked in less than 15 minutes, in fact.",
    "Described by Tefal as \u2018the Daddy of electric pressure cookers\u2019, the Tefal Cook4Me+ CY851840 One-Pot Digital Pressure is currently on sale down from \u00a3269.99 ($351 / AU$487) to \u00a3199.99 ($260 / AU$360) over on the Tefal website. You can currently find it priced at \u00a3169 ($220 / AU$304) on Amazon.",
    "For a Tefal model with specific slow cook setting however, consider the Tefal All-in-One CY505E40 electric pressure cooker, which costs \u00a399.99 ($130 / AU$180).",
    "At 38cm high, the black and chrome body of the Cook4Me+ is relatively compact compared to other competing multi-cooker designs and at 1450W it is also rather powerful. It comes with a stainless-steel steaming basket, which is very useful for cooking fruit and vegetables.",
    "On board it has a digital menu with settings for programmed recipes that you can follow step by step in real time. There are also manual settings for classic cooking (for tasks such as melting butter, simmering and browning) as well as pressure-cooking, steaming, reheating and keeping warm. The latter feature comes in handy when you\u2019re dealing with two supper \u2018sittings\u2019 \u2013 giving the kids a meal at 5pm, and then eating with your partner once they are (fingers crossed) in bed at 7.30pm, for example.",
    "Should you wish to prep in advance, there is also a delayed start button \u2013 up to 15 hours in fact for those who are super keen. It isn\u2019t recommended that you use this for fresh foods such as meat, milk, and eggs however, but it can be useful when cooking pasta and rice or steaming vegetables.",
    "The Cook4Me+\u2019s colorful LCD screen can be easily navigated using the single dial, and you can scroll through the 100 built-in recipes, for dishes such as Green Thai Chicken Curry and Sweet Chill Salmon. For more recipes you can download the Cook4Me app and search for a recipe with a particular ingredient through the 200-plus ideas. In the \u2018In my fridge\u2019 section, you can add the ingredients that are in your fridge and the app will suggest a suitable recipe \u2013 just for fun we typed in \u2018red wine\u2019 and it came up with nine recipe ideas including \u2018Bolognese Chef Style\u2019 and \u2018Pears in Red Wine\u2019 \u2013 you can then automatically add the ingredients to a handy shopping list on the app, for reference when you\u2019re in the supermarket.",
    "To find out how useful the Tefal Cook4Me+ is in terms of functionality, ergonomics and efficiency, we used it to make a delicious Lamb Rogan Josh Curry with rice. We searched the app for this lamb recipe, which features canned tomatoes, onions, rogan josh paste, and a diced leg of lamb diced.",
    "The rice took an impressive nine minutes after we popped it into the bowl and followed the simple instructions to cover with water (although it didn\u2019t say how much) and press start. The result was light and fluffy rice. Job done.",
    "One thing to remember is that the pressure valve will release steam at random intervals, so you need to make sure there are no restrictions such as a kitchen cabinet above the pot so there is plenty of room for the steam to escape.",
    "We found that, as expected in a pressure cooker, quite a bit of water runs off the lid when you open it after the cooking cycle. On this design however, the dew runs neatly around the rim of the bowl so it doesn\u2019t leak onto the worktop. At the end of the cycle the Cook4Me+ told us to empty the dew collector. The two cool-touch handles are also well thought out as they make it easy to remove the pan from the cooker to serve.",
    "To make the Lamb Rogan Josh Curry the digital display walked us through the initial browning of the onions and meat \u2013 conveniently inside the pan \u2013 and then we closed the lid and left the pressure cooker work its magic. In just 35 minutes we could enjoy a curry dish with surprisingly tender meat."
