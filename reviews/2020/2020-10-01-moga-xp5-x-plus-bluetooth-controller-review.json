    "Despite the new console hype, the future of gaming sits not solely with the likes of the Xbox Series X or the PS5, but in the cloud, with subscription services and data centers doing the heavy lifting, and our lower-powered mobile devices acting as the conduit to our remote gaming hosts.",
    "From Google Stadia to GeForce Now to Amazon Luna, game streaming is now commonplace (though still not perfected), and to take proper advantage of it, you need a controller fit for the job.",
    "The MOGA XP5-X Plus is perhaps the most capable of all the mobile controllers we\u2019ve seen so far \u2013 designed specifically with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass Streaming for Android in mind (though, being a Bluetooth controller, it\u2019ll work with any gamepad-supporting gaming app) it ticks pretty much every box you can think of.",
    "Housing your phone in an adjustable cradle, it essentially mirrors an official Xbox One controller (while adding a couple of additional customizable buttons too), and includes a built in battery for charging your mobile device while in play.",
    "It\u2019s comfortable to use, its buttons and weight feel like Microsoft\u2019s own excellent controller, and the addition of a battery pack is a genius extra. Being developed with Samsung phones in mind, the cradle can interfere with the volume rocker of some phone brands\u2019 designs.",
    "It can also be confusing remembering which of the controllers two USB ports are responsible for either charging the controller, your device, or making a wired connection between your phone and the pad.",
    "Those issues aside, it\u2019s the most complete mobile controller we\u2019ve yet tried, and comes heartily recommended.",
    "The MOGA XP5-X Plus is available now, and costs $69.99 / \u00a369.99. That seems quite expensive for a control pad, but when you factor in that removable gaming clips for phones, and battery packs, each cost upwards of $10 / \u00a310, it evens out a bit. Remember that the pad is compatible with PC, too, so can serve a dual purpose.",
    "If you\u2019ve ever used an Xbox One controller, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re getting here. There are four face buttons (X, Y, A, B), a D-Pad, two clicky thumb sticks, a view button, menu button, Xbox button, two shoulder buttons and two triggers. These all feel great, and have a nearly-identical amount of travel and resistance as the inputs you\u2019d find on a regular Xbox One controller, with a dark grey and green design in keeping with the Xbox aesthetic.",
    "It\u2019s where the package differs from the standard Xbox controller that things get interesting. Beneath the right thumbstick is a toggle to turn off or on the controller\u2019s internal battery charging pack, which can be used to charge your mobile phone when in use. Just under the D-Pad is a button that fires up four small LEDs, each representing battery level in 25% increments.",
    "Both wireless and wired connectivity modes are offered up, and can be switched between with a toggle under the Xbox button.",
    "Finally, there are two clicky buttons hidden away where your fingers rest on the controller\u2019s grips \u2013 they can be totally ignored, or programmed for any function of your choosing by holding a button under the battery toggle, pushing your desired input, and then pushing the assignable button you want to attribute it to.",
    "It\u2019s a fantastic controller that feels great in the hand, with useful added functionality. However, you may initially find it confusing to find two separate USB inputs (one standard, one micro) on the rear of the controller. One is used for charging the device and making a wired connection to the pad, and the other lets you charge your phone from the battery pack.",
    "The controller comes with cables of all kinds, for both charging and connecting both micro USB and USB-C phones, as well as charging the controller itself, and figuring out which combination of port and cable is required for each function is a bit of a puzzle initially. Moga doesn\u2019t disclose the size of the battery pack in its controller, and we wouldn\u2019t rely on it for marathon streaming sessions, such is the drain on a device\u2019s battery.",
    "What is nice and simple though, is the included removable phone clip. It\u2019s pretty much identical to the sold-separately PowerA Moga phone clip, which is pretty much the best that money can buy. It\u2019ll house phones up to 79mm (3.12 inches) wide, and has two locking points of articulation that cover a range of 270 degrees of movement.",
    "It makes balancing the weight of your phone and finding the right angle to view its screen at a cinch. Note though that it\u2019s been made with the latest Samsung phones in mind, so you may find some other phones fit slightly more awkwardly \u2013 my Pixel 3XL for instance had its volume rocker button pushed unless the phone was placed inside at just the right point."
