    "The EKSA E900 Pro 7.1 Virtual Surround Sound 2-in-1 Gaming Headset is a high-quality budget headset. It has an ergonomic design and comes with detachable USB and 3.5mm cables, meaning you can plug it in to your Switch, PS4, Xbox One S and X, tablet, smartphone, as well as Mac and, of course, PC.",
    "The E900 Pro looks good in sleek black and red, and clamps nicely to your head. The frame is aluminum, not plastic, so it should stand up to some abuse. It\u2019s sturdy and there\u2019s a good amount of range movement, meaning it should fit you even if you have big hair or an unusually large head.",
    "It\u2019s comfortable to wear, with soft, well-padded leather earpads. These are detachable, so you can replace them if you need to. The earpads fit well over the ear, and should be comfortable for most ear sizes and shapes.",
    "The E900 Pro has physical volume, play/pause and mute controls built into it. It\u2019s not heavy, and isn\u2019t big and bulky, which means it should feel comfortable to wear for long periods of time.",
    "You can detach the mic, which with its noise-canceling tech will make sure your voice is heard by filtering out background noise. It\u2019s omnidirectional, sounds great and is simple to attach; just plug it in to the microphone socket, bend it to the most comfortable angle for you and voila, you\u2019re good to go.",
    "To experience the headphones\u2019 7.1 surround sound, you need to use the USB cable, which at 1.9m is a decent length. It\u2019s long enough to reach your PC even if it\u2019s on the floor without tethering you like a dog with a cruel owner. It might be a little long, though, for convenient use on the go with your phone.",
    "We tested the E900 Pro on PC, PS4, and tablet, playing games, watching shows and listening to music. The headset remains comfortable and doesn\u2019t get sweaty or uncomfortable after hours of use. It\u2019s also kind to your ears, with a warm bass-rich sound that doesn\u2019t irritate after a while.",
    "Price-wise, the E900 Pro weighs in at value-for-money $49.99 (\u00a339, AU$70) on eksa.net. You can spend $100 on a headset and not get more than you get here. In fact, some budget gaming headsets can be more expensive and offer poorer specs.",
    "The headset comes with red LEDs, which complement the color scheme, but some might prefer RGB. Considering everything you get for the price point, though, this is absolutely forgivable. Bear in mind, the LEDs are only available when connecting via USB.",
    "To use the E900 Pro\u2019s surround sound feature, you\u2019ll need to download EKSA\u2019s Windows-only drivers. It comes with an app that lets you straightforwardly control basic features like panning and volume. Aside from this download, the E900 Pro is simple to use and set up. You can\u2019t fold it to make it easier to travel with, but it does come with a cool leather carry bag.",
    "The E900 Pro is certainly an improvement on the previous E900 model which has the same mic, but doesn\u2019t come with LEDs or virtual surround sound."
