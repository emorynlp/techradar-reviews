  "summary": "Screen on the front, screen on the back",
  "verdict": "The Nubia Z20\u2019s second screen may not add a whole lot to the device, but the phone doesn\u2019t really need it \u2013 it\u2019s a fine mid-range phone with a great main screen, useful cameras, and snappy processing speed. Most users might find they\u2019re paying for a screen they don\u2019t use, though, so we can\u2019t recommend it for everyone.",
  "pros": [
    "Great-looking screen",
    "Decent camera array",
    "Impressive chipset"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Battery leaves a lot to be desired",
    "Second screen doesn\u2019t revolutionize experience",
    "No headphone jack"

    "The Nubia Z20 has a screen on the front and another, smaller one on the rear. Is this an attempt to increase screen space, like dual-display devices or foldable phones? Or a solution to the full-screen \u2018problem\u2019? (As the smaller screen is nestled under the rear camera array, so there\u2019s no need for a snapper on the front). Perhaps it\u2019s both.",
    "The Nubia Z20, from tech company ZTE, is partly the successor to the Nubia Z18, as part of the brand\u2019s confusingly-named range, but it\u2019s similar to the Nubia X from 2018 which also had a screen on the back.",
    "It\u2019s easy to pigeon-hole the ZTE Nubia Z20 as \u2018the phone with a screen on the back\u2019, and it\u2019s certainly an interesting gimmick, but to condense the handset down to this one feature is to ignore all its other strengths.",
    "The phone has a three-camera array led by a 48MP sensor; this isn\u2019t just an attempt for the device to look good on paper, either, as the Z20 takes good-looking pictures with that snapper as well as its ultra-wide and telephoto siblings. These snappers double as your selfie cameras too, although curiously when in selfie-mode some of the modes are absent.",
    "The main display and chipset are good too, especially for the price tag, which is decidedly mid-range. So you\u2019d have a good time with the Nubia Z20 whether or not you use the second screen, although whether you\u2019ll be happy paying for this extra display is another matter entirely.",
    "The ZTE Nubia Z20 is available to buy for $549 / \u00a3499 / AU$670, so it\u2019s a decently-priced mid-range phone, and you can pick it up for a similar price to some of its contemporaries like the OnePlus 7T ($499 / \u00a3469, roughly AU$750).",
    "The phone is available from Nubia\u2019s website as well as Amazon, though we haven\u2019t seen any carriers selling it, so you may have to pick it up SIM-free. It was made available at the end of 2019.",
    "The Nubia Z20 has a screen on both sides of the device, but we\u2019ll refer to the \u2018front\u2019 as the side without the camera array on it. This side has a screen taking up the majority of the space, although there\u2019s a bit more bezel around the sides than on a more premium device. This display is also curved, lending a high-end feel to the phone.",
    "On the back there\u2019s the smaller screen, housed under a horizontal camera bump (although \u2018bump\u2019 might be an exaggeration, since it barely sticks out from the back of the phone). Then, in the chin under this second display, is Nubia\u2019s logo.",
    "An interesting design aspect of the Nubia Z20 is that there\u2019s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on both sides of the device. Not only does this make it easy to unlock the screen whether you\u2019re using the front or back display, but it\u2019s also very useful for left-handed people who want to pick up and unlock the device with their primary hand.",
    "These side fingerprint sensors also double as the power button, so it\u2019s incredibly easy to unlock the device, and we\u2019re big fans of phones that use this method of opening (the Honor 20 for example also has a side-mounted scanner/power button combo).",
    "On the right hand side of the phone (when you\u2019re looking at the primary screen) there\u2019s also a volume rocker, just above the fingerprint sensor.",
    "There\u2019s a USB-C port at the bottom of the handset, but no 3.5mm headphone jack, so if you\u2019re a fan of wired headphones you\u2019ll have to use the adapter in the box.",
    "You\u2019d expect a phone bedecked with multiple screens to feel pretty fragile, but the Nubia Z20 felt particularly robust, and in our time with the phone we never felt at risk of damaging it. It\u2019s likely not compatible with many cases though.",
    "The ZTE Nubia Z20\u2019s \u2018front\u2019 display is a 6.42-inch AMOLED screen, with a 1080 x 2340 resolution and HDR10. Content viewed on this is pretty good looking, thanks to the resolution and the AMOLED screen tech, which really makes colors pop.",
    "There\u2019s an impressive collection accessibility features present in the device too, thanks to the display. For example, if you squeeze the phone (and therefore tap both sides of the curved display), you trigger a mappable function (which we choose to use to access the camera). This turns a common gripe with curved-screen phones into a useful function.",
    "There are also gestures that change how you switch between the different screens, either by tilting the phone or tapping a certain button, and the option of an always-on display for either the front or back panel. However, we never managed to actually get this latter feature to work.",
    "Then on the back there\u2019s a 5.1-inch AMOLED screen with a 720 x 1520 resolution, and as those specs suggest this isn\u2019t exactly the best for viewing content, compared to the front display. This was a little bit of an issue for certain functions of the second screen, but wasn\u2019t too bad for others.",
    "A common question we were asked when testing the ZTE Nubia Z20 was \u2018why do you need two screens?\u2019, and after using the device for a few weeks we have a few answers, although we\u2019re not sure if any of them justify the extra cost of it.",
    "The main use of the second screen is so you can use the rear camera array to take selfies, and while the display is a little too small and low-res to make this as convenient as using a standard front-facing selfie-cam, it still works.",
    "A much more practical use is the ability to send notifications to the rear screen, or open separate apps on it to the front screen. This makes it easy to deal with a message, for example, or temporarily jump to a second app without disrupting work on the first.",
    "For example, when taking a flight we delegated our digital boarding pass to the second screen, so when we needed it we could easily turn the phone over and have the boarding pass ready, without having to worry about finding it.",
    "Sure, these functions are quite convenient, as is viewfinder mode in the camera app, which lets the subject of pictures see what you\u2019re snapping, and we enjoyed the ability to use them, but we\u2019re not sure the possibility would be a big enough draw to convince someone to buy the handset.",
    "The main camera on the ZTE Nubia Z20 is a 48MP f/1.7 one, and it\u2019s joined by an 8MP f/2.4 telephoto shooter which supports 3x optical zoom, and a 16MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera.",
    "These are, of course, also the cameras you use for selfies, although curiously most of the functions of the rear cameras aren\u2019t available when you press that \u2018switch\u2019 button in the camera to activate the rear screen to take selfies.",
    "You can work around this, by toggling the viewfinder function which lets you see on the rear screen what you\u2019re about to take a picture of, then using the volume rocker as a shutter button. However this is a bit of a pain, and we wish the functions would be available even in selfie mode.",
    "Our brief sweeping statement on the Nubia Z20\u2019s cameras is that the hardware is pulling all the weight, while the software lets the side down a little bit. This results in pictures that are still good, which is why \u2018decent camera array\u2019 is in our list of pros, but \u2018decent\u2019 isn\u2019t quite \u2018amazing\u2019.",
    "Pictures taken with the ultra-wide, main and telephoto cameras are all decent, with little to no distortion on the ulta-wide (whereas some such lenses create pictures that are rippled at the sides) and good quality even when zoomed on the telephoto (another issue some phone cameras have). Colors on photos look a little pale, but nothing to turn your nose up at.",
    "However where another smartphone camera might have software that makes decent pictures great, there isn\u2019t too much software at work in the ZTE Nubia Z20, which means those decent pictures stay at just that.",
    "As a result, colors don\u2019t really pop as much as they should, and images ended up a little duller than we\u2019d have liked.",
    "The fact the software is the main issue is also evident when looking at different camera modes. For example, both Portrait and Night modes don\u2019t make a huge difference to shots generally.",
    "If you find the right subject and framing, then you can take Portrait shots that effectively blur the background but not the subject, or Night shots that are noticeably brighter, but after lots of testing we only took a few shots where these option modes made much of a difference.",
    "Unlike hardware, software can be changed by a company over time, so it\u2019s possible that with updates and tweaks the ZTE Nubia Z20 will take great pictures. But at the time of testing, the photos we could take were good, not great.",
    "If you like video recording, you might be in for a shock with the Nubia Z20, because not only can you shoot in 4K 60fps (a rarity in mid-range smartphones), there\u2019s actually an 8K shooting mode, technically making the phone beat the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Xiaomi Mi 10 to be the first with this feature, as it launched before those phones.",
    "This 8K mode isn\u2019t something we\u2019d recommend though, as the frame rate was incredibly low, so videos shot are honestly pretty hard to watch. Videos shot in 4K, or even 1080p, were fine for use though, and it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll even have a screen that can display 8K content.",
    "The ZTE Nubia Z20 comes with the Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset, which was the top Android chipset available when it was released (although in early 2020 phones started coming with its successor, the 865). This provides some pretty decent processing power, as you\u2019d imagine. It\u2019s paired with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.",
    "In a Geekbench 5 benchmarking test, the ZTE Nubia Z20 returned a multi-core score of 2,411, beating 2019 phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10 range, but not quite matching the Sony Xperia 5 or OnePlus 7T Pro, which were just ahead.",
    "With the Nubia Z20, though, you\u2019re not going to be pining for more processing power, because it\u2019s just fine as is. Games ran smooth on high graphics, and we never had an issue with lagging or slow loading.",
    "The Nubia Z20 runs Android 9, with Nubia UI 7 laid over the top, and of all the Chinese-made custom UIs that run on phones from the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Oppo, this is definitely one of the best \u2013 it\u2019s free of annoying bloatware, easy to navigate, and with a settings menu that\u2019s a lot more logically laid out than on many other handsets.",
    "One slight issue though is the \u2018second-screen button\u2019, which is always present on the screen. You can choose what this does, depending on how you toggle the second screen: if you select the option that lets you tilt the main screen forward to open the second screen, this button locks that function so you can\u2019t accidentally switch screens, but you can also make the button simply open the second screen if you find this an easier way of getting the second screen working.",
    "Either way, the button is always on the screen, and while you can drag it about to move it out the way, we often found it a little annoying having to move the icon around depending on what we were doing. Perhaps a physical button to change screens would have been more convenient.",
    "If you choose the aforementioned \u2018tilt\u2019 way of switching screens, the phone can sometimes be a little oversensitive and swap screens even when you don\u2019t want it to, so we\u2019d recommend staying in lock mode if you don\u2019t want this other display turning off and on.",
    "The Nubia Z20 has a 4,000mAh battery, which is a fair size for a mid-range smartphone, although we came to wish the power pack was a little bigger, as it didn\u2019t last us as long as we\u2019d like.",
    "With light use, the phone could make it through a day, but if we were to play games, stream content, or spend lots of time on social media, we\u2019d usually have to top the phone up towards the end of the day.",
    "This relatively short battery life is likely a result of the high screen quality, and when we used the second screen for day-to-day activities instead it did feel like the battery was lasting a little better, likely thanks to its smaller size and lower resolution.",
    "Charging is done with 27W fast charging, which feels rather standard for a smartphone at this price point. It will get your phone fully charged in less than an hour, but since the battery life isn\u2019t great this powering speed feels like the bare minimum."
