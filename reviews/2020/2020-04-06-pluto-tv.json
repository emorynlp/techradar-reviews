  "summary": "It\u2019s not going to overtake Netflix, but Pluto TV has a surprising catalog of *free* TV shows and movies",
  "verdict": "Pluto TV is a surprising combination of cable and YouTube channels that presents a lot of variety for a free streaming service. Its many performance issues and lack of mainstream channel providers prevent it from being a free alternative to Sling TV or YouTube TV, but if you just want to binge on some brainless shows like Jersey Shore or Tosh.0, this ad-supported streaming service is a great solution.",
  "pros": [
    "Free service with no signup necessary",
    "Works on a number of devices",
    "250+ channels"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "The ads, obviously",
    "No local channels",
    "Periodic performance issues"
  ],
  "article": [
    "In the world of online video streaming, your options are pretty much endless. It\u2019s the domain YouTube ruled for years (and still does) while newcomers like Facebook Video have jostled for a mere slice of the pie.",
    "But in the category of legitimate cable replacement services, your options dwindle down to just a few key players - even fewer of which are free.",
    "That\u2019s the niche pocket where Pluto TV - an ad-supported streaming service from Viacom, the owners of MTV, Nickelodeon and more - feels it can change the game.",
    "Instead of ditching traditional cable channels for internet streams or vice-versa, Pluto TV mashes them together - giving you hundreds of channels of content you can flip through without having to drop a single dime of your own money. Better yet, Pluto TV even gives you access to a number of on-demand movies and some major news networks, perfect for throwing on in the background of your home office.",
    "The problem with this setup? Well, you\u2019ll have to contend with ads, obviously, and miss out on local channels that you\u2019d get from a paid service like Sling TV or YouTube TV. Moreover you\u2019ll have to contend with periodic performance issues and a library of channels that tends to skew more niche than it does appeal to the general public.",
    "All said, if you can live with all that and you can pry yourself away from Netflix\u2019s arsenal of original content for two minutes, Pluto TV is well worth checking out - even if it\u2019s just for an afternoon.",
    "Pluto TV began as a service back in 2014 and has grown immensely over the years. Originally it was just available in the US, but starting in September 2019, it became available on mobile platforms in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, too. Content is likely to be different in those countries (our review was written using the US catalogue) but it\u2019s fair to expect comparable features, device support and bugs across the board.",
    "One of the best things Pluto TV has going for it is its platform agnosticism - it\u2019s a service that works on pretty much every major smart TV and streaming device, including game consoles, mobile devices and, when all else fails, web browsers as well.",
    "Here\u2019s the complete list of supported devices from Pluto TV\u2019s support website:",
    "To get started with it, download the Pluto TV app on whichever device you\u2019d like and you can begin streaming without needing to register - a huge perk of the service.",
    "What you\u2019ll find at the top of the 250+ channel listings are the channels Pluto TV is currently pushing. At the time of writing, that includes a 007 Channel that shows James Bond films 24 hours a day, the NFL Network, Movie Channel, Animals, VH1 Reality and Investiga, a Spanish language investigation network with crime dramas. Scroll down and you\u2019ll find 240 more channels to choose from, some of which we\u2019ll talk about in more detail below.",
    "The one benefit to signing up for the service is that it allows you to save your favorite channels at the top - which is great if you plan on using the service daily and know you want to see ABC News and don\u2019t want to scroll through 50 channels to get to it.",
    "Over the last six years since Pluto TV first started streaming, the service has made a number of lucrative deals with some of the biggest content providers in Hollywood and beyond. First and foremost, that includes a huge swath of the CBSViacom library of content - namely MTV, BET, Spike, Comedy Central plus Nickelodeon. Pluto TV also has a number of breakout channels from some of the top shows from those networks. Tosh.0 has its own channel, for example, as does Crank Yankers, Degrassi and Dora the Explorer.",
    "On top of that, you\u2019ll have a number of great news and sports channels from CNN, NBC, CBS, Bloomberg, Sky and FOX. The catch here is that these networks aren\u2019t always live - in fact every time we\u2019ve tuned into them they\u2019ve been showing content from earlier in the day. That\u2019s all well and good if you\u2019re just trying to get a general idea of what\u2019s happening in the world, but it probably won\u2019t suffice if you need up-to-the-minute information about a situation. The same is true for the sports channels that, more often that not, are showing games from last year - and in some cases several years prior.",
    "While Pluto TV is clearly not the go-to place for news and sports, it does have a lot of entertainment content, particularly for niche audiences. In its Tech + Geek section you\u2019ll find an IGN channel that cobbles together let\u2019s play-style videos and reviews, as well a straight-up Naruto channel that only shows episodes of Naruto... which is actually pretty cool.",
    "At any point in your TV watching experience you can switch over to the On Demand tab of the Pluto TV player where you\u2019ll find a number of on-demand movies and series. As a caveat, you probably shouldn\u2019t go in expecting world-class cinema here - what\u2019s on offer is more or less the schlock that either went straight-to-DVD or didn\u2019t do super well at the box office, but there are a few gems here like the Bond movies that are currently getting featured. Otherwise expect to see films like Aeon Flux, Paranormal Activity 4 and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot with Tina Fey, all of which have some level of name recognition, but probably not enough that you\u2019d pay to see them. It\u2019s a similar story for the TV show selection with a few notable exceptions like One Punch Man, Anthony Bourdain\u2019s No Reservations and Hell\u2019s Kitchen that are more akin to what you\u2019d see on a paid service like Netflix surrounded by a bunch of content that you may or may not want to watch.",
    "According to the most recent numbers from Viacom, Pluto TV has about 22 million average monthly viewers. That pales in comparison to Netflix\u2019s 167 million paying subscribers - many of whom use the service every month - but it\u2019s still a surprising amount.",
    "We float that number out there because it\u2019s important to provide context for the service\u2019s performance that starts out in a low resolution and slowly ramps up. There's a single channel that's available in 4K (conveniently called 4K TV) but don\u2019t expect to see 4K or even Full HD resolution throughout the service anytime soon. As it stands now, the service peaks somewhere around HD quality.",
    "Like traditional cable you can expect commercials every eight minutes or so and expect them to last between 30 seconds and two minutes. It feels like the commercials stay on longer the more you watch - which would make sense logistically - but we\u2019ll need to collect more data before we can say that with any certainty.",
    "Commercials are expected, but the playback issues we experienced weren\u2019t. While this often takes the form of downgraded resolution and artifacting, the service can also experience more catastrophic failures like showing you the same part of a film three times before cutting to a commercial\u2026 which was really awful. The streaming portion of the website performs slightly better than the on-demand section, weirdly, but neither live up to the high bar set by other services like YouTube and Netflix.",
    "At the end of the day it can be tough to categorize Pluto TV. On one hand, it\u2019s not exactly a live TV service in the same way that YouTube TV and Sling TV are. On the other, it\u2019s not just the kind of content you\u2019d find on YouTube, either. It\u2019s an ambitious blend between the two formats that\u2019s made available to the public free of charge. And that\u2019s really respectable.",
    "The downside here is that the channels aren\u2019t always live and do skew towards niche genres and B-movies. There\u2019s not a ton of flagship content available, and Pluto TV doesn\u2019t have any original series that you can\u2019t find somewhere else. Tack on the occasional performance issue and you\u2019re left a middling service that works for a very specific user.",
    "But hey, you get what you pay for."
