  "summary": "A really basic VPN with exorbitant prices",
  "verdict": "Insorg VPN is way too expensive for what it offers, or rather what it doesn\u2019t offer. There are no native clients except for Windows, the customer support is very poor, and it has a rather tiny server network. Its speeds aren\u2019t impressive either. The only thing that was good was the level of privacy ensured by multiple VPN chains.",
  "pros": [
    "Multiple VPN chains",
    "Lots of subscription options"

  "cons": [
    "Ridiculously expensive",
    "Poor customer service",
    "Client only for Windows"

    "Active since 2009, Insorg VPN is a VPN provider that offers access to its small server network mainly through third-party software like OpenVPN GUI and TunnelBlick. It stands out for its single, double, triple, quadro, and even penta VPN chain connections, meaning there are multiple levels of privacy protection.",
    "However, it does have some disadvantages which is why we recommend giving a chance to one of the best VPN providers on the market.",
    "This VPN provider offers two subscription packages - Lite and Pro. The Lite package provides access to servers in only seven countries for the duration of one month, at the cost of $7/month. The Pro subscription will get you access to servers in 26 countries and you can select among multiple durations.",
    "The shortest is the 1-day option at $1.3, followed by the 1-week at $7.5, and then the 1-month one at $20. The 3-month subscription will cost you $55, the 6-month one $105, while the longest, 1-year option will set you back by a staggering $190, which equals to a very high $15.83/month. This makes it unusually expensive, more than even the best options on the market. There\u2019s also an option to get VPN (PPTP or OpenVPN) with the dedicated IP at a monthly price of $20.",
    "Under one account, users can simultaneously protect up to three devices. Accepted payment methods include cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC, ZEC), Perfect Money, Webmoney, Yandex money, Qiwi, credit card, or Paypal.",
    "This VPN vendor gives you very limited options to try the service out before paying so much, and you\u2019ll have to contact the customer support to get it. The trial lasts only one hour, even though we found information on the website that says this period is two hours, and were even told by the customer support agent that the test period was three hours, only to be told again that it was two. When we downloaded the app, it said we only had one hour to use it.",
    "Insorg also has a 100% money-back guarantee but you\u2019ll need to ask for it within 72 hours after the payment, which is unusually short as well.",
    "Considering just how expensive and flawed Insorg VPN is, we believe you should rather go for one of the many cheaper but better options, like NordVPN, CyberGhost, or IPVanish.",
    "Even the best VPN service on the market, ExpressVPN, costs half as much as Insorg and it\u2019s miles ahead of it in almost every way.",
    "Insorg VPN\u2019s customer support agent was very vague when we tried to find out if the platform can unblock the popular streaming channels like Netflix or BBC iPlayer, so it\u2019s safe to assume it either doesn\u2019t or cannot guarantee it.",
    "Insorg VPN\u2019s owner company, as well as its location, is a mystery, and we couldn\u2019t get it out of the customer support either. Judging by the website\u2019s live chat and the option to switch the language from English to Russian, its location is probably Russia.",
    "You won\u2019t get plenty of servers with this provider, only up to 34, depending on the chosen package. However, according to the website, all of its \u201cVPN servers are dedicated, not virtual VPS servers as cheap VPN services have.\u201d The servers are scattered across 17 countries, including in Romania, Turkey, Russia, Panama, and Malaysia.",
    "This service supports OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP/IPSec, and PPTP connection protocols. Different levels of encryption are used in different connection options. Therefore, the basic OpenVPN connection, Double VPN, Triple VPN, and OpenVPN with dedicated IP all use 4096-bit encryption, while PPTP VPN and PPTP VPN with dedicated IP use 128-bit encryption.",
    "No information was provided when we asked about whether we could use the service for torrenting, so if you do, you\u2019d be doing it at your own discretion.",
    "The privacy policy is strikingly short. We only learn that the provider doesn\u2019t \u201ccollect statistics, logs of user\u2019s activity on the VPN servers.\u201d It also adds that it doesn\u2019t share your email address, password, username, or subscription choice with any parties, nor does it store your email correspondence and \u201cinformation on your account on our VPN servers\u201d, finishing it with a statement that \u201cWe do not monitor your Internet activity.\u201d It\u2019s hard to conclude anything from such a short privacy policy, and we aren\u2019t told many other important details, such as are other things that may or may not be logged, like connection times, device identifiers, operating system, or even IP addresses. Also, it is impossible to tell if the provider speaks the truth about its no-logging policy to begin with, unless they bring an outside auditor to confirm it.",
    "Insorg VPN supports use on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux, but it only has a native client for Windows. As for the other platforms, you\u2019ll have to make do with OpenVPN and PPTP configuration files.",
    "You can contact customer support via online chat, contact form, ICQ, Jabber and email, but be ready to wait forever for a response via the latter. Also, the customer support agent we talked to via online chat was a bit dismissive and gave us conflicting information.",
    "The Windows app is extremely basic, making it also extremely easy to use. Just choose your desired location and how many VPN chains you want the connection to go through, click Connect, and you\u2019re good to go - the app connects in a few seconds.",
    "We tried connecting to a server in Austria and got some modest results concerning download speeds - barely reaching 16Mbps on a 55Mbps test connection. The more VPN chains we added, the lower the speeds were. So the TripleVPN option for Austria gave us 9Mbps, QuadroVPN 8.45Mbps, and PentaVPN 5.52Mbps. As for the SingleVPN connection to one of the servers in the US, we were surprised that the speeds didn\u2019t diverge much from Austria - with 14.24Mbps. However, the server in Japan hailed a very low 1.71Mps.",
    "Insorg VPN leaves much to be desired. Other than the VPN chains and bullet-proof privacy for which the company charges a hefty price, there really isn\u2019t much to look forward to. There aren\u2019t any native clients except for Windows, the server network is very small, there\u2019s no guaranteed support for torrenting and Netflix, and customer communication is on a very low level.",
    "Considering all of this, a first-class performer such as ExpressVPN would certainly be a better choice, providing the best service in the business at half the price of Insorg VPN."
