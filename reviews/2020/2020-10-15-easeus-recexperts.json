    "If you\u2019re creating webinars or need to record videos on your computer, EaseUS RecExperts is one of the best screen recorders around. This capable software enables you to capture a specific subset of your screen, easily overlay video from a webcam, and record audio on top of it all. RecExperts supports 4K recording and comes with a variety of handy features to make your videos more impactful.",
    "In our EaseUS RecExperts review, we\u2019ll cover everything you need to know about this software to decide if it\u2019s right for you.",
    "EaseUS RecExperts costs $11.97 per month, $23.97 per year, or $69.95 for life. This pricing only includes a single license for one computer. Note that you can also try out the software for free. The trial software limits you to recordings up to two minutes and adds a watermark to your videos.",
    "RecExperts is packed with features to make it easy to create advanced screen recordings. To start, you can record video up to 4K resolution. That might not be necessary for a webinar, but it\u2019s a big draw for gamers who want to share session recordings. RecExperts also enables you to change the frame rate when recording games, up to 60 frames per second.",
    "Importantly, RecExperts captures more than just your screen. You can use the software to capture audio from your computer\u2019s built-in microphone or from any microphone you connect to your system. It will also record system sounds, which is another plus for gamers.",
    "If you want to record a video of yourself, RecExperts handles that, too. The software will capture video from your webcam and overlay it on top of your video. The settings enable you to choose which corner of your screen capture the webcam video is overlaid on, the resolution of the webcam recording, and whether it appears as a circle or square.",
    "EaseUS also has two handy features for managing special recordings: auto stop and task scheduler. The auto stop function enables you to start a recording and then walk away. EaseUS will automatically stop recording after a set time limit or when the video file reaches a desired size. It can even put your computer to sleep or shut it down after the recording is saved. The task scheduler offers the same functionality, except that you can also start a screen capture without being at your computer.",
    "Using EaseUS is incredibly easy. The software auto-detects your computer\u2019s webcam and microphone, as well as any additional recording devices you connect via audio jack or USB. There are four modes for recording your screen, a gaming session, audio, or a webcam-only video.",
    "If you want to shrink your recording window rather than capture your full screen, it\u2019s easy to do so. The software enables you to drag crop bars to change the capture area, or you can lock the capture to a common resolution like 1080p or 720p.",
    "When you start a recording, the software gives you a three-second countdown to prepare. You can take advantage of several tools within the recording that enable you to spotlight or zoom in on a portion of your screen. There\u2019s also an annotate function, which includes a series of drawing and text tools so that you can use your screen like a whiteboard.",
    "Once videos are finished recording, they\u2019re visible in a playlist inside the RecExperts desktop app. There\u2019s a built-in video player with some basic editing capabilities so that you can trim and watermark your clips as well as add intros and outros. This is nice to have, but it\u2019s worth noting that some other screen recorders come with much more advanced editing suites. When your video is finished, you can launch an upload to YouTube, Vimeo, Dropbox, or Google Drive from inside the desktop app.",
    "EaseUS provides support for RecExperts by email and live chat from 9 am to 5:30 pm Eastern, Monday to Friday. The company has a large online knowledgebase, but it\u2019s largely dedicated to other software. We found just one support article for RecExperts explaining some of the software\u2019s hotkeys.",
    "There aren\u2019t any security features built into RecExperts to speak of. The software has a tool for compressing video files, but you\u2019ll need third-party software if you want to encrypt them.",
    "RecExperts is excellent screen recording software, but if you\u2019re looking for more bells and whistles you might be interested in Camtasia or Flashback Pro. Camtasia has a number of options for animating your video recordings and adding annotations during editing. Flashback Pro offers similar capabilities and adds the possibility of recording multiple screens in a single video. Flashback Pro is slightly cheaper than RecExperts, although Camtasia costs $249 for a lifetime license.",
    "EaseUS RecExperts is easy-to-use screen recording software with a lot of features to offer. This recording tool can capture audio and webcam video in addition to what\u2019s happening on your screen. We also liked that it offers scheduled recordings and an auto-stop function. While EaseUS RecExperts is slightly more expensive than competitors like Flashback Pro, it still represents good value for the money."
