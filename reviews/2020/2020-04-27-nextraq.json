    "NexTraq is a leading telematics solution provider headquartered in Atlanta, US. It is a Michelin group company and offers services like vehicle tracking, a job scheduling board, automatic driver assignment, routing and real-time alerts.",
    "The firm has been in this business for the past 19 years and provides its services to companies across a wide variety of industries like construction and heavy equipment, food and beverage, manufacturing, transportation, oil, gas and mining, agriculture, distribution, government and public safety, and many more.",
    "Unlike most fleet management services, NexTraq does not list pricing details on its website, preferring instead to have businesses connect them directly. Since there is no limitation on the number of vehicles for a contract, it is equally suitable for small businesses as for medium and large enterprises. The company can be contacted via a telephone helpline or by filling in a query form available on the website.",
    "NexTraq\u2019s key highlight in terms of setup is the fact that it offers free installation and does not charge any activation fee. Since a lot of people are not savvy about handling hardware installation on vehicles and machinery, having a professional set up the tracking system is a highly sought after benefit.",
    "Like most other companies, NexTraq has a three-year contract. The cost of hardware needs to be paid upfront while the monthly payment primarily consists of a software license fee.",
    "NexTraq is a cloud-based fleet management solution provider that offers a cost-effective solution to manage and track moving assets, as well as helping businesses to optimize their resources to achieve maximum output. To meet the industry standards and stay compliant with government policies, NexTraq offers ELD, HoS, DVIR and FMCSA compliant solutions.",
    "NexTraq's system is powered by Google Maps and therefore capable of offering precise details about location and terrain to suit business requirements. Its software refreshes every 30 seconds, providing real-time vehicle location details to admins.",
    "Its intuitive software not only lets users track vehicles, but also comes with a host of features that help a business stay informed. Options like geofencing, two-way communication and so on, along with the numerous reports that can be generated using the system, keeps administrator\u2019s on top of the drivers\u2019 performance.",
    "The following features make NexTraq\u2019s software extremely useful:",
    "NexTraq also has a native mobile app for both Android and iOS operating systems. This app can be used by drivers to log their daily attendance, record start times, break times, and finish times. While on the back-end it can be used to run various reports like individual or the entire team\u2019s attendance reports, or to compare historical data.",
    "Unlike other fleet management companies, NexTraq has a keen focus on safety features. It offers a detailed comparative report based on the drivers\u2019 performance which can help reward the best performing drivers, while necessary coaching can be given to the ones lagging behind.",
    "The company offers a suite of features ensuring driver safety and accountability. These include:",
    "Customers can reach out to NexTraq via multiple mediums. The company offers telephone support five days a week via a dedicated helpline. The support team can also be reached via email or chatbot.",
    "While there is not much training material available online on NexTraq\u2019s website, its YouTube channel offers some resources. The company has added a few explainer videos recently that can help first time users and drivers while on the go.",
    "Even though NexTraq has been rated A+ by the Better Business Bureau, it has only a handful of reviews on the portal. Most of these reviews have complaints about service and communication.",
    "With a keen focus on safety, no restrictions on minimum vehicles, free installation and a lifetime warranty on hardware, NexTraq is one of the obvious choices when it comes to selecting a GPS fleet tracking service."
