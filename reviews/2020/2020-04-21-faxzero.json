  "summary": "A simple solution for online faxes",
  "verdict": "FaxZero might have a free tier, but it\u2019s too limited for most users with branded cover pages and ridiculously low page limits. Sadly, the paid tier also represents poor value for money.",

    "Up to five free faxes per day",

    "Looking for the best online fax services? Then it\u2019s worth giving FaxZero a closer look. This Internet fax service enables you to send faxes of up to three pages for free. FaxZero isn\u2019t necessarily the best option if you need to receive faxes or send online faxes regularly. But, it\u2019s simple to use and works well for the occasional electronic fax. In our FaxZero online fax review, we will cover everything you need to know to decide if this is the right fax app for you.",
    "You can use FaxZero to send five faxes per day, up to three pages each, at no cost. But, keep in mind that free faxes include a cover page with FaxZero branding, and the service is only free for sending files within the US and Canada.",
    "If you want to eliminate the FaxZero branding or send faxes of up to 25 pages, you\u2019ll pay a fee of $1.99 per fax. Note that FaxZero only accepts payments through PayPal, although you don\u2019t need to have a PayPal account to pay by debit or credit card. FaxZero also supports international faxes. However, the pricing and maximum number of pages you can send varies by country.",
    "There\u2019s not much to FaxZero, which is part of the allure of this basic online fax service. Its main feature is the ability to send multiple documents as part of your page limit. That is, if you send a three-page fax, you can either upload one three-page document or three one-page documents. But, beware that if you\u2019re sending a longer fax, you\u2019re still limited to uploading a maximum of three different attachments.",
    "FaxZero sends a cover sheet automatically with every free fax, although you can disable the cover sheet when you purchase premium fax. This cover sheet doesn\u2019t count against your page limit, and there\u2019s a simple text editor box that you can use to customize it. Still, the text entry options are limited to basic formatting, so don\u2019t expect too much.",
    "Beyond those relatively standard features, the only noteworthy thing about FaxZero is that it works with international fax numbers. Unfortunately, no fax is free if you\u2019re sending documents outside of the US and Canada, but it\u2019s nice to know that this service can work for sending a fax from your desktop or laptop to anywhere in the world.",
    "FaxZero is designed primarily for one-off fax jobs, so there\u2019s virtually no setup required. Just input the name, email, and phone or fax number of you and your recipient and upload your files using the on-page dialog box. You\u2019ll need to fill out a CAPTCHA box and confirm your email address before you can send your fax.",
    "The browser-based interface that FaxZero uses is a single webpage, which adds to this online fax service\u2019s simplicity. All of your options, from the sender and recipient information to cover letter customizations, are displayed right up front. Even the pricing information is on that page, so you know exactly what the limits are if you want to send a free fax.",
    "When you send a fax, you can be confident that it\u2019s received based on the confirmation email you receive from FaxZero. If the fax can\u2019t get through, for example, because you sent it to the wrong number, you\u2019ll get an email notifying you of the failure.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that paid faxes get priority over free faxes on FaxZero\u2019s lines. When you pay for a fax, your request automatically moves to the front of the queue. Still, we tried sending a free fax and the service started dialing within 30 seconds.",
    "FaxZero has some basic security measures in place, although it\u2019s not an ideal service for sending documents securely. The company uses HTTPS to encrypt your file uploads and SSL or TLS when sending outbound files from its servers.",
    "However, FaxZero does keep sender and recipient data, including names, emails, and phone numbers, indefinitely. Although the company promises not to share that information with any third parties, the fact that they keep your data at all isn\u2019t great.",
    "You can reach FaxZero\u2019s support team by email, although the company doesn\u2019t list support hours. Most questions are answered on a very detailed FAQ page, so that\u2019s a good place to start if you run into any issues.",
    "The closest competitor to FaxZero is GotFreeFax, another simple browser-based online fax service. GotFreeFax only gives you up to two free faxes per day and the pricing for one-time paid faxes is similar to FaxZero. But, GotFreeFax offers prepaid page credits with business accounts, which can be extremely useful if multiple people in your business need to send faxes on occasion. Prepaid plans at GotFreeFax start at $9.95 for 100 pages.",
    "FaxZero is a great choice for sending an electronic fax if you only need to send documents on occasion. The interface is extremely simple, and the service is inexpensive even if you can\u2019t take advantage of the free faxing option. The only downside to using FaxZero is that the company stores both your information and that of your recipient, which is less than ideal for privacy."
