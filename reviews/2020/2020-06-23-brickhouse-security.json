    "Brickhouse Security is a New York-based company that offers GPS fleet tracking services. Founded in 2005, the company offers various security and tracking solutions. A trusted brand in the US, Brickhouse Security offers services to some 80% of Fortune 500 companies, along with over 2,500 government agencies. Furthermore, the firm also counts over 60,000 companies globally as its clients.",
    "Brickhouse Security sells a wide variety of tracking hardware including GPS trackers, surveillance cameras and other security systems. These products are plug-and-play vehicle tracking devices, as well as advanced hardware and software solutions depending on business requirements.",
    "While Brickhouse Security does not list all its plans and pricing online, it does mention the details of its basic subscription. The basic plan starts at $12.99 per unit per month. Unfortunately, the website does not list any other tiers.",
    "However, Brickhouse offers a free demo for companies to test out its services and products. The fact that it doesn\u2019t charge any activation fee, and that it doesn\u2019t have a minimum contract period are major advantages.",
    "Additionally, Brickhouse Security offers multiple GPS trackers which can be bought from the website. The company offers a lifetime warranty on these tracking devices.",
    "Brickhouse Security offers smart GPS fleet tracking services which are loaded with features that will likely meet the requirements of most businesses. These solutions not only efficiently track and manage assets on the move, but also help clients to optimize their workforce, fleet, and improve on cost efficiency.",
    "Brickhouse Security\u2019s solution aims at helping clients with:",
    "The company offers a wide variety of customizable reports that include key elements like an efficiency report, vehicle maintenance reports, safety reports, driver scorecards and more. These reports help the key decision-makers with their decisions, helping to optimize fleet operations.",
    "Brickhouse Security offers a cloud-based solution that can be accessed from anywhere or any device. The solution can be accessed via the website directly, which hosts two different platforms. TrackView is applicable for clients who joined before October 2019, and customers who signed up after October can log in to the newer LocateGPS dashboard. The company also offers a mobile app for Android and iOS.",
    "The company offers both hardwired as well as battery-powered GPS trackers. These trackers depend on 4G for connectivity.",
    "The key features of Brickhouse Security are:",
    "Brickhouse Security\u2019s support team can be reached via a direct helpline, email or SMS. The company has a toll-free number for calls and texts in the US, plus an international helpline and a FAX number. There is a live chat option as well, and both the call center and live chat team is available between 10am to 7pm on weekdays.",
    "The website does have a section called Learning but it does not offer any detailed information about the products on offer. Brickhouse\u2019s social media accounts are not very active either, and its YouTube channel is only updated occasionally, with the last set of videos uploaded three months ago at the time of writing.",
    "Brickhouse Security does have an impressive line-up of customers, including many major businesses, but it's less impressive that the firm's social media and website are not updated regularly.",
    "Brickhouse is accredited by the Better Business Bureau but does not have any reviews on the Bureau. There are just eight complaints on the Better Business Bureau website which is pretty incredible for a company as old and as big as Brickhouse Security."
