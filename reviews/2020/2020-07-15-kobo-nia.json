  "summary": "Kobo takes on the Amazon Kindle",
  "verdict": "If you\u2019re looking for an affordable ereader that won\u2019t tie you up within the Amazon ecosystem, then the Kobo Nia is a compelling option, particularly since its 212ppi screen is a step-up from its rival, the basic Amazon Kindle\u2019s 167ppi display. While the Nia lacks Bluetooth support (which the 10th-gen Kindle boasts), the Kobo has wider file support and a more streamlined user interface.",

    "The Kobo Nia is a no-frills ereader aimed at those who want a Kindle alternative. It\u2019s marginally more expensive than the current 10th-generation Amazon Kindle, but the Nia boasts a better 6-inch 212ppi screen.",
    "However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything new about Kobo\u2019s latest entry-level ereader. In fact it appears to be physically identical to the Tolino Page 2 (which was released in 2019 and is only available in some markets). This shouldn\u2019t be very surprising as Rakuten, the makers of the Kobo range, bought Tolina back in 2017.",
    "The Nia also shares plenty of similarities with the now-discontinued Kobo Aura, the company\u2019s previous entry-level ereader. They both have the same screen resolution of 1024x758 and screen size of six inches. The display advantage the Nia has over its older sibling is that it uses the latest E Ink Carta technology that makes the screen more responsive and sharper than the Aura. The screen resolution is also a boost over the current Amazon Kindle (2019) model, whose 6-inch E Ink display is just 167ppi.",
    "But where the Kobo Aura had just 4GB of internal memory, the new Nia boasts 8GB of storage, putting it on par with the rest of the current Kobo ereaders, like the Clara HD, Aura One, Libra H2O and Forma. However, the Aura had a microSD slot to expand storage, which is not an option on any current Kobo or Amazon device.",
    "Thanks to a newer processor (1GHz i.MX 6 CPU) and a more streamlined interface than before, the Nia is definitely a far superior ereader to what the Aura was, and can give the Kindle a run for its money.",
    "Alongside a shared screen size, both the Nia and the Kindle lack waterproofing, and both boast front-lit displays. Kobo\u2019s patented ComfortLight technology makes its way to the Nia, meaning you can easily adjust the brightness of the front light by just swiping up or down the left edge of the screen for a more comfortable reading experience at night. However, unlike the Clara HD and the more premium Kobo ereaders, there\u2019s no blue-light filter on the Nia (or the Kindle), meaning the hue of the light cannot be adjusted to warmer tones at night.",
    "Like all other Kobo ereaders, the Nia comes with OverDrive support in many countries, so borrowing ebooks from a public library is seamless. And you can switch from reading on the device to the Kobo app on your smartphone or tablet (in case you\u2019ve left the house without your ereader) without losing your place.",
    "The Nia might not have Bluetooth like the Kindle (used for the VoiceView feature, a text-to-speech screen reader, as well as for audiobooks), but it offers wider file support and the ability to sideload different fonts, including Amazon\u2019s own Bookerly or Ember. We\u2019re also a little partial to Kobo\u2019s more streamlined interface.",
    "All in all, Kobo\u2019s new Nia is a very compelling alternative to the Kindle, particularly for anyone who\u2019s not keen on getting locked into Amazon\u2019s ecosystem.",
    "Compared to Amazon\u2019s Kindle range, Kobo\u2019s ereaders have always been a tad more expensive and the Nia is no exception. At $99.99 / \u00a389.99 / AU$149.95 / \u20ac99.99 apiece (with the sleep cover sold separately), the Kobo Nia is quite affordable, although you can get the latest generation Kindle for just $89.99 / \u00a369.99 / AU$139.",
    "However, the Kobo Clara HD, which boasts a higher resolution 300ppi 6-inch screen and a blue-light filter, costs a little more \u2013 available for $129 / \u00a3109 / AU$179 \u2013 and does seem to be the obvious choice if you\u2019ve got the extra cash.",
    "The Nia is available to buy now directly from Kobo or from select retailers in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and some European countries.",
    "The Kobo Nia doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table in terms of design. It looks remarkably like the older Aura, the newer Clara HD and Amazon\u2019s Kindle. In fact, it\u2019s practically identical to Rakuten\u2019s Tolino Page 2, with the exception of the branding on the lower bezel. The Kobo brand name is etched into the plastic of the chassis and that\u2019s the only design embellishment on the top surface.",
    "The underside, like the Clara HD, bears the Rakuten branding on the top right corner of the housing, while most of the rear surface is textured that makes the Nia feel a lot more secure in the hand than the Amazon Kindle (which has a smooth finish on the rear).",
    "The only button on the Nia is on the bottom edge of the device and serves as both the sleep and the power button. Beside it is a microUSB charging port that, today, does seem antiquated when USB-C is fast becoming standard.",
    "The Nia weighs almost as much as the Kindle (172g compared to the Kindle\u2019s 174g) but is slightly heavier than the Clara HD (which weighs 166g), and shares similar dimensions to both older ereaders, making it a very portable device that easily slips into any bag.",
    "But where the Nia outshines the Kindle is screen resolution. The Nia\u2019s 6-inch display has a resolution of 1024x758 (translating to 212ppi) as opposed to the Kindle\u2019s 800x600 pixels (or 167ppi). While that doesn\u2019t match the Clara HD\u2019s 300ppi screen, the Nia\u2019s display is sharper than the Kindle.",
    "In some markets, a 4GB capacity Kindle is still available, although the Nia only comes in one flavour \u2013 8GB internal storage \u2013 that\u2019s twice the capacity of the Kobo Aura it\u2019s replacing.",
    "And that\u2019s about where its advantages over the Kindle stop. Many of the other factors are on par with its Amazon competition \u2013 there\u2019s no waterproofing or blue-light filter in either, for instance \u2013 but the Kindle does have Bluetooth support that the Kobo lacks.",
    "So which cheap ereader you decide to go for will depend on other factors, like user interface, your preference for Amazon\u2019s Kindle Store or whether you\u2019d like to borrow ebooks from your local public library.",
    "Kobo has previously not divulged battery specifications for its entry-level ereaders; instead the company has only claimed that you\u2019ll get weeks of reading from a single charge (depending on use). This time, though, Kobo has specified that there\u2019s a 1,000mAh battery under the hood of the Nia.",
    "It\u2019s hard to quantify exactly how long a single charge will last you as it depends on how long you read each day, what brightness your screen is set at and how long you spend browsing the Kobo Store on the device.",
    "During our time testing the new ereader, we had the device set at 25% brightness, had Wi-Fi switched off most of the time, and read for about an hour and a half each day, and only managed to drain the battery by about 20% by the end of a week. That means you should be able to get up to four weeks of use per full charge if you read for a couple of hours every day with Wi-Fi on at all times.",
    "The Nia\u2019s screen is quite responsive, on par with the Clara HD but a touch slower than the Libra H2O. Things like text selection for dictionary look-up (or highlighting and note-taking) are less hit-and-miss than on the Kindle or the older Kobo Aura range, with markers falling accurately where your finger touches. Moving those same markers around is also easy. However, we found that you need to be very precise where you place your finger while typing (either a Wi-Fi password or in the search bar) as even the slightest shift to the left or right would select the adjacent key even though they\u2019re all well spaced out on the 6-inch screen.",
    "Kobo has been progressively improving its user interface and, we have to admit, has made it a lot more streamlined than the clunky UX you\u2019ll find on any of the Kindles. The interface is easy to understand and very intuitive, offering excellent organization even for books that weren\u2019t purchased directly from the Kobo Store. This is something you can\u2019t do on a Kindle as only books purchased from the Kindle Store can be organized into folders.",
    "The latest Kobo OS updates came last year when the Libra H2O launched in September, adding a new ebook navigation system that uses a slider and shows you a preview of the selected page instead of taking you there directly. This, of course, has made its way to the Nia and it\u2019s good to see it hasn\u2019t come at the cost of the \u2018rapid page turn\u2019 engine \u2013 which allows you to quickly move forward in an ebook by holding down on the bottom-left corner of the screen \u2013 that was introduced with the Clara HD.",
    "Even adjusting screen brightness is simple on the Nia \u2013 all you have to do is slide a finger up or down the left edge of the display to increase or decrease the brightness. You can, of course, adjust brightness by using the slider presented when tapping on the \u2018light\u2019 icon on the top toolbar but this way allows you to continue reading while you make adjustments.",
    "Another advantage of using a Kobo device is the ability to sideload fonts. The Nia comes with 12 preloaded fonts, but it\u2019s easy enough to add more by just downloading the ones you want to your computer and transferring them to the Kobo\u2019s fonts folder when the device is plugged in via the microUSB cable.",
    "Moreover, all Kobo devices offer better file support than a Kindle. Whether you want to read comics, look at images or read text files, you\u2019ll be able to view EPUB, MOBI, PDF, PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, TXT, HTML, CBR and CBZ files on the Nia.",
    "Kobo\u2019s partnership with OverDrive means users in supported countries will be able to borrow ebooks from their local public library, thus saving money on buying new reads. There\u2019s also support for Pocket \u2013 a website and browser plugin that lets you save articles for reading later \u2013 as well Dropbox integration that allows you to transfer books wirelessly if you happen to have your library saved to the cloud.",
    "Amazon\u2019s Kindle Store is unrivaled, with way more books available as compared to the Kobo Store. That said, there are over six million books available on Kobo right now, which includes practically all top-selling titles. What keeps the Kindle Store a step ahead for readers is Amazon\u2019s self-publishing option that ties authors down to the e-commerce giant\u2019s Kindle platform.",
    "Moreover, titles on the Kobo Store can cost more as compared to the Kindle Store, although Kobo allows you to earn what it calls Super Points with each purchase. Once you\u2019ve accumulated a sufficient amount of points, you can use them to buy ebooks on the Kobo Store. However, these points have an expiration date and must be used up within a certain period.",
    "Audiobooks are also available on the Kobo Store but, unlike the current Kindles, none of Kobo\u2019s ereaders have audiobook support.",
