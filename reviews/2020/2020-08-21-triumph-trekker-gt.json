  "summary": "A nicely designed debut e-bike from the British motorbike manufacturer",
  "verdict": "There\u2019s no doubt the Triumph oozes class. It\u2019s beautiful to look at and rides well. However, for just under \u00a33,000 (about $4,000 / AU$5,500) it's expensive for what is a fairly ordinary e-bike spec.",
  "pros": [
    "Great design",
    "Silent motor",
    "Excellent range"

  "cons": [
    "Very expensive",
    "Not as much power as expected",
    "Quite heavy"

    "Before Triumph even started producing motorbikes at the turn of the 20th century, it was already making push bikes. But that was nearly 150 years ago (1884 in fact) and a lot has changed since then.",
    "The Trekker GT is the company\u2019s first pedal-assisted electric bike, and it\u2019s not a bad effort at all. It\u2019s beautifully designed with a classy grey and black matt finish and rides well. Triumph has turned to well-respected Japanese component manufacturer Shimano for the electronics and the end result is an e-bike boasting a solid, if not spectacular, performance.",
    "Admittedly, it\u2019s not the most powerful e-bike in the world, but it does offer an excellent range \u2013 certainly around 100 miles if ridden in eco-mode (there are also \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018high modes\u2019 if you want an even bigger boost when you\u2019re cycling up hill).",
    "It\u2019s also a nice quiet ride so you will sail past other cyclists who will have no idea you are being assisted by a motor! But there\u2019s just one problem. It\u2019s really quite expensive for what it is. If you love the Triumph brand, then you will probably adore this e-bike. If you\u2019re not a big fan, then you can probably get a better and cheaper alternative elsewhere.",
    "Launched in June 2020, The Trekker GT is available in the UK, United States and in Europe (with the exception of Germany and Austria), with a recommended retail price of \u00a32,950 (about $4,000 / AU$5,500).",
    "There\u2019s no getting round the fact that even the best electric bikes are heavy and this one is no exception. Three different frame sizes are available to buy \u2013 small (450mm) for riders between 155 and 165cm tall, medium (500mm) for those 165cm to 180cm tall and large (550mm) for 180cm and above.",
    "For those opting for the medium frame, the e-bike weighs around 24kg including the lithium ion battery, with the Shimano motor itself accounting for nearly 3kg (which is actually a lot less than the company\u2019s older style motors).",
    "That sounds like a lot, but the Triumph Trekker GT isn't actually very much heavier than many of the other e-bikes we\u2019ve tested, and it looks a lot lighter than it is thanks to its sleek design.",
    "At first glance, you wouldn\u2019t even know it was an electric model as the battery is neatly integrated into the aluminium frame (a key is supplied if you need to remove it). A twin paint scheme \u2013 matt silver ice and matt jet black \u2013 gives the Trekker GT a really classy feel as does the Triumph branding, including the Union Jack-inspired badge on the front.",
    "While you wouldn\u2019t call the Trekker a racing bike (it looks more like an elegant tourer) it does come with quite a sporty looking Selle-Royal Vivo saddle (which is thankfully more comfortable than it looks).",
    "Less sporty, but perhaps more practical, is the blacked-out pannier rack on the back for putting your shopping on while other useful features include integrated Abus Pro Shield security lock, full length mud guards, a kick stand, LED lighting both front and back and an old-fashioned bell! In summary, the overall feel is of an extremely elegant e-bike which you might expect from one of the Britain\u2019s finest manufacturers of motorcycles.",
    "While at first glance the Triumph Trekker GT may look an ordinary pedal bike with a fairly standard 10 gear Shimano cassette, obviously nothing could be further from the truth. Helping to power this e-bike is the Shimano Steps DU-E6100 mid-drive motor with power provided courtesy of Shimano\u2019s BT-8035 504Wh battery.",
    "To charge the e-bike you simply connect the bulky AC charger provided to a socket located at the top of the pedals. Alternatively, the battery can be removed for charging using the key provided though that\u2019s obviously a little more fiddly.",
    "Charging the bike for a few hours gives you enough charge for up to around 100 miles of assisted pedalling, although just how much depends on the mode you are riding in, your weight etc. Three levels of assist are provided including \u2018high\u2019 (full power for maximum support), \u2018normal\u2019 (for gradual support) and eco (less support for longer journeys).",
    "Choosing the level of support you want is simply a case of pressing the up and down buttons on the controls of the left handlebar. Pressing the centre button on these controls changes the black and white display in the centre of the bike to change the Shimano head-up display. Here you can find a number of options including speed, distance, trip time, clock, gear and battery levels. The display can also be used to switch the bike\u2019s power and lights on or off.",
    "Complementing the bike\u2019s electronics is a 10 gear system which can be controlled using the up and down levers on the right hand side handlebar. Here you can also find the rather natty bell which you can use to tell people to get out of your way!",
    "In terms of performance, the Triumph Trekker GT is decent rather than outstanding. What\u2019s great about it is that it doesn\u2019t take more than a few hours to charge fully and even after riding around for a few hours the battery doesn\u2019t drain that much. However, on the downside it\u2019s certainly not the most powerful e-bike we\u2019ve ever ridden.",
    "While eco mode is fine for cycling on flattish land, if you are going up hill or you want to get away quickly at the lights to avoid motorists then you will need to use the normal or high modes for additional power. That\u2019s because the Shimano motor only produces a fairly modest amount of \u2018torque\u2019 (60Nm) compared to some much more powerful e-bikes we\u2019ve looked at.",
    "That said, unless you're riding up and down mountains regularly, it\u2019s probably more than enough. It\u2019s also a more comfortable ride than you might expect from a quite narrow, sporty-looking saddle.",
    "For those who like the Triumph brand and want an e-bike that looks good and performs reasonably well then we would definitely recommend the Trekker GT. However for those on a budget or who are looking for really high levels of performance then it\u2019s probably best to steer clear."
