    "Fleetio is a cloud-based comprehensive fleet management solution that helps keep track of vehicles, drivers, and vehicle parts. Founded in 2012, the company is already present in 80+ countries and has handled over 250,000 vehicles and operators.",
    "Fleetio\u2019s solution suits fleets of different sizes and seeks to reduce the complexity of a fleet management product. It does so by automating fleet operations, allowing for the management of asset lifecycles, fuel efficiency, and also supporting the staff operating these vehicles.",
    "Like many other cloud-based solutions, it focuses on collaborative efforts and aims to reduce the use of tools such as spreadsheets.",
    "Fleetio is transparent in terms of listing pricing and contractual details on its platform. It offers two different plans, and the base tier called the Pro plan starts at $75 per month for 15 vehicles on an annual basis. The Advanced tier is available at $105 per month, also on an annual basis for 15 vehicles. This translates to $5 and $7 per vehicle per month respectively. A monthly payment option is $1 more expensive (per vehicle) for either of the plans.",
    "The Pro plan is aimed at organizations that have outsourced vehicle maintenance to third-party vendors, while the Advanced plan is apt for businesses that handle vehicle maintenance in-house. The company offers a 14-day free trial.",
    "There is also an Enterprise plan aimed at larger fleets with complex requirements. Fleetio offers a free demo and prefers businesses to contact it directly for pricing with this plan.",
    "Here is what the company gives you with the Pro and Advanced plans:",
    "Fleetio offers a range of services, including maintenance and fleet management, apart from simply tracking vehicles. It empowers the admin or operators to optimize on the cost front by letting them manage fuel, drivers, and assets in a controlled and seamless manner.",
    "The company offers two different mobile apps: Fleetio Go and Fleetio Parts. The latter focuses on just mobile parts and inventory management and is available only with the Advanced plan. Both the apps are available on iOS and Android for free on those respective app stores. The Fleetio dashboard is a cloud-based solution and so is operating system agnostic.",
    "The service can be divided into three broad categories: Mobile Asset Management, Fleet Asset Management, and Integrations Driver Management. Let's look at these in more depth now.",
    "Mobile Asset Management: This covers the entire lifecycle of a vehicle and helps with managing fleet operations easily.",
    "Fleet Maintenance Management: This section mainly covers the vehicle\u2019s maintenance and historical service data as well as reports around inventory and more.",
    "Integrations and Driver Management: Fleetio allows for the integration of different services to increase functionality. As a result, the software can automatically collate details like odometer readings, vehicle locations, and fuel card expenses alerts, plus it can track each vehicle, services, documents and other records allowing people to find key data all using a central dashboard. Since Fleetio\u2019s software allows unlimited users, it has options to assign role-based access.",
    "Fleetio offers email support as well as a dedicated telephone helpdesk which is available weekdays between 7am to 8pm. The company hosts webinars and podcasts to help users. Fleetio also has a dedicated YouTube channel where it keeps posting informative guides.",
    "Fleetio offers comprehensive fleet tracking services and helps in managing various aspects of the entire fleet effectively. The company has received various positive reviews on sites like Capterra, but note that it is not listed on Better Business Bureau or Trustpilot yet."
