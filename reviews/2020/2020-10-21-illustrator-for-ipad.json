    "If you're a Creative Cloud member who hasn't been enjoying Lightroom Mobile, you're missing out on what is arguably the best on-the-go photo editing solution out there. Meanwhile, Photoshop for iPad is a smart, fun, handy way to supplement your full-fat desktop experience. Now, the third installment in Adobe's holy trinity of creative apps has landed: Illustrator for iPad.",
    "Adobe's vector-based illustration software has been a firm favorite with designers creating scalable artwork, icons, logo design, and bold graphics for years. By primarily focusing on vectors instead of pixels, all your strokes, points, shapes, and gradients are a series of calculations, which are much more efficient to work with than Photoshop's memory-heavy pixels.",
    "Since introducing artboards \u2013 the ability to work across multiple 'pages', or more appropriately, canvases in a single file \u2013 Illustrator has scaled new heights of utility. But Adobe isn\u2019t done. We\u2019ve spent over a week with the Illustrator for iPad Beta to figure out if the company\u2019s masterful multi-purpose toolkit has transitioned to Apple's tablet-line successfully.",
    "The version 1.0 release of Illustrator for iPad became available to download on October 20, 2020. You can download it either as part of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription or with a standalone app subscription.",
    "An Adobe Creative Cloud subscription including Illustrator costs $19.99 / \u00a319.97 / AU $29.99 per month, with Adobe running students discounts of 65 percent. If you up your access to multiple apps, price-per-app goes way down. The full suite of Creative Cloud apps, including After Effects, Audition, InDesign, Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro, Adobe cloud storage, for example, costs just over double the single-app price.",
    "If you only want Illustrator for iPad, though, you can also buy it as a single app for $9.99 / \u00a39.99 per month.",
    "Familiar and pared-back, that's the name of the game as soon as you fire up Illustrator for iPad. You'll see familiar features like the vertical toolbar to the left and panels to the right, but the notable omission is the horizontal 'everything else' bar at the top. Instantly, this should give seasoned Illustrator users a sense of the limitations here.",
    "When you select an element, a new context-sensitive hovering bar expands, giving you quick access to tools like stroke thickness, transparency, text settings, and the option to duplicate or delete the current layer. Many of these can be manipulated by a dragging gesture which is intuitive.",
    "Speaking of layers, Illustrator aficionados will be delighted to know layers are here in full force. Drag layers up and down, sort them into groups, rename, lock and hide them at will.",
    "You can also customize the properties of whatever you\u2019re selecting in the properties tab to the right of the screen. This menu is an extension of that context-sensitive menu mentioned, only with more granular control. If you\u2019re selecting a shape, for example, you can transform it precisely here. Additionally, shape fills, blend modes, opacity, and stroke type can be controlled in this expanded menu.",
    "This properties menu gets even better when manipulating typography. For starters, you have access to all the fonts on your iPad, and thousands more through the Creative Cloud app. Alignment, leading, kerning, and tracking (line, word, and letter spacing) are all easy to manipulate, and it makes illustrator an incredibly powerful type tool for the iPad. You can even convert text to an outline, giving you granular control of letter characteristics \u2013 especially handy for logo design.",
    "Additional interface highlights include control over snapping \u2013 the software\u2019s helping hand that latches your selection to where it thinks you\u2019re trying to place it. There are options to combine multiple shapes into one, manage the alignment and distribution of multiple objects, create clipping masks, compound paths, and repeat shapes.",
    "The repeat tool is particularly well optimized for iPad, packing all the frivolity of a spirograph with the potential utility and time saving that you really need when you don\u2019t have all the power of desktop software at your fingertips.",
    "On the subject of the desktop Illustrator software, while Adobe has crammed a huge amount into its iPad app \u2014 the versatility and curated set of features are incredibly impressive, there are some notable omissions.",
    "The first thing we noticed that didn\u2019t work was keyboard shortcuts. Whether increasing text size, trying to select multiple elements, or trying to switch tools, we ended up prodding the screen more than we would have liked to as long-time desktop app users. This also means you have to be more careful with your layering in the iPad app if you want to move multiple elements at the same time, as holding onto command or shift won\u2019t let you select multiple items.",
    "Some system shortcuts do work \u2013 command + Z to undo an action, command + A selects everything \u2013 but even these are inconsistent, so we\u2019re looking forward to deeper keyboard integration in the future.",
    "Other advanced Illustrator features like Image Trace are missing, and you forgo some of the granular control over all elements, so no distorting images or adding drop shadows. This all highlights that Illustrator for iPad is a supplementary tool, not a replacement for the MacOS and Windows staples.",
    "Once you get comfortable with the notion that you can\u2019t bin your desktop just yet, you really start to enjoy Adobe\u2019s tablet app though. Its selection tool works with a finger or an Apple Pencil, though you can\u2019t beat the precision of a stylus. Illustrator offers up total control over points and handles, and if you aren\u2019t using a graphics tablet with Illustrator already, the Pencil integration will liberate you.",
    "There are three ways to create lines in the app - point by point, using the pencil, or using the brush. It\u2019s very likely you\u2019ll want to handoff between iPad and computer; the brush and Pencil integration on iPad are so good. Add to the mix Adobe\u2019s cloud saves and getting files across devices is simple.",
    "Additionally, there\u2019s an eraser tool, shape creator (complete with options to control rounded edges), an image importer and finally, artboard control, so you can work across multiple artboards in a single file. All work intuitively and manage to cover more than just the basics, rounding off a very capable experience for a tablet.",
    "After a 15-minute learning curve, we were creating icons and setting type on the tablet, then flinging files to our laptop for finishing touches. That\u2019s also incredibly impressive \u2013 every Illustrator file we tried to open on the iPad was fully editable; that\u2019s a huge deal given the complexity of the desktop software.",
    "Given everything that Adobe Illustrator for iPad can do, not to mention its excellent Apple Pencil integration, it\u2019s easy to recommend. As a typography tool, it\u2019s virtually unparalleled and is a great way to get ideas out of your head when a computer isn\u2019t within reach. Additionally, the Apple Pencil integration is stellar, as is Creative Cloud syncing.",
    "What holds the Illustrator for iPad experience back isn\u2019t so much what it can\u2019t do from a features point of view, but more usability limitations and occasional bugs that crept up in the early version we used. Layer management for example is finicky, as is selecting multiple items, and of course, the missing keyboard shortcuts noticeably slowed us down.",
    "Nonetheless, this is an excellent, supplementary app that won\u2019t cost you extra but should still add plenty of value to your workflow."
