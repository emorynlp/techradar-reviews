    "Logitech has two decades worth of the best racing wheels behind it. As next-generation consoles are slated to hit store shelves, the hardware and accessory maker is already introducing its latest G923 racing wheel and pedals featuring grand improvements from the G920. The wheel still features the same caliber of materials, from the leather stitching to the metal pedals, incredibly sturdy steering, strong force-feedback and logical button layout all return. Set-up is also fairly easy by-way-of power adapter and USB cable. Button placements and macros are customizable through Logitech\u2019s GHub application to a respectable degree.",
    "Building on that, the G923 adds some suitable refinements. Working directly through a racer\u2019s in-game engine, the TRUEFORCE force feedback system makes driving even more realistic. This comes via a new internal closed-loop motor control set-up. The G923\u2019s firmware monitors all the current flowing through the wheel motors as a way to match outputs from game physics.",
    "Both the LED rev indicator and 24-Point selection dial from the Playstation 4 version of the G920 become standard for both consoles. Though the focus remains on the wheel, it would have also loved to have additional functionality for pedals and stick shift. Compatible with both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X, the G923 is as enjoyable now as it\u2019ll eventually become once the next-generation consoles arrive.",
    "At launch, only four racing titles are completely compatible with the G923 including Grid (2019), Assetto Corsa Competizione, Gran Turismo Sport and iRacing. Fans of simulation-leaning racers have much to celebrate as the addition of TRUEFORCE does add a better sense of vehicle control, which can possibly lead to better lap times. Even games that don\u2019t support TRUEFORCE get the added benefit of better force feedback through closed-loop motor controls within its firmware.",
    "PS4 owners with the mainstream sim leaning GT Sport already enjoyed the rev indicator and selection dial for adjusting torque, stability controls, brake force and other settings on the fly. TRUEFORCE makes the blockbuster Polyphony Digital developed game even better. Hardcore racing sims like Assetto and iRacing work incredibly well as well besides being extremely customizable control wise.",
    "Depending on one\u2019s level of play, users will undoubtedly make use of all the wheel\u2019s 900 degree turning radius. However, the best example of the G923 is with Grid (2019). Bridging the gap between sim and arcade like handling, it\u2019s easy for beginners and the hardcore elite to dive in.",
    "It is disappointing that newer arcade-leaning racing titles like Need For Speed: Heat or middle-of-the-road open world racers like Forza Horizon 4 don\u2019t receive the TRUEFORCE treatment. Would have really been nice to have some support for non-racing titles like Truck Simulator. Considering the wheel forward compatible with next-gen consoles, more games could potentially utilize the feature in the future.",
    "Breaking, cornering and various surfaces all feel better than ever on the G923. The pedals receive the least enhancements. A progressive spring and stiffer feeling on the brake pedal allows for some better heel-toe manuevers. Hopefully, Logitech can figure out how to have their pedals match the realism on their wheels without an insane price increase. Regardless, the entire build feels incredibly strong. Both the wheel and pedals are comfortable and ready for hours of continuous driving.",
    "Hardcore racing sim fans should have a lot to love with this wheel at it\u2019s more middle-tiered $399.99 (\u00a3350, AU$799) price point. Doesn\u2019t hurt that the additional \u201cH\u201d pattern stick shifter attachment from the G920 is also compatible with the G923. Casual racers or those looking to play more arcade handling titles are better off getting a cheaper wheel where 180 degrees of rotation are required."
