    "Edison Mail is a much-loved iOS app, and now it\u2019s available for the Mac. It looks and works very much like the iPad app and does all the important things its mobile sibling does.",
    "There\u2019s a clean, uncluttered interface that makes good use of swipe gestures; support for dark mode; and a Unified Inbox that enables you to combine your inboxes from most providers (but not currently Exchange). It\u2019s ad-free and automatically blocks email trackers to help protect your privacy.",
    "The app is very easy to set up, simple to use and very nice to spend time in. You can use Gmail, Apple Mail, Gmail Inbox or Microsoft Outlook keyboard shortcuts or Edison\u2019s own ones, it\u2019s easy to customize the swipe gestures, you can create your own templates and the support for Gmail aliases works very well \u2013 something that lets down some other Mac mail clients.",
    "It\u2019s a very attractive alternative to Apple\u2019s Mail app and to browser-based clients, although its use of white space does mean it takes up a little more room than some clients: with otherwise identical settings for font sizes and preview lines, Apple Mail shows us 10 emails to Edison\u2019s seven.",
    "There are three key features designed to protect your privacy and eradicate irritations. Block Sender does exactly what you\u2019d expect, although it\u2019s separate from Apple\u2019s own blocklist so if you\u2019ve been block-happy in Mail for a while you may need to re-block some persistent senders in Edison.",
    "One-click Unsubscribe gets rid of those mailing lists and promotions you don\u2019t recall signing up for, and Read Receipt Blocking is a more subtle way to prevent people snooping on you than just blocking external images. With Read Receipt Blocking you can keep images on without worrying about tracking pixels.",
    "One of Edison\u2019s headline features is the Assistant, which scans your email and classifies appropriate ones as Travel, Packages, Bill & Receipts or Entertainment so you can get a bird's-eye view of the things that matter to you. We\u2019ve seen similar classification and filtering in other mail apps, notably Microsoft\u2019s Outlook and Google\u2019s now-discontinued Inbox, but Edison\u2019s approach is more fun and friendly.",
    "Or at least, it is when it\u2019s available: it\u2019s only currently designed for US users. We\u2019re in the UK and and the Assistant\u2019s Entertainment category found just four concert bookings out of the many hundreds in our Gmail and it didn\u2019t find any emails it considered travel-related at all. Annoyingly you can\u2019t remove these Assistant links from the sidebar.",
    "Edison is a very clever, attractive and useful alternative to existing email apps: it\u2019s fast and friendly, the multiple account support is useful, it handles Gmail aliases properly and the customisation options are useful and extensive. It\u2019s just a shame that its Assistant doesn\u2019t really work for non-US users."
