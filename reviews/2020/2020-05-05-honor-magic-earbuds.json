    "When the Honor Magic Earbuds were first announced, we were certainly intrigued. With a form factor that cleaves pretty close to the AirPods Pro, and a price point that undercuts even the standard Apple AirPods, many of us wondered whether Honor may have a true wireless earbuds competitor on their hands.",
    "Add to that active noise cancelling \u2013 still a rarity among in-ear buds \u2013 and there\u2019s clearly plenty to recommend the Honor Magic Earbuds\u2026 on paper at least.",
    "Not every technology packed into these compact earbuds pays off, while audio may be disappointing to those expecting AirPods-level performance, even if some aspects of Honor\u2019s design are worth a look. Why\u2019s that? You can find out in the rest of our Honor Magic Earbuds review below.",
    "The price tag of \u20ac99 (roughly $110 / \u00a390 / AU$170) makes these earbuds pretty mid-range, meaning we wouldn\u2019t expect market-leading specs or bottom-dollar performance \u2013 and the question, as ever, is whether the trade-off of price and performance is worth it.",
    "The earbuds are available to pre-order from May 5 across the UK and Europe, and will be availably to buy from May 21. More specific region pricing is yet to be announced.",
    "The Honor Magic Earbuds may look familiar, and that\u2019ll be because of how similar they are to the Apple AirPods Pro.",
    "Honor\u2019s earbuds feature a near-identical stem design, with adjustable eartips for a snug fit in your ears, and it\u2019s clear Honor isn\u2019t trying too hard to differentiate its offering.",
    "These buds do fit pretty firmly \u2013 in this reviewer\u2019s ears, at least \u2013 though they have a slightly boxier shape than the AirPods Pro, which could lead to some discomfort after long listening sessions. For on-and-off use, though, we found them largely comfortable.",
    "The model we reviewed was in a clean white (Pearl White), though you can also buy these buds in an aquamarine color (Robin Egg Blue) if you want something a bit different from the many sets of AirPods out there.",
    "You get a smattering of eartip sizes in the box, as well as an USB-C cable for charging up its rather sleek case. Honor has gone for a horizontal take on the charging case, meaning the earbuds rest on their side \u2013 and they make a rather satisfying click when attaching magnetically to the inside of the case.",
    "You\u2019ll find a pairing button on the back of the case, too \u2013 if you open up the case, and hold down the pairing button until a white light appears, the earbuds should be visible to whatever source you\u2019re pairing it with.",
    "There\u2019s no connection sound when the earbuds link up to a source device, though, which quickly proved frustrating as we had to pick up our phone to check if the earbuds had connected.",
    "But what of the features? Honor has made much of the inclusion of active noise-cancelling, which aims to soften outside sounds and help listeners hear intended audio that bit more clearly.",
    "The noise-cancelling \u2013 activated with a long press on either earbud \u2013 most certainly works, helping to diminish external noise. The effect is rather minimal, but we\u2019re glad to have something to help block out the outside world when we want to.",
    "The Magic Earbuds\u2019 three-microphone array, however, works exceptionally well for calls and voice recordings, with speech being clearly picked up in our various Zoom and Google hangouts meetings throughout the week. Honor uses a technology it calls \u201cuplink noise reduction\u201d, which appears to help in this regard.",
    "You\u2019ll get the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, ensuring a reliable connection with smartphones and other Bluetooth devices, and we didn\u2019t have any dropout issues during several days of testing. As with the Apple AirPods, audio will pause when taking a bud out of your ear too.",
    "The battery life should last you 3.5 hours for music playback, or a brisker 2.5 hours for more energy-intensive calls \u2013 but the charging case will get that amount up to around 14.5 hours total. That's not a huge amount by modern standards, but it is enough to get through a full day's use, at least.",
    "As in any headphones review, though, we need to talk about the audio quality \u2013 and it\u2019s not what we hoped we would hear.",
    "The Honor Magic Earbuds pack in 10mm drivers per earbud, and they certainly have some whack, though you probably won\u2019t want to play anything too loudly through them. Trebles, especially, can get quite scratchy, with a grating sibilant sound that turns s\u2019s and x\u2019s into torturous consonants.",
    "We listened to Blondie\u2019s classic One Way Or Another and found ourselves flinching at every refrain of \u201cmaybe next week\u201d. This was mitigated by turning down the volume, to be fair \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t bode overly well for loud environments, such as a rush hour commute, especially given the slight nature of the earbuds\u2019 active noise-cancelling.",
    "The Magic Earbuds are far better with mids, with our standard rock and pop anthems performing largely well, and vocals being pretty clear \u2013 even if some of the finer vocal details we\u2019re used to hearing with the (more expensive, admittedly) Jaybird Vista earbuds aren\u2019t to be found here.",
    "The bass is also pretty nonexistent, meaning you shouldn\u2019t get these earbuds if you\u2019re hoping to listen mostly to thudding house tracks or banging drums.",
    "When listening to Stormzy\u2019s 2019 album, Heavy Is The Head, we found that lower frequencies were largely lost, or converted into lower-end mids \u2013 making for a perfectly pleasant sound, though music fans after real audio fidelity probably won\u2019t find what they want here.",
    "The Honor Magic Earbuds offer a satisfying collection of features for its mid-range price tag, including active noise-cancelling and pleasing out-of-ear audio pause functionality.",
    "Audio, however, is a bit rough around the edges, and we can\u2019t help but feel that the sound should have been more controlled. We tested Honor\u2019s buds in tandem with the 2017 Apple AirPods and found the latter were far easier on the ears, with deeper bass and an overall more balanced sound, which is a disappointing realization when reviewing a 2020 model.",
    "While this Apple imitator undercuts the AirPods on cost, something like the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 may be a better choice at this price point."
