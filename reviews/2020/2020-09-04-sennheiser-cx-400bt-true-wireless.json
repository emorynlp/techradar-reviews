  "summary": "\u2018Affordable\u2019 Sennheisers have Apple AirPods firmly in their sights",
  "verdict": "They\u2019re not the most glamorous nor the most distinctive \u2013 but Sennheiser\u2019s new CX400BT true wireless earbuds have it where it counts. They sound open and articulate, and if there\u2019s detail in a recording to be extracted, you can rely on them to do just that.",
  "pros": [
    "Widescreen, detailed, and quite upfront sound",
    "More comfortable to wear than they look",
    "Great app and good touch-control"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can be excitable with treble sounds",
    "Ordinary battery life",
    "Don\u2019t quite look or feel the asking price"
  ],

    "Having established its credentials as a high-end true wireless earbud front-runner with two generations of its Momentum True Wireless, Sennheiser\u2019s now turned its attention to the less rarefied area where Apple, Microsoft, Sony and all the rest duke it out. At \u00a3169 / $199 / AU$299 / AED799, the CX400BT are pitched right into the thick of the action.",
    "Happily, the CX400BT are specified to compete. They have aptX Bluetooth connectivity, with SBC and AAC codecs catered for too; they have app-based EQ adjustment; they have responsive touch-controls (which can be customised in the app); and they can be operated using Google Assistant or Siri.",
    "They share the same 7mm full-range dynamic driver as their more expensive Momentum True Wireless 2 siblings too, though they go without that model\u2019s active noise-cancelling technology. Thanks to four sizes of eartip in the packaging and the twist-to-fit arrangement, there\u2019s actually quite a lot of passive noise-cancelling delivered once you\u2019ve established the correct fit.",
    "On an aesthetic level, there\u2019s not a great deal to discuss \u2013 Sennheiser has never been the showiest headphones brand around, and anyone expecting a little Apple or Microsoft-style weirdness is going to be disappointed. The plastics they\u2019re built from don\u2019t feel anything special, and in all honesty the CX400BT look a little clumsy in situ, but despite a 6g-per-\u2019bud weight they prove comfortable even over extended periods.",
    "\u2018Extended\u2019 in this instance means a battery life of up to seven hours from the earbuds themselves \u2013 there\u2019s another 13 hours held in the charging case. A total of 20 hours\u2019 battery life is by no means a disaster, but it puts the Sennheisers at a mild disadvantage compared to any number of nominal rivals.",
    "The word \u2018disadvantage\u2019 doesn\u2019t apply where the sound of the CX400BT is concerned, though. They\u2019re an open, eloquent and prodigiously detailed listen, with some particular talent where texture and timbre are concerned. Only the rather assertive treble frequency response stops the Sennhesiers scoring the full five stars.",
    "The Sennheiser CX400BT are available to buy from September 15, 2020, and cost $199 / \u00a3169 / AU$299 / AED799.",
    "That puts them at the same price point as the Apple AirPods with Wireless Charging Case (unless you can find a great AirPods deal, that is), but cheaper than noise-cancelling rivals like Sennheiser\u2019s own Momentum True Wireless 2 and the Sony WF-1000XM3.",
    "Cheaper wireless earbuds are available, though; the Lypertek Tevi and Camrbidge Audio Melomania 1 are two examples of true wireless earbuds without ANC that sound great and cost under $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150.",
    "Sennheiser doesn\u2019t so much \u2018design\u2019 a product as \u2018put all the necessary components inside a housing\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s safe to say that \u2018design\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to have been any more of a consideration with the CX400BT than with any other product in the Sennheiser catalogue.",
    "Of course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the way the CX400BT are made. But the plastics from which they\u2019re constructed don\u2019t feel anything special, and they\u2019re chunky enough to sit proud of the wearer\u2019s ears when they\u2019re in place. Despite the rather ungainly appearance, though, and the unpromising 6g-per-earbud weight, the CX400BT remain secure and comfortable for hours on end.",
    "The charging case is equally prosaic in its materials, and at 59 x 34 x 42mm and 37g (when empty) it\u2019s no shrinking violet either. All this relative bulk makes the 20 hours\u2019 all-in battery life of the CX400BT a bit of a disappointment.",
    "Still, the sizable Bluetooth earbuds means there\u2019s plenty of room for a capacitive touch surface, and the Sennheisers prove very simple and responsive to operate. Between the left and right \u2018buds, all the obvious stuff - \u2018play / pause\u2019, \u2018answer / end / reject call\u2019, \u2018skip forwards / backwards\u2019, \u2018volume up / down\u2019 and \u2018summon voice assistant\u2019 \u2013 is catered for. Voice assistants extend as far as Siri and Google Assistant \u2013 and thanks to some sharp-eared mics in each earbud, your assistant of choice will have no more trouble understanding you than anyone you\u2019re having a telephone conversation with.",
    "It\u2019s straightforward to tailor your CX400BT experience using Sennheiser\u2019s exemplary \u2018Smart Control\u2019 app. Clean and stable where so many alternatives are busy and flaky, it\u2019s everything you want from a control app \u2013 and the ability to rearrange the touch controls, fiddle with EQ settings, decide how to answer calls and so on, is extremely gratifying.",
    "The CX400BT are supplied with four sizes of silicone eartips and, as with all in-ear designs, it\u2019s important to make sure you get the fit just so if you\u2019re going to hear them at their best. It\u2019s worth persevering with, because the Sennheisers\u2019 best is really very good indeed.",
    "The company\u2019s claiming a frequency response of 5Hz - 21kHz, and while the idea that the CX400BT can dig that deep is fanciful, there\u2019s no doubting their low-frequency credentials. Once through Danny Keane\u2019s Twenty Tonnes of Tension is ample for the Sennheisers to demonstrate their ability to shape bass sounds convincingly, loading them with information about texture and attack.",
    "Analogue and digital low frequencies scrap it out for primacy here, but the CX400BT have no problem spacing them out even as they\u2019re integrated into the recording as a whole. The bottom end attacks with straight-edged clarity, and the decay of individual notes is well managed at the bottom of the frequency range as a whole.",
    "Up in the midrange there\u2019s an equally gratifying amount of detail retrieved and laid out for inspection. Laurie Anderson\u2019s voice during Let X = X is intimate, immediate and absolutely packed with fine details \u2013 and as a result, it\u2019s entirely convincing. The CX400BT are an articulate and naturalistic listen on the whole, and nowhere is that more apparent than when they\u2019re loading voices with character and emotional weight.",
    "This is a fairly empty recording, and while the Sennheisers keep the vocal front-and-centre they give due consideration to the spaces between the sounds in the background. Consequently it\u2019s easy to understand the shape and scale of a soundstage, as well as individual instruments\u2019 position on it.",
    "In virtually every other sonic respect the CX400BT are equally accomplished. They have enough basic dynamism to put proper distance between \u2018very quiet\u2019 and \u2018very loud\u2019, and they have sufficient talent with second-stage harmonic dynamics to make even the most minor variations plain. You\u2019re never in any doubt the Sennheisers are handing over all available information, and maintaining it as a convincingly unified whole at the same time.",
    "About the only area where the Sennheisers overplay their hand is at the top of the frequency range. Unlike the more expensive Momentum True Wireless 2, which are the very model of high-frequency good taste, the CX400BT are confident to the point of recklessness. Eric B & Rakim\u2019s Microphone Fiend demonstrates the treble edginess well \u2013 the Sennheisers are constantly threatening to become uncomfortably hard, and it\u2019s a trait that becomes more pronounced the louder you listen or the more trebly the recording you\u2019re listening to. It\u2019s possible to dial down this top-end excitability in the control app, but you\u2019ll need to take care you don\u2019t neuter the sweet midrange response at the same time.",
    "Far be it from us to labour a point, but 20 hours all-in is not the most impressive battery life a true wireless in-ear ever enjoyed. Seven hours from the buds themselves, 13 in the case and a flat-to-full charging time of 90 minutes or so isn\u2019t going to trouble the likes of the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 or, for that matter, Sennheiser\u2019s own Momentum True Wireless 2.",
    "Connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.1, and while there\u2019s no aptX HD (or aptX Low Latency) compatibility here, the CX400BT are able to stream Hi-Res Audio files from the likes of Primephonic and Tidal without problems. And despite the lack of Low Latency functionality, we don\u2019t experience any sync issues when streaming video content. Pairing is swift and proves secure even over quite long distances."
