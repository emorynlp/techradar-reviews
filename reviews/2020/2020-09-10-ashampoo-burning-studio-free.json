    "Ashampoo Burning Studio Free is a comprehensive toolkit for burning CDs and DVDs. It features specially made profiles for different types of data, plus the ability to make quick backups.",
    "It\u2019s an impressive set of features for a free DVD burner, but this software\u2019s real selling point is its clean, simple interface that makes a potentially confusing task refreshingly simple.",
    "Ashampoo Burning Studio Free has a smart, slick interface that\u2019s a cut above many free DVD burners, with clearly laid out options for burning different types of disc: data, audio and videos. You can also use the software to copy discs, burn and create images (ideal for storing a bit-for-bit copy of a CD or DVD on your hard drive), and back up and restore selected files.",
    "The backup tool isn\u2019t as comprehensive as dedicated backup software (there\u2019s no scheduling, for example, and you can\u2019t choose to make incremental backups), but it\u2019s handy for tasks like making occasional copies of files that don\u2019t change often, such as photos. You can also set exclusion rules so certain types of file aren\u2019t included in your backup (such as system files, for example).",
    "If you have a rewritable disc, you can erase its contents with a click, and it\u2019s possible to copy CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays (though only if they\u2019re not protected by DRM, which is fair enough).",
    "The software isn\u2019t limited to burning, either; it can also rip audio CDs automatically, which is a welcome feature",
    "The premium version adds several handy features including the ability to add password protection, create animated menus and create labels and covers for your discs. It also supports disc-spanning, and can copy data to Compact Flash (CF) cards and microcards.",
    "These are all useful to have if you burn data regularly, but for occasional use, Ashampoo Burning Studio Free has everything you\u2019ll need.",
    "As is often the case, there are a few factors to watch out for when installing Ashampoo Burning Studio Free \u2013 though hopefully none will be a deal-breakers. When you run the installer, you\u2019ll be prompted to request a free registration key.",
    "To do this, you\u2019ll need to submit an email address. Ashampoo won\u2019t sell your email address to third parties, though it may be used to send you ads for its own software (which you can unsubscribe from).",
    "After clicking the email confirmation link, you\u2019ll be prompted to create an Ashampoo profile by entering your name, day and month of birth and country, but you can skip this if you prefer and go straight to your license key by clicking \u2018Not now\u2019.",
    "The installer contains no bundled adware, but will add a link to Ashampoo\u2019s online store to your desktop unless you deselect the option to add desktop icons during installation.",
    "Once installed, the software itself contains no banners or other advertisements, so you can concentrate on burning discs without distractions.",
    "Ashampoo is a well-known presence in the PC software market and been around for over 20 years. You can access the company\u2019s official website for technical or product-based queries (the website has a dedicated support section).",
    "The product support page provides detailed step-by-step instructions and tips for all of Ashampoo\u2019s apps. Product manuals are also available online, along with a detailed FAQ relating to product activation, features, and your account.",
    "If you are still unable to resolve your problem, there\u2019s an online support form which you can fill in, and a tech support representative will contact you at an email address you provide.",
    "Ashampoo Burning Studio Free is a very impressive DVD burner utility with a host of features made available at absolutely no cost. It meets all the basic disc burning needs, and indeed goes beyond that in many respects. Burning Studio Free doesn\u2019t demand much of your PC in terms of system specs either, and in short, this is a must-have package."
