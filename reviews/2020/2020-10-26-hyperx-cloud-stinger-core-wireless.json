    "Kingston\u2019s HyperX division made its name in the headset market thanks to a successful collaboration with Swedish peripherals maker QPAD in back in 2014. QPAD is like the Broken Social Scene of PC gaming gear - you probably haven\u2019t heard of them, but they basically invented everything you like.",
    "The HyperX Cloud took QPAD\u2019s excellent, aviation-inspired QH-90 headset design, turned the bass up a bit, and rightly found rapturous reception. And then the company did it again with the Cloud II. And again with the Cloud Alpha, each time modernizing the overall package while leaving the fundamental sound and comfort intact, because they were close to perfect. Until, of course, HyperX moved away from that model entirely.",
    "And unfortunately, the Cloud Stinger Core Wireless model\u2019s issues boil down to the fact that there\u2019s no discernible DNA from that QH-90 left. Instead of that reassuring hug the Cloud Alpha gave your temples, this headset gives a stiff prod - there\u2019s simply too much clamping force, even with the headband fully extended. There\u2019s also very little rotational movement to each earcup.",
    "This is unashamedly a budget proposition, priced well below $100, and in order to retain a lot of the pricier Cloud Stinger\u2019s core features sacrifices must be made, but comfort shouldn\u2019t be one of them.",
    "Because the quality of that contact around your head has a knock-on effect on the sound. Not to labor the point, but in the earlier Cloud models that snug fit and leatherette cushion cover material gave the frequencies an enclosed space to resonate, and provided great passive noise cancellation.",
    "Instead of the authoritative low-end response and tangible pulse you got around your ears from the first-gen Cloud headsets, this feels imprecise and unimpressive by comparison. Yes, there\u2019s a lot of low-end, but it doesn\u2019t push like it should.",
    "It\u2019s not all bad, though. There\u2019s really useful clarity higher up the EQ range, whether you\u2019re using the 7.1 virtual surround or not. That makes these cans a viable option for anyone who plays shooters with a lot of important positional sound cues. Even though the bass sounds a bit muddy, the overall response is tight enough for an Overwatch session without losing track of characters announcing their imminent specials.",
    "More positives are to be found when the sound\u2019s going in the other direction. The boom arm has a satisfyingly pliable construction which means it stays just where you place it, and the mic\u2019s fuller than we\u2019d expect at this price range. It\u2019s not detachable, but this isn\u2019t the kind of model you\u2019d want to take to the streets in the first place, so we won\u2019t hold that against it.",
    "Controls couldn\u2019t be much simpler - a power button on the rear-lefthand earcup, with a volume scroll just below it, and a USB-C input below that for charging. The mic mutes after a notched point on its hinge, which is a feature we love in every mic we test, and battery life seems to hold up to the advertised 17 hours. That\u2019s a lot.",
    "Wireless setup is simple and stable too, on both PC and PS4 (it's compatible with both, and PS5). There\u2019s not much to be said about the accompanying software, other than that it doesn\u2019t give you a whole bunch to tweak, but we can live without EQ profiles at this price. It\u2019s annoying having to set your chat mix in Windows sound settings, though.",
    "It\u2019s not a Cloud, or a Cloud II, or a Cloud Alpha, then. It doesn\u2019t look, sound, or feel as good as any of those older, similarly priced, wired headsets. That\u2019s a slightly baffling turn of events, and it means you really need to want the wireless functionality for the Stinger Core Wireless to make any sense for you."
