  "summary": "A versatile gaming monitor",
  "verdict": "The Asus CG32UQ has a smart design, decent HDR, a 4K resolution and great image quality, including huge contrast. It has impressive speakers, and even packs in some RGB LEDs. However, its FreeSync implementation could be better, and its 32-inch size means it\u2019s not suitable for larger living rooms.",
  "pros": [
    "Fantastic contrast and good colors",
    "Powerful speakers",
    "Decent HDR options"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not large enough for living rooms",
    "AMD FreeSync performance is only middling"

    "The Asus CG32UQ is a gaming monitor that\u2019s designed for console users \u2013 and it delivers a 4K resolution, good HDR options and AMD FreeSync.",
    "It sounds great on paper, but it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 this panel will set you back $800 (\u00a3783, around AU$1,800).",
    "It also has unexpected competition from the BenQ PD3200U, which is a rival 32-inch 4K panel at a similar price. The BenQ is designed for business, but it\u2019s very good for gaming.",
    "The Asus CG32UQ has a 4K resolution, which means is well-placed to handle the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X alongside the PS5, Xbox Series X and high-end gaming PCs.",
    "The VA technology will deliver top-notch contrast, and the Asus adheres to DisplayHDR 600. It\u2019s a mid-range HDR specification that won\u2019t match the best HDR TVs, but it will still provide a noticeable improvement in games.",
    "The Asus also has AMD FreeSync, but it tops out at 60Hz. That refresh rate is high enough to provide smooth single-player experiences, and it\u2019s a challenge for PCs to render some 4K games beyond 60fps.",
    "However, a 60Hz refresh rate isn\u2019t fast enough for competitive play in games like Fortnite and Rocket League. With Sony and Microsoft both touting 120Hz playback for their next consoles, that\u2019s a disappointment.",
    "Similarly, the response time of 5ms is fine for single-player gaming but not good enough for competition play.",
    "The 31.5-inch diagonal size is an issue, too. While this is a large display by PC standards, it\u2019s small when compared to TVs, and it\u2019s too small for most living rooms. You need to consider how far away you\u2019ll be sitting \u2013 and if you\u2019ll be able to see game HUDs \u2013 before you buy this panel.",
    "The rival BenQ is the same size as the Asus, with the same resolution, and it offers an IPS display with no AMD FreeSync or HDR. Its IPS technology should deliver better colours, but it won\u2019t have the same smoothness or depth of contrast as the Asus.",
    "The Asus CG32UQ has several neat features. For example, the stand has USB ports for charging phones and controllers, and there are customisable RGB LEDs on the rear.",
    "It has height adjustment and forward and backwards tilting, but no left-to-right swivel.",
    "The on-screen display uses a big, bright blue menu system that can be navigated with a neat remote control.",
    "The Asus has two 12W speakers, and they\u2019re punchy, with lashings of bass and volume. They\u2019re far better than the speakers included in most monitors, and are easily good enough for gaming. Only TVs will be better.",
    "Meanwhile, BenQ\u2019s display has more USB ports, a card reader and better adjustment options, but no RGB LEDs and poorer speakers.",
    "But how well does it perform? The Asus CG32UQ\u2019s brightness level of 425cd/m2 is very impressive, and the black level of 0.14cd/m2 is deep. They create a contrast ratio of 3,035:1 \u2013 a vast figure that produces huge depth and intensity across the entire color range. It\u2019s miles better than the BenQ.",
    "Colors are also accurate: the Delta E of 2.2 is solid, the color temperature of 6,904K is reasonable, and the panel renders a stunning 99.8% of the sRGB gamut. For mainstream gaming, that\u2019s top-notch, although the BenQ is a little better.",
    "With HDR activated the Asus\u2019 contrast level approached 4,000:1 and it covered a very good 95.6% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Those high figures deliver a noticeable boost to games. DisplayHDR 1000 is better still, but the Asus CG32UQ is still decent in this regard."
