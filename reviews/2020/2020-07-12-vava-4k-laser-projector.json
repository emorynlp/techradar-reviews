  "verdict": "The Vava 4K projector proves to be one of the best projectors on the market today, with a bright projection and the beginnings of HDR capability. A messy app store and lack of either Netflix or Hulu is hard to swallow, and 8-bit HDR isn't as advanced as we'd hope, but make no mistake \u2013 the Vava 4K projector is a great choice nonetheless.",

    "Effortless style",

    "The Vava 4K projector has a lot going for it, which is all the more surprising for its humble beginnings, having been crowdfunded during development. It's now proving to be one of the best projectors on the market today.",
    "As an ultra-short throw laser projector, you\u2019re getting a massive picture (up to 150 inches) while only having to place it a few inches away from a wall or screen. As a 4K HDR projector, too, you\u2019re getting highly detailed images and a rich color spectrum \u2013 beautifully powered by a 2,500 lumens peak brightness lens, ensuring pixels pop and shine with color. (You are settling for 8-bit HDR, rather than 10-bit, though.)",
    "The smart platform is somewhat secondary here, with an old iteration of Android TV and a couple of big-name apps (Netflix, Hulu) nowhere to be seen. But with Vava\u2019s mix of bright 4K images, impactful color, and ultra short-throw picture \u2013 all packaged in a gorgeously sleek design \u2013 it's a brilliant choice for a new home projector. And it won\u2019t cost you the earth, either.",
    "UPDATE: The Vava 4K laser projector is now available in an additional black coloring, alongside the original white model \u2013 meaning it should be easier for you to pick a model that matches your decor.",
    "This Vava UST projector retails at $2,799 in the US. If you do manage to ship it elsewhere, you may need to supplement its smart OS with a localized streaming stick, given its US-centric operating system.",
    "It\u2019s a good sight cheaper than our best projector pick, the $6,000 LG HU85LA CineBeam, though a touch more expensive than its runner up, the HU80KSW. You\u2019re probably paying a similar amount, or not too much less, for an equivalently performing television with 60W audio \u2013 and all in all you\u2019re getting a level of performance worth the asking price.",
    "The Vava 4K projector certainly has a winning appearance. With soft edges, an inoffensive white/gray (or black/gray) coloring, and a soft fabric mesh covering the front and sides, it\u2019s one projector that should fit in easily with the decor. (Dimensions are 533 x 368 x 107mm, if you need to measure it up with your counter, too.)",
    "Most of the blemishes on the casing \u2013 say, for the vents at the projector\u2019s sides \u2013 are out of view and kept away from the front of the model. As with most projectors, ports are hidden at the back, facing the wall, which is great for a clean appearance, though any jutting cables or streaming sticks can prevent the projector getting more than around 5 inches from the wall, though you shouldn\u2019t need to get any closer.",
    "Vava tells us a distance of 7.2 inches results in a 100-inch image, with a total range of 80-150 inches, depending how close you place the projector to the wall. It should go without saying that, if you don\u2019t have an 80-inch patch of wall to spare in your home, this projector isn\u2019t right for you.",
    "A motion detection system also ensures that, if you peer over the top of the projector (as we did during testing), the picture will cut out and be replaced by a warning sign, asking you not to look directly into the lens (you know, like you\u2019re not meant to stare right at the sun?).",
    "The ports at the rear include three HDMI 2.0 ports, with one support eARC for connecting an external soundbar (if you wish to). There are also audio input and output ports, for connecting to a wider audio setup or using the Vava projector as a speaker from another device source. There\u2019s an Ethernet port, too, for connecting to the internet, S/PDIF, and a single USB port.",
    "The remote is also sleek, with an identical two-tone color scheme and a minimal button layout, including volume, home, back, menu, power, mute, and navigation buttons. The Vava logo is inscribed at the bottom end of the remote, and identical upside down, which is a pleasing touch. It requires two AAA batteries (included, as is a cleaning cloth for the projector lens).",
    "You\u2019ll find a relatively basic Android 7.1 operating system, despite there being an Android 10 OS for smart TVs these days. It\u2019s mostly simple to use, though, with a home menu that lists HDMI inputs (very handy) as well as the App Store, File Manager, and Multi-Screen (for casting). There is a huge amount of app support, including (but not limited to) Disney Plus, Now TV, YouTube TV, JustWatch, Syfy, Amazon Prime Video, AMC, Showtime, BBC News, ESPN, iflix, Deezer, DC Universe, HBO Go, HBO Now, and HBO Max.",
    "The main issue here is that more commonly used apps aren\u2019t listed first, making it difficult to comb through the hundreds of options to find what you\u2019re after. You can organize via name, date added, star rating, or number of downloads, but a little more curation would have been helpful here. Note that you won\u2019t find Netflix or Hulu on here either, though.",
    "The Vava 4K projector boasts a peak brightness of 2,500 lumens, which is what we\u2019d expect for this price point (the \u2018peak\u2019 being the brightest that individual sections of the projection can go).",
    "While some truly high-end models, like the Epson LS100, offer up to 4,000 nits, the Vava projector is certainly capable of bright and vivid images. (The specs for the projector cite 6,000 lumens for the light source, but what\u2019s important is the brightness of the image on the wall or screen itself.)",
    "As ever with a projector of this brightness, it can struggle to show shadow detail when playing in light environments \u2013 especially in summer, and in rooms with a lot of outside light leakage. When viewing dark scenes, a dark environment is pretty necessary, but mostly the Vava projector manages admirably to offer an impactful picture.",
    "HD images look rich and detailed, even on the larger end of the Vava projector\u2019s 80-150-inch picture. Upscaling an HD/SDR stream of Black Panther feels seamless, with smooth motion on both opening shots on a basketball court and an aerial assault on a convoy of trucks. Colors are distinct, and clearly benefit from the brightness of the projection, too, especially with the purple and blue skies of the \u2018spirit plane\u2019.",
    "To test out 4K/HDR we turned to The Shape of Water on 4K Blu-ray, and found the level of detail still up to scratch, befitting the Ultra HD resolution of the source. For a movie so subsumed in deep, verdant greens, these colors didn\u2019t come across quite as forcefully as those closer to blue, which appear to be more prominent.",
    "You won\u2019t find a proper wide color gamut here \u2013 just Rec.709, which means you only get 8-bit color depth, rather than the 10-bit color depth that HDR10 is capable of. The colors are still noticeably improved over SDR, but it\u2019s disappointing to see HDR hardware restricted on this basic metric.",
    "We recommend setting Brightness to High rather than Standard to up the impact of color, though you will make the fans work a bit harder in the process.",
    "The Vava projector doesn\u2019t slump in the sound department, either. With an integrated 60W soundbar, courtesy of audio specialists Harman Kardon, you\u2019re getting some decent heft and detail for a projector.",
    "The soundbar consists of only two 30W drivers, so you\u2019re not getting a hugely varied separation of channels, but the sound is still rich and detailed. In the opening scenes of The Incredibles, the lively score rushes to the forefront, and then subtly rumbles underneath the action as the blare of police sirens and revving engines emerge. The smashed glass of a window, the distant tick of an explosive off camera; all these minute details come across clearly. Not with the depth of a proper 5.1 speaker setup, but certainly with adequate impact for a movie night in. An additional subwoofer might be a good investment, though, to get more of lower frequencies across.",
    "You won\u2019t get Dolby Atmos here, but it does support Dolby Audio and dts-HD formats, which are a start.",
    "There\u2019s also Bluetooth connectivity, meaning you can use these 60W speakers to play music from other source devices like a smartphone. Keep in mind that a regular Bluetooth speaker won\u2019t have to compete with the noise of a projector fan, though."
