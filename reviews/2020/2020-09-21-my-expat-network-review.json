  "author": "sead-fadilpasic",
  "summary": "Capable, but slow at times",
  "verdict": "If you need access to any of the popular streaming channels or P2P file exchange, then My Expat Network is a good choice, as long as you don\u2019t mind sometimes volatile download speeds. It is also a solid option for users who want privacy in restrictive countries that may be actively blocking VPN providers but its privacy policy is a bit short and customer support slow to respond.",
  "pros": [
    "Unblocks all popular VOD channels",
    "Deploys StealthMode",
    "Allows torrenting",
    "30-day money-back guarantee"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Small server network",
    "Can be slow",
    "Not many details in its privacy policy",
    "Customer support could use improvement"

    "Headquartered in Hong Kong, My Expat Network is a VPN platform that has been active for over 10 years - so it knows a thing or two about how to provide a good anonymity service.",
    "It doesn\u2019t have a lot of servers, at least not thousands like some of the best VPN providers, its download speeds can be inferior, and it isn\u2019t the cheapest on the market, but it does unblock all the main streaming services and provides an optional second layer of encryption to bypass VPN blocking measures.",
    "You can sign up for My Expat Network\u2019s services under one three billing options. If you go for the 1-month option, you\u2019ll be charged $10.99/month, the 12-month subscription will cost you $6.79/month, while the cheapest option is the 24-month plan at $5.49/month. These rates place the provider slightly toward the more expensive end of the pricing range.",
    "If you wanted to test the service before making the final decision, you won\u2019t get a traditional free trial. However, there\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee which you can use instead if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re getting.",
    "Regardless of the chosen subscription option, you\u2019ll be able to run up to 5 simultaneous connections, or more if you enable it on a router or buy one pre-installed.",
    "Buyers can pay using PayPal or credit cards - and cryptocurrencies are not accepted.",
    "My Expat Network is good, but there are better VPN providers out there, especially considering its price. For example, NordVPN, CyberGhost, and Surfshark are all cheaper, but with a lot more servers, user-friendly clients for every major platform, and readily available customer support.",
    "If you can afford it, ExpressVPN is even better, although more expensive.",
    "My Expat Network is an expert in unblocking some of today\u2019s most popular video-on-demand platforms like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and many more.",
    "Considering this is the reason why many users start using a VPN in the first place, it is certainly an important quality.",
    "My Expat Network Limited is a Hong Kong-based company. There aren\u2019t many servers in its network, only 120, which is not even close to thousands some of the top providers have.",
    "These servers are scattered across 12 countries, including in Canada, Australia, Spain, and more.",
    "To protect your privacy, My Expat Network deploys the bullet-proof AES-256 encryption and OpenVPN and IKEv2 connection protocols. Its apps are also equipped with DNS leak protection and a kill switch, which shuts down your internet access if the VPN connection is interrupted. Torrenting is supported, albeit only on the Netherlands servers.",
    "For an additional level of encryption, you can use the \u201cStealth Mode\u201d VPN connection, which helps you bypass local restrictions on VPN usage, which are in effect in places like China or the United Arab Emirates. However, the provider recommends you use the Primary connection as default and only turn on the Stealth Mode when absolutely required as the additional encryption may have a negative effect on connection speed.",
    "My Expat Network claims to not retain or store any information regarding your Internet activity, the bandwidth you use, or any of your DNS queries, and that\u2019s as much as we get from its no-logs policy. We aren\u2019t told if any other logging takes place, such as IP addresses, devices used, geo-location, connection times, etc. We also have no choice but to trust it, as there hasn\u2019t been an independent audit of its claims.",
    "If you\u2019re using any of the major platforms, you\u2019ll be able to run this provider\u2019s services, as it supports Windows, iOS, Mac, Android, and Linux with native clients, as well as DD-WRT and Sabai Technology routers with manual installation and config files.",
    "Its Android app has been downloaded 10,000+ times but only got a 2.7 rating out of 5, as rated by 81 users. It was last updated on July 4, 2019. The iOS app has performed even more poorly, with 1.9 stars from 12 people. It was last updated on May 11, 2020.",
    "The provider\u2019s support center is quite large and contains all sorts of articles, installation guides, FAQs, and more. Users also have at their disposal an online helpdesk and an optional installation service which helps you set everything up with the help of TeamViewer.",
    "Keep in mind, however, that the online helpdesk isn\u2019t the same as live chat and you may need to wait for a while before you receive a response to your query. Two days in and we still haven\u2019t received a reply to a simple question.",
    "My Expat Network\u2019s desktop apps aren\u2019t as straightforward as they should be. As soon as you install the app, it will hide away in your taskbar and you\u2019ll only see it when connecting or tinker with the settings.",
    "Testing download speeds gave us some pretty mixed results. The server in Italy gave us a solid 23Mbps on a 40Mbps test connection, while the one in the UK only delivered 8.3Mbps. We also tried connecting to a server in the US and it gave us a very good 18Mbps, although during the subsequent testing it fell to only 8.37Mbps.",
    "My Expat Network is a solid provider of VPN services that unblocks popular streaming channels, enables torrenting, and uses additional encryption methods to circumvent blocking of VPN service by governments and ISPs. However, its download speeds are a bit unpredictable, its server network small, and customer service slow to respond to direct questions.",
    "If these are a priority for you, you might want to consider a better solution such as ExpressVPN instead, as it\u2019s the best VPN service that money can buy."
