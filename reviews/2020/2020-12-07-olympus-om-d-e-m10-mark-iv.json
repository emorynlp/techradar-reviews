  "verdict": "The E-M10 Mark IV is an easy camera to overlook, but if you're looking for a small, stills-focused camera, it deserves serious consideration. Olympus has carefully refined this model over the years, keeping a strong focus on taking beautiful pictures. Its combination of a 20MP Micro Four Thirds sensor, 3-inch flip-down touchscreen and five-axis in-body image stabilization put it in a different league to smartphones and most pocket cameras. If you\u2019re a beginner or enthusiast who\u2019s looking to take the next step up in photography, this is a brilliant option.",
  "pros": [
    "Capable 20MP sensor",
    "Impressive image stabilization",
    "Handy flip-down touchscreen",
    "Very compact body",
    "Hundreds of affordable lenses"

    "Despite its complex name, the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV is a simple, compact entry-level mirrorless camera. And if you're a beginner or keen photographer looking for a compact body that takes consistently attractive photos, it's a camera that has to be on your list.",
    "Sure, the E-M10 Mark IV is lacking some of the more advanced features being touted by its pricier rivals, like phase-detection autofocus, 4K/60p video and microphone/headphone inputs. But it does a brilliant job as a stills camera that can shoot a little bit of quality video when needed.",
    "The camera's approachable button layout and combination of Bluetooth/Wi-Fi functionality means it's primarily designed to tempt smartphone photographers over to an interchangeable lens camera. And as a Micro Four Thirds (MFT) camera, it has one of the widest selection of lenses around.",
    "Although the Micro Four Thirds system was originally created by Panasonic and Olympus, a wide range of companies have now produced quality, affordable lenses for MFT-compatible cameras. This makes it a great system for beginners to invest in.",
    "One big thing this camera has in its favor is superb in-body image stabilization (IBIS). This system is the same as the one used in Olympus' award-winning flagship E-M1 series, and it works a treat for capturing images at slower shutter speeds handheld.",
    "The E-M10 Mark IV is Olympus\u2019 answer to cameras like the Panasonic Lumix G100, Fujifilm X-T200 and Sony ZV-1. And it manages to stand out with its classic OM-D styling, super-compact body and that excellent IBIS system. The 20MP resolution isn\u2019t going to grab any headlines, but it's a significant and welcome step up over its predecessor's 16MP sensor, and keeps it within range of the competition.",
    "While it's a great first camera for beginners, we'd also recommend the E-M10 Mark IV to more experienced photographers on a budget or those looking to downsize from a DSLR. It doesn\u2019t deliver the battery or image quality performance of high-end mirrorless cameras or DSLRs, but it could be a great option as a recce or second camera.",
    "The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV was released in August 2020 and was available to buy immediately for a body-only price (in black or silver) of $699 / \u00a3699.99 / AU$1,299.",
    "Naturally, there is also a kit lens bundle available, with the M.Zuiko Digital ED 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 EZ bundle we tested costing $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,499. Australian fans can also buy the E-M10 Mark IV with a longer M.Zuiko Digital ED 14-150mm f/4-5.6 II zoom lens from for AU$1,799 (around $1,285 / \u00a3985).",
    "Despite being relatively new, we've already seen some discounts on the OM-D E-M10 Mark IV, which bring its price more in line with rivals like the Fujifilm X-T200. That said, if you're on a tighter budget, it's worth checking prices on this camera's E-M10 Mark III predecessor.",
    "While the latter lacks the new sensor or flip down screen, you can currently pick it up for $449 / \u00a3449 / AU$799, which is impressive value.",
    "The first thing that strikes you about the E-M10 IV is its diminutive size. It\u2019s small enough to fit into the pocket of regular fit trousers \u2013 and that\u2019s with its 14-42mm M.Zuiko f/3.5-5.6 pancake kit lens attached.",
    "We've always been huge fans of the twin control dial setup of the E-M10, as it allows you to make adjustments to both shutter speed, aperture or exposure compensation with ease when shooting manually.",
    "The mode dial that sits beside them provides straightforward access to the camera\u2019s nine shooting modes, including video. There\u2019s also a dedicated video record button, placed sensibly on the shoulder of the camera for quick access.",
    "There isn\u2019t much room for buttons elsewhere on the camera, but Olympus has managed to place controls that cover most key functions without making the camera feel cluttered. There\u2019s also touchscreen access via the rear LCD, further boosting the camera\u2019s usability.",
    "The 3.0-inch LCD touchscreen is the most ambitious of the series so far. This time, the E-M10 IV\u2019s screen tilts upwards 90-degrees for shooting at hip level, and also flips downwards 180-degrees in the other direction. This positions it under the camera for selfies and vlogging. It\u2019s good to see more flexibility introduced, but it does present a potential issue for people who want to self-shoot while using the camera on a tripod.",
    "The E-M10 IV's 2.36m-dot OLED viewfinder, unchanged from the previous model, provides a clear view of the scene ahead with settings overlaid on top. This means that once you\u2019re familiar with the layout, you won\u2019t need to take your eye away from the viewfinder to make adjustments.",
    "The share button on the top left shoulder doubles as a quick menu when taking pictures. But in playback this provides simple access to the camera\u2019s share-to-smart device functionality.",
    "The E-M10 Mark IV is powered by a TruePic VIII imaging processor, which works to deliver reduced noise in images captured in low light and has a native ISO sensitivity range of ISO 200-6400. This can be expanded to ISO 80 (LO) and ISO 25,600 (HI), but you\u2019d be wiser to take advantage of the camera\u2019s quality five-axis in-body image stabilization system (IBIS) before you crank the ISO up to those numbers.",
    "This IBIS system is same as the one in Olympus' award-winning flagship E-M1 series, and it's excellent. It boosts the E-M10 Mark IV's handheld shooting capabilities and means you can pack light and don\u2019t need a tripod to get fantastic shots, even at night.",
    "Also borrowed from the upper tier of OM-D cameras, is the updated 121-point autofocusing system, which can better detect and track faces and eyes.",
    "Aside from these features, there aren\u2019t other big spec or physical changes of note from the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III. It\u2019s a sensible update, one that focuses on improving the camera\u2019s stills capabilities.",
    "Olympus has included its trademark scene (SCN) and Art Filter modes, which function as you might imagine, placing 'creative' looks over images. We're not huge fans, but they can be fun to have a play with. We're more keen on the Advanced Photo (AP) section of the mode dial.",
    "AP mode makes it super easy for people to create otherwise complex images, such as live composites for capturing star trails and light painting, long exposure images with live progress displayed on screen, multiple exposure images and more. These are a great way to explore photo creativity.",
    "Autofocus systems need to be predictable, even if they're not the fastest. The E-M10 Mark IV\u2019s autofocusing system may not be the most advanced in this camera class, but it functions consistently and that\u2019s the main thing we want from a camera\u2019s autofocus.",
    "Hybrid systems that incorporate on-sensor phase detection AF, such as the AF system featured in the Sony ZV-1, are superior and better suited for things like vlogging. This is because they are quicker at detecting faces from a range of angles and will stick with them more tenaciously without hunting for focus.",
    "If you\u2019re more concerned with photography, though, the E-M10 Mark IV\u2019s focusing system is capable of handling a range of moving subjects, including wildlife, field sports and planes. Although it\u2019s worth noting that its top continuous burst mode speed of 15fps (electronic shutter) can only perform at such speeds with fixed focus.",
    "Its 121 AF points cover a large amount of the frame, but its tracking capabilities are a little patchy, particularly when subject backgrounds are busy.",
    "We had the most consistent and pleasing results when sticking with AF-S and centre point focus. Use that and this camera can focus fast, even in low light.",
    "The E-M10 Mark IV is the most photo-centric camera in its category. While its rivals are more geared towards video shooters, this cameras wants to be a great stills camera first and foremost \u2013 and it does a solid job.",
    "Carrying a high resolution 20MP Micro Four Thirds sensor helps the E-M10 Mark IV capture a significantly more impressive dynamic range compared to smartphones and other small sensor cameras. This is most visible when looking at high contrast or night mode scenes. The physical advantage of a larger sensor means the E-M10 Mark IV has great light-gathering powers.",
    "Pushing the camera\u2019s ISO sensitivity to its limits, the results were usable, although details begin looking smudged past ISO 6400 when viewed at 100%. The ability to take better pictures in low light is further supported by the camera\u2019s five-axis in-body image stabilization. This manages to keep images sharp when shooting handheld as slow as 1/8th of a second, which is a significant advantage for dimly lit scenes.",
    "The IBIS system also works quite well during video recording when walking and panning. While the E-M10 Mark IV can be used to capture attractive looking video, it's not heavily geared towards video shooters.",
    "The omission of a microphone input or USB-C port, which could be used to adapt a microphone or headphone input, is another giveaway that this camera isn\u2019t focused on video. It\u2019s also capped at 4K/30p and FHD/60p resolutions. There\u2019s a high-speed movie mode, but it\u2019s only 120fps at 720p resolution. In terms of video specs, this is one of the most unambitious cameras released since the E-M10 Mark III in 2017.",
    "It is, though, a different story for stills. We were really impressed with this camera's basic kit lens \u2013 its 14-42mm pancake lens option is a fantastic starting place for someone upgrading from a phone.",
    "It offers a versatile focal range that covers everything from landscapes to portraits. Plus, given the super compact size of this camera/lens combo, it makes for an ideal travel companion. It will capture quality shots without attracting too much attention, so it\u2019s also ideal if you enjoy capturing more candid imagery.",
    "The camera\u2019s battery is rated to around 360 shots and under 30 minutes of video. This is typical for cameras in this class and at this price point. In use, we found it got us through a day of walking around, with it powering down into battery saver mode.",
    "If you predominantly use the electronic viewfinder (EVF) when shooting and aren\u2019t recording a lot of video, this camera should get you through a day trip before needing to charge. There\u2019s no dedicated battery charger in the box, mind, so you have to charge the battery in the camera via USB micro B input. Again, it\u2019s a shame to miss out on a USB-C input here, as it also means the camera cannot be used while charging."
