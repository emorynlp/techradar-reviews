  "verdict": "The Instant Vortex 6 is at the more expensive end of the market for air fryers. However, considering its 5.7-liter capacity \u2013 which makes it one of the largest air fryers available \u2013 and its durability, we think it\u2019s a reasonable price to pay for an appliance that\u2019s likely to become integral to your kitchen.",
  "pros": [
    "Uses a fraction of the oil you\u2019d normally need",
    "Easy to clean",
    "Handy smart presets"

  "cons": [
    "Bulky",
    "Limited selection of cooking settings"

    "Instant Pot is known for its combi-cooking gadgets, and the Vortex Air Fryer \u2013 it's called the Vortex 6 Quart in the US, and the Vortex 4-in-1 in the UK \u2013 is the latest addition to its line of air fryers. With a 5.7-liter capacity, this sizable kitchen appliance is designed to deliver super-crisp, juicy food in a fraction of the time it would take in a conventional oven. Unlike the best Instant Pots, the brand's air fryers don't offer pressure cooking or slow cooking functions, but you can use preset Smart Programs to air-fry, roast, bake and reheat in an instant, helping you to say goodbye to wasted oil and lingering frying smells, and hello to a safer, healthier way of cooking at home.",
    "The Instant Vortex 6 Air Fryer is currently available directly through Instant Pot\u2019s website, and from Amazon and other retailers, with an RRP of \u00a399.99 / $119.99 \u2013 see below for today\u2019s best prices where you are.",
    "Air fryers work by combining just a little oil with air that\u2019s quickly raised to roasting temperatures to produce the crunchy texture you\u2019d otherwise need a traditional deep-fat fryer to achieve. By cooking foods so quickly, an air fryer is able to ensure that they're crisp on the outside but moist on the inside, using only a fraction of the oil that\u2019s required for conventional roasting or frying.",
    "If you\u2019re accustomed to cooking such foods in the oven, you\u2019ll also find the results from an air fryer far more succulent than those cooked in an oven, which can easily dry out food by the time it\u2019s heated it all the way through.",
    "A key design difference between the Vortex and other models is its 5.7-liter / 6-quart square basket, as opposed to the smaller circle or oval baskets in other air fryers; Instant Pot boasts that it offers enough space to cook a small chicken. The square shape of the Vortex also ensures that you can make the most of every inch of space on your countertop, and that you can fit more into the tray, which is big enough to feed a whole family.",
    "Note, though, that at around 32cm high and 30cm wide this is a relatively bulky appliance, so if you don\u2019t have enough room to keep it on a countertop you\u2019ll need to store it away when it\u2019s not in use.",
    "The touchscreen and dial are intuitive to use, with no confusing options or over-complications. Each time you air fry, the machine sends out an alert once it\u2019s preheated, and when it\u2019s time to turn the food \u2013 but you can also ignore the latter if you\u2019re cooking for 1-2 people, since smaller quantities of food cook far more evenly as a result of the circulated air.",
    "The only fault we could find with the Vortex is that the settings for roasting and baking are restricted to very specific items \u2013 don\u2019t expect to bake a wide range of items here. A roasted butternut squash came out beautifully crisp after half an hour, but cinnamon rolls cooked on the Bake setting were far too crisp. There are cooking tips available for the Vortex Air Fryer online and via Instant's recipe app, but we'd have like to see more guidelines on baking and roasting times included with the appliance itself.",
    "The removable cooking tray inside the basket has a tendency to fall out when you\u2019re serving food, although this also means it's easy to remove and clean between uses.",
    "We were keen to see if the Vortex Air Fryer really could cut down on the amount of oil we used for cooking, and it didn\u2019t disappoint \u2013 certainly with potato wedges, for example. Whole baskets of food required only a tablespoon of oil for a wonderfully crispy texture. Helpfully, the cooking tray drains off any excess oil, so our food didn\u2019t soak up any more oil once the cooking time was complete.",
    "In a conventional oven, it\u2019s difficult to monitor food once cooking is underway, especially at high temperatures; opening the oven to check on progress reduces the temperature inside, adding extra cooking time. The Vortex is a more compact appliance, thus there\u2019s less space to heat, and as a result keeping an eye on cooking time and temperature was easier, and we never needed to add on extra cooking time as a result of fluctuations in temperature.",
    "Noise is a concern for many people who are considering buying an air fryer, but while the Vortex does make a whirring sound while running, the noise is at a similar level to that of an extractor fan; and since cooking times rarely exceed 20-30 minutes, it isn\u2019t something that would put us off using one.",
    "And if the Vortex\u2019s many talents described above aren\u2019t enough, it makes heating and cooking many processed foods super-easy, too \u2013 everything from spring rolls to leftover chips, cheese toasties, roti and arancini. While an air fryer can\u2019t cook foods typically drenched in batter that would usually be deep fried, it works a treat with foods that are high in oil content but aren\u2019t wet on the outside.",
    "In fact, it made us realize how much oil there is in everyday foods such as chip-shop chips and potato waffles, which all emerged crisp and succulent after only a few minutes in the fryer.",
    "If the health benefits of reduced oil consumption aren\u2019t enough, you\u2019ll no longer have to deal with the cooking smells that can linger for days after deep-frying food, nor any leftover oil. And for those with children, the Vortex is safer to have on a kitchen counter than an appliance that uses hot oil."
