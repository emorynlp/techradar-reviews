  "summary": "Asus brings Wi-Fi 6 performance to its ZenWiFi mesh routers",
  "verdict": "It\u2019s expensive, and not everyone will need the sheer speed of Wi-Fi 6, but the new ZenWifi AX mesh networking system provides top-of-the-range performance for streaming video, gaming and other online activities. The Asus app also impresses with a good set of advanced controls, security features, and content filtering for parents of young children.",
  "pros": [
    "Top-of-the-range Wi-Fi speeds",
    "Good parental controls",
    "Versatile app and security features"

  "cons": [
    "Expensive",
    "Fiddly set-up process",

    "The Asus ZenWifi AX (XT8) is quite possibly the best router the company has produced, and it's one of the best mesh router systems, and best Wi-Fi 6 routers, we've tested.",
    "You can\u2019t buy the Asus ZenWifi AX (XT8) directly from Asus, but it\u2019s widely available online. If you\u2019re in the UK and just need a Wi-Fi 6 upgrade for your existing router then you can buy a single ZenWifi AX for \u00a3219.99, which can cover an area of up to 2475sq.ft - although that single router option doesn\u2019t currently seem to be available in other countries.",
    "The two-piece mesh system that we review here covers a more extensive 4400sq.ft and costs a rather hefty \u00a3399.99/US $449.99/AU $899.00. It\u2019s available in either black or white - but be careful not to confuse it with the less expensive Asus ZenWifi AC (CT8), which is virtually identical but, as the name suggests, still uses the older 802.11ac version of Wi-Fi.",
    "It\u2019s expensive, even by the standards of new Wi-Fi 6 routers, but the Asus ZenWiFi AX earns its keep with an impressive combination of features and performance.",
    "The two routers support tri-band Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) on the 2.4GHz and two 5.0GHz bands, with a total speed of 6600Mbps (6.6Gbps). That\u2019s far beyond the speed of most current routers that use 802.11ac wi-fi, and even faster than many new Wi-Fi 6 routers as well.",
    "However, Wi-Fi 6 is still compatible with millions of devices that use 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you shouldn\u2019t have any problem using it with your existing computers and mobile devices.",
    "There are few home broadband services that come anywhere near the speeds supported by Wi-Fi 6, so Asus sets aside one of the 5.0GHz bands to be used as a \u2018backhaul\u2019 that provides a high-speed link between the two mesh routers, while still leaving the remaining 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands to transmit data to your computers and mobile devices.",
    "To make the most of the router\u2019s performance, each router also has a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port for high-speed Internet connections, along with three additional Gigabit Ethernet ports for devices that need a wired network connection, and a USB 3.1 port for sharing a USB storage device on your network.",
    "The Asus Router app and set-up procedure aren\u2019t quite as straightforward as we\u2019ve seen from other mesh systems, but once you\u2019ve got everything running the app does provide an impressive range of features.",
    "Most mesh systems start by using an Ethernet cable to connect the first mesh router to your existing broadband router, and you then place the other mesh routers further away in other rooms around your home. The Asus app doesn\u2019t tell you anything at this point at all, so you have to read ye olde printed manual to find out how to get started. And, somewhat unusually, both routers initially have to be plugged in and set up together in the same room - preferably sitting within three metres of each other.",
    "The Asus app then uses a Bluetooth connection on your iOS or Android mobile device to set up your new mesh network. And, unlike many routers and mesh systems, we were pleased to see that it starts off straight away by asking if you want to create a single network that combines the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands, or create two separate networks with different names and passwords. Once that\u2019s done you can unplug the second ZenWifi router and move it into another room to complete your new network.",
    "Again, though, the app doesn\u2019t help you here, leaving you to flick through the printed manual to find that information. It also has a tendency to throw jargon around, such as \u2018dynamic DNS\u2019, without explaining what it means, so Asus could do a bit more to clarify the set-up process for people who aren\u2019t too familiar with mesh technology.",
    "Thankfully, though, the Asus app is more straightforward once you\u2019ve got your new mesh networking up and running, and includes a good set of parental controls and other features. You can create profiles for family members under the age of 18, which are linked to the devices they use. These profiles allow you to create a schedule for Internet access, as well as using content filters to block unsuitable adult material, gambling or messaging apps for younger children.",
    "There\u2019s also a simple option for \u2018QoS\u2019 - quality of service - that allows you to prioritise bandwidth for specific services, such as streaming video or gaming, and even a bandwidth \u2018limiter\u2019 that can restrict the bandwidth used by individual devices.",
    "The app also includes Asus\u2019 AiProtection features, which keep an eye out for malicious websites, malware, and other outside attempts to hack into your home network. Many routers and mesh systems charge additional subscription fees for security features and parental controls such as these, so it\u2019s good to see Asus providing these features without any additional charge.",
    "We weren\u2019t disappointed by the performance of the ZenWifi AX either. It\u2019s not cheap, of course, but it pushed our 50Mbps Internet connection all the way - even squeezing it up to 60Mbps at one point (which sometimes happens when the weather is good for some reason). And, crucially, it was able to maintain that speed even in our back office, which often struggles to get a good wi-fi signal. Downloads from Steam hit 7.4MB/s for devices in the same room as the first ZenWifi, and barely flickered as we moved into the back office, with download speeds holding steady at 7.3MB/s even on the slower 2.4GHz band."
