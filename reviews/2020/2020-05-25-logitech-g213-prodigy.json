  "summary": "Does it earn a place on your desk?",
  "verdict": "The G213 impresses in several key areas: its mechanical-style typing action is robust and impressive, and it has good features for media playback and day-to-day use. Its build quality and lighting could both be better, though, and it\u2019s physically larger than its rivals.",
  "pros": [
    "Satisfying, impressive typing action",
    "Loads of media keys",
    "Plenty of features elsewhere"

  "cons": [
    "Mediocre build quality",
    "Underwhelming lighting",
    "Larger than rivals"

    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy is one of the more affordable keyboards around, with a price of $50 (\u00a340, around AU$80). It wasn\u2019t always this way, though \u2013 the G213 was originally released at nearly twice the price.",
    "The price drop means that the Logitech G213 Prodigy punches above its weight when compared to similarly-priced rivals like the Razer Cynosa Lite and SteelSeries Apex 3.",
    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy has an impressive collection of features. In the top-right corner it has an array of media buttons, a volume rocker, a Game Mode toggle and a button to switch the lighting on or off. This unit is spill-resistant, and it includes a braided cable. Logitech doesn\u2019t reveal the G213\u2019s rollover rating, but it\u2019s at least ten \u2013 so it\u2019s just as good as the Razer, and easily good enough for most gaming situations.",
    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy features RGB LEDs that can be customised across five different zones, and it includes a wrist-rest, but it still manages to look pretty modest, with no over-the-top design. In that sense, it\u2019s well-suited for both gaming and work.",
    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy's feature set also compares reasonably well to rivals. The Razer has one lighting zone, no media keys, no wrist-rest and no braided cable, but it is spill-resistant. The SteelSeries is spill-resistant too, and it has ten-zone lighting, 24-key rollover and a removable wrist-rest, but no Game Mode and fewer media keys.",
    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy may have good features, but it\u2019s not perfect. Its wrist-rest isn\u2019t removable, which means it\u2019s 218mm deep and 452mm wide \u2013 bigger than both rivals. There\u2019s no USB pass-through. Build quality is only mediocre: its plastic easily creaks back and forward.",
    "The Razer is more robust and it has macro recording on all of its buttons, while the Logitech G213 Prodigy only has macro recording on the function row.",
    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy's lighting is also mixed. The G213 may have five zones, which means solid versatility, but the lighting itself is a little weak and inconsistent. It\u2019s better than the Razer\u2019s illumination, but the SteelSeries had stronger lettering and an extra glow beneath the keys.",
    "On the inside, the G213 has membrane keys rather than mechanical buttons \u2013 no surprise at this price. The keys are designed to mimic mechanical units, and have 4mm of travel distance and a 50g actuation force. They also have a noticeable tactile bump in their action, just like many mechanical devices.",
    "The Logitech G213 Prodigy's buttons are tall and heavy \u2013 in that respect they\u2019re very similar to most mechanical keyboards. They\u2019re firm, with a noticeable bump when they bottom out, and they\u2019re quick.",
    "The heavy, satisfying and solid action will easily cope with mainstream gaming and esports.",
    "They\u2019re also very different to rivals. The Razer\u2019s buttons are softer, lighter and shorter \u2013 very similar. The SteelSeries keys are more closely matched, but they\u2019re noticeably bouncier than the G213. That characteristic will irritate some users.",
    "As ever, the Logitech G213 Prodigy\u2019s keys don\u2019t compare to proper mechanical hardware: these buttons may be tall, heavy and firm, but a mechanical keyboard will have more snap and heft. Also bear in mind that you could find a basic mechanical keyboard for only thirty dollars or pounds more."
