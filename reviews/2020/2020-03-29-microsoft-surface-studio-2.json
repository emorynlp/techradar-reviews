    "The Surface Studio 2 is still the most robust digital drafting table to date. Now, one might argue that the upgrades it received may not be on par with a lot of today\u2019s professional all-in-one PCs. However, this device was never meant to compete with most computers, so these updates are doing wonders for its core use case.",
    "Because of that core use case, however, the Surface Studio 2 isn\u2019t for everyone. If you\u2019re new to Microsoft\u2019s Surface world, you should make sure it\u2019s the right device for you before breaking open the piggy bank for this good-looking digital work table for artists. This PC will benefit digital media artists more than it\u2019ll benefit everyone else, so if you\u2019re not one, you\u2019re better off looking elsewhere.",
    "However, if you bought a Surface Studio back in the day and it\u2019s benefited you in ways that no other PC can, the Surface Studio 2 might mark the perfect time to upgrade. It\u2019s enhanced the original in pretty much every way, and the Surface Studio 2 should last for years to come.",
    "The Surface Studio 2 calls for a kingly sum of $3,499 or AU$5,499 (about \u00a32,680) \u2013 and that\u2019s just to start. (Sadly, Surface Studio 2 isn\u2019t yet available in the UK.)",
    "This is powered by a 7th generation \u2013 nope, not a typo \u2013 Intel Core i7 processor designed for laptops and gets you an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5) GPU, 16GB of DDR4 memory and a 1TB NVMe SSD. Yes, the hybrid drives are gone.",
    "This all sits beneath a 28-inch, 4,500 x 3,000 resolution PixelSense touch display that\u2019s now 38% brighter (515 nits) and offers a 22% higher contrast ratio (1,200:1).",
    "If you want to upgrade the Surface Studio 2, you may do so by switching the GPU to Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 (8GB GDDR5), the RAM to 32GB and as much as 2TB of SSD space. Unfortunately, you\u2019re still stuck with the 7th generation Intel Core i7 CPU.",
    "The configuration you see listed here \u2013 one of only three available in the US \u2013 will set you back $4,199 (AU$6,599, about \u00a33,319). This doubles the memory of the starting model and upgrades to the GTX 1070 GPU.",
    "It\u2019s hard to compare this desktop against competing all-in-one PCs for creatives and otherwise, since it is designed for a very specific audience: digital artists and other creators.",
    "However, the asking price has been bumped up by $500 in the US for innards that, while definitely better than the Surface Studio, are arguably outdated by today\u2019s standards. Hopefully, Microsoft fixes this shortcoming in the Surface Studio 3.",
    "All in all, it\u2019s hard to say what price should be put on such a niche product with such a specific use case, but this is an expensive piece of hardware no matter how you slice it.",
    "Absolutely nothing has changed in the Surface Studio 2\u2019s physical design over the original \u2013 this may be either a disappointment or music to your ears, depending on your perspective. Even the included wireless peripherals haven\u2019t really changed since the first Surface Studio was released.",
    "That said, Microsoft did take the chance to upgrade the Surface Studio display with this revision. The screen has been given quite a boost in the brightness and contrast departments by 38% (515 nits) and 22% (1,200:1), respectively.",
    "The improvements to brightness and contrast don\u2019t exactly blow our mind, personally, but we\u2019re sure they can make content more visible and workable for creatives. The increased brightness can bring out enhanced detail, while the boosted contrast will drive deeper blacks and lighter whites, and in turn offer more color depth.",
    "Beyond these points \u2013 and USB-C in lieu of a DisplayPort \u2013 there are no major design upgrades. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as the Surface Studio \u2018Gravity Hinge\u2019 doesn\u2019t need any improvements.",
    "However, we would have appreciated a starting price hike supported with a full array of USB-C 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 ports. This is especially true considering the Surface Studio 2\u2019s potential to serve as the hub of your desk. Not to mention its target audience: content creators.",
    "Also, why couldn\u2019t this product have received that jaw-dropping, all-black color scheme that adorns the Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Pro 6, release alongside the Studio 2? Imagine how that would bounce off the chrome accents and just disappear behind your work \u2013 a sorely missed opportunity.",
    "The keyboard and mouse inputs included in the box work just fine. The keyboard feels very similar to that of the Apple Mac desktop keyboards in terms of travel and feedback. The mouse, meanwhile, has a welcome curvature to it that\u2019s comfortable to hold. Both inputs require AA batteries. Sadly, there are no rechargeable peripherals here.",
    "The Surface Pen stylus that\u2019s also included will feel identical to those found on Surface Pro tablets, as it\u2019s the very same stylus. The only difference is that now you have a massive canvas to draw on with it, and the stylus shines when used on that much surface (get it?) area.",
    "Of course, the Surface Pen attaches to the left side of the display magnetically.",
    "Honestly, we\u2019re glad to see Microsoft\u2019s design persist in the sequel, as it was already rather brilliant. The Gravity Hinge still works effortlessly here, with all of the computer\u2019s major components hiding within its base.",
    "Speaking of which, the base has received a bit of an update with a USB-C 3.1 port in addition to its existing USB 3.0 ports, replacing the old model\u2019s mini DisplayPort.",
    "The parts inside the Surface Studio 2, on paper, look like peanuts compared to the latest processors and graphics cards available in similarly-priced desktop computers. However, none of those computers also serves as a high-resolution drafting table.",
    "Microsoft\u2019s unique positioning for Surface Studio 2 puts this computer into almost a whole category unto itself. However, its innards will be capable of basically all modern computing tasks regardless. Just don\u2019t expect to quickly encode 4K video, or drive the latest games at native resolution, with this machine.",
    "As you can see, this model is superior than its predecessor in every way \u2013 and by a considerable margin. This model is better at rendering 3D graphics as well as multitasking and at processor-intensive tasks, like encoding video and rendering dense, complex spreadsheets.",
    "However, for the content creator out there who doesn\u2019t do much with digital art generation or illustration, there are many more powerful options out there that are more affordable \u2013 even all-in-one PCs, like Apple\u2019s iMac Pro. Basically, if you don\u2019t find yourself using this 28-inch computer as a digital drafting table, at least a double-digit percentage of the time, we would seriously reconsider making the investment.",
    "Now, Microsoft may have included its Xbox Wireless connectivity protocol for its Xbox One controllers, and this PC may have the capability to handle many of the latest games at decent settings, but this is hardly a gaming PC. We wouldn\u2019t even remotely consider gaming to be a concern when purchasing this machine.",
    "When it comes to gaming, you can simply do far better for far less.",
    "Still, the Surface Studio 2 is perfectly capable for its primary use case \u2013 as well as a few others \u2013 so, don\u2019t let the arguably dated specs turn you off if you\u2019re a digital artist seeking fresh tools. For folks specifically in that crowd, the Surface Studio 2 could last you several years.",
    "Of course, the Surface Studio 2 comes with zero pre-installed software from third parties, coming directly from Microsoft. This is certainly part of the appeal of the Surface Studio 2, with so many other devices filling the operating system with software that\u2019s both non-essential and unwanted.",
    "However, that does leave the Surface Studio 2 with little to speak for in terms of unique software and features. What we can highlight is the Windows Hello camera.",
    "This is a 5MP (1080p) webcam that includes infrared sensors for facial recognition, and it appears to be largely unchanged from the previous. However, we couldn\u2019t help but notice just how fast the system registers your face and gives you access to the desktop. Honestly, it takes less time than we can say the words \u2018one second.\u2019",
    "Super fast logins that are also secure should make any user happy \u2013 digital artist or not.",
    "The Surface Studio 2 absolutely does what it ultimately sets out to do: improve upon the previous model in every way that\u2019s essential and changing nothing that didn\u2019t need changed. This version is faster, brighter and with more vibrant colors than before.",
    "Granted, this computer will absolutely look like an overpriced heap when stacked up against competitors, like the Apple iMac Pro, on paper. Spec-for-spec comparisons simply cannot capture the complete value found within Surface Studio 2.",
    "That said, its unique use case makes it one of the world\u2019s best digital drafting tables. For the digital artist out there looking to upgrade from the previous model, this iteration is a no-brainer. For newcomers, this model might seem far more prepared to weather the endless silicon improvements and upgrades, with even stronger support for 4K content creation and the latest accessories via USB-C.",
    "Surface Studio 2 isn\u2019t going to compare well against most computers simply because it was never meant to compete with them. This device is meant for the digital artist or other visually-focused content creator, and as that, it\u2019s going to be tough to beat \u2013 dated parts and all.",
