  "summary": "Can these bug-killing buds deliver on sound quality?",
  "verdict": "The LG Tone Free HBS-FN6 come with a nifty charging case that can kill \"up to 99.9%\" of the bacteria that lives on the speaker mesh of your earbuds, and they\u2019re comfy to wear thanks to a lightweight build. Unfortunately, the sound quality on offer is pretty abysmal \u2013 and that\u2019s what counts when it comes to headphones.",

    "The LG Tone Free HBS-FN6 earbuds are true wireless earbuds made for an age in which people are looking for increased protection against pathogens, coming with a UV light-touting charging case that LG says can kill \"up to 99.9%\" of bacteria on the speaker mesh of the buds.",
    "Whether this works isn\u2019t something we can say for sure without access to a lab, but the thought of not needing to regularly disinfect our earbuds is certainly an attractive prospect \u2013 and as any music aficionado knows, ear infections that make wearing earbuds or headphones uncomfortable aren't much fun.",
    "Unfortunately, this is one of the few noteworthy features the LG Tone Free have to offer, alongside good connectivity courtesy of Bluetooth 5.",
    "The design of these wireless earbuds is pretty unassuming, taking an aesthetic cue from the AirPods Pro \u2013 though they don\u2019t offer the noise-cancelling smarts of Apple\u2019s earbuds. They\u2019re lightweight and comfortable to wear, and a choice of silicone eartips plus IPX4 water resistance rating makes them suitable for use while working out.",
    "In truth, however, the audio quality offered by the LG Tone Free buds isn\u2019t very good at all \u2013 trebles sound harsh and distorted, while the bass manages to be both underwhelming and muddy at the same time.",
    "Their only saving grace here is that they handle mid frequencies fairly well (think pianos, vocals, and guitars), especially in simpler musical arrangements. However, once you give them anything much more complicated than a solo guitar and voice to deal with the soundstage becomes a muddled mess.",
    "We\u2019d expect more than that for the price you're paying \u2013 even if they can kill the bugs that hope to infect your ears.",
    "The LG Tone Free HBS-FN6 were first announced at CES 2020 in January, and went on sale shortly after. They cost $149.99 / \u00a3129.99 / AU$279 \u2013 though discounts are sometimes available \u2013 putting them at the lower end of the true wireless price scale.",
    "If you can live without the bacteria-eliminating UV light charging case, the HBS-FN4 are a cheaper alternative, coming in at $99 / \u00a379 (about AU$140).",
    "Coming in black and white, the LG Tone Free buds look pretty similar to the Apple AirPods Pro, with protruding ear stems and silicone eartips \u2013 although they don\u2019t offer the noise cancellation that you\u2019ll get with Apple\u2019s earbuds.",
    "The buds themselves are slick and lightweight, with a glossy finish on the housings and a matte finish on the touch-sensitive ear stems. You get a choice of three sizes of eartip in the box, and they feel very comfortable to wear, with a secure fit that makes them suitable for using while out and about.",
    "The earbuds also come with an IPX4 water resistance rating, which means you can use them while working out without worrying that a little sweat or rain will damage them \u2013 you definitely can\u2019t take them swimming though (for that, we\u2019d recommend checking out the best waterproof headphones of 2020).",
    "The touch-sensitive controls are housed at the very top of the ear stems; you can use these to play / pause your music, adjust the volume, answer phone calls, and activate Ambient Sound mode, which allows some environmental noise to pass through the buds \u2013 it's a handy feature if you need to quickly tune into your surroundings.",
    "We found that the controls are a little finicky, and you do have to be very deliberate in the way you press them, lest your taps be misinterpreted by the buds.",
    "The charging case has a round, featherlight design and flip-top lid, and it\u2019s definitely among the smaller charging cases we\u2019ve tested, which means you can easily slip it into your pocket when not in use \u2013 and thanks to its wireless capabilities you can charge it up on a wireless charging mat.",
    "On the front of the charging case is a small LED that gives you an indication of your remaining battery life, while a USB-C charging port can be found on the back.",
    "As mentioned, LG says the charging case is capable of killing 99.9% of bacteria on the speaker mesh of the earbuds. When you place the earbuds inside the case it blasts them with UV light, sanitizing them for the next time you use them \u2013 the charging case does need to be connected to the USB-C power cable in order for this to work.",
    "It\u2019s a bit gimmicky \u2013 and LG doesn\u2019t say whether the UV light is also capable of killing viruses, which in hindsight, may have be more useful during the current Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 but we can see how this feature may be reassuring to those who frequently share their earbuds with others.",
    "We\u2019ve certainly never heard of anyone becoming sick from bacteria on their earbuds, but what\u2019s the harm in taking extra precautions?",
    "We first tried the LG Tone Free HBS-FN6 earbuds by listening to Crystal Castles\u2019 Not In Love, and the sparkling synth ostinatos cut through the mix with clarity as Robert Smith\u2019s distinctive vocal commanded the track; however, the rest of the instrumentation suffered from a muddied sound that made it difficult to pick out the different instruments.",
    "Experimenting with the equalizer does yield some better results when using the Natural preset, but the bass frequencies tend to overpower the rest of the soundstage, while the trebles sometimes sound a little sibilant, with an annoying hiss when the volume picks up.",
    "The LG Free Tones fare better with less complex tracks; in Drunk Kid Catholic by Bright Eyes, the piano sounded clear and bright, while whining guitar lines wrapped fugue-like around Connor Oberst\u2019s angsty vocal. There was still that irritating sibilance in the high-frequency percussion, though, which detracted from the otherwise well-balanced mids.",
    "It seems these earbuds sound best when playing clean pop music. In Kimbra\u2019s Cameo Lover, the bass initially sounded tight and controlled, though it did begin to bleed into the other frequencies as the chorus picked up. The sparser verses with harmonized backing vocals sounded pretty good \u2013 but as more instruments are introduced, the soundstage became confused, with a lack of clarity across the board.",
    "Putting our theory to the test, we tried the buds out on Fleet Foxes\u2019 Oliver James \u2013 a song that relies purely on Robin Pecknold\u2019s resonant a capella vocal \u2013 and we found that the LG Free Tones sounded far clearer and more detailed, although that hissing quality was still there.",
    "The LG Tone Free earbuds offer a six-hour battery life, with an additional 12 hours contained within the wireless charging case; a quick five-minute charge will give you an hour of juice if you\u2019re in a hurry, too.",
    "That battery life is fairly underwhelming. While the buds themselves are longer-lasting than the likes of the Apple AirPods, the 18-hour total is significantly lower than you get from many of the best true wireless buds available today.",
    "We found that pairing the LG Tone Frees with our Nokia 7.2 was absolutely seamless, and that\u2019s thanks to Bluetooth 5 connectivity. We didn\u2019t experience any annoying connection dropouts while we were using them, and once you\u2019ve paired them initially, they\u2019ll automatically connect with your phone when you place them in your ears."
