  "summary": "The smart speaker goes portable",
  "verdict": "The Harman Kardon Citation 200 takes a Google Assistant smart speaker and makes it portable, without losing the stylish looks that we love about the rest of the brand's wireless speaker range. However, it\u2019s overly bassy sound profile lets it down where it matters most.",
  "pros": [
    "Stylish looks",
    "IPX4 water-resistance",
    "Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Overly bassy sound",
    "No voice assistant support without Wi-Fi"

    "Smart speakers are becoming a fixture in the modern home \u2013 but models like the Harman Kardon Citation 200 demonstrate that these hardworking devices have their place in the garden and on the move, too.",
    "Now there\u2019s one caveat with the Citation 200 \u2013 the onboard Google Assistant only works when you\u2019re connected to the Wi-Fi, so you can forget any dreams you had of using it to turn on your smart thermostat at the park before you get home.",
    "Once home though, you have all the functionality of a Google Assistant speaker \u2013 and that means you can ask it questions, give it commands, and control your other smart home devices.",
    "It looks great in the home, too; with a chic fabric grille, luxurious leather carrying handle, and subtle charging cradle, the Citation 200 looks just as stylish as the other speakers in the Citation range.",
    "Despite it\u2019s high-end looks, you can comfortably take it outside thanks to an IPX4 water-resistance rating \u2013 just hook it up to your phone via Bluetooth if your Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t extend to your garden.",
    "Battery life is pretty good at eight hours \u2013 though that doesn\u2019t beat its biggest rival the Sonos Move (saying that, the latter is far more expensive).",
    "That's true in terms of audio performance, too. Unfortunately, the sound quality doesn\u2019t quite measure up to the Citation 200\u2019s good looks and smart features; the bass is far too extended for our ears, and it tends to muddy the other frequencies.",
    "We\u2019re told the bassy sound profile is intended to make the speaker sound good outside, and it admittedly works rather well for bass-driven music genres like dance and reggae \u2013 but for rock, pop, and RnB we found ourselves wishing for something more finely balanced, and for a company that prides itself on its audio prowess.",
    "[Update: Harman has announced that Citation 200 speakers are getting a new software update that allows you to update the bass and treble settings to fine tune your listening experience. There are four steps for each setting, indicated by the LEDs on the front of the speaker \u2013 just short-press the Bluetooth and Volume Up button for bass or Bluetooth and Volume Down buttons for treble adjustment.]",
    "The Harman Kardon Citation 200 is available to buy now, having been first announced at CES 2020 back in January. It\u2019ll set you back \u00a3299.99 / $299.95, which works out at around AU$430 \u2013 though right now, availability is still to be confirmed in Australia.",
    "That price makes it more expensive than the non-portable Citation One \u2013 however, it's far cheaper than the Sonos Move, which currently sits at the top of our list of the best portable speakers you can buy in 2020.",
    "With a carrying handle and bucket-shaped build, the Harman Kardon Citation 200 is designed to be moved around your home, and if you want to take it outside, it's protected from the elements thanks to an IPX4 water-resistance rating. You won't be able to take it into the pool as you can with fully waterproof speakers, but it should be able to withstand a spot of rain.",
    "Like other speakers in the Citation range, it\u2019s covered in a gray blended wool grille, offset by the leather handle, which is secured to the speaker with metallic buttons \u2013 and true to Harman Kardon\u2019s aesthetic, it encapsulates Scandi-cool design.",
    "While we love the way it looks, the Citation 200\u2019s expensive looks made us hesitant to take it outdoors at first; but, while not the most rugged portable speaker out there, Harman Kardon does promise that its wool exterior is \u201cdirt repellent, flame retardant, and features a special coating for easy cleaning\u201d.",
    "Unlike some speakers, it\u2019s not a magnet for dust, fingerprints, or pet hair either, which means it should stay looking good no matter how much your home is craving a run around with the feather duster.",
    "On the top of the speaker you\u2019ll find the control panel, which features power on/off, Bluetooth pairing, and volume buttons, as well as a button to play/pause your music, stop timers and alarms, and summon Google Assistant.",
    "That control panel also houses two microphones designed to pick up your voice when interacting with the built-in voice assistant, and an array of four LEDs that give an indication of your remaining battery life.",
    "There are also LEDs built-in the front of the speaker that light up when you change the volume and summon Google Assistant.",
    "On the back of the Citation 200 is a Wi-Fi indicator light, a USB-C charging port for when you need to top up your battery on the go, and a physical switch that allows you to turn off the inbuilt microphones.",
    "The Citation 200 comes with its own sleek charging cradle that plugs into your mains \u2013 simply pop the speaker on top and it will charge.",
    "The Harman Kardon Citation 200 is packing a 25mm tweeter and a 120mm woofer; the latter being far bigger than the 89mm woofer found within the Citation One.",
    "And it shows \u2013 the Citation 200 boasts a powerful sound, is capable of reaching high volumes, and sports an incredibly bassy presentation \u2013 which we found isn\u2019t always a good thing.",
    "Listening to Little Simz\u2019 No Offense, we found the bass was a little too boomy and tended to overpower the other frequencies. We were left craving a little more detail in the trebles, particularly the percussion, and a richer quality to the romantic string sections that sweep through the track.",
    "It was a similar story with Radiohead\u2019s Burn The Witch, where the stabbing strings where vastly overpowered by the low synth drones.",
    "Listening to Fleet Foxes\u2019 Wading In Waist-High Water, the hushed vocals came through beautifully, with the muffled guitar sounding warm and welcoming \u2013 again, the bass sounded over the top when the rest of the instruments kicked in, and we missed out on some of the subtle horn flourishes that pepper the track.",
    "Of course that bassy profile suits some genres of music down to the bone \u2013 Gorillaz\u2019 Dracula sounded suitably spooky, with thumping bass lines, dissonant vocal melodies, and echoing reggae guitars.",
    "We\u2019re told that the bassy presentation is designed to make the speaker sound good outdoors, where there aren\u2019t walls for the sound to bounce off of \u2013 but for indoor use (which we daresay is where most users will be doing the majority of their listening), it\u2019s too much.",
    "Like the rest of the Citation range, you can hook the 200 up to its siblings (which include soundbars, freestanding towers, and wireless speakers) to create a multi-room audio setup; you can also pair two Citation 200s for stereo sound.",
    "With Google Assistant built-in, the Harman Kardon Citation 200 can double up as a control hub for your other smart home devices, from your smart lights to your connected thermostat.",
    "Even if your home isn\u2019t kitted out with a ton of extra smart devices, having a voice assistant on board is super handy. It means you can ask Google Assistant general questions like, \u201cwhat\u2019s the weather going to be like today?\u201d, or give it more personalized commands like adding events to your calendar.",
    "You can summon Google Assistant hands-free by either using the \u2018Hey Google\u2019 or \u2018OK Google\u2019 wake words, or by long-pressing the button on the top of the speaker.",
    "One downside is that you can only get access to these smart features while connected to Wi-Fi, unlike the Alexa-powered Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd gen). Try summoning Google Assistant while connected to the speaker via Bluetooth, and you\u2019ll be directed to connect the Citation to your Wi-Fi network via the Google Home app \u2013 though this is a mercifully simple process.",
    "Battery life comes in at eight hours, though you may find this dips lower if you play your music at high volumes \u2013 it's not quite as much as the Sonos Move, but it should be enough to get you by. You can top up the battery by using the accompanying charging cradle or USB-C cable, and it takes around three hours to reach full charge.",
    "The Harman Kardon Citation 200 comes with Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity \u2013 not the most recent specification, but it\u2019s enough for you to comfortably stream music wirelessly from your phone or tablet when outdoors. If you\u2019re using the Citation 200 indoors, you can hook it up to your home Wi-Fi network, which should offer a higher quality of wireless streaming, with Google Chromecast and Apple AirPlay both supported."
