  "summary": "We test Dell\u2019s easy-to-use peripheral combo",
  "verdict": "Dell\u2019s KM717 Premier Wireless Keyboard and Mouse is a good peripheral combo to meet your most basic needs. The mouse offers 1600 DPI, and can pair with up to three different devices. It has a simple, but sharp design, and is very easy to set up and work with. However, it\u2019s not suitable for gaming.",
  "pros": [
    "Can connect to up to two devices at once",
    "The keyboard has cool aluminum-style finish",
    "Simple straightforward setup",
    "Full keyboard but slimline and light"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not advisable for gaming",
    "Doesn\u2019t work great on mousepads",
    "No rechargeable battery",
    "Slightly over-priced"

    "Dell\u2019s KM717 Premier Wireless Keyboard and Mouse is a laser-sensored (when it comes to the mouse), USB and Bluetooth combo that's easy to set-up and even easier to use.",
    "The mouse works on almost every surface including glass (tried and tested) which is pretty decent, and it also offers Bluetooth connectivity with up to two other devices in addition to your PC.",
    "At the reduced price of $89.99 (\u00a365.16, AU$143.08) from Dell, down from its original price of $99.99, (\u00a390.50, AU$196) we think the combo is decent value. Its original price was eye-watering, considering you could get a better mouse and keyboard with similar, if not identical, specs for much cheaper.",
    "Batteries are included, which is a plus, although rechargeable batteries would have increased our rating as it would have justified its original price, and would have made it competition for similar products on the market right now.",
    "We tested out the connectivity by linking the mouse with a laptop and smartphone, and the setup was straightforward and worked well.",
    "We would have liked there to have been an option to raise the keyboard higher. The keyboard does, however, have a raised back, which has a removable cover in which to place the two AAA batteries it requires.",
    "The chiclet keys are soft and quiet, with a decent travel time and a good \u2018thunk\u2019 on each press. Although quite small and slim, it\u2019s still a full keyboard, and has all the necessary trimmings you would expect.",
    "If you care about backlighting you won\u2019t find it here. Dell likely omitted backlighting in order to ensure the set is as eco-friendly as it boasts, and it\u2019ll prolong the battery life. And, while it can be used for gaming, you\u2019re better off going with a gaming specific keyboard to get the best out of your game.",
    "Speaking of eco-friendliness, the battery life, according to Dell, is six months for the mouse and a year for the keyboard. We can neither confirm nor deny this as we haven\u2019t had a full six month and one year run of both devices \u2013 but we have no reason not to believe Dell\u2019s claims.",
    "Meanwhile, the Dell KM717 Premier Wireless mouse is OK, but not anywhere near as good as other wireless mice like say, the Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed, which even at full price works out to be cheaper.",
    "The mouse, according to Dell, is \u201cergonomically designed\u201d, which is great, but we certainly didn\u2019t get a feel for its ergonomics. Everyone has their own style of holding a mouse, however, and so this may be more of a personal opinion.",
    "The mouse is simple, sleek and slimline. It\u2019s also light, travel-friendly and ambidextrous. The top of the mouse is magnetic and lifts to reveal the slots for two AAA batteries. There are forward and back buttons, one on either side of the mouse, and a wheel for scrolling. The last button is the switch that controls which device you control, the one with the USB dongle connected or one of the two paired Bluetooth ones.",
    "Although the Dell KM717 Premier Wireless Keyboard and Mouse doesn't have many customisable features, it's not advisable for gaming and it doesn't have a rechargeable battery, it's still a great set to invest in if you're looking for a good day-to-day keyboard and mouse.",
    "The keyboard is particularly good, while the mouse is just OK. Both are designed well and look particularly stylish, and would fit in well at home or in the office.",
    "The fact that they can connect to multiple devices is a big plus and is what sets them apart from most wireless keyboard and mouse combos. It's comfortable to type on and easy to set up and for the current price, it's just right."
