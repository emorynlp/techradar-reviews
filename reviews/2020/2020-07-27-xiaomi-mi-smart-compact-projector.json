    "While technologies like short-throw projection are taking off and 4K resolutions are finally arriving en masse to high-end, expensive projectors, budget projectors are improving too. They\u2019re getting sleeker designs, better image quality, and more.",
    "Enter the Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector.",
    "With a compact design, smart features built in, and support for things like HDR10, on paper, the Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector has a lot to offer. It\u2019s simply designed, and mountable on a tripod, which is a nice touch, plus has Android TV built-in. Most importantly, it offers a good image with decent HDR performance with a few caveats.",
    "But do those features translate to an ideal experience? Should you buy a Xiaomi projector instead of a cheap BenQ or Optoma beamer? We put the Xiaomi projector to the test to find out.",
    "The Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector became available in the US back in March 2020 and goes for $599 at Walmart or on Amazon in the UK for \u00a3465.",
    "When you first take the Xiaomi Mi Smart Compact Projector out of the box, you\u2019ll notice how compact it really is. The device measures in at 4.5 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches, which is small enough to easily place on a small table. At 2.8lbs, it\u2019s light enough to mount on a tripod too, and with the tripod mount on the bottom, it\u2019s easy to move the camera to the right position.",
    "The projector is mostly white, save for the black front, with the lens on the top right of the face. On the top, you\u2019ll get the power button, while on the back is where you\u2019ll get a power port, a headphone jack, a USB port, and a single HDMI port. It would have been nice to get an extra HDMI port on the back, but the idea behind this projector is that you\u2019ll use the built-in Android TV anyway, so you may not need the port.",
    "The design of the remote is nice too, and it\u2019s pretty simple: you\u2019ll get a basic power button, and then basic software controls for Android TV \u2014 including a microphone button to trigger Google Assistant. It\u2019s nice to see integration here, and having the microphone in the remote makes Assistant even more accessible. The remote is very light, and is powered by two AAA batteries. It does feel a little cheap considering the plastic build, but it\u2019s not a big deal.",
    "Something that is a big deal is that there\u2019s no backlighting on the remote, and considering the fact that you\u2019ll mostly need to use this projector in darkness, it can get frustrating fumbling around to find the right controls. Once you get used to the button layout it may not be an issue, but that will take a few days of use.",
    "The projector relies on Android TV, and that makes it very easy to set up software-wise. You\u2019ll simply log in to your Google account, download the apps you want to use, and you should be good to go.",
    "It\u2019s easy to physically set up too. The projector has an auto-focus technology built right into it that means that you don\u2019t have to deal with manually focus the image. You will need to adjust keystone, but it\u2019s generally very easy to do.",
    "While Android TV devices are easy to set up, the overall software experience on this projector could be described as \u201cfrustrating.\u201d The Android TV interface is fine, with its rows of apps and content that you can easily access \u2014 plus there are a ton of streaming apps available to the platform. All your favorite apps are here, including the newer Disney+. This is also the first Android TV projector to support Netflix, making using a projector with Android TV much better for many users. That said, there\u2019s no Apple TV+ on Android TV in general just yet.",
    "The frustrating part, however, has more to do with the projector\u2019s overall performance. Android TV in general is a heavy operating system, and like many Android TV TVs, this projector doesn\u2019t have the processing power to properly handle the software. Scrolling through apps and content can be a slow process, especially in the minutes after startup. That\u2019s not to mention Google Assistant commands, which take far too long to process, resulting in us avoiding using Assistant on the projector altogether. Thankfully, after the projector is warmed up, Android TV seems to run a little more smoothly.",
    "You can\u2019t completely avoid the software either. Considering the fact that the remote and software is so basic, even if you do use that lone HDMI port for a streaming device, you\u2019ll still have to venture back into Android to to focus the projector and adjust the image. If you plan on keeping the projector stationary, that probably won\u2019t matter to most, but those that plan on moving it around will get used to waiting for Android to catch up to simply opening the Settings app.",
    "If you do get through the software and manage to start watching something, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. The image quality on this projector isn\u2019t groundbreaking, but for something in this price range it has a lot to offer.",
    "The projector offers a 1080p resolution and support for HDR10, and the result is a pretty good image. You\u2019ll get six image modes in total, including Standard, Movie, Vivid, Sports, Child Mode, and User Mode. It\u2019s a decent selection, though in the end we simply stuck with Standard Mode, as it looked to be the most natural. If you\u2019re adventurous, you may be able to get something you like more with User Mode.",
    "Despite its small size, the projector can actually display a relatively large projection \u2014 though you will need a little room to get larger images. You can get up to a 120-inch projection, from a distance of three meters.",
    "Perhaps the worst thing about the projector\u2019s image quality is that it doesn\u2019t get very bright. With an average brightness of 500 lumens, I found that the projector performed fine in dark environments, but add a bit of ambient light to the mix, and you may struggle a little. For comparison, non-compact projectors like those from Optoma and Epson can get into the multiple thousands of lumens when it comes to brightness, so if you do plan on using your projector in a living room or an area where there may be some ambient light, we recommend looking elsewhere.",
    "In HDR, the projector is able to display deeper colors, but the HDR performance didn\u2019t seem drastically different than the SDR performance. It\u2019s better, to be sure, but don\u2019t expect to get an ultra cinematic experience just because you\u2019re viewing in HDR mode.",
    "With a lower brightness, you don\u2019t necessarily have to cool the projector as much \u2014 and we found that the fan noise in this projector was actually relatively quiet. Not only that, but once you do start playing content, that content will easily drown out fan noise to where you won\u2019t really notice it. That\u2019s pretty handy.",
    "The speakers built into the projector are pretty good too \u2014 and far better than we expected them to be. You\u2019ll get relatively deep lows, though don\u2019t expect incredible bass extension. The kids are well-tuned, and there\u2019s more detail and clarity than you would expect in the high-end. Overall, the audio can get a little midsy, but not overly so. We still recommend buying external speakers if you can afford them, but in a pinch, the built in speakers will do the job quite well.",
    "There are projectors will a better image quality in this price range, but if you're looking for the complete package of a built-in smart operating system, a decent audio quality, and a compact design, then this projector is the way to go."
