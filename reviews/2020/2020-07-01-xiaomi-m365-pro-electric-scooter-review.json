    "Electric scooters are becoming a bigger and bigger part of transport, and so it makes sense that Chinese electronic company Xiaomi, most known for its smartphone and smart home tech, is entering the race. That\u2019s what it did with the Xiaomi M365, and now there\u2019s a bigger and better Pro variant.",
    "The Xiaomi M365 Pro has an expanded display so you can see your speed and modes better, a bigger design, and longer battery life, so on paper it seems like an all-around plus-sized improvement.",
    "It's a competent piece of tech, so it's no wonder we added it to our list of the best electric scooters. If you're tempted to buy it, we'd recommend you check out our guide on what you need to know before riding an electric scooter",
    "The Xiaomi M365 Pro isn\u2019t available in most regions, including the US, but in the UK you can pick it up for around \u00a3550 - \u00a3600 depending on the retailer.",
    "Bear in mind electric scooters aren't legal everywhere, so check our guide to find out if electric scooters are legal where you are. Of course, you shouldn't buy such a pricey piece of tech if you can't legally drive it, although it's worth pointing out some countries let you own one if you're only going to use it on private land.",
    "As with most Xiaomi products, such as its smartphones, the Xiaomi M365's price places it firmly in the mid-range tier of the competition \u2013 at roughly $600/\u00a3500 depending on retailer, you\u2019re paying more than the low-range Micro scooters which often sit at around $300/\u00a3300, but you\u2019re also not paying a four-figure sum for one of the high-end scooters.",
    "The Xiaomi M365 Pro is a bulky beast, there\u2019s no question about it. With a weight of 14.2kg it\u2019s not exactly easy to pick up and carry, and it\u2019s fairly heavy compared to most other electric scooters, which vary between 8kg and 12kg.",
    "The scooter\u2019s weight is matched in its size \u2013 with a 45cm x 15cm deck to stand on, and a handlebar that rises 99cm above the deck, it\u2019s clearly distinct from a non-electric scooter, and you definitely feel the power of the M365 Pro when you\u2019re standing on it.",
    "Between the handlebars is a display which tells you your speed, or the battery percent while you\u2019re charging, as well as the speed mode you\u2019re in. It looks like there are more options on the screen, but we never figured out how to actually toggle these.",
    "A button below the display turns the scooter on when you press it, toggles the headlight with a single press, changes speed mode with a double press, and turns the scooter off with a hold. Due to the size of the handlebars it\u2019s quite a stretch to press, unless you\u2019ve got big hands.",
    "These handlebars had good grip, and felt comfortable to grip even when held tight for long periods of time or in the rain.",
    "There\u2019s a kickstand on the left side of the deck near the back, which we found easy to open with just one nimble kick, and it\u2019s easy to get used to doing so absentmindedly.",
    "In general aesthetic terms, the Xiaomi M365 Pro is a fairly good-looking scooter, with its black body and red trim. The large Pure logo on our review unit spoils this a bit, but won't be present on scooters from other retailers.",
    "As befits a chunky scooter like the Xiaomi M365 Pro, it\u2019s not exactly the most portable device in the world (unless you\u2019re riding it), but that isn\u2019t helped by the lack of features for the scooter itself.",
    "You can collapse the handlebars of the scooter down into the deck, and then lock it using a hook by the bell which attaches to a hook on the back wheel \u2013 it's a little fiddly the first time you try and do it, but afterwards becomes easy, and it makes the scooter a lot easier to carry.",
    "There\u2019s also nowhere on the body of the scooter you can attach a lock, so if you want to chain your ride to a bike parking space, you\u2019re out of luck.",
    "Using the Xiaomi Home app on your smartphone you can digitally lock the scooter, so it sets off an alarm if someone tries to move it and won\u2019t let them scoot, but this doesn\u2019t stop them picking it up and walking away with it anyway \u2013 if they can pick it up in the first place, due to its weight.",
    "During our testing of the Xiaomi M365 Pro electric scooter, we found it\u2019d last roughly four 7km (4.3 mile) 30-minute commutes, so we\u2019d estimate you can drive it about 30km on a full charge. We were driving at the scooter\u2019s full speed for the majority of this distance though, so if you were to drive in Eco Mode, which lowers the max speed, we\u2019d imagine the scooter would reach the 45km maximum range that Xiaomi states.",
    "You can charge the scooter through a power cable provided, which plugs into a port near the front wheel.",
    "This charging seemed quite slow \u2013 after roughly half an hour of charge the battery was up 8%, which suggests the battery actually drains quicker than it charges. If you plug in every time you\u2019re at home this is no problem, but you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019ve got sufficient time to charge the scooter regularly if you use it a lot.",
    "The actual capacity of the Xiaomi M365 Pro is 474Wh, which is considerably higher than the 280Wh of the non-Pro variant, so unless you can charge regularly we\u2019d recommend sticking with the Pro.",
    "The Xiaomi M365 Pro has three riding modes \u2013 Eco, Driving, and a third cryptically referred to as \u2018S\u2019, which we took to referring to as 'Speed Mode!'. You can change between them by double-pressing the button between the handlebars, which is a little challenging to do while you\u2019re driving, so we found ourselves stopping or slowing when we wanted to change speed.",
    "Eco Mode caps out at 15kmph (9.3mph), which was good for navigating busy roads and weaving through cars queuing in traffic, and didn\u2019t burn through battery as much as other modes. However it did feel a little too slow for all but the busiest or quietest roads, and Driving mode was often better for these situations.",
    "Driving mode lets you drive up to 20kmph (12.4mph), and is a perfect speed for keeping pace with cyclists. We found ourselves using this a lot when there were a lot of cyclists or motorists about, as it\u2019s slow enough to be safe but fast enough that we didn\u2019t feel like we were getting in the way at all.",
    "When it was possible though, we engaged Speed Mode!, which let us enjoy the scooter\u2019s true max speed of 25kmph (15.5mph). This isn\u2019t exactly lighting speed for an electric scooter, as the high-end models can reach up to 50kmph (30mph), but there\u2019s no need to go that fast on most roads.",
    "The motor doesn\u2019t kick in when you hold the accelerator button \u2013 instead you have to actually be moving for it to work, so you have to kick off like a normal scooter then hold the button. Acceleration for all modes felt great \u2013 you shoot off rapidly, and we found ourselves overtaking cyclists and other scooters upon setting off.",
    "Whether we were meandering through traffic in Eco Mode or burning rubber in Speed Mode!, the motor always felt reasonably quiet, and amongst the honking and shouting of a busy city, we could barely hear it most of the time. At higher speeds, and on hills, the sound did become noticable, but never unbearable.",
    "There were a few things that didn\u2019t feel great while driving, though. The tyres didn\u2019t have a whole lot of grip, so if we didn\u2019t slow down before braking, there was a fair bit of stopping distance, especially in wet conditions. In addition the handlebars don\u2019t turn all that much, so when we were navigating tight corners at a slow speed we often had to make wide turns \u2013 of course this didn\u2019t matter much when actually driving, as you use your body to do most of the turning then.",
    "The Xiaomi M365 Pro is a big and bulky scooter, with one of the biggest frames you can get for its mid-range price, but you\u2019re getting a lot of power behind the handlebars too.",
    "The electric scooter feels particularly great for roads, as you\u2019ll always go the right speed to keep pace with traffic, without feeling like you\u2019re a small and frail imposter.",
    "Battery capacity does feel a little low though, in particular charging speeds, so people with certain lifestyles might have trouble keeping the scooter charged enough at all times."
