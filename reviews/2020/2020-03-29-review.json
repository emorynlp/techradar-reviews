    "The Samsung Notebook 9 (2018) is a complicated device, much more than other laptops. It has some frustrating limitations that hold it back from becoming a truly great laptop. However, those shortcomings are generally compensated by the huge benefits it brings to the table.",
    "For example, the Samsung Notebook 9 (2018) is held back by its squishy keyboard and small SSD. However, it makes up for those with a long-lasting battery and fast hardware. As a result, it has this kind of balance in compromises and features, and that makes it an excellent choice for the right type of user.",
    "If you\u2019re someone who values battery life and raw horsepower over anything else \u2013 and can get used to a mushy keyboard \u2013 then Samsung Notebook 9 (2018) is worth considering as the next laptop for you.",
    "Our Samsung Notebook 9 review model is priced at $1,699 (about \u00a31,334, AU$2,455), which gets you the hardware listed to the right. However, there is a cheaper base configuration with half the RAM and without dedicated graphics for $1,299 (about \u00a31,020, AU$1,877).",
    "Both models of the Samsung Notebook 9 tout Full HD displays, Thunderbolt 3 ports and a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello login. However, there\u2019s only one color option \u2013 you\u2019ll get the same \u201cLight Titan\u201d finish on either model. So, the Samsung Notebook 9 hasn\u2019t changed much this time around, at least beyond the obvious upgrades to processing and graphics power.",
    "Starting at $999 (about \u00a3719, AU$1,299), the brand-new Dell XPS 15 easily outshines the Samsung Notebook 9 when it comes to value, offering half as much RAM but far more powerful Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics and a 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD combo storage solution behind an FHD display.",
    "However the Samsung Notebook 9 far out-prices the $2,399 (\u00a31,719, AU$3,129) MacBook Pro 2017 with more modern processors, even if it doesn\u2019t have the Touch Bar and the AMD Radeon Pro 555 GPU in Apple\u2019s flagship may outclass the Nvidia MX150 chip just a bit. So, where does that leave the Samsung Notebook 9?",
    "Well, to start, the Samsung Notebook 9 relies heavily on its features and design to justify the price. It\u2019s good that it is smart-looking and fully-featured, even if the Samsung Notebook 9 really hasn\u2019t changed all that much design-wise.",
    "Not that we\u2019re complaining: Samsung has an awesome laptop design approach. The Samsung Notebook 9 is flat where it needs to be, featuring only the essential amount of curves \u2013 this laptop radiates understated luxury throughout its silvery aluminum frame.",
    "The Samsung Notebook 9 comes in just under 3lbs and is only 0.61 inches thick, making it one of the most compact and lightweight 15-inch laptops we\u2019ve ever tested. That said, there\u2019s one part of the chassis we\u2019d have preferred were a little better.",
    "The most glaring flaw is in its keyboard which, while spacious and deep in travel, is awfully squishy feeling when it comes to feedback. It\u2019s definitely not the crisp, punchy experience we\u2019re used to on laptops in this price range, though admittedly it doesn\u2019t impact your time using it \u2013 just get ready for a learning curve. It\u2019s up to you whether some of the laptop\u2019s other major benefits outweigh this drawback.",
    "Also, we found the keyboard backlighting to be awfully weak, not appearing much brighter than a glow-in-the-dark sticker and similar in hue. At least, the keys are well-spaced, and leave room for a fantastic fingerprint sensor and touchpad.",
    "The touchpad on this laptop is coated in glass like before and offers up superb palm rejection in that it not once triggered mouse movements while typing. Meanwhile, the fingerprint sensor is snappy to set up and very responsive in action \u2013 all laptops should provide this feature.",
    "Unsurprisingly, Samsung\u2019s FHD display in use here is excellent, offering vibrant color reproduction through its LED panel. Reds absolutely pop while blacks all but disappear into the screen\u2019s bonding.",
    "Unfortunately, the Samsung Notebook 9\u2019s true brightness potential is hidden behind an outdoor mode within the Samsung Settings app. This increases the screen\u2019s maximum brightness of 350 nits by another 150 to give a max brightness of 500 nits, putting it in league with the MacBook Pro.",
    "The fact that the Samsung Notebook 9 display is incredible isn\u2019t surprising, knowing the manufacturer \u2013 just turn that Outdoor Mode on when watching Netflix, and you\u2019ll have an immersive time. Plus, you\u2019ll be happy to know that this settings app also boasts a blue light reduction mode so you can make those 500 nits easier on the eyes.",
    "As for the audio, we\u2019re sad to report that it sounds about as thin and tinny as you\u2019d expect from small, down-firing speakers. This is one place worth looking at for Samsung in terms of refining the 2019 model.",
