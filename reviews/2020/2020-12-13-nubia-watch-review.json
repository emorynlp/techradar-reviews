  "verdict": "The Nubia Watch has an interesting design, with a long, thin, curved display that wraps around your wrist and gives you plenty of screen real estate to look at. In terms of features, though, it gets only a passing grade, with the bare minimum number of fitness and lifestyle modes and options, and a few issues regarding fitness tracking. If you just want a smartwatch that\u2019s a fashion piece to impress people at parties, the Nubia Watch will do that, but if you\u2019re looking for a serious life companion you\u2019ll be better off going for a more capable device \u2013 or waiting for a potential update that brings more features.",

    "ZTE-owned Nubia might not be the best-known tech manufacturer in the world, but when you do hear about one of its products it tends to be something unusual enough to make you take an interest: the Nubia Z20 smartphone had two screens, one on either side of its body; the Nubia Red Magic 5G was the first phone with a 144Hz display; and the Nubia Alpha was a smartwatch with a curved display, a camera and gesture controls.",
    "The Nubia Watch is something of a successor to the Alpha \u2013 the company isn\u2019t marketing it as such, but a quick glance will tell you the two devices look pretty similar. They both have long displays that curve around your wrist, chunky designs, and run the same software.",
    "More specifically, the Nubia Watch feels like a refined version of the Alpha. Gone is the camera, which protruded out from the body quite a bit \u2013 and we imagine few will miss that low-res, hard-to-use snapper. The gesture controls are gone too, which means another feature you\u2019ll likely end up ignoring, and another sizable sensor, are gone. The smartwatch\u2019s clasp has had a redesign too, to make it more comfortable to wear while you're working out and sleeping.",
    "The most important change is that the myriad bugs that plagued the Nubia Alpha are all gone \u2013 we barely encountered any during our time with the Watch, which was a breath of fresh air compared to our experience with its predecessor.",
    "So the Nubia Watch brings a few noticeable improvements over the Alpha model, which make it a more tempting purchase. It hasn\u2019t seen a total overhaul, however, and lots of the issues we had with the original are still here.",
    "There aren\u2019t very many lifestyle or communication apps \u2013 while you can text and call when paired with a phone, and receive notifications to the device, you can\u2019t reply to or even read many of the notifications you get. There are four different workout modes, but while each is fine for tracking your fitness, you can\u2019t access historic exercise data on the watch or its tie-in app, and we found the distance measured on runs was wildly incorrect.",
    "This is certainly not a lightweight device either \u2013 its screen wraps much of the way around your wrist, and sticks out a fair bit from your arm too, so it\u2019s as sleeve-catching as it is eye-catching.",
    "So the Nubia Watch is more of a party piece or conversation-starter than a watch you\u2019ll find useful throughout your waking day, which would be fine if the watch wasn\u2019t burdened by a pretty high price. But it definitely has a particular audience: one that wants a fashion piece that can also let them text and count their steps, and if that sounds like you, this is a device worth considering.",
    "The Nubia Watch was released via a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, a method of launching tech we\u2019ve seen used before, although rarely by established companies like Nubia.",
    "The campaign was started in mid-August 2020, and the campaign rocketed past its pledge goal almost immediately, with units shipping from October..",
    "The Nubia Watch price is $399 (roughly \u00a3300 / AU$550 \u2013 the website lists the price in US dollars no matter where you are), although pre-ordering it as part of the Kickstarter campaign gets you a discount, with the amount depending on how early you ordered it.",
    "That\u2019s a pretty high price for a smartwatch, especially one with a relative lack of features (as we\u2019ll get into) \u2013 it\u2019s the same as the starting price for the Apple Watch 5, and that\u2019s a premium watch from a huge brand.",
    "We\u2019d guess the curved display tech isn\u2019t cheap to make, and the Nubia Watch is at least cheaper than the Nubia Alpha, which costs $449 (roughly \u00a3340 / AU$640), so if you absolutely want a curved smartwatch this is the cheapest.",
    "We\u2019ve already mentioned that the Nubia Watch has an interesting display. It\u2019s a 4.01-inch AMOLED panel with a 960 x 192 resolution. The display shows colors well, and while you won\u2019t exactly be watching Netflix on your wrist, it makes colorful menus look even more vibrant.",
    "The long, curved display can initially seem fun, but unnecessary; however, there are some tasks which benefit from the extended screen real estate. You can easily see a long notifications list without scrolling, for example, and it\u2019s also handy for reading lengthy texts. Not all apps or functions utilize the long screen, but enough do that we grew to appreciate its presence.",
    "There are two bezels around this display: a physical one, with very faint numerical markings on it, which is raised above the screen slightly, and another that\u2019s flush with the screen and creates a black border between the viewable display and the edge bezel.",
    "This flexible display covers a rather thick body, one that sticks out 0.55 inches from the wrist and weighs 98g. That\u2019s quite a bit thicker and heavier than your average smartwatch \u2013 don\u2019t buy this if you\u2019re looking for a dainty device.",
    "The body \u2013 for clarity we\u2019re using this term to describe the long section the screen is housed in, though the distinction is less clear-cut than on your standard smartwatch \u2013 has a single crown, which you can press to wake the Nubia Watch and also to jump to the main menu from a different one. There are visible screws jutting out of the body \u2013 we\u2019re not sure if this is part of some mechanical-themed design aesthetic or just an unavoidable design quirk.",
    "While this smartwatch might seem like it\u2019s all a single component, as with the Alpha you can actually remove the straps if you so wish. In the box you\u2019ll find a longer strap than the one which comes fitted, which people with larger wrists might appreciate, although changing straps can be quite a fiddly process, as the levers to that you need to flick in order to detach the strap from the body are rather small.",
    "The silicone strap that\u2019s attached fits pretty comfortably on the wrist, and there are enough holes in it to suit a variety of wrist sizes.",
    "We had issues when using the watch while wearing shirts with tight sleeves, as it was hard to get the sleeves over the watch. We didn\u2019t find the watch uncomfortable to wear in general, but it\u2019s harder to ignore when you are wearing it compared to other watches, as it\u2019s thicker and heavier than most. If you\u2019re looking for a lightweight device to track your steps, that you can forget the rest of the time, this watch isn\u2019t it.",
    "The Nubia Watch uses Nubia\u2019s own smartwatch software, and it\u2019s basically the same as it was in the Nubia Alpha, but without the numerous bugs that made that device a pain to use.",
    "The main watch face shows you the time, your steps, and other bits of information depending on which face you go for. You swipe up on the main face for notifications, and swipe down for a settings panel, which includes options for things like changing the brightness and toggling the power-saving mode.",
    "You swipe left or right on the watch face to bring up the apps list which, as on the Alpha, is pretty limited. There are some fitness tracking modes, which we\u2019ll get on to, and a Health option that enables you to check out your workouts and general fitness for the day, and which includes a heart rate testing mode.",
    "There\u2019s calling and texting, both can be initiated from the watch, as long as it\u2019s paired to your phone; Weather, the function of which needs no explaining; Clock, which lets you set alarms and timers;, Schedule, which pulls through your phone\u2019s calendar; SearchPhone, which causes your phone to buzz so you can find it (and was really useful when it worked); plus a compass mode, Alipay (a Chinese-based payment system), and a music-handling mode.",
    "You need to manually download the songs onto the Nubia Watch to play them via the app, so fans of streaming services won\u2019t be able to use it. In an era where music streaming is widespread we\u2019re not sure how useful this mode is, and we never used it.",
    "Finally, there\u2019s Barrage mode, which was called Marquee on the Alpha, which lets you display ambient patterns and scrolling words across the watch face. It\u2019s a fun mode to play around with, but it won\u2019t revolutionize your smartwatch experience \u2013 we also had trouble getting the text, which you have to type in the Nubia Wear app, to sync with the watch.",
    "You might notice from this list a lack of communication modes beyond texting and calling: there\u2019s no WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, emailing or anything like that, and while notifications are pulled through, the feature isn\u2019t always useful. You can still read notifications from these apps when they\u2019re on your phone, but you can\u2019t reply, or write new messages to people. For example, you can read, but not reply to, WhatsApp messages \u2013 unless there are multiple messages, from the same or different chats, and then you\u2019re simply told the number of messages and the number of chats these messages are in.",
    "Nubia has suggested to us that it might put out a version of the watch with apps such as WhatsApp on it, and if that\u2019s the case it would really improve the experience of using a Nubia device \u2013 maybe enough to bump the review score up by half a star. As it stands, though, no such function exists.",
    "The Nubia Watch has four fitness tracking modes: Outdoor Running, Indoor Running, Outdoor Walking, and Free Workout. Each tracks distance, time and calories burnt \u2013 the former is done via your phone\u2019s GPS connection.",
    "That\u2019s not a huge range of workout modes or stats tracked, although for an average smartwatch user who just runs now and again, or wants to be a bit more active, it may be enough. In our testing most of the metrics seemed accurate except distance \u2013 after our 6.1km running course (that we use as a standard test of distance accuracy) the watch thought we\u2019d gone 3.5k, suggesting it has errors in how it computes distance. A few hundred meters discrepancy would be understandable, but not multiple kilometers.",
    "General step tracking works well though \u2013 gone are the Alpha\u2019s bugs which, among other things, saw it deduct 50,000 steps for no obvious reason.",
    "Another big issue with fitness tracking on the Nubia Watch is one we\u2019ve already mentioned, in that there\u2019s no way of viewing historic data, either on the watch or on the Nubia Wear smartphone app. The most the apps do is tell you your workouts for the day, but there\u2019s no option on the watch to cycle through previous days, and while there is a button on the phone app which seems like it should let you check previous days, it doesn\u2019t actually work, although it\u2019s possible Nubia could add this feature via a firmware update.",
    "So maybe the ability to view the run you did the day before is coming, but the Alpha didn\u2019t have historic data either, so this feature really should have been introduced by now. And this doesn\u2019t just affect workouts \u2013 you can\u2019t see your previous day\u2019s step count either.",
    "Nubia estimates that its smartwatch will last seven days between charges \u2013 this seems like a rather optimistic stat to us, but we weren\u2019t disappointed by the Nubia Watch\u2019s battery life.",
    "The battery life seems to vary quite a bit depending on whether you\u2019re tracking workouts and taking calls, or just using the watch to check the time now and then. When we were using it most intensively it seemed to last us at least two days, and this stretched upwards to four or five days with light use.",
    "It\u2019s hard to give a reliable estimate for \u2018typical\u2019 battery life due to these widely varying results. Regardless, compared to your average Wear OS device or Apple Watch the battery life seems impressive,, as those rival devices tend to need recharging daily \u2013 and they don\u2019t have large 4-inch screens either.",
    "Charging is done via a proprietary charging panel that attaches to the back of the watch\u2019s body via magnets, and can be plugged into any standard USB port like the one on your computer. Nubia estimates it takes 85 minutes to power up the device to full, but we\u2019re not sure most people will see that kind of speed.",
    "When we plugged the charger into our laptop, it seemed to take several hours to charge the Nubia Watch to full \u2013 in fact, we often found it easier to charge it in frequent bursts, to save us having to wait that long for it to power up.",
    "Sure, this is because laptop USB ports output less power than a USB wall adapter, and if you used one of those, you\u2019d get faster charging. But given that solution isn\u2019t very convenient, and it\u2019s much easier to charge USB devices via a computer or laptop, we\u2019d imagine most people will get similar speeds to us.",
