    "Update: we have now been able to use the Steelseries Arctis 7P with the PlayStation 5, and have included our experience with the new console below in its own section.",
    "As the PS5 and Xbox Series X lurk around the corner, SteelSeries has released a pair of gaming headsets geared toward the new consoles. There are some subtle differences between the two extending beyond hardware-matching colors. Specifically designed for the Playstation 5, the Arctis 7P Wireless offers a lot for its $149 (\u00a3159, about AU$210) price tag.",
    "The PS5 branding is more than just a theme: besides the attractive white and blue colorway, it\u2019s also compatible with Sony\u2019s Tempest 3D Audio Tech. Unlike its Xbox Series X/S sibling, the Arctis 7P doesn\u2019t need to use the included USB-C adapter to utilize the wireless connection dongle on Sony\u2019s console either.",
    "The Arctis 7P includes a 2.4 Ghz ultra-low latency audio connection, 24 hours of battery life and a retractable Discord-certified microphone. This feature set is housed within SteelSeries\u2019 signature steel frame that\u2019s solid as a rock \u2013 the ski goggle adjustment strap may turn some off. Around $50 more than the SonyPulse 3D, the Arctis 7P is one of the best wireless PS5 and PC gaming headsets available at launch.",
    "Out of the package, the Arctis 7P feels as strongly constructed as it looks. The headset can take on some serious drops thanks to the steel frame. It\u2019ll have to, considering how the ski goggle adjustment strap and velcro combo isn\u2019t very user friendly. Some users won\u2019t have a problem with it, but others may find it a bit uncomfortable during long gaming sessions, where traditional sliding adjustment mechanisms are more comfortable.",
    "The ski goggle adjustments aren\u2019t ideal for activities outside of stationary gaming. Running, working out and vigorous movement means the Arctis 7P is prone to sliding a bit much. As long as one plans on taking nice walks, it works well as a decent pair of headphones wired or wireless. Music quality is serviceable but a bit on the flat end despite bass and mids sounding good.",
    "Having a retractable mic means that you won\u2019t have to fumble with and potentially lose a detachable microphone. Buttons are easily identifiable and usable as well. The mic switch, volume roller, micro-USB port, 3.5 mm jack and mobile cable port sit nicely enough to easily make mid-game adjustments. The right cup even features a handy sidetone volume roller, which makes communicating during gaming sessions or phone calls more accommodating.",
    "Gaming on Playstation 4, Switch, PC and even on compatible mobile devices sounds great. Audio rich games like The Last of Us Part II or Ghost of Tsushima come to life. Connecting the SteelSeries Arctis 7P to our phone is a treat: we\u2019ve never heard mobile games like Genshin Impact or Asphalt 9 feature such sonic clarity.",
    "Unfortunately, PC users lose out on virtual 3D sound. The SteelSeries\u2019 Engine 3 can fine-tune your audio experience through the presets, but they don\u2019t help much. That app does let you tune the mic too, however, which helps it sound clear when trying to chat with teammates. In multiplayer games like Call of Duty: Warzone or Rainbow Six: Siege this is a godsend, and the mic is even great for giving commands to Cortana.",
    "SteelSeries is claiming 24 hours of battery life, which means you should be able to get through some long gaming and listening sessions with no problem. The SteelSeries Engine 3 app provides a battery bar on PC alongside the power button phasing between green, yellow, red and the blinking red, so you always know when you need to charge the headset.",
    "Playstation 5 users looking for a feature-packed headset offering more than Sony\u2019s first-party Pulse 3D headset should take the Arctis 7P into consideration. Not only does it support Tempest 3D but it offers double the battery life.",
    "However, if you\u2019re looking for something that can handle all platforms and actually sounds good with music, you may want to look elsewhere. Still, the SteelSeries Arctis 7P is a great gaming headset that\u2019s ready for the PS5 right out of the box.",
    "Not supporting virtual surround sound on PC in favor of offering compatibility with Sony\u2019s Tempest 3D Audio Tech makes sense. As of now, this audio solution feels as next-generation as the DualSense controller or popular buzzwords like \u201cRay Tracing\u201d and \u201cSSD.\u201d",
    "Experiencing games like Spider Man: Miles Morales on the Arctis 7P is a treat. Though not incredibly noticeable, swinging between New York skyscrapers and walking down the streets of Harlem definitely feels more immersive. It\u2019s incredibly noticeable how the directional sound of action set pieces blend with various aspects of the soundtrack during certain moments.",
    "Pre-installed game Astro's Playroom does a solid job at showcasing the tech as well through the Arctis 7P. It really does a great job with how the sound is layered besides improved directional sound. Like mentioned in the original review, it\u2019s really one of the best alternatives to the Pulse 3D headset at the moment. Be mindful of using the dongle on the PS5\u2019s only USB-C port as it covers the neighboring USB-A port."
