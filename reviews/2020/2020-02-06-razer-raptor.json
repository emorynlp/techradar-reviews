  "summary": "A smooth start for Razer",
  "verdict": "The Razer Raptor 27 is a strong first entry into the monitor market for Razer. It has excellent gaming performance, and could fit just as well in a gaming environment as a workplace. Like most of Razer\u2019s products, it comes at a high price, though.",
  "pros": [
    "Superb gaming performance",
    "Striking design",
    "Wide color gamut"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "HDR still wonky with Windows",
    "Steep price"

    "The Razer Raptor 27 is a $699 (about \u00a3530, AU$1,045), 27-inch gaming monitor that makes for Razer\u2019s first foray into high-end, standalone displays. It\u2019s a lofty price for a 1440p, 144Hz display when many such monitors are available for less, like the 1440p version of the MSI Optix MPG27C or even the $599 (\u00a3449, about AU$860) BenQ EX2780Q we recently reviewed. For $699 (\u00a3499, AU$799) the BenQ EX3203R offers up extra screen space and a similar gaming and HDR grade.",
    "That\u2019s not to say that the Razer Raptor doesn\u2019t deliver some major perks for the price. The monitor itself looks great, with stylish design touches like the fabric back, cable routing, and included (though somewhat cheap feeling) green cables for that signature Razer aesthetic. Naturally there\u2019s RGB lighting, which shines from the very bottom of the stand. The stand itself is easily adjusted up and down, with a very low bottom-out but not a very high peak. The base of the stand takes up a lot of desk space, but because it\u2019s just a flat surface, it more or less gives that space right back.",
    "Even the hardware controls are solid, with an easy-to-use control nib on the back. Powering off is as simple as flicking it down twice, though the lack of a dedicated power button is somewhat odd.",
    "The display boasts DisplayHDR 400, FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility, and a low 1ms response time (albeit only in a motion blur reducing mode that dramatically lowers the screen brightness. It also supports 10-bit color (8-bit+FRC) while offering 95% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space.",
    "That all makes it a highly versatile monitor, and it offers more than stunning enough visuals in our experience watching movies and gaming with it. Aside from noticeable backlight bleed in very dark scenes, like the opening crawl to Star Wars movies, the picture is generally excellent. As this is an IPS panel, we\u2019re able to get that excellent view from just about any angle around the monitor as well.",
    "For the minor nuisance the backlight bleed can be in cinema, we notice it far less gaming. Creeping around in the dark in Metro Exodus was no less engrossing, and our lighter and glowing mushrooms really stood out bright in the darkness. It\u2019s only more stunning when we toss out a molotov into the darkness and watch the flames burst out to scare away critters.",
    "Colors pop without feeling oversaturated. In Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, the world proves wonderfully vibrant and rich, with all the enemy factions easy to spot based on their colored uniforms.",
    "The HDR implementation isn\u2019t perfect, though. In games, it\u2019s a minor improvement to standard visuals. In TV shows and movies, it\u2019s also an improvement, though Windows\u2019 HDR causes some hiccups with shifting brightness levels (nothing like bright white subtitles to change the overall brightness of the whole screen).",
    "When simply browsing or working on the monitor, the HDR mode is more troublesome. The brightness level constantly shifts as the on-screen content changes, which may not seem like too big a deal until you see the white background of a website or word document shifting brightness levels willy-nilly. Disabling HDR in Windows but leaving it enabled on the monitor gets around this issue, but toggling back and forth is tedious.",
    "For the most part, the Razer Raptor offers a positive experience with a brilliant view of the games we\u2019re playing or content we\u2019re watching. The price holds it back some, especially when the BenQ EX2780Q offers most of the same features while building in strong 2.1-channel speakers."
