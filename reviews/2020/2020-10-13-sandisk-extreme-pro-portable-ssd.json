    "With the prices of SSD storage dropping lower and lower, there\u2019s little reason to use a traditional mechanical HDD as your source for external storage. SanDisk offers plenty of internal SSD solutions, but its Extreme Pro Portable SSD is an improvement from its predecessor.",
    "The tough design makes it much more durable for throwing into a camera bag, and with up to 2TB of capacity and blazing-fast transfer speeds, it\u2019s an excellent choice as an excellent external storage solution for both PC or Mac users.",
    "Note that a 4TB version of this drive was launched in January 2021 at CES 2021 with a significantly higher price to reflect its premium status.",
    "We\u2019re reviewing the 1TB version here, which is priced at AED 729/$189.99/\u00a3159.99 and is available at most retailers. You can also opt for a 500GB or even a 2TB drive, depending on your storage needs.",
    "The design of the Extreme Pro Portable SSD remains largely unchanged. It\u2019s got a sturdy, rubberized body that makes it easy to grip, and an aluminium body with a loop at the top to secure it via a carrying clip.",
    "The drive is IP55 water and dust resistant, so for those who need to copy data quickly during photo shoots or filming, this drive is more than capable of standing up to wear and tear. The one thing you\u2019ll need to be careful about is the USB-C port at the bottom.",
    "It\u2019s not covered or protected in any way, so should your drive fall into water or become dusty, you\u2019ll want to make sure that this port is thoroughly dry and clean before you connect it to anything. It would have been nice for SanDisk to include some sort of removable cover attached to the drive to protect this port, so maybe we\u2019ll see that in a future version.",
    "Bundled with the drive are two USB cables \u2013 one with USB type C on both ends, and one with USB type A for more general compatibility. Again, it would have been nice if there was a way that both cables could be bundled together for convenience, so you don\u2019t have to bring two cables along everywhere.",
    "This is where the Extreme Pro Portable SSD really takes the cake. If you\u2019re looking for ridiculously fast data transfer speeds, then you won\u2019t be disappointed. Provided you\u2019re using a Thunderbolt 3 port, you\u2019ll get really good performance out of this drive. SanDisk rates the Extreme Pro Portable SSD at read speeds of up to 1,050 MB/s, but we peaked at around 928MB/s during our tests.",
    "Bundled on the drive is SanDisk\u2019s SecureAccess software, which lets you create a secure space on your drive to lock files and folders behind a password. It\u2019s not necessary if you just want to use your drive like normal, but is an added bonus.",
    "There are plenty of external storage solutions out in the market, but very few of them will be as durable as the Extreme Pro Portable SSD. It\u2019s got great transfer speeds to keep you going, plenty of storage, and comes in a variety of storage sizes.",
    "Whether you\u2019re trekking through snowy mountains or filming in the middle of the desert, this drive won\u2019t let you down."
