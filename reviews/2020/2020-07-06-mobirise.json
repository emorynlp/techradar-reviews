    "Mobirise is an app for both Windows and Mac, that advertises itself as free, and will help those with no coding experience to create websites with ease.",
    "But although it\u2019s true that you don\u2019t have to pay for it, if you want to use anything but the two bundled themes, you\u2019re going to have to fork out for the privilege. I mean it\u2019s understandable: you design an app, you should expect to be financially rewarded for that, but it would be more honest to be upfront about it: if you want to unlock all the features, you can do so for a one-off fee of $149.",
    "You can also choose to gain access to new themes one at a time. As of this writing, there are 87 of them to try out, at $49 a pop (that\u2019s where the $149 price tag becomes mighty attractive if you\u2019re going to go down that route).",
    "Mobirise allows you to build sites using blocks, and that price also includes over 3,400 blocks to play with. However don\u2019t go clicking on \u2018buy now\u2019 just yet, and let\u2019s take the free version out for a spin.",
    "The moment you launch the app you need to log in. You can do so using your Google or Facebook accounts, but if you\u2019d rather keep everything separate, you can create a Mobirise account instead.",
    "Once done, you\u2019re presented with a default website based on the \u2018Mobirise 4\u2019 theme, which you\u2019re free to browse through, customise, or just create one of your own from scratch. This is where you have access to only two themes - this one and \u2018Mobirise AMP\u2019, but that\u2019s more than enough to get a taste for what\u2019s on offer.",
    "Do note that you can\u2019t change a site\u2019s theme once you\u2019ve started creating it. If you change your mind, you\u2019ll have to start again from scratch.",
    "The interface is incredibly simple to use and understand. The bulk of the window is your site. Not only is it a preview of what you\u2019re creating, but you also have hands on editing control over everything right from there. Want to change a menu\u2019s name? Just highlight it and overwrite it. Want a different colour? Select the section and alter it. It really is that simple.",
    "The tools you need for each specific task appear as you require them. This makes for a very clean interface which is very nice to use.",
    "The list of blocks you add to your site can be found on the right hand side by clicking on the big \u2018Add Block to Page\u2019, lower right of the interface.",
    "Adding additional pages, or creating a brand new site, is done from the sidebar on the left (revealed by clicking on the three horizontal lines, top left of the interface).",
    "Adding blocks is incredibly easy. Reveal the section and scroll through the list until you find the one(s) you\u2019re interested in. There are headings on the far right of the sidebar, to help you jump to the right section quicker, but if you just scroll through the list, you\u2019ll pass through every category in time.",
    "You can add a navigation menu, headers, image galleries, videos (only from YouTube and Vimeo it seems), an article section, or an \u2018about us\u2019, \u2018contact us\u2019, \u2018maps\u2019 section, links to social media, and a footer.",
    "Your page is now populated with generic images and texts, but it\u2019s a simple matter to edit it all to make your site truly your own.",
    "Just click on some text and edit it. You\u2019ll have a choice of heading size, colour and justification. You can bold and italicise words or turn them into hyperlink. The basics, really, but it\u2019s all there and easy to access. By default the colour section will give you a list of matching colours that would suit the other shades on your page, but you\u2019re also free to select any colour you wish.",
    "Changing images is just as easy: select one and you\u2019re instantly brought to a free online library. There\u2019s a handy search field to find the exact image you need, or import your own from your computer instead.",
    "Your image editing options are extremely limited. You have cropping, zooming, and flipping tools, and that\u2019s it.",
    "We do like the \u2018Site Library\u2019 option: this is where all the photos you\u2019ve used throughout your site are stored. It saves you from re-uploading the same photo should you wish to use it multiple times. Saves on bandwidth, and speeds up visitor access to your site.",
    "There are some editing options for each of your blocks. These are accessed by clicking on the Block Parameter icon (a cogwheel to the right of each block). This is where, for instance, you can choose to increase the block\u2019s top and bottom padding, add a background colour, or set how many images are to be in your Gallery. It\u2019s all done with sliders, toggles and drop down menus. Very straightforward and easy.",
    "As you\u2019d expect, you can also reorder your blocks or delete them altogether.",
    "Now you could create a complete landing page that way - everything you need to share with your visitors about yourself and your business, on one scrollable document, but Mobirise also lets you create multiple pages.",
    "You can start a new one from scratch, or duplicate an existing one should you prefer.",
    "Your pages don\u2019t appear in the navigation menu automatically though. You have to create a menu name, and link it manually to any new page. This is not very convenient, especially if you plan on creating a complex website. Even if you only want a couple of pages, automatically updating the navigation bar should be something Mobirise, which prides itself on making it easy for you, should offer.",
    "The absence of a blogging facility is sorely felt. Yes, you can create \u2018Article\u2019 blocks, place them on new pages, and link to such articles manually from the main page, but you\u2019d essentially be doing the non-existing blogging tool\u2019s job for it. And of course, there\u2019s no ecommerce facility.",
    "This is just a website builder which is designed to create simple and attractive pages to attract customers, and get them to contact you.",
    "As you\u2019re building your site, you have multiple ways to check how it would look to potential visitors.",
    "One way is the button in the middle of the top toolbar. It lets you toggle between Mobile and Desktop view (Desktop is selected by default).",
    "What\u2019s quite cool is the fact you can edit your site no matter which view you\u2019re in.",
    "Another way is opening your site in your default browser. Depending on its complexity, it will take a few seconds for Mobirise to export your project, but once done, it\u2019ll open instantly, and you\u2019ll be able to browse through it at your leisure.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to publish, Mobirise has an FTP client built right in, which is most convenient.",
    "Such a straightforward app should be easy for most people to use, but anything can happen, so it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s a help centre and a forum for you to access. The help centre is broken down into sections, and also has a search field to make finding the right article easier.",
    "As with all online forums, this one is filled with users asking questions with others (hopefully) providing the answers they seek.",
    "And if all else fails, the app\u2019s Help section also lets you write an email to Mobirise\u2019s technical support team.",
    "Mobirise is very easy to use, has a lot of simple options to help you create an elegant site in little time. There are limited options - at least the free version has - but if all you need is a basic site to advertise your presence online, and don\u2019t need features like blogging or ecommerce, you should definitely check Mobirise out. What it does, it does extremely well."
