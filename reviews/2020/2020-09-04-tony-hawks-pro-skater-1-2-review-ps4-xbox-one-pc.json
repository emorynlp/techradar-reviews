    "Unlike the kickflip most of us never came close to accomplishing in our youth, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a perfectly executed remake. It delivers in all the areas that fans of the original would expect, and sweetens the deal by adding all the modern necessities we demand of today\u2019s video games: sumptuous graphics, great performance, and more in-game challenges than you can pop an Ollie over.",
    "After many failed attempts to revive a series that was all but dead, developer Vicarious Visions has proved that there\u2019s life in the old Hawk yet. The collect-a-thon challenges, the ludicrously large combos and gravity-defying grinds are all present, and there are even instances when the game manages to transport you back to the halcyon days of 1999.",
    "From the moment you boot up Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 you\u2019re hit firmly in the feels with a wave of nostalgia. Guerilla Radio by Rage Against The Machine begins to play, and a considerably older-looking Tony Hawk proves that age is just a number as he pulls off his famous 900-degree spin. It remains quite the feat, and is a subtle reminder that, yes, skateboarding is still incredibly cool.",
    "Before long, skaters from a bygone era make an appearance \u2013 Bob Burnquist, Eric Koston and Kareem Campbell light up the asphalt with various tricks, flips and grabs that are made all the more impressive when you consider that most of them are now well into their 40s.",
    "And then the new blood comes in: the skating stars of the future. These days, it will be these skaters, rather than Tony, who will ultimately encourage greater numbers to pick up that plank of wood with wheels attached \u2013 skaters such as 18-year-old Aori Nishimura and 28-year-old Leo Baker. It\u2019s a symbolic moment; a changing of the guard, where the baton is passed to the younger generation. The Tony Hawk games put pro skating and The Birdman on the map after all.",
    "The biggest obstacle that Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 may have to overcome is whether the youth of today cares about skateboarding, or even Tony Hawk for that matter. For all the fogies who are \u201cgrowing older all the time (but feeling younger in their minds)\u201d, this game was always going to be a day-one purchase, particularly if it was any good (note: it\u2019s excellent). But Tony Hawk\u2019s games were very much a phenomena of the late 90s and early 00s, and the various failed attempts to resurrect the series only solidified that opinion.",
    "But here we are in 2020, and Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 proves that these games were always great, no matter whether or not you have (or had) an affiliation for skateboarding. For anyone who feels like their best years are behind them \u2013 your reviewer included, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 will feel like comfort food, and it\u2019s a dish that we\u2019ll be happy to gorge on for many months to come.",
    "And that\u2019s because, even after all these years, the simplistic arcade-style gameplay holds up remarkably well. Careering down a stupidly steep slope to catch some mad air is still an undeniable thrill, while trying to stop your skater from toppling over during a monumental grind continues to be a rewarding feat.",
    "If you\u2019re new to the series, the face buttons and combination of directional inputs allow you to perform a variety of jumps, tricks, grabs and grinds. Most of the gameplay loop involves vaulting over (and onto) obstacles as you explore the map to find the best areas to score points. The more tricks you combine, the bigger your score will be, and the quicker you\u2019ll be able to pull off risk/reward-style special moves that will really see you rack up the points.",
    "Each level is also broken down into a series of mini-challenges. You get two minutes to complete as many as you can, but unlimited attempts to do so. The majority of tasks require a bit of skill and technique to accomplish, such as scoring a set amount of points before the timer runs out, or reaching a specific area to collect or destroy certain items.",
    "So what does Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 bring to the table that\u2019s new? While everyone will undoubtedly have their own favorite entry in the series, the first two Tony Hawk\u2019s games established many elements that we love. Levels such as the Warehouse, Hangar and Venice are as much fun to skate around now as they were all those years ago. The difference, however, is that everything looks and plays significantly better.",
    "The biggest improvement is the inclusion of mechanics introduced in later entries such as Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3. Tricks can now be strung together by pulling off reverts and manuals, and they have a transformative impact on the way the games play. You can now bring together monstrously large combos and tackle the game\u2019s many intricate levels in entirely new ways.",
    "Also noticeable are the improvements to the game\u2019s graphics. This is a beautiful-looking game, particularly on HDR-capable displays. It\u2019s hard to imagine that we used to spend hours skating around largely empty levels, with bland textures and ugly geometry \u2013 although it obviously didn\u2019t feel like it back then.",
    "The action feels satisfyingly smooth, too. The game now runs at 60 frames per second for a super-responsive experience \u2013 made all the more noticeable when the slightest mistake can cause your skater to bail into the pavement.",
    "Speaking of bails, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 also improves on this all-too-common occurrence. Previously, your skater would hit the deck after a failed trick and writhe around in pain for a period of time. Now, however, your skater is almost virtually rewound, making bails far less frustrating and disruptive overall. It\u2019s pretty sick.",
    "Series veterans will likely blast through the game\u2019s 17 levels relatively quickly, but the plethora of in-game challenges and online leaderboards have the potential to provide countless hours of extra entertainment. Purists will probably become obsessed with trying to top the competition and complete everything the game has to offer \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot to get through.",
    "There\u2019s a slew of customization options that you can unlock \u2013 such as new boards, clothing, logos and in-game extras \u2013 by completing various milestones. Pro tip: if you really want to maximize your chances of achieving the highest scores possible, collecting all the stat points for each skater is a must. These points can upgrade your skater\u2019s balance, air time and top speed, which essentially gives you a greater chance of success when you\u2019re on your board.",
    "But that\u2019s not all. Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 also includes a level editor and online multiplayer. You won\u2019t find a huge suite of options here, but the ability to play with a friend \u2013 particularly during these challenging times \u2013 adds an extra layer of longevity to an already sweet package.",
    "A sublime remake that will feel like a grand homecoming for fans and an exciting revelation for newcomers, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a gnarly remake of two classic games. The Birdman kickflipped his way into the hearts of countless gamers back in 1999, and in 2020, his legacy has thankfully been restored. We only hope that Tony will step back on his board for further remakes or entirely new entries to the series \u2013 but if this is all we get, this one\u2019s super, man."
