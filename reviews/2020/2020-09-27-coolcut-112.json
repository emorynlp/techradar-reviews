  "summary": "Does this video screen grabber have everything you need to edit your project?",
  "verdict": "If you\u2019re looking for a screen grabbing tool, Coolcut may meet your needs. It\u2019s been much improved since the last time we looked at it - when it was called GoPlay - and despite a handful of niggles, is well worth a look.",
  "pros": [
    "Simple video screen grabbing tools",
    "Can build an edit fast",
    "Acceptable video editing tools"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Webcam recording are is embedded in the screen recording rather than saved separately",
    "Dubbing doesn\u2019t automatically mute the audio on other layers"

    "Coolcut (formerly GoPlay Video Editor) is a Windows-only app which is not strictly speaking a traditional video editor. It\u2019s main focus lies in being able to record your screen - a very useful tool if you\u2019re into making tutorials, or recording your game sessions, for instance.",
    "When you first launch the app, you\u2019re offered a very simple menu: \u2018Recorder\u2019, or \u2018Video Editor\u2019. Since we\u2019ll be needing footage, let\u2019s take a look at its recording capabilities first.",
    "The first time you launch either Recorder or Editor, little onscreen tutorials appear to help you quickly understand some of the major features of Coolcut. It\u2019s a great way to make you feel at ease when tackling a new or revamped application.",
    "Having Clicked on \u2018Recorder\u2019, you\u2019re then graced with a live preview of what is currently seen on your screen. All the controls you need are along the edges of that window. By default, Coolcut will record the entire screen for you, but you can select \u2018Window\u2019 instead to focus on a specific area, ignoring everything else. You are also free to resize that selection and even choose specific dimensions depending on your screen\u2019s resolution.",
    "There\u2019s an option to use a webcam connected to your PC to record yourself instead of your computer screen, or, if you select the \u2018picture in picture\u2019 option, you can do both at the same time. This is a cool feature which works as advertised, but you must specify how big you want the recording of yourself to be, and where on the screen you want to place it prior to starting the session; you cannot alter this during the editing process. The video of yourself is essentially burned onto the footage as it\u2019s being recorded, which greatly limits your editing options.",
    "You also have the ability of recording the audio that comes from your PC and/or the one from your built-in microphone.",
    "Top of the screen is a quality option. By default it\u2019s set to \u2018Lossless\u2019, but if this proves too taxing for your computer, you have other options available.",
    "You also have the ability to do live recordings (ie stream them on the web), but you need to manually enter the live RTMP address before you can do that.",
    "Once all your preferences are set, hit the blue \u2018Rec\u2019 button, and Coolcut will immediately begin recording the screen. Stoping the recording is done either via a keyboard shortcut or by clicking on that button once more (which has turned red and is now labelled \u2018Stop\u2019).",
    "The Editing part of Coolcut looks and feels like a regular non-linear video editing app, with better options than were available in previous versions.",
    "Any footage you\u2019ve recorded appears in the browser section. Double-click on any clip to see it in the preview window to the right. Not only are the screen recordings there, but you can also import any number of other video clips stored on your hard drives.",
    "Just as you\u2019d expect, you create your video in the Timeline area. Coolcut doesn\u2019t allow gaps in your video so as you drag more and more clips, they\u2019re automatically added to the end of the previous one. Even better, delete a clip within your edit and all footage to its right is automatically moved to the left. This allows you to build an edit fast.",
    "The editing tools have been beefed up in this version. In addition to being able to cut a clip, you can alter its speed, crop it, generate a freeze frame (when you wish to focus on a specific section for longer for instance), and even have access to green screen parameters.",
    "You can only work with one video track - which really labels this app as a basic editor. There is a sort of workaround thanks to two picture in picture tracks. As its name suggests you can add a video on top of another, but by default, that second video will be smaller than the one underneath it. However, not only can you reposition it to where you want it to be, you can resize it too.",
    "So theoretically, this could allow you to work with up to three layers of video, but you\u2019d have to resize every clip you add there, and if you delete a clip in the primary track it won\u2019t affect the picture in picture clips\u2019 position, so this is a solution that is very far from ideal.",
    "However, as a picture in picture tool, it works very well. You can use it to add a watermark for instance, or insert a small piece of video. Don\u2019t forget though that if you recorded yourself at the same time as your computer\u2019s screen, that \u2018picture in picture\u2019 effect cannot be altered from its original position. Considering the tools are there, it\u2019s very frustrating the webcam video is \u2018baked in\u2019 as it is.",
    "You have access to a good number of transitions, from the basic cross dissolve (which it calls Fade in and Fade Out), to more interesting motion and 3D effects.",
    "We do appreciate the fact that simply mousing over the transition\u2019s thumbnail gives you an animated preview of what to expect. This applies to Filters as well.",
    "You also have numerous titles to choose from to add to your video.",
    "Scroll down your available layers in the timeline and you\u2019ll notice additional ones past the Pic-in-Pic layers: Text1 and Music1 are self explanatory, but then you get to Dubbing1.",
    "If you\u2019re not keen on recording a narration as you\u2019re grabbing the screen, you have the option of doing it as you\u2019re working on the edit via the \u2018Dubbing\u2019 button, and this is where those tracks will appear.",
    "Click on that button, and the audio recording starts immediately at the playhead\u2019s location. Unfortunately it still doesn\u2019t mute the other layers as you do so, meaning that if you forget to mute the tracks yourself, it will make it impossible to reposition your voice-over to another position later on, or even edit it, as you\u2019ll transfer a copy of the background audio too. It\u2019s an odd omission to have made, and it would\u2019ve been better for any audio to be muted automatically as you click on that button.",
    "Once you\u2019re happy with your video, it\u2019s time to share it. Coolcut offers you a series of options. You get to chose its format, resolution, bit rate and frames per second (or just leave those as standard if you\u2019re not certain about them). As expected, the free version forces you to include a \u2018Coolcut\u2019 end credit. If you want to get rid of that, you need to become a VIP (more on that later).",
    "Another way to avoid the end credit and still not pay those hard working developers, is to choose \u2018GIF export\u2019 instead. But be aware that a GIF has no sound, and its quality and resolution is severely constrained. Still, the option is there if you\u2019d like to make a meme, or something.",
    "Finally, you can sidestep all that video you recorded and edited, and only export the audio.",
    "All these options are leaps and bounds better than what was available in previous versions.",
    "There are two flavours to this software: Ordinary and VIP. The first one is free but doesn\u2019t include all features in Recorder or Editor, and also adds a watermark to your video. Possibly the worst limitation is a restriction to only record two minutes at a time. To remove all this, you need to choose VIP.",
    "This can be done on a month by month basis for $9.80 per month, pay three months at a time for $12.90 per quarter, or forgo the subscription model and pay for the software outright for $49.50.",
    "The most popular option is $39.48 per year, which includes a free 3-day trial.",
    "Coolcut\u2019s selling point is its video screen grabbing capabilities, and this works pretty much as you\u2019d expect. The editing section of this app has been vastly improved, and so are its exporting options. It\u2019s just a shame that there are still some puzzling design decisions which hamper what could be a very good product.",
    "However, those major niggles are few. Everything else is miles better than it used to be, and is well worth taking a look at Coolcut if you\u2019re interested in making short screen recordings for free, or pay to make longer ones."
