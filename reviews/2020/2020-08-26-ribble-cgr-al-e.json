  "summary": "The Ribble CGR AL e is versatile, fun e-bike for the road less travelled",
  "verdict": "If you're in the market for an electric bike for more than just commuting, this could be just the ticket. The Ribble CGR AL e is just as happy on a rough trail as a tarmac road, and its smooth motor assistance and super speedy acceleration make riding a joy. It's just a shame the app can't keep up.",
  "pros": [
    "Fast acceleration",
    "Smooth ride",
    "Stylish, practical design"

  "cons": [
    "No display other than the LED color",
    "App needs work"

    "The Ribble CGR AL e is an electric bike that picks and mixes elements of cross, gravel and road designs to create something that\u2019s both versatile and a whole lot of fun. It\u2019s equally happy on smooth tarmac or a muddy trail (though make sure you wipe it down and dry it off carefully afterwards).",
    "The ride is super smooth and acceleration is exhilarating. If you love cycling but are finding it less fun than you once did, this is the bike to put a smile back on your face.",
    "The only downside is the ebikemotion app, which is very handy for checking the bike\u2019s charge on longer or more intense rides, but is still a work in progress. Maps are expensive, and you might find your phone's battery draining rather faster than expected. It\u2019s not a failing of Mahle ebikemotion platform as a whole though, and hopefully it\u2019ll be updated soon.",
    "The Ribble CGR AL e is available to buy directly from Ribble now. The bike is available in four standard setups, with prices ranging from \u00a32,299 (about $3,000 / AU$4,200) to \u00a32,999 (about $4,000 / AU$5,500). When ordering, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to customize your bike through Ribble\u2019s Bike Builder, which will allow you to change and add components, and pick a custom paint color for an extra charge.",
    "If you live in the UK, the CGR AL e is available in cycle-to-work schemes (essentially hire-purchase schemes that allow you to pay for the bike in instalments directly through your salary).",
    "Looking at the Ribble CGR AL e, you\u2019d never know it was an electric bike unless you spotted the discrete power button on the top tube. The battery is tucked inside the downtube, which is only slightly thicker than normal, and the motor is hidden in the rear hub.",
    "Design-wise, it\u2019s an interesting mix. Its road heritage is shown mainly in its drop-handlebar design, and while its tires aren\u2019t particularly knobbly, there\u2019s plenty of clearance around for mud. There\u2019s no suspension, so you\u2019ll definitely feel any rocks and bumps, but this is definitely a bike that\u2019s as happy on a woodland trail as a tarmac road.",
    "Take a closer look and you\u2019ll notice that those drops aren\u2019t smoothly rounded, but have a more ergonomic shape typical of a gravel bike. We found them very comfortable, and the angle worked well with our hands.",
    "When it comes to shifters and brakes, the CRG AL e is available in various specifications, which can be customized further through Ribble\u2019s Bike Builder when you place your order. All models are supplied with a comfortable Prologo Kappa RS Saddle (though you\u2019ll want to get up out of it at every opportunity).",
    "Note that the pedals on our review model are our own (rather old and tatty) ones, and aren\u2019t what you\u2019ll get with the bike.",
    "The bike weighs approximately 13.1kg with no additional components like mudguards or pannier racks, which is impressively light for an e-bike, and makes it easy enough to shoulder and carry. That\u2019s largely down to Ribble\u2019s choice of the Mahle ebikemotion drive system, which contributes just 3.5kg to the overall weight.",
    "The Ribble Hybrid AL e is a lot of fun. Switch on the power (as with any electric bike, this should be done before you place any pressure on the pedals) and you\u2019ll notice the difference immediately \u2013 it accelerates extremely quickly, and a gentle push of the pedals in the medium and high assistance levels will definitely put a smile on your face.",
    "Once you\u2019re in motion, the ride is smooth, and the motor is barely audible. Surging along the flats is a joy, but the assistance really comes into its own on climbs, ironing them out so you can forge on without the burn in your thighs.",
    "If you\u2019re planning to ride more off-road than on, we\u2019d recommend switching the standard tires for some knobbier ones that\u2019ll give you more grip; there\u2019s plenty of room to accommodate them. For commuters, the optional mudguards are a wise pick \u2013 we couldn\u2019t resist charging through a long, straight tunnel and wound up with a rather stripy back.",
    "The button is your only control on the bike, so it\u2019s wise to read the manual carefully before heading out. To choose a power assistance level, tap the button once so that the LED flashes. Tap it again once, and it will begin to flash green for level one. Tapping it one more time will make it flash orange for level two, and tapping it yet again will cause it to flash red for maximum assistance.",
    "Once the button stops flashing, it will revert to a color that represents the current battery level. It\u2019s a pretty intuitive system, with white and green being good and flashing red meaning you\u2019d better be prepared to plug in soon, or start putting in some more legwork.",
    "The bike is charged through a connector at the bottom of the down tube, which plugs into a simple adapter. Charging is extremely quick too, taking around 3.5 hours from flat. Bear in mind that because the battery isn\u2019t removable, you\u2019ll need to plug the bike itself in. You can buy an extender cable to make this easier.",
    "You can easily use the Ribble CGR AL e by itself, but the bike\u2019s lack of a display means it\u2019s a good idea to download the Mahle ebikemotion app (available for Android and iOS), which transforms your phone into a GPS bike computer. Connecting the bike to the app is extremely straightforward \u2013 simply switch the bike on, and it\u2019ll be detected by the app automatically. The bike\u2019s light will illuminate blue when it\u2019s successfully connected.",
    "It\u2019s a good looking app \u2013 particularly the main screen, which displays a map with essential information like current speed and charge. However, it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s still a work in progress, and not everything works perfectly so far.",
    "The app can provide turn-by-turn navigation, with both on-screen and spoken directions, but only if you purchase a map set first. Each map set covers an entire continent, and once you\u2019ve chosen the one you want, you\u2019ll be able to download maps for individual countries.",
    "It\u2019s a simple enough process, but most people will probably only need to find their way around one or two countries. We\u2019d prefer a system that allowed us to pay for only the maps we need, with optional bundle deals for globe-trotting holidaymakers.",
    "Thankfully, once you\u2019ve purchased a set, it will be linked to your account and available for any ebikemotion-powered bike.",
    "The ebikemotion app also seems to be quite battery-hungry, so it\u2019s wise to ensure your phone is fully charged before heading out on a ride."
