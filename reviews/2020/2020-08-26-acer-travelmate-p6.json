    "The Acer TravelMate P6 we\u2019ve reviewed costs $1,399 (\u00a31,299, around AU$2,400), which is a little less than most of its competitors, and it\u2019s an impressive office machine in several key areas.",
    "It only weighs 2.4 pounds (1.1kg), which undercuts rivals like the LG Gram 14, Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Air 13. It\u2019s packed with features \u2013 it has good internal and external connectivity, MIL-STD-810G accreditation, TPM and a webcam with IR and a privacy shield, and it can be configured with even more hardware, like NFC support and SIM card compatibility. When it comes to business versatility, it\u2019s better than every competitor.",
    "The Intel Core i7 processor delivers enough power to handle day-to-day work situations, from Office applications and loads of browser tabs to light photo-editing, and its Nvidia GPU is a little better than Intel\u2019s integrated offerings. The screen quality is reasonable \u2013 and the touch functionality is a bonus \u2013 and the Acer has better battery life than any of its key rivals. If you\u2019re careful with the screen brightness, this machine will last for two working days.",
    "In some areas, though, the Acer\u2019s lower price does mean compromise. The screen is good enough for everyday work, but it doesn\u2019t quite have the colour accuracy or gamut ability to handle colour-sensitive work tasks \u2013 the Dell or Apple machines are better. On the inside, several rivals offer significantly more CPU power, which means that laptops like the LG, Dell and Apple have more ability when handling multi-tasking scenarios and tougher work software.",
    "The machines from Dell and Apple have snappier, higher-quality keyboards and trackpads, too, and the Acer only has mediocre build quality and aesthetic design \u2013 it\u2019s not overly robust and it looks a little underwhelming.",
    "Those issues mean that the Acer isn\u2019t the right laptop if you need a machine with lashings of power, great-looking design, or a particularly sturdy chassis. Despite that, there\u2019s certainly a place for this laptop. It\u2019s powerful enough to work as a mainstream daily driver, and it has stellar battery life and loads of features alongside a reasonable price.",
    "The Acer we\u2019ve reviewed costs $1,399 (\u00a31,299, around AU$2,400), and it\u2019s the most expensive version of the TravelMate P6 that\u2019s currently available. If you\u2019re based in the UK, it\u2019s possible to save cash with a \u00a31,099 machine that pairs an Intel Core i5-10210U processor and 8GB of memory with the 1TB SSD and Nvidia graphics core.",
    "American buyers have a little more choice. Models that cost $1,049 and \u00a31,199 include 8GB of DDR4 and 256GB SSDs alongside different variations of Core i5 processor.",
    "Acer also says that models are on the way with different screen and graphics options \u2013 certain models will ditch Nvidia\u2019s GPU hardware and abandon the touchscreen, presumably to bring prices down further.",
    "Acer\u2019s machine tips the scales at 2.4 pounds (1.1kg), which is impressively light for a business laptop \u2013 better than most rivals. The 0.62in (16mm) thickness is decent, and barely any different from any of the market\u2019s leading ultraportables. It can be slipped into a bag without making a dent.",
    "The dimensions are good, but the Acer isn\u2019t as impressive elsewhere. Build quality, for instance: the TravelMate is made from magnesium alloy and its base is reasonably sturdy, but the screen flexes too much. At least it\u2019s got MIL-STD-810G certification for high and low temperatures, drops, vibrations, humidity, and rain, which is the bare minimum for any decent business laptop.",
    "The Acer isn\u2019t a particularly good-looking machine. The black metal is dull, the screen\u2019s bezels are too wide and there are no stylish touches.",
    "The Acer\u2019s key rivals outpace the TravelMate\u2019s design in important areas. The LG Gram 14 looks better and is lighter, the Dell XPS 13 looks smarter and is slimmer, and the Apple MacBook Air is one of the best-looking laptops around. The Dell and Apple machines have better build quality too.",
    "The TravelMate\u2019s keyboard is reasonable but, again, it\u2019s another area where competitors improve. The Acer\u2019s buttons have a fast and consistent action, and they\u2019re soft, with a slightly crisper feel when they bottom-out. It\u2019s easy enough to work for hours here, and the layout is decent, with a double-height Return key and separate Page Up and Down keys.",
    "The Dell and Apple machines are superior, though, with crisper buttons and quieter operation. The Acer\u2019s trackpad is only middling, too \u2013 fine for day-to-day use, but with spongy buttons.",
    "The Acer\u2019s Core i7-10510U processor is a 14nm Comet Lake chip with four Hyper-Threaded cores alongside base and boost speeds of 1.8GHz and 4.9GHz. It\u2019s joined by 16GB of dual-channel memory, a 1TB SSD and a low-end Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics core. Connectivity is handled by WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.0 and Gigabit Ethernet.",
    "This machine has great business features. Around the edges the Acer has a single USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port that supports DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3 and charging, and there are two full-size USB 3.2 Gen 1 connectors with slower transfer speeds. There\u2019s an audio jack, a Kensington lock slot and a microSD card reader. The HDMI 2.0 port is notable because it supports 4K output at a higher frame rates than the more common HDMI 1.4 standard. The 1080p webcam offers good quality, a privacy shutter and IR support, and the Acer also has TPM 2.0 and a fingerprint reader in the power button.",
    "It\u2019s even possible to configure this machine with NFC, a smart card reader and SIM card support if you\u2019re a business talking to Acer about larger deployments.",
    "The LG machine is similar when it comes to business additions, although its webcam doesn\u2019t support IR and it doesn\u2019t have a privacy shutter or super-fast USB 3.2 Gen 2. The Dell and Apple machines don\u2019t have full-size USB ports and they miss out on hard-nosed office features like TPM, webcam privacy shutters and Gigabit Ethernet. There\u2019s no doubt about it here \u2013 for office versatility, the Acer wins.",
    "The only negative is the audio gear. The Acer\u2019s speakers have decent volume and the mid-range is relatively crisp, but bass is almost non-existent, and the top-end is tinny. They\u2019re only suitable for casual media use.",
    "The Acer is fast enough to handle everyday computing \u2013 it\u2019s smooth and responsive when zipping around Office apps and web browsers with loads tabs, and it\u2019s powerful enough to tackle mainstream photo-editing. It\u2019s only going to encounter issues if you try to run high-end database or video software \u2013 or if you want to run loads of work software simultaneously.",
    "It\u2019s solid, but rivals offer more. In Geekbench the Acer returned single- and multi-threaded scores of 1,225 and 2,965, but the LG Gram 14 included a 10nm Intel Core i7-1065G7 that scored 1,330 and 3,494. That 10nm chip is also used inside the Dell, and a variant is used in some Apple machines, too \u2013 and, unsurprisingly, the Acer\u2019s 14nm CPU also fell behind Passmark, CPU-Z and Cinebench. LG\u2019s machine includes that faster Core i7 for a near-identical price to the Acer, although you\u2019ll have to pay $1,399 (\u00a31,599, around AU$2,159) to get that silicon inside the Dell and $1,449 (\u00a31,449, around AU$2,149) to get a similar CPU inside the MacBook.",
    "The SSD\u2019s read and write speeds of 3,545MB/s and 2,860MB/s are solid \u2013 easily good enough to keep the machine feel snappy and loading times swift.",
    "Don\u2019t expect much from the Acer\u2019s Nvidia GPU. Acer has used the weaker version of the MX250, which only has 2GB of memory, and it scored 3,421 in 3D Mark Fire Strike. That\u2019s around 600 points more than the Intel Iris Plus integrated GPU included elsewhere, which means a modest boost to photo-editing tools and graphical applications \u2013 but it\u2019s not transformative.",
    "The internals may not break speed records, but the modest hardware and battery deliver superb longevity. In PC Mark the Acer lasted for just over ten hours, and in our movie tested it lasted for a whopping fourteen hours and thirty-three minutes. Reduce the screen brightness and keep the applications light and you\u2019ll see sixteen hours from this machine. It\u2019s hours better than any rival.",
    "The Acer\u2019s 14in touchscreen has a 1080p resolution, which is fine for everyday work. It\u2019s matte, and viewing angles are good. The contrast ratio of 1,374:1 is easily good enough to provide great depth in darker areas and impressive vibrancy everywhere else \u2013 although the brightness measurement of 316cd/m2 means this machine isn\u2019t bright enough for outdoor use. The Delta E of 2.48 is reasonable and the colour temperature of 6,717K is great, too \u2013 so colours are accurate.",
    "Those results aren\u2019t quite good enough to handle colour-sensitive tasks, though, and the display only rendered 92.3% of the sRGB gamut and 67.7% of the Adobe RGB colour space. So, while this screen is easily good enough for day-to-day use and mainstream colour work, professionals who need pinpoint accuracy will have to look elsewhere.",
    "It\u2019s better than the LG\u2019s glossy panel, but the Dell and Apple machines are brighter and bolder, with more accurate colours and crisper resolutions."
