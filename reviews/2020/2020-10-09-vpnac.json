    "VPN.ac is a Romania-based VPN provider that has started offering its services at the end of 2012, \u201cafter several months of development and rigorous testing.\u201d Its VPN service is available on all major platforms, while its SecureProxy extension is offered for browsers.",
    "Unfortunately, Netflix and BBC iPlayer have so far been successful in blocking its IP addresses, which isn\u2019t the case for the competition that lists some of the best VPN services on the market. Regardless, VPN.ac is fast enough for torrenting if you\u2019re connecting to servers close to your physical location, and its native clients are simple enough for any beginner.",
    "If you opt for this provider, you\u2019ll have four subscription options at your disposal. The shortest length is one month and will cost you $9/month. A longer and 11% cheaper option is the 3-month one, at $24 (equal to $8/month), followed by the 1-year subscription with a 46% discount and the price of $58 (or $4.8/month). Finally, you\u2019ll get the best deal if you purchase the 2-year contract which comes with a price tag of $90 (or $3.75/month), placing VPN.ac somewhere in the middle of the pricing range in the VPN industry - there are cheaper players out there but also much more expensive ones.",
    "Under one account, users can run the VPN on up to 6 devices at the same time if they\u2019re using the OpenVPN protocol, or 3 if they\u2019re using WireGuard.",
    "The provider has a 1-week trial option but you have to pay for it, which kind of defeats the purpose and it doesn\u2019t even offer the full service - you can only connect up to 3 devices simultaneously. There\u2019s also a 7-day money-back guarantee if you\u2019re not happy with the platform\u2019s performance. The provider does ask that you reach out to the customer support first to see if they can resolve the issue.",
    "Accepted payment methods include credit/debit cards, PayPal, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, vouchers/prepaid cards, Alipay, UnionPay, iDeal, WebMoney, SEPA Direct Debit, and more.",
    "Where VPN.ac fails, the likes of ExpressVPN or NordVPN outperform. This includes unblocking Netflix and BBC iPlayer, as well as the truly risk-free, no-questions-asked money-back guarantees. There are more worthy contenders in those areas, including Surfshark and CyberGhost, both of which are cheaper than VPN.ac.",
    "Although many VPN providers can give you access to major VOD services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, etc. that are blocked in certain areas, VPN.ac, unfortunately, isn\u2019t one of them. If this is your priority, check one of the VPN platforms we listed above or our best VPN buyers guide.",
    "VPN.ac is operated by Netsec Interactive Solutions, a cyber-security firm established in 2009 in Romania, a country where data retention was declared unconstitutional so you can be sure there\u2019s no authority that would force VPN.ac to retain any of your information.",
    "This VPN provides access to 118 servers in 21 countries via its VPN services, while the SecureProxy addon covers locations in 32 countries. The countries where the provider has servers include Brazil, Czechia, Hong Kong, Mexico, Taiwan, the US, and others.",
    "To keep your sensitive information safe from outsiders in the privacy-unfriendly online world, VPN.ac utilizes Elliptic Curve Cryptography, obfuscation, the innovative WireGuard technology, and several types of encryption. Traffic protocols deployed, other than the WireGuard (which is in beta stage), include OpenVPN (UDP and TCP), L2TP/IPSec, IKEv2/IPSec, and PPTP. Sharing large files via P2P/torrenting clients is allowed.",
    "If you\u2019re using the OpenVPN protocol, you\u2019ll be able to turn on the kill switch mechanism that disables your Internet access in case the VPN is disconnected, preventing your actual IP address from leaking. You can also turn on/off the IPv6 blocking option in the app.",
    "For an increased level of privacy, you can direct your VPN traffic through not one, but two VPN servers, which is called Double Hop. The Double Hop server combinations can be selected in the server list inside the app.",
    "The provider claims not to \u201clog/monitor any kind of user activity such as visited web-sites [sic], emails, files transferred, instant messages, DNS queries, etc.\u201d However, some connection logs are kept when you connect to the VPN service, \u201cfor security and support purposes\u201d, but they\u2019re erased daily. These connection logs include \u201cyour real IP address, connection start/end time, and total traffic transferred during the session.\u201d VPN.Ac adds that it doesn\u2019t retain \u201cany logs on servers, not even common Linux daemon logs.\u201d",
    "The fact that the only information collected is only kept for a day does sound reassuring but we have no way of knowing for certain unless an independent auditor is brought to observe the platform and issue a public report.",
    "The provider offers its VPN software for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux (in beta stage), as well as the SecureProxy browser add-on for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.",
    "It is also compatible with third-party connection software, allowing you to install it on additional platforms, such as routers (enabling you to circumvent the limitation on simultaneous connections).",
    "The Android app has been downloaded over 50,000 times and was last updated on May 12, 2020. It has been rated 3.9 (out of 5) by 418 users. As for the iOS users, 30 of them gave the app a median rating of 3.8. The iOS app was last updated on June 4, 2020, when its designers gave it a brand new UI, dark mode, and fixed some bugs.",
    "Should you need any assistance, you can find it on the website in the form of setup tutorials, FAQs, and knowledgebase, divided into thematic categories. If these sources fail to provide you with the answer you seek, then the next logical step is to reach out to customer support. You can do so using email, Wire, Skype, a contact form, or a ticketing system, which is reserved for technical/billing support exclusively.",
    "As soon as we paid, the confirmation and activation emails arrived instantly. We only needed to download the app, enter the credentials, and connected immediately to a server in Amsterdam. The server performed marvelously - delivering 40Mbps on a 70Mbps testing connection.",
    "Then, it was the turn on the trickier locations, such as the one in New York, US. This time around, the speeds were expectedly lower but still reaching a very usable 14Mbps. Sydney, Australia hailed only 6Mbps. We also gave Double Hop a shot and it delivered around 20Mbps when connected to servers in the UK and Switzerland, which was a very good result considering the connection went through two separate servers.",
    "Switching between servers went quickly and smoothly. We only needed to select the server we wanted and the app would connect to it, regardless of whether it was already connected to a different server.",
    "VPN.ac is a capable and fast provider, at least on the servers in the user's relative vicinity. Coupled with military-grade privacy protection, this makes it one of the best VPN platforms for P2P traffic and torrenting, which it openly supports. Also, it features simple native clients for all major platforms, as well as supporting installation on additional devices.",
    "Having said that, if the lack of capacity to unblock Netflix and BBC iPlayer is a deal-breaker for you, you\u2019ll want to look for a VPN service that is more successful in this area, such as ExpressVPN."
