    "Dyson\u2019s Pure Cool Me fan and air purifier would be cool enough, looking as it does like a Stanley Kubrick 2001: A Space Odyssey prop. But its ability to send blasts of chilled air in directed waves around your person makes it cooler still.",
    "Small enough to sit on a bedside table, but powerful enough to be felt a few feet away, it does a good job of fitting that \u2018personal\u2019 fan bill. You may want to look elsewhere if you\u2019re after a device that will chill a larger room, but it\u2019s certainly a capable option for a bedroom or home office, where its relatively-quiet operation will be most appreciated.",
    "The Dyson Pure Cool Me is also an effective air purification system, with an onboard display letting you know how hard its filter is working. Mileage will vary here, particularly if you\u2019re not prone to noticeable reactions to allergens, but it\u2019s a nice space saving to feature to have as a dual-purpose gadget. Note, however, that filter replacements, available only direct from Dyson, are pricey.",
    "With no connected features, it\u2019s one of the more simple Dyson fans. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, making for straightforward operation and likely driving the price down a fraction. But if you\u2019re looking for a smart home addition, or are prone to losing a remote, this button-less fan may frustrate. However, at its core this is a hard-working fan \u2013 and one that you may not feel the immediate urge to hide in a cupboard once the weather turns a bit cooler.",
    "The Dyson Pure Cool Me is available now and costs \u00a3299 / $349.99 / AU$499, making it the most affordable of Dyson\u2019s fan-air-purifier combo range. That\u2019s down to their relative power and size, with the top of the range \u2018Tower\u2019 model significantly more expensive, and the medium-sized \u2018Desk\u2019 version costing more than the Dyson Pure Cool Me, too.",
    "Dyson products come at a premium, and that\u2019s no different with the Dyson Pure Cool Me, so we\u2019d encourage you to consider if you really want both a fan and an air-purifier. If you do, this space saving solution is great \u2013 if not, buying a single-purpose Dyson fan or air purifier will be cheaper.",
    "Dyson has a knack for making devices that don\u2019t look like their conventional rivals, and the Pure Cool Me is no different \u2013 even against Dyson\u2019s own range. Yes, it\u2019s a fanless design, but rather than having an open loop like other Dyson fans, the Pure Cool Me features a dome-like top sat on a cylindrical base, measuring 401 x 254 x 247mm. The dome area where air is pumped out is finished with a white gloss plastic, while the base is a perforated silver aluminium.",
    "Rather than the \u2018Air Multiplier\u2019 technology seen in other Dyson fans, the Pure Cool Me uses a system called Core Flow, concentrating blasts of air at you by pushing two streams of air together and over a convex surface. That dome can then be adjusted to send the air directly at you, or upwards for a more general cooling of an area.",
    "Ten speed settings can be flicked through, as well as a 70-degree oscillation mode. A sleep timer can also be accessed as well as power on and off functions, and also an information button that scrolls through some rudimentary stats (fan speed and filter health) on a circular display situated on the fan\u2019s base. All of these controls are accessed by a small remote that magnetically attaches to the front of the Dyson Pure Cool Me \u2013 which you\u2019ll want to do well to look after, as with no app control supported here, and only a single power button on the rear, you\u2019ll lose these control options without the remote.",
    "The dome part can easily be lifted up to access the single part filter (provided solely by Dyson), which Dyson claims is capable of capturing gases and 99.95% of ultrafine particles in its activated carbon and glass HEPA layer. It\u2019s one of the easier filters to replace as a result, even if it is a bit pricey.",
    "It\u2019s worth noting that the power plug for the Dyson Pure Cool Me is on the chunky side though \u2013 we had to shuffle a bedside cabinet forward considerably in order to plug the fan in behind it.",
    "As a personal fan, the Dyson Pure Cool Me excels. By pushing its dome up or down, you can easily direct its air flow directly at you, or upwards for a room-cooling effect. It\u2019s quiet in operation, making it a good desk or bedside table buddy, and its oscillation offers just enough movement to get a good breeze going.",
    "It\u2019s not the most powerful fan we\u2019ve used, even at its top speed setting \u2013 if you\u2019re sat on the other side of a larger room, it\u2019ll feel a bit lost. But it\u2019s one of the few fans of its size that can take control of a smaller room without its output noise being too much of a distraction. It\u2019s perfect for staying cool overnight as a result, without disturbing sleep.",
    "Thanks to only having on-remote controls, it\u2019s one of the easiest Dyson air purifiers to use. You simply switch it on and let it get to work. However, it also limits its usefulness, too. For starters, there\u2019s no smart home functionality, so the device cannot be accessed remotely nor switched on as part of a room group. But more importantly, the lack of Dyson Link app functionality means there\u2019s no way of gauging how effectively the filtration system is working, nor can it respond to incoming data the app can send regarding in-air pollutants. Other Dyson Link-enabled devices can turn themselves on automatically if a high concentration of pollutants are recognised. It likely keeps the price down, but considering you can\u2019t actually see in-air pollutants, we\u2019d have appreciated the omniscient auto controller here, and the pollutant-quelling evidence the app stats provide."
