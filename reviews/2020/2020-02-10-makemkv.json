    "MakeMKV is a refreshingly frill-free DVD ripper. It\u2019s available for Windows, macOS and Linux, and is completely free to use while it\u2019s in public beta. That\u2019s likely to change with the final release (the developer suggests that Blu-ray decryption may well become a paid-for feature), but for the time being there are no restrictions and the ability to read DVDs will always remain free.",
    "Streaming is rapidly overtaking DVDs and Blu-rays as the preferred way of watching movies and TV from a comfy couch, but many of us have expansive collections of physical discs gathering dust on shelves. It\u2019d be so much easier to watch them",
    "Unfortunately, Windows doesn\u2019t come with its own dedicated DVD ripping tool, so you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere for a tool to do the job. That\u2019s where Make MKV comes in. It\u2019s not flashy and certainly isn\u2019t packed with options, but it gets the job done with the minimum of fuss.",
    "First, however, a word of warning: copyright laws vary greatly between countries, and even backing up your physical media for private use is illegal in some territories. Make sure you check the law where you live before using a DVD ripper, and don\u2019t use them to rip rented discs, or to make copies to sell.",
    "It might look simple, but MakeMKV can handle both DVDs and Blu-ray discs with aplomb, and is packed with thoughtful touches to make your life easier when backing up your movies.",
    "Although it can\u2019t rip all encrypted discs, it can handle Blu-rays and DVDs protected with AACS and BD+ encryption without any additional software.",
    "All metadata (such as track titles, chapter information and track language) is kept intact when your discs are ripped, and conversion is pretty speedy. MakeMKV doesn\u2019t benefit from the GPU acceleration of tools like WinX DVD Ripper Platinum, but the speed is perfectly respectable for everyday tasks.",
    "Just pop your disc into your computer, allow MakeMKV to analyze it, select which tracks to rip and where to save them, and the software will handle the rest."
