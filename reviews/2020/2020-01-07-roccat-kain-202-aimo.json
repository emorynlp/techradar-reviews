    "The new Roccat Kain 200 AIMO has been updated, and we've been playing around with this pearly-white gaming mouse. The Roccat Kain 202 AIMO is admirable for its ability to do one thing really well: be a mouse.",
    "If that sounds strange, let us elaborate. Gaming mice have evolved significantly over the past decade, with the emergence of features such as real-time DPI tweaking, numerous programmable extra buttons and \u2018sniper mode\u2019 hotkeys.",
    "The Roccat Kain 202 AIMO is recognisably a gaming mouse, but it forgoes a lot of the flotsam features that bog down some of its competitors. Priced at $99.99 (\u00a389.99, AU$218) for the white model, it still keeps the stuff that really matters, but the focus for this product is to make pointing and clicking as fluid, fast, and comfortable as possible.",
    "That comes to the fore immediately in the form of Roccat\u2019s \u2018Titan Click\u2019 feature. The mechanisms underneath the two main split mouse buttons was completely overhauled for Titan Click, resulting in an undeniably pleasing experience. Both buttons have a satisfying, responsive click thanks to hidden hinges and low-tolerance springs.",
    "The real mechanical star of this mouse is definitely the scroll wheel, though. Not only is the Titan Wheel 2.0 (yes, they named that too) pleasing to scroll with, but it delivers a weighty wheel click with great physical feedback.",
    "That design quality does extend to the rest of the mouse too. The two side buttons and DPI swapper all feel responsive, and the overall shape of the mouse fits comfortably under the palm despite lacking a thumb rest. The Roccat Kain 202 AIMO weighs just over a hundred grams, and it feels very nice to use indeed.",
    "The 50-hour battery life \u2013 dependent on RGB brightness \u2013 is respectable for any wireless mouse, although we do wish that Roccat hadn\u2019t specifically shaped the microUSB charging port on the mouse to ensure use of the included cable. It\u2019s a frustrating trend with a lot of tech hardware right now; if you lose the cable that comes with the Roccat Kain 202 AIMO, you can\u2019t replace it with any cheap microUSB power cable.",
    "The set-up process is relatively straightforward too; just plug in the tiny USB dongle and off things go. Use of Roccat\u2019s Swarm software is a must here, allowing you to tweak all manner of settings from DPI profiles to automatic standby modes. Thankfully, Swarm is an easy program to use and doesn\u2019t attempt to clutter your PC with unnecessary add-ons like some hardware control software.",
    "We mentioned RGB lighting earlier - it\u2019s there, but it\u2019s relatively subdued, with gently pulsing rainbow LEDs beneath the scroll wheel and Roccat logo. It looks pretty good, and flashes briefly with specific colors when you hit the DPI profile switch button to adjust your sensitivity on the fly.",
    "Assuming that most gamers will want to keep their DPI control and left-right clicks, that leaves two buttons to remap for gaming (three if you include the scroll wheel button). It\u2019s certainly not enough for MMORPG fans, but for shooters and action games it should do just fine.",
    "Our final criticism of the Roccat Kain 202 AIMO might seem like a petty one, but it\u2019s still a frustration. A diminutive USB dongle connects the 202 to your computer, but there\u2019s nowhere to store it on the body of the mouse itself, as many other wireless mice offer. It\u2019s not likely to be an issue if you\u2019re using a desktop PC, but if you want a wireless mouse for your laptop, this might not be the best choice.",
    "On the whole, though, it\u2019s hard to dislike the Kain 202 AIMO. It just feels really nice in the hand, the matte finish almost soft to the touch. It\u2019s grippy and feels quite durable, and while the bright white color had us worried about wear and tear, Roccat promises the hybrid anti-wear coating is also dirt-resistant. It\u2019s a good wireless mouse, plain and simple."
