  "summary": "Open source accounting software from TurboCash",
  "verdict": "TurboCash comes with an impressive collection of tools for tackling many aspects of accounting, but the trade-off for its open source origins is a lack of major support and a rather lumpy interface that isn't going to appeal to everyone.",
  "pros": [
    "Deceptively potent",
    "Paid-for edition best"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Limitations with freemium version",
    "A little rough round the edges"

    "TurboCash is a free-to-use open source accounting package that is aimed at small businesses and works on a freemium basis, which is useful if you're trying to cut costs in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the older incarnation of TurboCash 4 is completely free, while TurboCash 5 comes with a $60 per year single user and $200 per year multiuser price tag.",
    "The software package, which originated in South Africa, can be installed on Windows and Mac machines and can be used for billing and invoicing, tax management and more besides. TurboCash isn\u2019t quite as slick and polished as others in this field, including Sage Business Cloud Accounting, QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks, Freeagent, GoSimpleTax, TaxCalc, Nomisma, ABC Self-Assessment, Crunch or Zoho Books.",
    "Nevertheless, it offers a decent starting point for any business looking to tackle their financial chores without spending much money to do it.",
    "With its freemium setup TurboCash makes quite good sense if you\u2019re a person with a business and who\u2019s got relatively simple financial affairs to sort out. Indeed, the TurboCash website suggests that opting for the free-to-use TurboCash 4 is the way to go if you\u2019re earning less than $10 an hour.",
    "However, TurboCash 5 is a more potent version of the software because it makes use of \u2018bought in\u2019 components according to the TurboCash website. Therefore, the extra features and functionality means it costs $60 per year single user and $200 per year for a multiuser license.",
    "TurboCash 5 also comes in Evaluation form, whereby you can use it and see if it suits your needs, with an evaluation charge of $6 per month. According to the TurboCash website, this is available on the understanding that you should subsequently take out a subscription for $60 per year.",
    "Despite the slightly low-budget or good-basic-value persona, TurboCash has been developed to include everything you need to tackle everyday accounting tasks.",
    "In terms of what you can do with it then TurboCash comes with an impressive armory of accounting tools, including options for managing accounts receivable, managing inventory, reporting and budgeting, while it can also handle multiple languages, making it of reasonably universal appeal.",
    "One of the main benefits of using TurboCash is that for a small outlay you can sign up other users, which means you can have other members of staff able to dip in and do their bit.",
    "Unsurprisingly, due to the fact that TurboCash 4 is free and TurboCash 5 isn't you can expect sprightlier performance from the latter. Users report that it\u2019s much more dependable and works with a little more of a spring in its step than the earlier and definitely more rough-round-the-edges fourth incarnation.",
    "If you\u2019ve got basic bookkeeping jobs to do and aren't in any particular rush to complete them then version 4 might suffice. But time is money, so anyone with any kind of urgency is best off plumping for the newest version of TurboCash.",
    "While TurboCash might come armed with lots of useful tools and functionality, it isn't the easiest software to use. That becomes evident early on during both installation and initial setup. Once users are into the main work area there are additional hurdles to overcome, and while the features are great, you\u2019ll need to be fairly accounts savvy to appreciate its nuances.",
    "TurboCash certainly lacks the usability of something like QuickBooks, and while they're two very different products \u2013 mainly due to the cost of QuickBooks, it\u2019s easy to see why a tax or accounting newbie might prefer to side with QuickBooks as a result.",
    "The support aspect of TurboCash is a little like other elements of the website, with a link through to a hierarchical menu list of help topics being the main source of help. There are hubs for both TurboCash 4 and 5. The documentation is actually quite commendable given the depth and volume that\u2019s available for both current editions of the software.",
    "However, being that it\u2019s open source and revolves around a community rather than a corporate service arrangement, you might feel a little nervous using it if you\u2019re not fully confident with the software. The lack of phone support from real people is not one of the strengths of TurboCash, which basically underlines its bargain-basement feel.",
    "While there is definitely appeal for an accounting program that can deliver so much for so little, TurboCash comes with limitations. If you\u2019re not too comfortable learning new programs, particularly those with less then comprehensive support options, then it might be best avoided.",
    "However, if you\u2019re willing to spend just a little for the latest edition, TurboCash 5, and have every confidence in your own abilities then this is a package that bristles with lots of features. While there are rough edges and a definite open source hand built feel throughout much of its interface TurboCash is worthy of inspection, even more so if you\u2019re willing to test drive it first."
