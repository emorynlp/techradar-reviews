    "The Fossil Sport is a mid-range sports watch that offers workout tracking and key smartwatch features in a smart package, but not one that's likely to blow you away.",
    "The way we look at it, the best technology is always going to combine performance and value. You don\u2019t want to pay too much, but you also don\u2019t want something that barely works. That\u2019s why when we\u2019re presented with a smartwatch that\u2019s right down the middle, like the Fossil Sport, we pay attention.",
    "This mid-range smartwatch is focused primarily on fitness, and is built for the task. It\u2019s light, attractive and durable. It even comes with a sporty silicone strap.",
    "The hardware is also suitably up to date, but it\u2019s not exactly bursting with high-end features. The question, then, is going to be how well this all translates to real-world performance.",
    "So, is the Fossil Sport the best smartwatch for you? For avid runners, it just might be. However, those looking for a premium accessory might want to look elsewhere, especially if you\u2019re using iOS.",
    "Luckily, if you\u2019re looking to get your hands on the Fossil Sport, you won\u2019t have to wait. It\u2019s available for purchase worldwide, both on Fossil\u2019s own website and through third-party retailers.",
    "At the time of writing it\u2019s the most recent and advanced smartwatch in Fossil\u2019s line-up, so its price rivals other recent Fossil wearables, such as the Fossil Q Explorist HR.",
    "You can pick the Fossil Sport up for $275 / \u00a3219 / AU$469, which places it solidly in the mid-range. However, compared to something like the Misfit Vapor 2, which is a bit cheaper at $249 / \u00a3215 / AU$349, the price looks a bit sour. But the bulkier aesthetics and weaker water resistance of the Vapor 2 might put some people off.",
    "When you\u2019re shopping for a smartwatch, particularly if you\u2019re looking for a new workout companion, you\u2019re going to want something that\u2019s both lightweight and durable. And, well, the Fossil Sport delivers in spades. The body is entirely composed of aluminum, and the strap that comes with the watch is lightweight silicone and won\u2019t absorb sweat.",
    "On the side of the Fossil Sport, you\u2019ll find a dial in the center, with a customizable button above and below. By default the bottom button is programmed to Google Fit, and the top to Fossil\u2019s own proprietary software.",
    "The Fossil software lets you save different configurations, or 'looks' for the home screen, but it\u2019s so arcane that we doubt many will find a use for it. We reprogrammed the button to launch a stopwatch instead.",
    "These buttons are a little stiff, but we think that\u2019s actually a good thing. While they can be a little hard to depress, it does mean that you won\u2019t accidentally start setting stuff off while working out.",
    "On the bottom of the Fossil Sport, you\u2019ll find a heart rate monitor, and two metal contacts for the charger. As far as we can tell, the heart rate monitor is glass, so it might get a bit cold, depending on the weather.",
    "Flip the watch around, and you\u2019ll be able to take in the 1.19-inch 390 x 390 OLED display. It's that size whether you choose a 41mm or 43mm case, and the Fossil Sport's display is definitely colorful enough, but it\u2019s not very bright. So you\u2019ll have to squint to read the smartwatch\u2019s screen in bright sunlight.",
    "The Fossil Sport\u2019s display will get the job done, especially if you\u2019re heading to the gym instead of jogging around your block at noon. But, with a smartwatch so focused on fitness, it would have been nice to see a brighter display.",
    "Bezels are pretty thick, too, but that\u2019s to be expected in a mid-range smartwatch. Unfortunately, bezel-less screen technology hasn\u2019t made it to smartwatches yet, though we\u2019re not sure it needs to.",
    "The wristband, however, is a highlight. Not only is it swappable, but the Fossil Sport is compatible with pretty much any 18mm or 22mm wristband (depending on whether you opt for a 41mm or 43mm case). This is excellent, because it means you\u2019re not locked to a proprietary connection, and you can save money on a new strap.",
    "However, we have to say that the lime green strap that came with our review unit looked good anyway.",
    "If you want to replace the strap, just flip the Fossil Sport around, and you\u2019ll notice two metallic switches on the end of each half of the strap. Pull these, and the strap will come right out. Reattaching the strap proved to be a little more troublesome, but that's in part because we're clumsy."
