    "It's not like Grado to rush to be first into a new sector of the market. But the good news is: the GT220 true wireless earbuds have been entirely worth the wait.",
    "On paper, the GT220 seem to have their work cut out. $259 / \u00a3250 / AU$365 for small, humdrum-looking true wireless in-ears with no active noise-cancelling and no control app? Even though the battery life (36 hours in total from the buds and their charging case) is competitive, even though touch- and voice-controls are very welcome, and even though the Grado name carries a lot of credibility (and consequently expectation), how are the GT220 meant to stand out in a market that\u2019s already awash with alternatives at every price-point?",
    "By performing with absolute confidence and assurance, that\u2019s how. By extracting every shred of information from digital files of your favorite music and delivering it with such authority, and in such a complete and coherent manner, that it sounds fresh even if you\u2019ve heard it a thousand times before, that\u2019s how.",
    "Hearing the GT220 do their thing makes the narrowness of their specification irrelevant.",
    "If you want to be completely isolated from the outside world while you\u2019re listening, well, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere. If you want to be able to fuss with EQ levels, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere, too \u2013 and anyway, the sonic balance of the Grados isn\u2019t going to be improved by your manipulating a five-band equalizer.",
    "If, however, you want a complete sonic picture that\u2019s alive with detail and nuance, and thrillingly musical at the same time, the GT220 are the wireless earbuds for you.",
    "The Grado GT220 true wireless in-ear headphones are on sale now, priced at $259 / \u00a3250 / AU$365. That puts them up against some very well-regarded alternatives (such as Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 2 and Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds), most of which have better on-paper specification than the Grados.",
    "Mind you, no company \u2013 not even Sennheiser or Bose \u2013 has an audio reputation that\u2019s more impressive than that of Grado. So it balances out, kind of.",
    "This is obviously a tricky one for Grado, as no one was building true wireless in-ear headphones in the 1950s \u2013 and it\u2019s the 1950s that has seemed to be Grado\u2019s design touch-stone with each and every pair of over-ear headphones it\u2019s ever turned out. So with no ancient reference point, how best to describe the design of the GT220?",
    "For starters, the look is anonymous \u2013 the likes of Bose and Sennheiser might be happy to make their customers look a bit weird when wearing their true wireless in-ears, but that\u2019s not how Grado rolls. The GT220 are compact, light at 5g per earbud and, and the polycarbonate housing looks and feels utterly unremarkable (and not exactly worth the money, either). The shape lends itself to a snug fit, though, and anyone who\u2019s worn a Shure in-ear monitor for example, will be familiar with the GT220s\u2019 \u2018twist/lock\u2019 fitting action and the degree of passive noise-cancellation it delivers.",
    "There\u2019s a big capacitive touch-surface on each earbud, decorated with a \u2018G\u2019 logo that lights up in a couple of different colors depending on what the earbuds are up to . The usual functions are catered for: volume up/down, play/pause, skip forwards/backwards, answer/end/reject call and summon voice assistant (both Google Assistant and Siri are available).",
    "Mics in each earbud ensure crisp call quality and pretty rapid voice-assistant response \u2013 although pausing music (rather than reducing volume) when interacting with the assistant seems a slightly stranger response than perhaps it ought to.",
    "On the inside, the Grados are fitted with a single 8mm polyethylene terephthalate driver in each enclosure. Connectivity is via aptX Bluetooth 5, which is more than enough to ensure high-resolution digital audio files can be dealt with comfortably. AAC codec compatibility is included too. Perhaps we\u2019re asking for the moon on a stick, but it\u2019s rather strange in a product this expensive, and from a brand with Grado\u2019s kind of audio reputation, that there\u2019s no aptX HD capability, let alone aptX Adaptive.",
    "Despite their very modest dimensions, the earbuds hold six hours of charge, and the 42g charging case (which can be topped up wirelessly from any Qi charging pad) is good for another five full charges. So unless you play at fearsome volume the whole time, an all-in total of 36 hours is achievable. Two hours\u2019 charging is enough to bring the GT220 from \u2018flat\u2019 to \u2018full\u2019.",
    "In truth, the \u2018twist to lock\u2019 action Grado recommends isn\u2019t especially intuitive and you may need to invest a little more time than you might expect to get the GT220 fitted as you\u2019d like. Do persevere, though, because these are among the most accomplished-sounding true wireless in-ears you can buy. There\u2019s just no aspect of music-making at which the GT220 don\u2019t excel.",
    "Once through an MQA-powered Tidal Masters file of Bob Marley & The Wailers\u2019 Turn Your Lights Down Low is enough for the Grados to establish their extensive credentials. The tonal balance, from the deep, detailed, textured lowest frequencies to the crisply attacking highest, is judged exquisitely. In the midrange, the vocal has more than enough breathing space at the front of the soundstage to communicate in spades.",
    "Throughout, detail levels are sky-high \u2013 the GT220 pay forensic attention to the attack and decay of individual sounds, to the extent that the sound of Marley\u2019s mouth as he finishes one note and prepares for the next is made obvious. Not overstated, you understand \u2013 just observed and communicated.",
    "There\u2019s so much space on the stage, it\u2019s possible to identify the individual positions of the I-Threes as they deliver backing vocals. Every element of the recording, in fact, exists in its own pocket of space, securely isolated from the rest of the strands of the recording even as the Grados integrate them all together.",
    "As far as the languid tempo and mildly choppy rhythm of the song are concerned, the GT220 describe them both with absolute positivity \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to keep a song as pleasantly languorous as this moving forward without giving the impression of hurrying it, but the Grados handle it with complete confidence.",
    "Dynamically, there\u2019s not a lot of the \u2018quiet/LOUD/quiet\u2019 stuff going on in this recording, but the Grados deal with the smaller-scale, second-stage dynamics of harmonic variation just as assuredly as they handle every other facet of detail-retrieval. If it\u2019s insight into a recording you crave, a proper understanding of every discrete element as well as an overview of the way they all hang together, the GT220 will delight you.",
    "And this attitude of almost casual, yet complete, fidelity is carried over to any other genre of music you might care to listen to. From Aphex Twin\u2019s Come On You Slags! to Princess Chelsea\u2019s No Church On Sunday, from Duke Ellington\u2019s take on Rhapsody in Blue to Mos Def\u2019s Ms. Fat Booty, the Grados are unfazeable. They dish the details without sounding analytical, they individualize specific strands of a recording without ever sounding less than unified, they have the scale to deal with even the largest ensemble pieces without alarms, and they couldn\u2019t care less about the type of music you like to listen to."
