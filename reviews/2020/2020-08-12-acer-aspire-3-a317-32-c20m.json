    "Celeron CPU is pretty woeful",

    "Do not adjust your screen. Yes, that is the thick end of three-quarters of an inch of bezel all the way around the edges of the new Acer Aspire 3\u2019s 17-inch LCD display. It\u2019s as if the slim-bezel bandwagon sailed straight on by Acer\u2019s latest affordable laptop.",
    "Is that necessarily a problem? This is a 17-inch model, so portability clearly isn\u2019t the primary concern. What\u2019s more, with the Acer Aspire 3\u2019s budget pricing, perhaps it\u2019s better the limited funds went on functionality rather than frills.",
    "So what exactly do you get for your not-a-lot of money? Physically, a whole lot of laptop with a 17-inch LCD panel that clocks in at 1,600 by 900 pixels (and thus not full 1080p HD). The screen panel itself is also TN where IPS technology has become virtually standard, even on cheaper devices. The result is a distinct lack of contrast and brightness, not to mention poor viewing angles.",
    "Next up is the Intel Celeron N4000 processor. In CPU terms, this is pretty much at the bottom of Intel\u2019s pile. It uses low power Atom cores, rather than full fat Core, er, cores. What\u2019s more, there are just two of them, they don\u2019t support Hyperthreading and they clock in at just 1.1GHz with burst speeds up to 2.6GHz. They\u2019re about as low performing as modern PC processors get.",
    "There\u2019s better news elsewhere in the form of 8GB of DDR4 RAM, plus a 128GB SSD and 1TB HDD. So the storage and memory side of the equation is actually pretty decent. Ditto the Intel UHD 600 graphics. Be clear, this is no gaming device. But it does offer hardware H.264 and H.265 decode support. The weak CPU is therefore no impediment to video streaming. It\u2019ll even stream 4K content effortlessly, though the screen obviously can\u2019t resolve that many pixels.",
    "For connectivity, Acer provides AC Wi-FI, Bluetooth 4.2 and gigabit ethernet. There\u2019s also HDMI, two USB 2.0 ports and a single USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A socket. Notably, therefore, you don\u2019t get USB Type-C or any kind of card reader. Rounding out the details is a mere 0.3MP webcam and a 36.7Wh battery.",
    "The latter feature results in just three hours and 11 minutes of battery life in PCMark 10. If that\u2019s pretty poor, PC Mark with its heavy multitasking is a relatively unrealistic test for this kind of portable. More relevant is video playback where you\u2019ll achieve well over double the PCMark 10 result, depending on conditions. In simple terms, this is a three-to-four movie laptop, should you lug it onto a plane.",
    "As for broader performance, in day-to-day usage, the Acer Aspire 3 in this configuration feels pretty sluggish. Apps are slow to load, which is somewhat forgivable. Harder to swallow is the laggy performance when opening web pages. The YouT",
    "ube homepage, for instance, takes an age to fully render.",
    "Thus, this is physically a lot of laptop for the money. But the computing experience, whether it\u2019s the dingy screen or the sluggish performance, is pretty low rent.",
    "For now, Acer isn\u2019t offering this 17-inch Atom-powered variant of the Aspire 3 in either the US or Australia.",
    "In the UK, it\u2019s yours for \u00a3399, which is either great value for a 17-inch laptop PC running windows, or a false economy if you\u2019re sensitive to the screen quality and weak performance.",
    "The Acer Aspire 3\u2019s fat bezels are hard to ignore in an age where slim is king. Get past that single aspect, however, and there\u2019s a solid, well-constructed if all plastic, portable PC to be appreciated.",
    "In portability terms, the Aspire 3 is marginal. At a little under three kilos and actually over 16 inches wide, if you\u2019ll forgive the mix of metric and imperial, it\u2019s a bit of a beast. At least the weedy Atom processor means the power supply is almost comically small given the scale of the laptop itself.",
    "The keyboard has plenty of throw, albeit with a pretty soft action, only suffers from a little bounce - the bed is pretty firm. It\u2019s also generously proportioned with a full number pad. As for the trackpad, it\u2019s not as large as we\u2019d ideally like - there\u2019s plenty of space for a larger pad - but at this price point, a huge Apple-style glass trackpad was never going to happen.",
    "Likewise, the all-black design may be plain, but it also lacks the kind of detailing that\u2019s prone to dating, those big bezels aside. In short, while the Acer Aspire 3 doesn\u2019t exactly look like a million bucks, it also avoids an overtly bargain-basement vibe. It\u2019s functional and robust.",
    "All ports are situated on the side of the device. That includes the power socket. For most portable, that\u2019s acceptable. However, the Aspire 3 is a large 17-inch device that\u2019s likely to spend most of its life in a single location. In that context, a rear power port would be preferable.",
    "The range of ports is adequate but no more than just one of the three USB sockets is high speed and there\u2019s no USB-C at all. Again, that\u2019s not a shock at this price point. But it still feels a little wrong here in 2020 to buy a new laptop without a USB-C port.",
    "Ever wondered whether Intel\u2019s Atom serves up a full featured PC experience? A mere 30 minutes with the Acer Aspire 3 makes it clear that\u2019s a negative. Some apps are so slow to launch, you\u2019ll find yourself doubling back to check you actually opened them.",
    "Arguably this type of device isn\u2019t designed for launching heavy duty apps, but you certainly would want it to open web pages pretty swifty, which sadly isn\u2019t the case. The reality is that a cheap tablet will be more pleasant for web browsing than this beefy laptop.",
    "Unsurprisingly, it really struggles in our benchmarks. Watching it labour through Cinebench R20 and record a result that represents about one sixth of the performance registered by something like a low-end Intel Core i5 quad-core mobile processor is pretty painful, even if it does serve as a timely reminder that mainstream laptops will full featured if more affordable CPUs like the Core i5 now offer remarkable performance.",
    "In mitigation, the Aspire 3\u2019s 12GB SSD offers reasonable performance, notching up 900MB/s reads and 600MB/s writes. Five or six years ago, that would have been cutting edge for a desktop PC. The 8GB of RAM means that performance is also not likely to be further slowed by running out of system memory. Put simply, it\u2019s that Celeron N4000 that is the performance bottleneck.",
    "The huge 17-inch screen disappoints a little, too. The TN panel lacks punch and pizzazz courtesy of poor contrast, brightness and viewing angles. Thanks to its generous proportions, it\u2019s not entirely without merit for consuming content or viewing web pages. But screen technology has improved dramatically in recent years, even in cheap devices, and the Aspire 3 is off the pace.",
    "The Aspire 3\u2019s 36.7Wh battery does not bode well for a large 17-inch system. Sure enough, it conks out after an unimpressive 3 hours and 11 minutes in the PCMark 10 Battery Life test. However, the news when it comes to video playback is much better.",
    "Over seven hours decoding 1080p content with the screen at half brightness isn\u2019t actually that bad. It\u2019ll get you through a long flight of movie watching. You can expect similar longevity with a little light web browsing, too. At this price point, that\u2019s actually better than we were expecting."
