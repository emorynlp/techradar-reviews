  "summary": "The TicWatch Pro 3 is a big yet sleek and fast watch",
  "verdict": "The TicWatch Pro 3 is a quality smartwatch with three-day battery life, great speed, and a sleek design. It doesn\u2019t particularly excel at anything, but it satisfies all your basic workout and message-previewing needs, with a standard Wear OS software setup and a few TicWatch-branded workout and health apps. It\u2019s notably cheaper than top-tier smartwatches, so pick it up if you\u2019re willing to forgo some features to save some cash.",
  "pros": [
    "Big battery lasts up to 3 days before charge",
    "Fast Snapdragon 4100 chipset",
    "Crisp, high-resolution display"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Wear OS is unremarkable",
    "Interface sometimes very unintuitive",
    "Sleep tracking isn\u2019t too accurate"

    "The TicWatch Pro 3 is one of the best Wear OS smartwatches we\u2019ve tested, full stop: with a big display, a huge battery, and a look that streamlines its large size to keep it from feeling chunky, it\u2019s got the right perks for anyone who wants a classy-looking watch with useful, if not standout, features.",
    "That means it\u2019s one of the best alternatives to the best smartwatches out there, including the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and the Apple Watch 6, especially since the TicWatch Pro 3 comes in much cheaper than either of those. While Wear OS doesn\u2019t have quite the interoperability in device ecosystems as watchOS or Tizen wearables, it covers the basics, from phone call commands and email/notification previews to tracking fitness.",
    "Instead of software, the TicWatch Pro 3\u2019s physical features are its greatest strengths: the 1.4-inch OLED display is sharp, vivid, and responsive to touch controls. There are heartbeat and SpO2 sensors on the bottom of the watch case, and two buttons on the right side for navigation shortcuts, but it\u2019s the overall look of the smartwatch \u2013 sleek and refined, with a matte black finish on the case, and a glossy dial with thin bezels \u2013 that make it stand out among chunkier rivals.",
    "The smartwatch\u2019s appearance is its most obvious upgrade on its predecessor, the original TicWatch Pro (no, there wasn\u2019t a TicWatch 2 Pro) that came out in 2018, which is only 0.4mm thicker but looks noticeably bulkier, with wider bezels on the dial.",
    "But the biggest upgrade is under the hood: the TicWatch Pro 3 is the first smartwatch with the Snapdragon Wear 4100 platform, and combined with the 1GB of RAM, the smartwatch coasts through switching between screens and apps without a hitch. This hasn\u2019t always been the case with Wear OS watches, let alone some of Samsung\u2019s Tizen ones, so it\u2019s appreciated here.",
    "Its 8GB of storage is pretty standard, and given most apps won\u2019t be more than 3 or 4MB, it\u2019s not much of an issue, though it\u2019s far from the massive 32GB of storage on the Apple Watch 6, say. While the Wear OS apps aren\u2019t as curated as those on the watchOS App Store or Tizen Store, there are still enough fitness, weather, and news apps to pick from. TicWatch\u2019s suite of apps is suitable, though a few questionable interface choices keep them from being as intuitive as competing software.",
    "Overall, the TicWatch Pro 3 is a solid watch with a high price tag that still comes in cheaper than the competition. It\u2019s a good smartwatch that excels in speed and looks, not intuitive or novel software.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 release date was September 24, 2020, with a price tag of $299 / \u00a3279 / AU$449.",
    "That\u2019s a bit pricier than the original TicWatch Pro\u2019s launch cost of $249.99 / \u00a3219.99 / AU$369.99, but the higher cost comes with more features and improvements in the TicWatch Pro 3, like an SpO2 sensor and a sleeker case.",
    "Among smartwatches, the TicWatch Pro 3 looks as premium as its price suggests, with a conservative chic rather than the futuristic \u2018bulbous\u2019 look of the Apple Watch series or Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2. It\u2019s got a traditional timepiece look and some elegant digital faces to match, if you\u2019d like, which come across great on the crisp display.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 has a sleek appearance with its matte black metal case, black glossy dial with thin bezels, and relatively thin build. It\u2019s a big wearable at 48mm wide, to be sure, but looks far slimmer than its predecessor and other smartwatches of yesteryear. Its 42g weight makes it lighter than today\u2019s pricey watches, like the Apple Watch 6 (47.1g) and smaller Galaxy Watch 3 (48.2g) \u2013 and even the latter\u2019s 43g titanium version. And with such a wide case, it feels quite balanced on the wrist.",
    "As previously said, the TicWatch Pro 3\u2019s 1.4-inch 454 x 454 display is very crisp, bright, and responsive to the touch. It has an always-on mode, too, which looks completely different to the usual smartwatch face, ditching pristine graphics for a monochromatic set of numbers that looks like digital watches of old.",
    "Most of the design changes from its predecessor trim down its appearance, making it look far leaner despite being only 0.4mm thinner (12.2mm thick for the TicWatch Pro 3 vs. 12.6mm for the TicWatch Pro). Otherwise, it\u2019s almost identical, with two buttons on the right edge for functionality: the top button brings up the app screen and a long-press activates Google Assistant, while the bottom one is a customizable app shortcut. The bottom of the watch packs the heart rate monitoring and SpO2 sensors.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 comes with a synthetic watch strap with stitching that makes it look a bit like the leather bands on more premium watches. This at least makes the watch more suitable for workouts \u2013 or shallow swimming thanks to the watch\u2019s IP68 dust- and water-resistance rating \u2013 but also gives it a higher-quality look from afar. It\u2019s a nice compromise we\u2019re surprised we haven\u2019t seen from other smartwatches.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 packs a suite of TicWatch-made workout and health apps, which are all branded with the Tic- prefix (TicExercise, TicHealth, TicSleep, and so on). This divvies the expected features pretty cleanly, though you\u2019ll keep getting prompted to feed all your biometric data back to your Mobvoi account.",
    "The TicExercise app works well enough with 13 workouts to choose from, though its interface makes some odd, unintuitive choices, like not having a \u2018stop exercise\u2019 button \u2013 you have to press and hold the \u2018lap\u2019 command (or press and hold the lower-right physical button on the watch\u2019s side). There\u2019s no tutorial either. If you want other workout and health options, you can go for Google\u2019s Fit suite of apps, which come pre-installed.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 does have GPS, tracking your route during a workout and displaying it, though we didn\u2019t always find it responsive, and sometimes it struggled to show the route with context \u2013 like, say, on a proper map.",
    "This makes exercise tracking a bit annoying to figure out, but thanks to its speedy specs, the watch is very responsive mid-workout. Physically, it\u2019s not too cumbersome and won\u2019t get much in the way of wrist rotations, and the weight is spread out enough that it isn\u2019t top-heavy like other clunkier watches \u2013 but it\u2019s still noticeable, unlike smaller fitness-focused devices like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2. The synthetic band that comes with the watch handles sweat just as well as other rubber-like straps popular in smartwatches, and we felt comfortable cranking out reps and going extra laps with the TicWatch Pro 3.",
    "Through the other Tic-suite apps, you can measure heart rate and blood oxygen level as well as track your sleep. The heart rate monitor and SpO2 sensors on the bottom of the watch take readings easily enough so long as the case is flush against the skin. Just be aware that it can track your heart rate, but not take a proper electrocardiogram (ECG), as other leading smartwatches do.",
    "The sleep tracking isn\u2019t quite as accurate as we\u2019d like, as it counted periods of late-night immobility (okay, playing games with friends) as sleep sessions, unlike other smartwatches we\u2019ve used alongside the TicWatch Pro 3. But the lengthy three-day battery life means we didn\u2019t worry about remembering to recharge the TicWatch Pro 3 before tracking sleep every night: once, diligent as we are, we failed to top up our Apple Watch 6 and it died overnight, but TicWatch\u2019s new smartwatch lasted through despite going around 60 hours without recharging.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 is the first smartwatch to pack the Snapdragon 4100 chipset, and with 1GB of RAM, it\u2019s a fast watch that hasn\u2019t lagged on us yet. It even aced our silliest test \u2013 watching YouTube videos on the Video Tube app \u2013 which streamed in seamlessly as fast as our Wi-Fi allowed.",
    "The TicWatch Pro 3 follows a pretty standard installation of Wear OS, with the usual \u2018slide left/right/up/down\u2019 gesture shortcuts for events/tiles/notifications/control center, respectively. If you\u2019ve ever used a Wear OS watch before, you won\u2019t be surprised.",
    "Hit the top-right button and you\u2019ll find all your installed apps in a double column, which is a simple way to sift through your software, though it\u2019s not nearly as fancy as the radial selection of apps on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, for example, or the swath of icons on the Apple Watch. But the fast chipset makes touch navigation breezy and as quick as you can swipe.",
    "There\u2019s a generous selection of watch faces, and while we\u2019re ordinarily a fan of minimal designs, we found ourselves picking the faces that packed in the most complications \u2013 because, unlike some other watches, the TicWatch Pro 3\u2019s screen resolution is detailed enough to see all of them. Finally, we can see health information like steps and heart rate and check the time, too.",
    "The 577mAh battery is another of the TicWatch Pro 3\u2019s standout features, as it regularly lasted us past two days and into a third. You can cheat out more battery life by switching to Essential mode \u2013 up to 45 days on a full charge, boasts Mobvoi \u2013 which has the same appearance as the bare-bones monochromatic digital watch-style always-on display.",
    "While decidedly old-school in looks, Essential mode shows more information like heart rate, oxygen saturation, step count, and sleep monitoring data than we\u2019ve seen from battery-saving display modes on other smartwatches. It grew on us, too. Why don\u2019t more smartwatches embrace the old-school Casio digital watch aesthetic?",
    "Lasting up to three days before needing to recharge puts the TicWatch Pro 3\u2019s battery life around the length of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, which is surprising given the latter\u2019s smaller 340mAh battery. Regardless, the new TicWatch packs a 5V1A charger (but not a wall mount \u2013 you\u2019ll have to use your own) which recharged the watch about 60% in an hour.",
