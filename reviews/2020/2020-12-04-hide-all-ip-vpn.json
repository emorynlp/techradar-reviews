  "author": "sead-fadilpasic",
  "summary": "Slow but some positive sides",
  "verdict": "Hide ALL IP is efficient in what it advertises - effectively masking your real IP address with the one you choose instead. This will allow you to access geographically restricted content and share large files via torrenting clients while staying safe and anonymous. That said, it is a bit rough around the edges and has some rather poor download speeds which might be an obstacle to performing some (if not all) of these activities.",
  "pros": [
    "Unblocks BBC iPlayer, Hulu",
    "Very affordable",
    "Supports mobile hotspots",
    "A lot of extras"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Poor speeds",
    "Lacks information on logging",
    "Looks a bit obsolete",
    "No mobile apps"

    "Hide ALL IP is a simple VPN platform that focuses on providing your desktop device with an IP address to hide your identity online, protect you from snoopers and hackers, play any online game, and access content available exclusively in specific regions.",
    "It has several unique features that separate it from many other similar solutions, including mobile hotspot support, faking HTML5 geolocation, auto-HTTP tunnel, flexible tunnel rules, and a portable version of its software.",
    "There\u2019s only one payment plan - a one-off, one-year subscription that costs $29/year (an equivalent of $2.42/month), making this VPN solution one of the cheapest on the market. However, you can only run one VPN connection at a time, and you\u2019ll need to purchase a license key for each computer you wish to run Hide ALL IP on. That said, the provider does offer volume discounts on purchases of more than one license.",
    "Hide ALL IP supports multiple payment processing options - Avangate & PayPal, FastSpring, Perfect Money, and Bitcoin. If you\u2019re using Bitcoin, you\u2019ll need to contact the provider directly for the recipient address.",
    "If you\u2019re not entirely satisfied with your purchase, you can request a refund under the unconditional 30-day money-back guarantee, with an option to provide a reason (or not) for the cancellation.",
    "Although it may be cheap and useful in some areas, Hide ALL IP falls far behind today\u2019s best-known VPN performers, such as ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, or CyberGhost. Some of them may be more expensive and may not offer some of the extras present in Hide ALL IP\u2019s platform, but all of them, without exception, provide superior platforms with advantages that far outweigh all of Hide ALL IP\u2019s perks, including apps for all major platforms, outstanding speeds, modern apps, and thousands of servers all over the planet.",
    "Hide ALL IP provides access to some of today\u2019s popular Internet TV channels, such as Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and others, which use location detection to deny users certain content. Video instructions are available for streaming Hulu and BBC iPlayer with this provider\u2019s help.",
    "Hide ALL IP offers access to over 150 servers in 38 countries, including Turkey, Vietnam, Brazil, Russia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Egypt, Mexico, and others.",
    "According to the website \u201call inbound and outbound connections (include [sic] UDP data) are encrypted using the industry standard RSA 2048 and AES/DES encryption,\u201d which is \u201cgovernment level encryption and is very safe.\u201d",
    "The provider also deploys Remote DNS Lookups. Additionally, all of your connections\u2019 transfer data (including TCP/UDP/DNS query data) \u201cis encrypted by default using the industry standard RSA+AES/DES algorithm.\u201d",
    "Other extra features include faking HTML5 geolocation, auto-HTTP tunnel, flexible tunnel rules, preventing WebRTC IP leak via auto-fix WebRTC STUN protocol, IP randomization, and more.",
    "Torrenting is allowed on all of its servers, and Hide ALL IP recommends that you use uTorrent or BitTorrent.",
    "Hide ALL IP\u2019s Privacy Policy isn\u2019t exactly teeming with information and we\u2019re only told that it \u201cis committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our websites\u201d and that it has \u201cput in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online\u201d. There are no details as to what data exactly is collected.",
    "Hide ALL IP only has native software for Windows and Mac but works with almost every browser, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Netscape, Opera, Safari, Maxthon, MyIE, Avant Browser, and Lolifox. However, safe browse mode is only supported by Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari.",
    "It is also \u201ccompatible with all types of routers, firewalls, home networks, wireless networks, and any other kind of Internet connection. You will need to purchase one license key for each computer on your network that you wish to conceal your IP address on.\u201d",
    "This VPN vendor also offers a portable version that you don\u2019t need to install but can be run from removable media.",
    "Using the devices\u2019 WiFi settings, you can set up your Android phone or iPhone to use the Hide ALL IP mobile hotspot, with the help of the provider\u2019s clear and detailed instructions on the website.",
    "The website is a pretty good source of information on anything related to this service, including setup manuals and usage instructions. However, if you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, you can contact the provider\u2019s customer support directly using email or a contact form.",
    "There was a slight learning curve, but once we got the hang of it, we realized just how easy the Hide ALL IP Windows app was. All the IP addresses are listed next to their location and signal strength, and all you need to do is press connect and choose your app of choice for which you intend to use this VPN.",
    "We tried out the platform\u2019s performance on the 82Mbps testing connection and weren\u2019t impressed with the results. The download speed for Hungary, which is relatively close to our physical location was a measly 3Mbps. Austria did even worse - 2.8Mbps.",
    "Surprisingly, a server in the United States did better than Europe, despite being further away, with 4.1Mbps, which is low but enough for private browsing and even torrenting, if you have the time. Singapore, unfortunately, wouldn\u2019t even connect to our speed test.",
    "Hide ALL IP has some good sides - it can unblock BBC iPlayer and Hulu content, it allows torrenting, works with a wide range of devices, and has some extras. It isn\u2019t expensive, either. That said, its speeds are unexpectedly poor, there are no mobile apps, and lacks details on its no-logging policy, all of which makes the VPN upper crust such as ExpressVPN look a lot better in comparison."
