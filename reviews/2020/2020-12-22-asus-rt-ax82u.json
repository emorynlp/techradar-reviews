  "summary": "Strong performance, versatile controls and competitive price",
  "verdict": "The RT-AX82U ticks a lot of boxes. Its strong Wi-Fi 6 performance is ideal for gaming, video and music streaming, but doesn\u2019t cost a fortune. The Asus app is quick and easy for newcomers to use, and provides good parental controls and security features. And, for gamers and more advanced users, there\u2019s a powerful web browser interface available too.",

    "Asus has a very extensive range of networking products, which includes its specialist Republic of Gamers (RoG) brand that offers seriously high-end gaming products, such as its Rapture router, which pushes the envelope at close to $530/\u00a3400/AU$700.",
    "The Asus RT-AX82U isn\u2019t in quite the same league, but this dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router is still far faster than conventional 802.11ac routers and is designed to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, as well as providing additional features for busy households that need fast and reliable Wi-Fi.",
    "You can\u2019t buy the RT-AX82U direct from Asus, and the online pricing seems to be somewhat inconsistent, but Asus says the RRP is \u00a3180 ($230/AU$310), so it\u2019s worth taking the time to shop around before buying.",
    "Asus has clearly got its eye on the latest gaming consoles and mobile devices that support Wi-Fi 6, but that\u2019s still a competitive price for a next-gen router such as this, making the RT-AX82U an affordable upgrade even for non-gamers.",
    "And, of course, new Wi-Fi 6 routers are also compatible with older devices that still use the 802.11ac version of Wi-Fi, so you don\u2019t have to worry about compatibility problems if you decide to upgrade your router.",
    "It may not fall under the Republic of Gamers banner, but the Asus RT-AX82U has certainly got the right look for a gaming router, with a low-profile, sharply angular design and four large antennae stabbing out from the back panel. And, on the front panel, there\u2019s a pair of \u2018eyes\u2019 - two small LED panels that glow with smouldering colours. You can even use the Asus app to choose a variety of \u2018auras\u2019 that strobe through different colour sequences.",
    "Gaming gimmickry aside, the RT-AX82U gets all the basics right, offering dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (aka 802.11ax) with a top speed of 5400Mbps (5.4Gbps).",
    "There are faster Wi-Fi 6 routers - including the RoG Rapture which boasts a massive 11Gbps - but that\u2019s a good speed for a router in this price range. The RT-AX82U doesn\u2019t include a modem, so it provides a dedicated Gigabit Ethernet port for connecting to your existing modem or router in order to use your broadband connection.",
    "There are also four additional Gigabit Ethernet ports for devices, such as a games console or a smart-TV, that work better with a lag-free wired connection, with one of those being designated as the \u2018gaming port and taking priority over devices connected to the other Ethernet ports. And, finally, there\u2019s a single USB 3.1 port for sharing a USB storage device on your home network.",
    "The Asus RT-AX82U strikes a good balance between ease-of-use for beginners, and advanced features for gamers and more experienced users.",
    "The printed manual included in the box gives you two options for setting the router up, with the quick and easy option being the Asus Router app for iOS and Android devices, while a more advanced web browser interface is also available for people who don\u2019t mind delving more deeply into their wi-fi and network settings.",
    "We started with the Asus Router app and were pleased to see that it starts by giving you the option of setting up separate networks on the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands, or merging the two bands together into a single network.",
    "The only minor oddity here is that the router\u2019s default Wi-Fi network isn\u2019t initially protected by a password, so you need to move through the set-up process and assign a password fairly quickly in order to keep your new network secure.",
    "Most people will find that the basic app provides all the features they need, including the ability to set up a guest network, and extensive parental controls that include content filters for a wide range of unsuitable material.",
    "There\u2019s also a security feature called AiProtection that monitors your network for malware and hacking attempts from malicious web sites - and, thankfully, this doesn\u2019t require an additional subscription as some routers do.",
    "The Asus Router app provides a Mobile Gaming mode that prioritises mobile devices for maximum performance, but you can also select specific tasks, such as video streaming, that you might want to prioritise as well. And, if you\u2019re prepared to delve into the web browser interface, you can select other devices for gaming priority, and even use that USB port to set up a hard drive for Time Machine back-ups on a Mac.",
    "Performance is also very strong for a mid-price router such as this. Devices in the same room as the Asus RT-AX82U managed to coax our normal 100Mbps broadband connection up to 103Mbps using the Ookla speed test on both the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands, with Steam downloads also impressively steady at 12.5MB/s on both bands.",
    "Moving further away to a back office didn\u2019t faze the RT-AX82U either, with the 5.0GHz band having no trouble maintaining those speeds, while the slower 2.4GHz band dipped only slightly to 98Mbs on Ookla and 11.7MB/s for Steam downloads.",
    "It\u2019s hard to fault that sort of performance at this price, and with the Asus app and browser interface providing versatile features and controls that are suitable for both gamers and non-gamers, the Asus RT-AX82U is an excellent option for any household that needs a fast and affordable Wi-Fi upgrade."
