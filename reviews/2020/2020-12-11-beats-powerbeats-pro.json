    "The Beats Powerbeats Pro are the next logical step for Apple's series of workout-focused headphones \u2013 true wireless earbuds are the way of the future, and since the launch of the Powerbeats Pro, Apple has expanded its output to include the noise-cancelling AirPods Pro.",
    "While Apple could've churned out a half-decent, sweat-resistant pair of wireless earbuds and called it a day, the Powerbeats Pro are something special \u2013 they\u2019re supremely comfortable, sound decent and seem to never, ever fall out.",
    "They might not be the best true wireless earbuds in Apple's audio arsenal now that the AirPods Pro are here, but they are Apple\u2019s most premium play into the world of running headphones, and are the buds we'd recommend to most workout enthusiasts.",
    "[Update: Apple has released four new colors for the Beats Powerbeats Pro \u2013 exactly one year after the true wireless earbuds were first launched. Among the new color options are pink, red, blue and yellow \u2013 all of which are a bit more vibrant than the four initial colorways that came out at launch.",
    "Meanwhile, we're still waiting for news of the Powerbeats Pro 2 \u2013 the rumored second generation of the Beats earbuds.]",
    "The Powerbeats Pro will set you back $249 / \u00a3219 / AU$349 / AED 949. They\u2019ll be available in four colors \u2013 Black, Ivory, Moss, and Navy \u2013 all of which come with a matching charging case.",
    "For comparison that\u2019s a significant jump in price compared to the Apple AirPods, currently on sale for $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249 / AED 679, and far more expensive than the basic Powerbeats 3 that can usually be found online for under $100/\u00a3100.",
    "Still, what you're getting with the Powerbeats Pro is the significantly improved design, new H1 Chip and a better sound quality than the Powerbeats 3.",
    "In terms of design, there\u2019s a lot to like about the new Powerbeats Pro - it has a sport look to it, while still being practical enough to wear around outside the gym.",
    "On each of the two earbuds the Powerbeats Pro have a center playback control button where the Beats logo is, plus a volume rocker. That means you can control your music with whichever hand is free, which is a nice feature. (Of course, if you have Hey Siri enabled, you can simply say the wake word with a voice command for the same effect.)",
    "It also helps that the Pro is extremely comfortable, and not just in terms of how it fits in and around the ear, but also in terms of how it feels when you\u2019re listening to music.",
    "If you\u2019ve used other true wireless headphones in the past, you might recall feeling a sort of in-ear pressure while listening to music. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve certainly felt while listening to other workout earbuds like the Jaybird X4, but that uncomfortable pressure simply doesn\u2019t exist with the Powerbeats Pro. That\u2019s because of a micro-laser barometric venting hole in the front chamber that, in Apple\u2019s own words, reduces pressure in the ear and improves the bass response\u2026 not that Beats headphones needs any help with bass levels.",
    "Another factor that contributes to the excellent fit is how slim the nozzle of the earbuds are - it\u2019s smaller than a lot of other true wireless earbuds on the market and with four different ear tip options, there are still plenty of ways to get that perfect seal.",
    "One issue with the Powerbeats Pro's design is that they do jut out of the ears a bit, and don\u2019t have quite the same low-profile look as the Apple AirPods. This is also kind of an issue if you want to wear headphones to bed, as when you lay down with them in your ear, it pushes them uncomfortably far into the ear canal.",
    "The other issue, and it\u2019s something other reviewers harped on as well, is that the Powerbeats\u2019 case is enormous. It\u2019s the kind of thing that looks awkward in your gym shorts and can be a hassle to carry around in your pockets. It feels like the only place the headphone case belongs is in your gym bag or locker, and that\u2019s kind of disappointing if you want to wear the Pro while you work at the office.",
    "Apple\u2019s rebuttal to that statement is that the Powerbeats can last up to nine hours in between charges and store about two charges in the case. When you combine those numbers, Apple claims the Powerbeats Pro have a 24-hour battery and should last a few days between charges - a claim to be fairly accurate during testing, getting two and a half charges from the case with about eight-or-so hours of use per charge.",
    "Unfortunately, however, if you want wireless charging, you won\u2019t find it here. If you want to stay within the Apple family, only the latest versions of the AirPods have that feature so, for now, you\u2019ll still have to use a lightning cable to charge the case every few days.",
    "Like other AirPod products, the Powerbeats Pro are the most at home when paired with other Apple devices. On iOS, pairing up the Powerbeats Pro is as simple as opening the case near your iPhone or iPad. Two touches later and your devices are synced.",
    "As with the AirPods, you can then open the case to see how much battery life is left on your iOS device, and that helps further their space-age feel. (It would\u2019ve been nice to see their battery life in the top-right corner of the home screen like we\u2019ve seen with other true wireless earbuds, but that\u2019s not a dealbreaker.)",
    "That said, the Powerbeats Pro aren\u2019t Apple-exclusive and will work with Android and Windows 10 devices - all you need to do is hold the pairing button inside the charging case and select the Powerbeats Pro on the device you want to pair. There\u2019s almost no difference in sound quality that we could hear between a paired iOS device (our iPhone 8) and a paired Android device (our Google Pixel 3a XL), as both connections use Bluetooth 5.0.",
    "One of the key reasons you\u2019d want to use an Apple device is to take advantage of the new H1 Wireless Chip, the same one that just went into the Apple AirPods. With it, you\u2019ll notice faster pairing times and hands-free Siri. You can certainly survive without those features, obviously, but hands-free Siri is a spectacularly useful feature if you want to place calls or send texts without picking up your phone.",
    "Staying in your ear and connecting to your devices seamlessly is table stakes in this category. What really matters is how good they sound when you\u2019re moving - an area that a lot of popular earbuds don\u2019t really master.",
    "The good news is that the Powerbeats sound good both during a workout and during your time away from the gym. Yes, there\u2019s a slight flimsiness to the sound if you take a critical ear to it - but it\u2019s not the kind of thing you notice during your workout.",
    "Over the course of a few weeks we listened to a number of genres and found that, like you\u2019d expect, the Beats brand still caters to EDM, R&B and rap, and can now play most crunchy rock and alternative with some authority.",
    "What\u2019s more surprising is that the Powerbeats Pro have really turned down the bass this time around. They\u2019re not quite at a flat EQ, but it\u2019s like a gentle v-shape that boosts the highs and lows with a slight recess on the mids. It\u2019s a smooth curve that music sounds reasonably energetic, but not too slanted that movies and shows are unwatchable. In fact, even movies like Thor Raganarok sounded absolutely fine with them.",
    "The problem here, however, is that music - and audio as a whole - is relatively subjective. Our preferences for an EQ curve aren\u2019t going to be your tastes, and Apple doesn\u2019t provide you any tools to alter the sound. That can be frustrating if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re hearing enough mids when you\u2019re watching a movie and worse, if you feel like your music is missing some sparkle in the upper register. As of now, there\u2019s no way to add any of that back in.",
    "You\u2019ll also be made frustratingly aware of all these issues when you take the Powerbeats Pro with you on any form of public transit - for all its other features, the Powerbeats Pro still don\u2019t offer noise-cancellation. Even worse, however, is that they don\u2019t block sound out very well either (what we call passive noise-isolation) - so, unless you blast your music at uncomfortable levels, expect to hear everything going on around you.",
    "An even more practical issue people might have with the Powerbeats is that they\u2019re only IPX4 splash-resistant. This means they can take a bit of sweat, maybe an accidental splash from a water bottle or someone jumping in the pool, but they\u2019re not water-proof. That means you need to be careful if you bring these with you to the beach and you should keep them as far away as you can from a pool party - if they stay submerged for more than a few seconds, they probably won\u2019t ever work the same.",
    "Where we found the Powerbeats Pro to perform their best is in a near-quiet environment, like your office, your home or your gym - because you can use hands-free Siri, they\u2019re great for setting timers in between sets and placing calls to friends and clients. And, because they\u2019re so comfortable in the ear and last around eight hours between charges, you can wear them around the house for hours without issue - making them a decent everyday headphone and the one we\u2019d go for if we needed to make a call or listen to Spotify on our phone.",
    "To keep the music going, in between sessions we\u2019d pop the earbuds back into their case and they\u2019d be ready to go and fully charged within an hour and a half.",
    "Ultimately, while the Powerbeats Pro impressed us, they\u2019re simply not the best true wireless earbuds on the market. These earbuds still aren\u2019t noise-cancelling like the AirPods Pro, nor are they water-proof like the Jaybird Run XT, nor do they sound as good as the Sony WF-1000XM3 \u2013 our favorite true wireless earbuds at the moment.",
    "That said, however, they are - in our opinion - Apple\u2019s best workout earbuds to date thanks to small additions like the earhooks, pressure-reducing micro-laser barometric venting hole, their longer battery life and superior sound quality.",
    "To that end, buy these earbuds if you\u2019re an Apple-loving gym-goer who can appreciate better-sounding music and features like hands-free Hey Siri, and don\u2019t mind paying a bit more for those things."
