  "author": "kevin-lee",
  "summary": "An impressive graphics card for a king\u2019s ransom",
  "verdict": "It doesn't reach the heights of the RTX 2080 Ti, but Nvidia\u2019s high-end Turing RTX GPU comes damn close to achieving 4K 60fps gaming for a mildly steep price.",
  "pros": [
    "Impressively improved gaming frame rates",
    "The second most performant GPU in the world",
    "Super simple overclocking"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Nvidia\u2019s most expensive xx80 card yet",
    "Dips under 60 fps with some 4K games",
    "More power demanding"
  ],

    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 may no longer be the flagship GPU du jour, with RTX 3080 just announced at Nvidia\u2019s September 1 event. However, it still very much holds its own in a souped up gaming rig, and is one of the most powerful gaming cards, especially in the RTX line.",
    "This Turing card\u2019s performance still justifies its relatively high price and is only slightly limited next to its more powerful siblings and rivals on our best graphics cards list. So, unless you need 4K 60fps performance, you can skip the RTX 2080 Ti for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080.",
    "And, while the GPU has been discontinued in favor of its refreshed successor, the RTX 2080 Super, it\u2019s still available through some retailers. In fact, with the RTX 3000 slated for release on September 17, you can probably expect some deals on the RTX 2080\u2019s floating around.",
    "Just when we were getting over the $549 (\u00a3469, AU$925) Nvidia GTX 1080 being noticeably more expensive than its predecessor, the Nvidia RTX 2080 hit the streets with an even higher $799 (\u00a3749, AU$1,199) price.",
    "Bear in mind this is the price of Nvidia RTX 2080 Founders Edition, which are high-end versions of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, and it\u2019s also slightly dropped in price, now setting you back $719 (about \u00a3570, AU$1030). Additionally, you\u2019ll find third-party models that start at a slightly lower $699 (\u00a3749, AU$1,199) price.",
    "Still, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 gets yet another massive increase in price over previous generations of graphics cards. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when the GTX 1080 Ti cost just as much at $699 (\u00a3669, AU$1,129). With this latest series of Nvidia GeForce graphics cards, it seems Team Green is trying to up the cost of its graphics cards to be more premium than in prior years.",
    "If you\u2019re seeking a high end graphics card that\u2019ll cost less than $500, you\u2019re stuck with the $399 (about 320, AU$570) Radeon RX Vega 64. AMD\u2019s highest-end Vega graphics card is getting long in the tooth after a year. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Team Red is gearing up to unleash its AMD Navi cards, which have a couple of under $500 options.",
    "However, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 is everywhere, with plenty of stock in most online stores. In fact, there are so many of them out there that you can expect some deals.",
    "Spec for spec, the RTX 2080 is a step up from its predecessors in every way, packing more CUDA cores, faster GDDR6 video memory and even the first very 90Mhz factory overclock on Nvidia\u2019s Founders Edition cards.",
    "Additionally, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 introduces a new set of 46 RT Cores and 468 Tensor Cores, which play a hand in rendering real-time ray tracing and artificial intelligence-powered computations.",
    "Both features are unique to Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards, but you\u2019ll probably notice the immediate effects RT Cores and Nvidia RTX brings as it transforms puddles, glass and other reflective surfaces into mirrors for the first time in video games.",
    "Tensor Cores are also impressive too. By introducing AI into mainstream graphics cards, Nvidia claims all Turing-based GPUs will be able to process anti-aliasing eight times faster. The RTX 2080 can also tap into a new Deep Learning Super Sampling feature that\u2019s much more efficient at applying super sampling and anti-aliasing at the same time.",
    "Those AI-injected Tensor Cores are also pivotal for Nvidia\u2019s new super-simple overclocking features.",
    "Popular overclocking apps like EVGA Precision X1 and MSI Afterburner have released beta builds that integrate this new NV Scanner API, which essentially tweaks your GPU up a precise micro-voltage curve and tests for stable overclock speeds and voltages.",
    "The new test basically takes out all the guesswork out of maximizing the performance of your GPU, and it's one of the unique features we love about the new Turing series.",
    "The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 is, without a doubt, more expensive than its predecessor. Luckily, it is powerful enough to make the price bump less egregious. The new GPU is a considerably better performer than the GTX 1080 with remarkably higher benchmark scores that even beat the GTX 1080 Ti and Titan Xp.",
    "The RTX 2080 isn\u2019t quite as powerful as the RTX 2080 Ti, but you won\u2019t find any other mainstream graphics cards as powerful as the 2080.",
    "In games, you\u2019ll witness an even bigger jump in performance if you choose to pick up this new RTX graphics card. 1080p gaming results show a 20-40 fps jump in frame rates. Meanwhile, at 4K the Nvidia RTX 2080 is hitting as high as 60 fps, and that\u2019s damn impressive.",
    "Outside of our benchmark tests, the Nvidia RTX 2080 also managed to achieve 40 fps while playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4K and the highest settings available. Destiny 2 delivered even better numbers with a frame rate hovering between 60-75 fps, once again at 4K and Ultra settings, not to mention HDR turned on.",
    "If you\u2019re prepared to hand over the kingly sum of $719 (about \u00a3570, AU$1030) that this graphics card demands, you won\u2019t come away disappointed. Other than the Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti, there isn\u2019t another graphics card faster than this currently, or one that could possibly deliver a 4K 60 fps gaming experience all on its own.",
    "But even then, the RTX 2080 is cutting it close to delivering that sacred, silky-smooth frame rate at Ultra-HD resolutions. If you don\u2019t want to deal with compromises, toning down your settings and splurging even more, you\u2019d be much better off going with the top-end Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti.",
    "We\u2019d personally go for the Nvidia RTX 2080 as its still hitting that sweet spot of performance to price, even if you have to save up a little more or swallow an extra credit card payment to pay it off.",
