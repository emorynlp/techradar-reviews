    "The 12-inch MacBook has certainly come a long way since its humble beginnings. What was once the budget alternative for the more powerful and more expensive MacBook Pro has evolved into one of Apple\u2019s most svelte offerings to date. After a four-year hiatus, Apple reintroduced it in 2015 as Apple\u2019s thinnest and lightest laptop, touting a 12-inch chassis and a higher price.",
    "Its reinvention only established it as an ultrabook that pushed the limits of how thin one could go instead \u2013 an achievement that the MacBook (2017) has proven to be more than just a fluke. This 2017 addition to the line brings back that svelte design alongside a few vital updates: namely, a stunning Retina display and even more powerful internals. Though unfortunately, it also comes with a higher price tag, putting it somewhere between the 2017 MacBook Air and the Touch Bar-less MacBook Pro in regards to price.",
    "The 12-inch MacBook (2017) has become the go-to for those who place a premium on thin and light design, as well as want access to the Apple ecosystem. Even now that it\u2019s been discontinued, it\u2019s still sought after. Only now, you can have its svelte, brushed aluminum Apple ultrabook form factor at a much lower price than ever before.",
    "Unfortunately, the MacBook is no longer available at Apple\u2019s online store, on the account of it being discontinued. Luckily, you should still be able to find the MacBook we reviewed here from third-party sellers for $1,299 (\u00a31,249, AU$1,899) or possibly less. That price tag should get you everything found under our hot pink spec sheet.",
    "For now, should your lavish taste or exacting needs require a more powerful 12-inch MacBook, there should still be more powerful configurations on hand. You\u2019ll just have to look harder for them.",
    "For example, you might be able to find a MacBook with an Intel Core i5-7Y54 and 512GB of SSD storage instead of the base model\u2019s 256GB. It\u2019s still going to be fanless, so it still wouldn\u2019t be as powerful as something like the MacBook Pro, but it will definitely offer a boost in power. Just keep in mind that with great power comes great price tags, and this more powerful MacBook will cost $1,599 (\u00a31,549, AU$2,349).",
    "If you want to max out the Apple MacBook, it\u2019ll set you back an exorbitant $1,949 (\u00a31,864, AU$2,909) for an Intel Core i7-7Y75, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe SSD.",
    "Keep in mind, though, that these processors are a bit out-of-date in 2019, what with both 8th-generation and 9th-generation chips now powering many laptops. If you want the latest fanless silicon, the refreshed and cheaper Apple MacBook Air (2019) might be a more ideal option for you.",
    "If you\u2019re shopping around for a Windows laptop with comparable specs, take a look at the Acer Swift 7, an Ultrabook that\u2019s designed to compete with the 12-inch MacBook. Currently, it starts out at $1,699 (\u00a31,499, about AU$1,200) for a similar Intel Core i7 Y-series processor, but with 8GB RAM and 256 GB SSD storage. You do get a Full HD, 14-inch display, however.",
    "On the Chrome OS side, there\u2019s Google\u2019s older flagship Chromebook, the Pixelbook, starting at $999 (\u00a3999, AU$791) with a more powerful Intel Core i5 CPU and the same RAM, but half as much SSD space as the top-end MacBook.",
    "The Apple MacBook 2017\u2019s look and feel hasn\u2019t been altered much \u2013 if at all \u2013 over the 2016 model. That\u2019s not automatically a bad thing. Coming in Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold, the brushed aluminum feels just as cool and elegant as ever, which we appreciate.",
    "The MacBook\u2019s thin chassis and feathery weight is also as impressive as usual, impressive enough that its dimensions are one of its biggest selling points.",
    "Although it must be said that an even thinner screen bezel or one extra USB-C port would have been amazing at this point.",
    "One key advantage the MacBook 2017 has over the 2015 and 2016 models is the enhanced, second-generation butterfly switches that make up its new backlit keyboard. Travel isn\u2019t any deeper, but feedback is more forceful, which allows for a typing experience that\u2019s significantly more satisfying \u2013 not to mention, more comfortable.",
    "The MacBook\u2019s wide, glass-coated trackpad remains the same as last year\u2019s, which just means it\u2019s just as enjoyable to use as it\u2019s ever been. Apple\u2019s touch interface tech through both software and hardware stays practically unrivaled.",
    "\u2018Practically\u2019 being the operative word here, because Google may have already caught up to Apple with its Pixelbook. Frankly, the keyboard and trackpad on that thing are ones to be equaled.",
    "It\u2019s general knowledge by now that Apple has made a name for itself by designing superb displays \u2013 among other things, that is \u2013 and the 12-inch MacBook\u2019s display steadfastly follows this tradition, remaining unchanged since its release in 2015. Editing photos and tackling graphically intensive workloads looks flawless on that Retina display, even though it\u2019s not exactly the sharpest screen in school anymore.",
    "The MacBook\u2019s 16:10 aspect ratio, however, may just be uncommon enough to be infuriating sometimes \u2013 like while watching movies or editing images that are formatted to 16:9 in Fullscreen mode, for example.",
    "When it comes to sound quality, the MacBook can without a doubt pump out some loud tunes with its four stereo speakers near the hinge. However, like all notebooks with mere millimeters to work with as audio chambers, the sound can be a bit thin and tinny, with some channels in songs simply disappearing altogether.",
    "To be fair, you\u2019re not going to get much better audio from any laptop near this thin. And, Apple may have been aware of this, since it still kept the headphone jack in the MacBook.",
