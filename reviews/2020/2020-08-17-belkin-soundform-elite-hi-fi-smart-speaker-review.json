  "verdict": "Despite Devialet engineering onboard, the Belkin SoundForm Elite Hi-Fi smart speaker doesn't sound good enough to justify its high price tag. That's a shame, as its wireless charging station is genuinely useful.",

    "Packing Devialet sound engineering, a built-in wireless charging pad and the Google Assistant voice helper, the Belkin SoundForm Elite Hi-Fi smart speaker seems like the perfect bedside companion on paper. And it\u2019s certainly useful, charging your phone effortlessly and speedily, controlling smart home devices and music playback, and offering more volume and bass than a speaker this size has any right to.",
    "However, while its brain is smart, its musicality is flat. Bass overwhelms, highs screech, and the midrange is flattened. This would be acceptable for a speaker half the price, but Belkin\u2019s put a prohibitively high price tag on this, meaning there are smarter options out there for the savvy buyer \u2013 providing the nifty built-in charger isn\u2019t essential.",
    "The Belkin SoundForm Elite costs $299.99 / \u00a3279.99 (about AU$420). Though it\u2019s packing in a lot of connectivity, and audio support from premium maestros Devialet, the Belkin SoundForm Elite does nothing better than the $199.99 /\u00a3189.99 Amazon Echo Studio does, aside from having a built-in wireless fast charger. It\u2019s a neat extra, and has taken some clever engineering to pull off, but simply can\u2019t justify that added expense.",
    "Belkin\u2019s SoundForm Elite looks a bit like a black egg with a diagonal slice taken out of the top of it \u2013 or a gray egg, if you go for the alternate colorway. And it\u2019s a good looking egg! With a wraparound fabric cover, and five touch-sensitive buttons on its front cutaway, it makes good use of its small size (162mm x 162mm x 168mm) by accommodating a wireless charging cradle for smartphones to sit on.",
    "A single port for the included power cable and pack sits recessed on the rear of the SoundForm Elite, so if you were hoping to hook up an audio device over a 3.5mm jack, you\u2019re out of luck. This is a strictly Bluetooth or web-based affair, making use of Bluetooth 5.0 and Wifi 802.11b/g/n/ac (2.4GHz/5GHz), with set-up carried out with the Google Home app for Android and iOS. Though 5GHz networking is supported, it\u2019s worth pointing out that I had trouble setting up the Belkin SoundForm Elite unless I jumped to my 2.4GHz channel.",
    "Two far-field microphone holes sit either side of the touch sensitive buttons \u2013 Bluetooth, volume down, play/pause, volume up and mic mute, in that order. It\u2019s a bit difficult to see the icons for each button, as well as where one starts and the other ends, so you\u2019d do well to learn each position.",
    "Pop your phone on the Devialet logo on the speaker\u2019s slanted side, and if it supports wireless charging, it\u2019ll automatically start juicing up your device. It\u2019s a 10W peak charger, and filled a Google Pixel 3XL nice and speedily \u2013 though performance will of course vary based on the battery capacity of your phone and the charging speed it supports. It\u2019s a nice addition and makes for a very nice bedside companion as a result, with the slanted cradle set at a good angle for seeing your phone\u2019s sleep screen at a glance.",
    "Once everything is set up in the Google Home app, the Google Assistant takes over the heavy lifting. Waking the SoundForm Elite with the \u2018OK Google\u2019 wake word, you can then have it play tracks from your favored streaming service of choice, have it control smart home gadgets like smart lights, set reminders, check calendars, double check facts and much more.",
    "While we still personally prefer Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Google Assistant remains an excellent smart helper, and works well on the Belkin SoundForm Elite. The speaker\u2019s microphones are responsive, and relatively good at listening for the trigger phrase even when the music is blasting out at higher volume levels.",
    "With its 35mm full range driver and 2x 70mm woofer configuration, the Belkin SoundForm Elite makes quite a startling first impression. For a small speaker, with a form factor best suited for a bedside table thanks to its charging support, this thing goes REALLY loud. You\u2019ll wonder where all that oomph is coming from.",
    "Part of the power derives from Devialet\u2019s smart \u2018Push-Push\u2019 woofer configuration, using a dual driver array to really move the air and get those low end sounds cranking out. The smart thing about the \u2018Push-Push\u2019 system is that it reduces vibrations from the speaker itself, allowing for a clearer, more responsive bass sound. It serves a dual purpose here, in that the reduced low-frequency vibrations won\u2019t disturb the contact point for the wireless charging system.",
    "But while the bass impresses, the rest of the sound feels squashed by comparison. There\u2019s some sparkle to the highs, but the midrange feels flat and distant. While you may be awed by the bass kick in Daft Punk\u2019s Phoenix, aim for something a little more subtle like the piano lines that underscore Waxahatchee\u2019s Oxbow from recent album Saint Cloud, and everything feels a bit off. The presence of bass is strong, and the shimmer of drum crashes ring true, but everything in between feels a little bit lost. Considering Devialet\u2019s pedigree, and the cost of the Belkin SoundForm Elite, it\u2019s more than a bit disappointing."
