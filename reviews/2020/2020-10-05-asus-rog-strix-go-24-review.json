    "Most headsets these days want you to look like the Las Vegas strip while wearing them \u2013 all flashy lights and glowing logos. The Asus ROG Strix Go 2.4 wireless gaming headset is a far more laid back affair. With its comfortable fit, light weight and generous leather padding, these are stylish cans you can happily walk down the street in, free from the gaudy sparkles of their RGB rivals.",
    "The Asus ROG Strix Go 2.4 makes a good account of itself in terms of core specs too. A wireless USB-C adapter lets you connect to everything from a PC to a Nintendo Switch without the need for a cable (with 35 hours of battery from a single charge), with a 3.5mm option to fall back on when needed. They also support Hi-Res audio formats, and come with an \u2018AI noise-cancelling\u2019 dual microphone \u2013 not to mention the convenience of a built in mic that still works when you\u2019ve removed the detachable boom component.",
    "It\u2019s a pity then, with so much going for them, that the Asus ROG Strix Go 2.4 sounds merely good, and not great. They offer a full sound, but detail can be lacking, and we experienced significant distracting hiss and interference when using them wirelessly, enough to sully their otherwise considerable strong points. The fact that its awkwardly shaped USB adapter will likely cause issues with your console or PC\u2019s neighbouring ports too doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, either.",
    "The ASUS ROG Strix Go 2.4 has an RRP of $199, but we\u2019re currently seeing its price hover close to the $150 / \u00a3120 / AU$210 mark. At that price it\u2019s quite good value given its premium design and feature set \u2013 but be aware there are much better sounding options out there.",
    "With a restrained look, the industrial design of the Asus ROG Strix Go 2.4 is by far the headset\u2019s strong point. Where other headsets are all about peacocking with RGB lighting arrays, this Asus set keeps things simple, looking more like an everyday (and premium, at that) pair of Bluetooth over-ear cans.",
    "On the end of a liberally-padded, foldable and fully-adjustable metal bar sits the headset\u2019s two oval-shaped earcups. It\u2019s unusual to see this shape used in gaming headsets, which usually are larger and rounder, but this is a discreet styling more akin to the Sony WH-1000XM4 models, and all the better for it. You won\u2019t turn heads in the street wearing them, and that\u2019s a good thing, with just a small silver ROG logo and imprinted stamp on the outside of the cups giving away their gaming affiliation. A leather carrying case, charging cable and 3.5mm braided cable finishes off the well-presented package.",
    "Light at 290g, you can comfortably sit wearing the headset for long stretches of time, with memory foam padding keeping the clamp effect from squeezing too hard. Playback controls and a volume rocker / mic mute button sit on the left cup, along with the built-in mic and space for the boom mic. Finally, there\u2019s a wireless / wired mode toggle \u2013 which, annoyingly, needs to be manually used when you\u2019re going from one state to the other. The charging port sits alone on the right ear cup.",
    "Inside, you\u2019re getting Asus\u2019s 40m \u201cEssence\u201d neodymium driver system. It\u2019s tuned more to mid-range sounds than over gaming headsets usually go for \u2013 for better and worse, as we\u2019ll discuss shortly. A wide 40,000KHz frequency range for Hi-Res audio playback is hit when using a wired connection from the left cup\u2019s 3.5mm jack port, but you\u2019re down to a more standard 20,000KHz when you\u2019re using the USB-C wireless module.",
    "That wireless dongle gives a key advantage to the Asus headset many others lack \u2013 it\u2019ll work right out of the box with an undocked Nintendo Switch, which can be a pain to find wireless headsets for. Note there\u2019s also a regular USB converter in the box for using with a PC or console that doesn\u2019t have the newest USB-C standard. The USB-C dongle is a funny shape \u2013 a bit like a chunky \u2018L\u2019 Tetris block, which could potentially cause problems if your ports are bunched closely together.",
    "It\u2019s a shame then that audio performance from the Asus ROG Strix Go 2.4 is quite a mixed bag. It\u2019s at its best when hooked up to your Hi Res-enabled mobile music player over the 3.5mm cable, as that\u2019s when it\u2019s able to make use of its 40,000KHz frequency range to the max.",
    "The mid-range focus of the drivers is unusual in gaming headset terms. It\u2019s great for following in-game dialogue, but if you\u2019re into action packed, explosive titles, the lack of a power in the bottom end can make scenes seem a bit weak. On the other hand, music-focussed games, especially those with synth soundtracks like Beat Saber or Sayonara Wildhearts sounded great. It\u2019s just not a great all-rounder, if you\u2019d rather be playing COD: Warzone, for instance. Virtualized surround sound, likewise, doesn\u2019t convince \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy trick to pull off successfully, and Asus isn\u2019t any worse than the majority of manufacturers attempting to trick your ears that there is sound coming from multiple locations around your head. But it doesn\u2019t raise the bar, either.",
    "Asus does allow for some considerable tinkering though through its Crate and Armoury apps. Here you\u2019ll be able to tweak the equalizer settings and virtual surround profile. While it can\u2019t remove the issues above, it does let you tailor the output in a meaningful way to suit your tastes, within the limitations of the headset itself.",
    "More troubling was the continued hiss we experienced routinely throughout testing. It wasn\u2019t noticed when using the wired connection, but any time wireless playback was active, there was a low hiss behind all the action. It may have been interference unique to my set-up, but it\u2019s not a problem I\u2019ve experienced with other wireless headsets, so was worth noting. It\u2019s volume wasn\u2019t loud enough to be game-breaking, but it was certainly distracting.",
    "The ASUS ROG Strix Go 2.4 isn\u2019t without benefits in the performance stakes though. Its battery life is superb at about 25 hours, giving me the confidence to take it out for a walk around the block listening to my tunes, knowing there\u2019d be enough juice in the tank for a gaming session whenI got home. And the headset\u2019s two microphone options (boom on or off, using the built in option) were great too \u2013 speech was conveyed with clarity to my teammates and friends. The built-in mic was usually clear enough to forego the boom entirely. It\u2019s this kind of convenience that makes me really want to love the Asus ROG Strix Go 2.4, but the audio performance is just too patchy to fully recommend."
