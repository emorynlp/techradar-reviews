    "23andMe is a brand that has quickly become synonymous with DNA testing. With more than 10 million users it\u2019s one of the most popular DNA test kits on the market. This is good, the more people in 23andMe\u2019s system, the better many of the ancestry results are likely to be \u2013 and the more relatives you can connect with.",
    "Unlike some other DNA tests on the market, 23andMe offers up a huge amount of insights about both your ancestry, including your genetic ethnicity and relatives, and your health, which includes genetic health risks. Not only are all of these results detailed, but they\u2019re easy-to-understand as well, thanks to a great user interface.",
    "Here\u2019s our experience with 23andMe DNA testing, including picking the right DNA test, sending in a sample of your DNA, and finding out the results a few weeks later",
    "There are two different types of 23andMe DNA test. The first one is Ancestry ($99/\u00a379, or around AU$145), which provides details about your ancestry composition (this means where in the world your ancestors are likely to have come from).",
    "It includes maternal and paternal haplogroups (different branches of ancestry from your motherline or fatherline), Neanderthal ancestry (what percentage of your DNA is likely to have come from a Neanderthal line) and information about your DNA relatives.",
    "The second type of 23andMe DNA test is Health and Ancestry ($199/\u00a3149, or around AU$300). This includes all of the information above from the Ancestry test, as well as health predisposition reports (these include data about predispositions to conditions including age-related macular degeneration and variants for breast, ovarian and other cancers).",
    "It also includes wellness reports (these tell you about your sleep, weight and muscle composition), traits reports (this is information about your hair, skin and tastes) and, finally, carrier status reports (these include results about whether you carry genes that could be responsible for conditions such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia).",
    "Whether or not you can access the full suite of DNA results may depend on where in the world you live and when you took the test. For example, recent users can now access data about their predisposition to type 2 diabetes, but if you took the test a few years ago you won't be able to see that data.",
    "The pricing of 23andMe\u2019s ancestry test is similar to other tests on the market. For example, AncestryDNA is also $99/\u00a379/AU$129 and MyHeritage is $79/\u00a375 (around AU$115) plus shipping.",
    "However, both of these brands tend to have regular discounts. For example, MyHeritage is currently available for \u00a359 in the UK. It\u2019s rare to find 23andMe discounted and usually only happens on Amazon Prime Day or other big sale events.",
    "When it comes to DNA tests that offer both ancestry and health information, 23andMe is one of the few that offers such a thorough set of results. However, MyHeritage has just added health testing too and a kit that does both costs $199/\u00a3179 (around AU$300) plus shipping.",
    "The 23andMe test arrives in a small box around 3 days after you\u2019ve ordered it \u2013 and everything you need to take the test is inside.",
    "Testing requires a saliva sample. You need to spit into a funnel \u2013 it can take a while to fill it up. Then you put a top onto the funnel, which releases a special liquid to preserve your DNA sample for testing.",
    "You then need to register your kit \u2013 there\u2019s a unique number on the box and on the tube \u2013 before you send it. This is really important, once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone, and your name isn\u2019t associated with your DNA sample.",
    "While you\u2019re registering, there are lots of questions you\u2019re asked to answer to make your results more relevant. However, many of the answers that were given ended up being presented in the results, so it felt like some of the answers were parroted back rather than obtained from the DNA sample.",
    "Once you\u2019ve registered your test and provided a sample, you need to secure it and send it \u2013 postage is part of the price of the test.",
    "We received a review sample of the 23andMe test, which means we can\u2019t comment on how long the results take \u2013 but according to 23andMe, they now take between 2 to 4 weeks.",
    "However, throughout the process, 23andMe will send emails, with the first acknowledging your sample has been received, and then another email is sent when it\u2019s being tested with a final email informing you when your results are in.",
    "The best thing about 23andMe in comparison to other DNA testing kits and services is the level of detail it offers up - there\u2019s a lot of information about you and your background to comb through.",
    "But what makes the service great to use is its dashboard. It\u2019s colorful, extremely easy to navigate and ensures that making sense of all the insights about your DNA is simple and even fun.",
    "The results you\u2019re presented with will depend on which test you went for. We had a Health and Ancestry test, which means the dashboard was divided up by those two sections.",
    "Click on the Ancestry section in the main menu on the dashboard and you\u2019re greeted with your Ancestry Overview. This is where your estimated genetic ethnicity is visualized in a number of different ways, including in a pie chart, showing the various percentages of ethnicity that make you, well, you!",
    "Click on this and you can then use an interactive map to see how your distant relatives may have been spread across the world.",
    "Click on a section or area and you\u2019ll be given even more detail. For example, our results showed that we have 14.9% French and German ancestry, but if we click into that section, we can see it\u2019s more specific to the Hauts-de-France area.",
    "You can also visualize this data on a timeline to see where these various ancestry details go back to. For example, according to 23andMe we have a small percentage of Scandinavian heritage, which dates back to 1810.",
    "You can also dig deeper and see how certain chromosomes are affected by your genetic ethnicity composition results. This is what we love about 23andMe - you can just look at a simple pie chart or start getting into the nitty-gritty of how your chromosomes are likely affected by your past.",
    "It\u2019s also here that you\u2019ll find information about how many Neanderthal variants you have in your DNA \u2013 and how you compare in this respect to most other people who have taken the test. For example, we have more Neanderthal variants than 84% of 23andMe customers.",
    "Because 23andMe examines mtDNA, which comes from your mother, and yDNA (if you were born male), you can get a good indication of your haplogroup from each side too. This is the group of humans you descended from that gives information about how your ancestors may have migrated.",
    "It\u2019s in the Ancestry section that you can also see your DNA Relatives. This is a huge database of people who share lots, or just some, of the same DNA as you. Of course, this will depend on who has taken the test.",
    "For example, our mum has, so she\u2019s our top match (obviously!) but below her there are 1,228 other DNA relatives, including a second cousin we didn\u2019t know about and many, many, many fifth cousins.",
    "The data you see about these DNA matches will largely depend on what they\u2019ve allowed you to see. For the purpose of this review, we decided to make most of our data available to anyone we're matched with, which includes a short bio and information about family background, as well as allowing sharing invitations from any matches too.",
    "You can then click onto people you\u2019re matched with and take a close look at how their data compares to yours. For example, doing this with our mum\u2019s DNA was fascinating, as we could see exactly which DNA segments we have in common.",
    "If you\u2019re connecting with a relative you\u2019ve never met before you can also send them a message and they can send you one \u2013 again, you can change these settings if you\u2019d rather keep things private.",
    "Next up, there\u2019s the Health section. This is where you\u2019ll find a number of personalized reports relating to your health. The most important thing to remember here is just because 23andMe flags that you could be a carrier for a certain genetic condition or you\u2019re predisposed to something health-wise, you won\u2019t necessarily have it and may never have it \u2013 and vice versa.",
    "There\u2019s a section called Health Disposition, which is where genetic factors have been found that could predispose you to certain conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and celiac disease. You\u2019ll be told whether no variants are detected or if there\u2019s an increased risk. Then, you can click on each condition to find out more about it and what predisposes you to it.",
    "Carrier Status is a section that\u2019s laid out in a similar way, but this explains your predisposition for carrying certain genes, which means they may not affect you, but you could pass them onto your children.",
    "There are then a range of other less serious, but still very interesting, results, about you and your personal traits. For example, we found that we're likely to be an early riser, have motion sickness and get freckles. Although it\u2019s cool to see all of this data written out, they are all things we could have told you already.",
    "Your experience with the Health section may vary, but some of the more serious conditions, like Alzheimer\u2019s or the likelihood you carry the BRCA1/BRCA2 variants that can be responsible for breast cancer, will be in a separate section you need to give your approval to \u2018unlock\u2019.",
    "We won\u2019t be delving into wider privacy issues for this review (check out our DNA testing guide for more on that), but it\u2019s worth mentioning that you do have plenty of control over your data with 23andMe. While you\u2019re registering the kit, you\u2019re asked to give various levels of consent to share, or not share, your data. Which you can then alter in the dashboard\u2019s settings once your results are in.",
    "The data sharing is a little confusing because there are a few different things going on and none of them are as clear as they could be. Firstly, you\u2019ll need to consider whether you want your DNA relatives to be able to see your details and send you sharing invitations \u2013 a must if you\u2019re keen to build your family tree, but you may not feel comfortable with this for whatever reason.",
    "There are then also permissions that need to be granted or denied about whether your data can be used for research purposes.",
    "For example, we liked the idea of our results being used as part of a wide group of results in big studies, but not the idea of our individual results being used \u2013 there\u2019s an option to switch either of these on or off after you\u2019re already opted in to general research consent.",
    "23andMe is one of the best DNA tests on the market right now. It offers detailed results about both ancestry and health in a way that\u2019s extremely easy to understand and navigate. Although health testing costs you extra, it\u2019s well worth it to get a deeper understanding of your DNA.",
    "It\u2019s one of the few companies that offers such a breadth of insights, including a lot of health information, details about your Neanderthal ancestry, and analysis of your motherline and fatherline. It's able to offer all this largely because it analyzes three different kinds of DNA.",
    "The main downside is that it\u2019s not cheap. But although 23andMe may be on the expensive side in comparison to some other DNA tests, which are often heavily discounted, it\u2019s worth it in our opinion.",
    "If you\u2019re only interested in genealogy it might be worth looking at some of 23andMe\u2019s competitors, especially AncestryDNA, which focuses specifically on genealogy and family tree building. But most people will find everything they need (and much, much more) from 23andMe.",
