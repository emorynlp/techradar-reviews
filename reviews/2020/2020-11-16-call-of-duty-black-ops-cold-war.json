  "verdict": "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a return to typical Treyarch form with a promising Zombies mode and old-school multiplayer outing, backed up by excellent visuals that make full use of the next-gen consoles. Especially with the handy immersion of the PS5's DualSense, this year's Call of Duty is well worth grabbing to flesh out your next-gen games collection. Just watch out for the mediocre campaign and some performance issues.",

    "Visuals take full advantage of next-gen power",
    "Addictive and immersive gunplay",
    "Old-school execution of Multiplayer and Zombies is fantastic"

  "cons": [
    "A cack-handed campaign that retreads old ground",

    "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has arrived right on time for the next-gen console launches, providing a reliable package of pristine shooter content for the multiplayer-loving masses. The question that remains is whether this year's Call of Duty is worth picking up right now with so many top-tier launch games on the market.",
    "With its appealing Warzone integration and the hotly anticipated return of Zombies, there\u2019s plenty here for every kind of returning player, but what about those consumers who are just looking for a solid shooter to play on their new device?",
    "We\u2019re going to run through all three of the game\u2019s major modes to give you an idea of what capers you\u2019re getting into when you pick up Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",
    "As you might expect from the marketing so far, Cold War\u2019s campaign is a real turn-your-brain-off, politically acerbic story. A deified Ronald Reagan provides a bunch of boneheaded operatives carte blanche to commit war crimes to protect \u201cthe free men and women of the world.\u201d You\u2019ve seen it all before, and you\u2019ll see it again. It\u2019s a far cry from last year\u2019s Modern Warfare, which at least tried to deal with its subject matter with some tact \u2014 even if its execution is debatable.",
    "You create your own character this time around, and you get to pick your gender and the tenets of your psychological profile, with choices like \u2018Tormented\u2019 providing you with double the lethal and tactical equipment because you always \u201cover prepare for a negative outcome.\u201d Edgy.",
    "There are some standout missions where the game flips the script and slows down the pace to create Hitman-esque stealth sequences, but the whole thing boils down into a popcorn action-movie of questionable ethics. Expect gruesome takedowns, rockets blowing up beautiful villages, cheesy mission codenames and helicopters exploding while you\u2019re in them. It\u2019s propaganda, but at least the 80s soundtrack is cool, and it doesn\u2019t drag on too long, clocking in at around six hours.",
    "There\u2019s enough variety in the mission locations and gameplay to keep you interested, and we enjoyed the fact you could collect evidence in the essential missions to complete optional puzzles that further contextualize the clandestine narrative. It was enough to make us break out a notepad, which is always a treat in a modern AAA game, where puzzles are usually liquidated.",
    "It looks fantastic too, especially at 60 fps in 4K on the PS5, with our old friend ray tracing working its lighting magic on the slick streets of Stasi-infested East Germany. Unfortunately, the late-game twists of the Cold War campaign were a predictable retread of old ground, but at the very least, they allowed for some mind-bending architectural feats that really made the most of the graphical power of the next-gen consoles.",
    "Black Ops Cold War\u2019s multiplayer mode is certainly the best part of the package, given the addictive nature of its back to basics style. It feels inherently old school, and bygone tactics like shotguns and snipers still pay off in dividends. The maps are tight and well-made but full of interactive elements, like zip lines that take you from boat to boat and rappels that let you surprise campers. The game\u2019s arsenal isn\u2019t bloated but it feels like there are still options for every kind of player, from sweaty SMGs to clinical three-round-burst rifles.",
    "Particularly on the PS5, this is where the DualSense shines. No conjecture, every gun does feel different thanks to the adaptive triggers. Ultimately this will be a marmite feature for Call of Duty veterans \u2014 we doubt pro players will endorse the extra hand-strain necessary to hold down a sniper trigger \u2014 but if you\u2019re not esports-ready and just looking for immersion, there\u2019s really nothing like it.",
    "We highly recommend you switch it on and try it out across your loadouts to experience vibrational variety. The crunch you feel when you fire a shotgun is awesome, as is feeling every spin of the helicopter blade as you peel through the game\u2019s lush environments. Swapping back to a last-generation controller on PC felt like a considerable step-down.",
    "Being able to hear enemy footsteps with 3D Audio is another fantastic boon \u2014 you really notice the extra effort that went into this game\u2019s superb sound design when you pull on a good pair of cans.",
    "We don\u2019t even mind the vehicles in the more open maps either, especially in game modes like Dirty Bomb where you can ride around at full speed, shotguns at the ready to take out fireteam squads and collect that precious Uranium. This new mode takes a leaf out of the good book of Warzone, forcing frantic play as you huddle around bomb sites and seek to detonate them and irradiate your enemies.",
    "There\u2019s a special kind of considered chaos to Call of Duty: Black ops Cold War \u2014 frankly it\u2019s an absurd entry in the series, but it works well and is certainly nostalgic, especially if you sunk many hours into the Black Ops games back in the day.",
    "The Zombies mode is similarly good fun, especially if you\u2019re more of a co-operator than a competitive player at heart. The premise is interesting and it commits to the far more interesting absurd side of the game, as you enter portals to another world and fight off plague hounds.",
    "Your loadouts and progression also track across all modes, which creates this coordinated onslaught of dopamine regardless of what part of the package you dig into. There\u2019s something very satisfying about upgrading your shotgun in Zombies to give it the attachments necessary to rack up kills in multiplayer.",
    "It\u2019s worth mentioning that the game crashed a few times on PS5 on launch day (yet this issue hasn\u2019t resurfaced since) and sometimes it does dip below the 60 FPS target when you\u2019re playing on the more sizable Combined Arms maps in multiplayer. These bugs will likely be ironed out in the coming weeks, but keep that in mind if you\u2019re picking this up ASAP.",
    "Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a (mostly positive) mixed bag. We were let down by Cold War\u2019s campaign, which held onto old tropes and botched its subject matter. The best part about that is that the campaign is the least essential part of the package. Certainly play it for the visuals, but you can also easily skip it and enjoy hundreds of hours of fun in the game\u2019s multiplayer and zombies modes. Even if you\u2019re just playing on your own, there\u2019s plenty of content here to dig into, and we doubt you\u2019ll feel short-changed for the price.",
    "The gunplay remains as addicting as ever, bolstered by the unique immersion of the DualSense, and the interactive new maps and modes add a tactical twist to the more conventional parts of the tried and tested Call of Duty gameplay. Black Ops Cold War is a great third-party pickup if you\u2019re looking for a game to test the limits of your next-gen console, especially if you\u2019ve got a group of friends lined up to jump in around launch."
