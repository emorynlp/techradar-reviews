    "The Razer DeathAdder is still one of the most popular gaming mice, even years after its initial release. It\u2019s not hard to see why: PC gamers have loved everything about these mice, from the ergonomics and performance to customization. It doesn\u2019t hurt the other technological feats the DeathAdder accomplished over the past decades. This includes introducing the first 3G infrared sensor and left-handed gaming mouse.",
    "The DeathAdder V2 Pro features everything that\u2019s carried its wired predecessors to 10 million+ sold while adding wireless connectivity. Priced at $129.99 (\u00a3129.99, AU 224.95), the wire-free gaming mouse is the most capable trim in Razer\u2019s flagship line.",
    "The Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro is a comfortable mouse to hold if you have average to large sized hands. Hand positioning feels perfect and ergonomic during general activities like web browsing or word processing. Gaming for long sessions maintains reasonable levels of comfort too due to how well the clickers sorta wrap around the index and middle fingers. The palm rest also sits perfectly under the user's palms.",
    "Adding wireless into the mix only adds 6 grams to the V2 Pro from the standard V2. Nothing seems sacrificed to accommodate the feature outside of the lack of a mouse wheel light. The 2.5Ghz Razer HyperSpeed compartment is sleek, and placed in the undercarriage alongside switches for connection type, profile select button and Mouse Dock Chroma charge port.",
    "Be mindful, Razer\u2019s wireless mouse charger costs an extra $49.99 (\u00a349.99, AU 89.95) and is not included. The USB port placed underneath the clickers fits wonderfully with the standard dongle that comes packaged. Since the V2 Pro port is molded around Razers\u2019s Speedflex micro-USB cable, using other micro-USB cords is possible but difficult to plug in. Of course, left handed gamers are left out in the cold. Meanwhile, users with smaller hands may have to stick with the wired DeathAdder V2 Mini.",
    "The DeathAdder V2 Pro features the same Focus+ Optical Sensor and Optical Mouse Switch of the lesser priced models meaning that utilizing it during gameplay feels incredible. Deliberate first person shooters like Call of Duty Modern Warfare and PUBG control like a breeze. Faster paced shooters like Doom Eternal couldn't be better suited for the BlackAdder V2 Pro. Movement feels slick and accurate thanks to the PTFE mouse feet and DPI controls. The scroll wheel is textured and features the perfect amount of resistance.",
    "It also doesn\u2019t matter much how exactly one decides to connect their DeathAdder V2 Pro as 2.5Ghz Razer HyperSpeed Wireless feels just as good as wired. However, latency is a little noticeable when using Bluetooth. Using Bluetooth does have the benefit of a whopping 170 hours of battery life on a full charge. Using the better HyperSpeed Wireless connection lends 70 hours, which is still fairly impressive. Those who love to use specific mouse layouts for certain games and programs will get much use out of the onboard memory supporting up to five profiles. These are programmable through Razer\u2019s Synapse app allowing users to customize macros, mouse sensitivity, RGB lighting, battery saving options and more.",
    "At this point, Razer knows that millions of fans will continue to buy mouses within their DeathAdder V2 line. That hasn\u2019t stopped them from making significant improvements that make gaming on PC better. Adding wireless capabilities don\u2019t come at much of a sacrifice outside of a handful of added grams and lack of RGB lighting on the scroll wheel. The battery is great and the option to use the HyperSpeed Wireless connection or Bluetooth is a huge plus. Too bad left hand and smaller handed individuals won\u2019t find this package approachable. For everyone else, the DeathAdder V2 Pro is close to perfection."
