    "The Canyon Precede:ON CF 9 is currently Canyon\u2019s top-of-the range e-bike with striking looks, excellent performance and an exquisite attention to design detail that makes it a very appealing proposition.",
    "With a price tag that puts it firmly into the growing range of premium electric bikes that are out there right now, Canyon\u2019s variation on the theme stands out on several counts. Aside from the dramatic angular frame design there is innovation aplenty, with a Gates belt drive and Enviolo automatic shifting allowing you to just get on and ride.",
    "While the Precede:ON CF 9 aims to remove hassle from the cycle riding equation it\u2019s also got more than enough to tempt bike enthusiasts with a banquet of quality components that come together to produce one of the best e-bikes out there.",
    "Standard and step-through frame options mean it\u2019ll meet any kind of rider preference while the experience it delivers leaves you wanting more. Boosting the appeal is the impressive combination of on-board tech, with Bosch supplying the motor, battery and handlebar-mounted computer.",
    "Chunky tires make amends for the rigid frame design while brakes, lights, saddle and handlebars all boast a premium edge. It\u2019s a great get-on-and-go bike, which turns heads for good measure.",
    "Canyon\u2019s Precede:ON CF 9 was released at the beginning of September 2020 and is currently priced at \u00a34,699 / \u20ac4,999 (about $6,000 / AU$8,500). Canyon\u2019s business model is to sell direct, so you order your bike online from the company, which should mean it ships pretty much anywhere.",
    "The Canyon Precede:ON CF9 is striking to look at, even when it\u2019s finished in sober Anchor Grey as our test model was. Champagne is the alternative colour option if you\u2019re looking for something a little more flamboyant.",
    "Design-wise it\u2019s angular all the way and there are elements of this bike that really showcase the craftsmanship on offer, with the carbon-fiber frame (sizes M through to XL) being a standout feature.",
    "Similarly, the handlebars have everything cleverly integrated into the design, plus there are no visible cables either. Canyon spent a long time engineering the bike so that all of the gubbins that normally sits outside of a bike frame now lies hidden inside it. Those rubber grips on the handlebars, by the way, are a dream to rest your hands on. The saddle is a minor work of art too, and accommodating enough for a few kilometers a day.",
    "The electric motor, battery and display all come from Bosch, with the former being its Bosch Performance CX unit featuring 85Nm of torque, as more frequently encountered on electric mountain bikes.",
    "Meanwhile, the battery is a 500Wh example, which Canyon says is good for a range of 65km and this has been nicely integrated into the down tube so you barely know it\u2019s there.",
    "The computer is a Kiox edition from Bosch, and its boxy design fits in perfectly with the way the rest of the bike looks. It can be detached from its mounting cradle with a gentle tug and the bike can\u2019t be used without it in situ.",
    "Elsewhere, the wheels turn out to be ideally suited to the ride quality. Being a rigid frame with no suspension, the spoked 25mm width Axelrims/Shimano wheels and Schwalbe G-One Allround 57mm tires do an excellent job of damping the journey over lumpy road surfaces. Even if you head off road the mildly-knobbled rubber prevents any unwanted slippage from over zealous bursts of power.",
    "Braking is impressive too, with the TRP hydraulic discs taking care of business with no messing about. As with everything else on the Canyon Precede:ON CF9, the overwhelming feeling is one of quality.",
    "Front and rear lights are small but powerful LED units, which prove to be way brighter than you expect. In fact, it\u2019s even possible to dip the front one, a Supernova Mini 2 Pro, from a high beam of 550 lumens down to 235 just so you don\u2019t dazzle oncoming traffic. The Supernova E3 taillight looks tiny, but boy, it\u2019s bright too.",
    "Our test model came with a robust rack above the back wheel, which has a maximum load capacity of 25kg. A front rack is another additional option, which can handle a payload of 5kg if you\u2019re looking to lug multiple things around.",
    "Full mudguards come as standard on the Canyon Precede:ON CF9, which makes sense especially if you\u2019re going to be using it for commuting and have work clothes to keep looking respectable.",
    "The devil really is in the detail with this e-bike: Canyon has spent quite lot of time ensuring that the kickstand looks like it\u2019s an integral part of the frame design, so it too features angular lines. It\u2019s a nice touch.",
    "Our example came with a top-of-the-range Abus Bordo Plus lock too, which also makes a lot of sense given the value of the Canyon Precede:ON CF9.",
    "Unlike many conventional bikes, especially those with myriad gears to maintain as you ride, the Canyon Precede:ON CF9 will appeal to many because of its simple Enviolo automatic shifting. Riding this e-bike is wonderfully smooth, with the Gates belt drive getting rid of the tick of a regular bike chain. There\u2019s an entertaining whirr from the power unit as you pedal, but otherwise the Canyon Precede:ON CF9 delivers a silky smooth experience as you sail down the road.",
    "The Bosch computer system allows easy management of the different drive modes and it\u2019s simple to pick through these (Eco, Tour, Sport and Turbo) as and when you need to. Manual controls for the computer and power modes are found in the cluster on the left-hand side of the handlebars. In fact everything can be controlled from here, plus there\u2019s a button for the lights too.",
    "Central to the riding experience is the cadence setting, which can be set via the computer. The continuously variable shifting system will then make sure that you can keep pedaling steadily while the Enviolo unit does the rest.",
    "It might take you a couple of minor excursions to get the best from the settings but there\u2019s an ideal level for most tastes. If anything we found the bike too easy to ride on our inaugural spin, but over time we managed to strike a practical balance between getting some exercise and enjoying the benefits that emanate from the Bosch power unit.",
    "Out on the roads the Canyon Precede:ON CF9 really starts to shift if you\u2019re so inclined, especially if you're lucky enough to be on a smooth surface. It weighs in at around 22kg, so it\u2019s actually lighter than the chunky lines of the frame suggest. We got a respectable return from the power unit too, with a battery range that seemed to easily live up to the claims from Canyon: nothing to worry about on that front. Which you\u2019d hope for on a nearly \u00a35K e-bike.",
    "While it excels on the roads and cycle paths, go off-piste by taking a short cut across a grassy field and this e-bike quickly reminds you that there\u2019s no suspension, save for a bit of sponginess provided by those bulbous tyres. Canyon has designed this to be a commuter bike though, and for getting to and from a place of work it\u2019s spot on.",
    "That said, the high price of the Canyon Precede:ON CF9 means you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on it and you\u2019ll definitely want a premium lock on board as ours did. This is a brilliant e-bike, but in some respects we feel it\u2019s perhaps a little bit too good for the daily commute. We just wanted to keep our example under lock and key and, well, just marvel at that dazzling design. Which is the exact opposite of what the Canyon Precede:ON CF9 was created for.",
