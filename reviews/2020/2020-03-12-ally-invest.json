    "Talking about trading charges, while online stock options and ETF trades are available at zero commission, Options Trades are available at $0.50 per contract. The $9.95 mutual fund trades from Ally Invest are lower when compared to any other full-service brokerage. Because of its charges, Ally Invest is not a ideal for penny stock trading.",
    "One of the highlights is that Ally Invest provides 24/7 customer support via a telephone helpline, email or live chat.",
