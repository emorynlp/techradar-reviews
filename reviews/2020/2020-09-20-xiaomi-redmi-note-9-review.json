  "summary": "Exemplary stamina and top snaps for \u00a3200",
  "verdict": "With the Redmi Note 9, Xiaomi zeroes in on battery life and photography as its twin priorities, resulting in a budget phone that occasionally punches above its weight. Performance and design compromises mean that it\u2019s not an outright winner, but showing strength in a number of areas where the Moto G8 fails makes it a viable alternative.",
  "pros": [
    "Great battery life",
    "Strong camera for the price",
    "Screen is LCD but large and bright"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Plasticky yet hefty design",
    "Mediocre performance",
    "MIUI 12 much improved, but still not perfect"
  ],
  "article": [
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 is a \u00a3200 phone that packs in stellar battery life, a large FHD+ display, and an uncommonly decent camera.",
    "While it doesn\u2019t sport the most attractive design, with an all-plastic body and some rather hefty dimensions, the Redmi Note 9 proves easy enough to wield. And where it really matters, on the front of the phone, you get the benefit of thin(ish) bezels and a tidy hole-punch notch.",
    "The display is a 6.53-inch LCD that gets pretty bright and, courtesy of an FHD+ resolution, is plenty crisp. No, it\u2019s not an OLED, but remember we\u2019re talking about a sub-\u00a3200 phone here.",
    "If we\u2019re honest, performance is slightly underwhelming, as a result of a cut-price MediaTek Helio G85 CPU that doesn\u2019t always deliver the most fluid experience. Still, it\u2019s capable of running the latest games reasonably well.",
    "If we\u2019re a little disappointed in how well the Redmi Note 9 runs, we\u2019re very happy with its camera. While calling it a quad-camera setup is a little generous, its 48-megapixel main sensor captures some genuinely decent shots in good lighting.",
    "Even more impressive is the Redmi Note 9\u2019s stamina. It\u2019s good for a full two days of use, thanks in no small part to a positively huge 5,020mAh battery. It\u2019s a brute-force approach that results in the phone\u2019s rather chunky dimensions, but it pays off handsomely.",
    "Xiaomi has taken some steps forward with its latest Android skin, MIUI 12, which is available as an update straight out of the box. It\u2019s a sharper, more flexible, and better-looking UI than before, even if it does continue to suffer from a little too much bloat and app duplication.",
    "All in all, it\u2019s another fine budget effort from Xiaomi. If your priorities for a new phone include great battery life and a decent camera, and you don\u2019t want to pay more than \u00a3200 for the privilege, then there aren\u2019t many better picks than the Redmi Note 9.",
    "It may not be our favorite budget phone \u2013 it\u2019s hard to look past the benefits of the Moto G8\u2019s classy build and slick software experience in day to day usage \u2013 but depending on your specific needs, it might just prove to be yours.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 first hit shops on May 12, 2020. UK prices officially start from \u00a3179 for the 64GB model, moving up to \u00a3199 for the 128GB model.",
    "At the time of writing, however, Xiaomi was running a 10th anniversary sale whereby the top-spec model could be picked up for just \u00a3159, along with a free 10,000mAh Redmi Power Bank. We\u2019ve also seen the lower-capacity model going for the same low price on Amazon.",
    "While we\u2019ll be treating those original prices as the norm here, we\u2019d encourage you to keep your eyes peeled for deals. You can clearly expect to get yourself a hefty saving on Xiaomi\u2019s new affordable contender.",
    "When it comes to design, the Redmi Note 9 sits at the \u2018functional plastic\u2019 end of the spectrum. There isn\u2019t so much as a hint of metal here, and the only glass you\u2019ll find is the Gorilla Glass 5 panel that covers the front.",
    "You wouldn\u2019t expect premium materials in the sub-\u00a3200 price category, of course. And to Xiaomi\u2019s credit, it delivers the plastic aesthetic in the form of a striking eggshell blue frame finish and a rear panel that shifts from sky blue at the top to lavender at the bottom. That\u2019s the Polar White model we were sent, anyway. The Forest Green and Midnight Grey models don\u2019t look quite as snazzy.",
    "This is a pretty large phone for the price. It\u2019s rather tall at 162.3mm, particularly thick at 8.9mm, and really quite heavy at 199g. You can probably thank the phone\u2019s huge battery for those last two stats.",
    "Xiaomi has eschewed the use of an in-display fingerprint sensor with the Redmi Note 9, which is a clear money-saving measure. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing in our book, as in-display technology remains a beat slower than equivalent stand-alone sensors.",
    "What we don\u2019t like so much is that the fingerprint sensor here is rather hard to locate. Not only does it lack edge definition, making it hard to feel out, but it sits rather anonymously as part of the extended camera module, so it\u2019s also visually indistinct.",
    "Around the front, the Redmi Note 9 has the kind of minimal bezels and punch-hole selfie camera that you\u2019d associate with a slightly pricier phone. We\u2019re accustomed to cheaper handsets going with a central teardrop notch, so it\u2019s a classy touch.",
    "The bottom edge houses a mono speaker, a USB-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack for all you sworn never-Bluetoothers. But it\u2019s the top edge that contains the biggest curiosity \u2013 an IR blaster that can be put to use as a back-up remote control for all your living room gear.",
    "A sub-\u00a3200 price tag guarantees one thing when it comes to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9\u2019s screen: it\u2019s no OLED. That\u2019s the bad news.",
    "The good news comes in the form of a large 6.53-inch IPS LCD that typically hits a reasonably bright 450 nits. It outputs a Full HD+ resolution, too, which still isn\u2019t a guarantee at this price point (hello Moto G8).",
    "For a cheap LCD, this is pleasingly colour-accurate. You\u2019re never going to get those deep inky blacks, of course, but viewing images and videos on it remained a thoroughly pleasant experience throughout our test period.",
    "Opting for the Saturated display mode gives colours a little more pop, although the difference isn\u2019t anywhere near as pronounced as on Xiaomi\u2019s OLED-packing devices such as the Poco F2 Pro. As it was, we were happy with the default Auto mode.",
    "You won\u2019t see any higher refresh-rate wizardry with the Redmi Note 9, which largely remains the preserve of pricier phones. But in general, Xiaomi has focused on the right things with this budget display.",
    "We\u2019ve tended to be mightily impressed with the camera technology Xiaomi packs into its Redmi Note range. Last year\u2019s Redmi Note 8T punched well above its weight with a largely impressive quad-camera setup, and the Redmi Note 9 appears to be very similar indeed.",
    "Once again, you get a 48-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro and a 2-megapixel dedicated depth sensor. We feel like a stuck record here, but the 2-megapixel macro really isn\u2019t worthy of the space it takes up, and the depth sensor feels rather superfluous.",
    "The lingering suspicion is that budget phone manufacturers simply throw such components into the mix because they\u2019re a cost-effective way of hitting \u2018quad-camera\u2019 status. Call us cynical, but we can\u2019t see how either of these 2-megapixel sensors add anything meaningful to day-to-day shooting.",
    "Grumbles aside, we\u2019re largely impressed by the pictures the Redmi Note 9 captures. So long as the lighting is good, you\u2019ll get the kind of crisp, well-balanced shots that you\u2019d have expected to pay \u00a3400 or more to achieve not so long ago. We did pick up the odd hint of overexposure \u2013 but, by and large, the phone handled high dynamic range scenarios admirably well for its price.",
    "The 8-megapixel ultrawide angle sensor matches the tone of the main camera quite well, although looking closely reveals plenty of noise \u2013 especially as your attention moves out to the edges of the frame. Still, it\u2019s always a welcome option.",
    "Standard 1X shots take the visual information from four pixels to create one decent one, thus churning out sharper 12-megapixel snaps. Even without a dedicated telephoto lens included, it\u2019s possible to secure usable 2X shots using that pixel-packed main sensor in conjunction with some smart Xiaomi software. Any higher on the zoom front and you\u2019ll start to notice some serious noise.",
    "We did achieve usable results in a well-lit restaurant at lunchtime, where the food shots looked appropriately vibrant. Xiaomi\u2019s AI assistant, as ever, proves pretty savvy at picking out such scenes and making the appropriate adjustments to the camera\u2019s tone and focus.",
    "That said, the Redmi Note 9 doesn\u2019t handle very low-light or night-time scenarios well, which is where its budget nature truly betrays itself. There\u2019s a dedicated Night mode here, which will brighten such shots significantly, but it produces shots that are full of grainy artefacts and therefore distracting.",
    "Video capture isn\u2019t up to the standard of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8T, with a mere 1080p 30fps on offer rather than the 4K 30fps/1080p 60fps of its predecessor. But it does a basic job.",
    "There\u2019s A 13-megapixel front camera here, too, which is fine for selfies once you\u2019ve reset the ghastly \u2018beauty\u2019 effects.",
    "Oh, and one final note to Xiaomi and every other manufacturer that chooses to slap a branded watermark on every photo by default: stop. Please. Just stop. Yes, you can fish around in the settings menu to switch off this annoying feature, but we really shouldn\u2019t have to.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 isn\u2019t a particularly hot performer. You don\u2019t get the Snapdragon 665 CPU that key rivals such as the Moto G8 do, or even last year\u2019s Redmi Note 8T for that matter, which is a bit of a downer.",
    "Instead, this phone is fitted out with the cheaper MediaTek Helio G85. Look at the benchmarks and you won\u2019t notice much of a difference between these two chips in terms of raw performance. An average Geekbench 5 multicore score of 1,273 is pretty comparable to Qualcomm\u2019s more popular budget chip.",
    "In the hand we noticed small but fairly frequent stutters when navigating between home screens, moving between menus, and simply unlocking the Redmi Note 9. That\u2019s all pretty standard, non-intensive stuff we\u2019re talking about, which meant we were never in any doubt that we were using a cheap phone.",
    "For gaming, though, the Redmi Note 9 holds its own. Grimvalor looks and moves great, as does Dead Cells \u2013 two slick action-platformers where you really notice those dropped frames.",
    "Conversely, while The Gardens Between runs reasonably smoothly, it does so with the odd stutter and a drastically reduced level of visual fidelity. Its Tenet-style time-warping puzzles seem to tax the chip into a Low settings state, or else the developer simply hasn\u2019t properly optimised the game for this less mainstream silicon.",
    "The choice of internal storage capacities is ample at either 64GB or 128GB. You can\u2019t really ask for more at this price.",
    "We also appreciate that the handset features NFC for full Android Pay compatibility, which is important in these increasingly cashless times. While this isn\u2019t an unusual inclusion, it\u2019s worth remembering that the Moto G8 omits NFC.",
    "While the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 ships with Android 10 and MIUI 11, we found that there was an update to MIUI 12 available from the get-go. It\u2019s a considerable improvement, once you\u2019ve spent some time tinkering with its many customisation options in the Settings menu to get it just so.",
    "You\u2019ll need to manually activate the gesture navigation system, for example, and it doesn\u2019t turn on the new split Notification Shade/Control Center menu by default. When activated, we found that this latter iOS-aping provision successfully declutters the somewhat overstuffed Android default.",
    "You don\u2019t get the fancy new live wallpapers of more capable Xiaomi/Poco phones with MIUI 12, but that\u2019s a small sacrifice. It\u2019s likely that these wouldn\u2019t have run too well on the Note 9\u2019s limited hardware, judging from our experience.",
    "Elsewhere, MIUI 12 has sharpened up the spacing and shaping of its icons, and it doesn\u2019t feel quite as \u2018Fisher Price\u2019 as it once did. It\u2019s still far from the best Android skin, failing to approach OxygenOS levels of sharpness and slickness, not to mention Motorola\u2019s feather-light approach. And it still, rather maddeningly, scans apps you\u2019ve just downloaded from the Google Play Store and uses this so-called \u2018Security\u2019 system to serve up unwanted ads.",
    "Bloatware remains a bit of an issue, too, with an extra web browser, a bespoke Notes app, Xiaomi\u2019s usual Themes app and a folder filled with at least half-a-dozen pre-installed third-party apps. Yes, we probably would have installed Netflix and Facebook at some point, but that\u2019s a choice we\u2019d like to make for ourselves.",
    "Elsewhere, MIUI 12 at least has the decency to leave the Google Feed well alone to the left of the main home screen, and it\u2019s generally quite customisable without being too in-your-face or cluttered.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 has a 5,020mAh battery. That would be considered pretty huge in a top-end phone with a 4K 120Hz display, let alone in a budget phone with much less demanding hardware.",
    "However, size isn\u2019t everything when it comes to battery life; software smarts are also necessary if you want decent stamina. Nevertheless, it counts plenty. And the result is that this is a proper two-day phone.",
    "Unless you\u2019re an out-and-out power user or a total media hound (and if you are then this probably isn\u2019t the phone for you anyway), you\u2019ll get through two full days of use in between charges.",
    "When you do hit the streaming services, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 has good if not outstanding stamina. We watched an hour of Netflix with the screen brightness set to half, and it sapped 7% of a charge \u2013 a good, but not freakishly good, result.",
    "Also notable is the fact that the Redmi Note 9 supports 18W fast charging. No, it\u2019s not the fastest standard on the market, but it\u2019s still noteworthy in such a cheap phone.",
