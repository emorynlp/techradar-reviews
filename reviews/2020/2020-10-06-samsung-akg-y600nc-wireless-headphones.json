  "summary": "Noise-cancelling headphones with a slick design",
  "verdict": "The AKG Y600NC will divide listeners; some people will absolutely love their expansive soundstage, while others will find their music sounds oddly sparse and disjointed \u2013 and the noise cancellation isn\u2019t anything to write home about. Saying that, we liked the slick design, and the ability to pair them with more than one device at once is a useful feature.",
  "pros": [
    "Slick design",
    "Simple controls",
    "Multipoint pairing"

  "cons": [
    "Music sounds sparse",
    "Noise cancellation could be better"

    "The AKG Y600NC are Samsung\u2019s latest foray into the world of noise-cancelling headphones, with the company hoping to take on class-leading models like the Sony WH-1000XM4 and the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.",
    "Costing \u00a3199 (about $250 / AU$360), they\u2019re slightly cheaper than these models, which could make them a compelling cheaper alternative to the best noise-cancelling headphones of 2020.",
    "Unfortunately, they just can\u2019t compete in terms of audio quality and noise cancellation performance. That\u2019s not to say these headphones sound bad \u2013 it\u2019s just that their incredibly expansive soundstage means music can sound a little sparse, and there\u2019s a general lack of dynamism, particularly in the higher frequencies.",
    "Some people will love that wide soundstage, and it\u2019s certainly impressive \u2013 it\u2019s just not to our taste, and we daresay audiophiles will crave more sparkle and detail from these cans.",
    "The noise cancellation is also somewhat underwhelming; again, it\u2019s not bad per se, but it doesn\u2019t match the competition.",
    "However, there are some aspects of the AKG Y600NC that we really like. Design-wise, they sport a classic look, with sleek lines and tactile volume controls that will appeal to anyone who hates the touch-capacitive sensor controls that are so in vogue at the moment.",
    "Meanwhile, Bluetooth 5 connectivity, multi-point pairing, and support for wired listening gives you the flexibility to switch between devices seamlessly.",
    "We have a feeling that these headphones will be somewhat divisive; some people will love their expansive sound and slick design, and some will find their music sounds too disjointed to really enjoy. Read on to find out whether the AKG Y600NC are right for you.",
    "The AKG Y600NC Wireless Headphones were released on July 24, 2020, and are available to buy now for \u00a3199 \u2013 and though international pricing is to be confirmed, that works out at around $250 / AU$360.",
    "That\u2019s cheaper than the best headphones of 2020, the Sony WH-1000XM4 \u2013 though these AKG cans aren\u2019t quite as high-spec as Sony\u2019s noise-cancellers. The AKG Y600NC actually sit at a price point more similar to the Philips PH805, which we awarded 4.5 out of 5 stars for their punchy sound, good battery life, and value for money.",
    "The design of the AKG Y600NC is pretty classic, with circular rotatable earcups and a slim, padded headband.",
    "The headband is adjustable with a sliding mechanism \u2013 the metal headband slide is furnished with measurements from 1-10, allowing you to precisely adjust it to fit your head exactly. It\u2019s a nice touch, and a cool design feature.",
    "Available in three colors (black, gold, and silver), the Y600NC have been designed with comfort in mind, thanks to a lightweight build and and memory foam-padded ear cushions, which make them suitable for long listening sessions.",
    "Each earcup features a metallic ring that adds a luxe finish to proceedings, alongside the AKG logo in white, which sits on the outer housings.",
    "The left earcup \u2013 a little like the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 \u2013 doubles up as a dial, which allows you to control the volume of your music.",
    "On that earcup you\u2019ll also find a 3.5mm audio port and a button that allows you to skip, fast forward, and play / pause your music \u2013 press this button when you receive a call and you can accept or reject it. Your music is also automatically paused when you remove the headphones, which is a handy feature.",
    "The right earcup features the power / Bluetooth pairing button, as well as the TalkThru button, which allows ambient sound to pass through the housings.",
    "With 40mm drivers and a rather large frequency range of 10Hz - 24kHz, the audio quality offered by the AKG Y600NC is generally very good, if not the best we\u2019ve ever heard.",
    "The first thing we noticed when listening to Sunblind by Fleet Foxes, is just how spacious the soundstage of these headphones is, with an airy, expansive presentation that we weren\u2019t expecting from a pair of closed-back headphones.",
    "There was a good amount of detail in the chattering hi hats and tinkling piano accents, with smooth, lush vocals that aren\u2019t overpowered by the rich, soaring bass lines.",
    "As we moved onto Fleet Foxes\u2019 Jara, the Y600NC were able to showcase their brilliant stereo separation, with clear bird-like vocals that pan from ear to ear. As the track develops, opulent vocal harmonies are given plenty of room to soar by these headphones, with the occasional medieval-style cadence adding color to the mix.",
    "That spacious feel is echoed in Fleetwood Mac\u2019s The Chain \u2013 however, we can\u2019t help but feel a little bit disappointed with the presentation, as the instruments feel almost sparse due to the width of that soundstage. That\u2019s not something we\u2019ve experienced very often in our time reviewing headphones, and it\u2019s an unusual sensation \u2013 though it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that we are being picky here, and the sound is generally good.",
    "In any case, things improve as the song kicks into that iconic guitar riff, with devilish bass lines and thrashing drums filling in the gaps for the packed, exciting mix we were hoping for.",
    "As well as indie folk and classic rock, the AKG Y600NC can handle RnB-tinged pop with aplomb. In Childish Gambino\u2019s Redbone, there was a pleasing sense of space and timing, with tightly controlled bass frequencies and delicately handled synth lines. However, we\u2019re still missing a little sparkle and dynamism from the higher frequencies, particularly when the vocal creeps up in pitch as the song reaches its climax.",
    "Again, we\u2019re being picky, and the AKG Y600NC certainly sound good enough to compete with most mid-range headphones on the market right now \u2013 they just aren\u2019t the best-sounding cans of 2020.",
    "While the noise cancellation provided by the AKG Y600NC is capable of blocking out some environmental sound, it certainly isn\u2019t on par with the likes of the Sony WH-1000XM4 and other class-leading models. It\u2019s enough to take the edge off of the rumble of your commuter train or the low frequency hum of an aircraft, but you\u2019ll find that louder conversations will make it through to your ears.",
    "If you do want to hear your surroundings more clearly, a TalkThru mode allows ambient sound to pass through the earcups \u2013 using this mode doesn\u2019t completely stop your music, but it does reduce the volume significantly, and it turns off the active noise cancellation.",
    "Battery life comes in at 25 hours with active noise cancellation switched on \u2013 turn that off, and you\u2019ll get 35 hours of playback from the AKG Y600NC, which is just shy of the Sony WH-1000XM4\u2019s 38 hours of juice.",
    "If you do run out of juice, you can get four hours of playback from a quick 10-minute charge via the included USB-C charging cable.",
    "You can also use these headphones with the provided 3.5mm audio cable if you drain your battery \u2013 or if you prefer the audio quality afforded by a wired connection.",
    "Wireless connectivity comes courtesy of Bluetooth 5, giving you a sturdy connection with your device of choice, while support for voice assistants extends to Google Assistant, Siri, and Bixby.",
    "It\u2019s possible to connect the AKG Y600NC to two Bluetooth sources at one time; to switch between them, you just need to hold down the power slider for three seconds."
