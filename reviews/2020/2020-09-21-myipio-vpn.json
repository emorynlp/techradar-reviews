  "summary": "Cloud-based VPN with excellent speeds, but for experts only",
  "verdict": "MyIP.io is a good choice for an expert VPN user who places high download speeds above all else. Beginners will find it a bit disorienting unless they\u2019re using the mobile app. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t have many servers or apps for all platforms, nor does it support more than one simultaneous connection but prices are pretty reasonable.",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent speeds",
    "Inexpensive",
    "Phone customer support",
    "Has a solution for businesses"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Only one simultaneous connection",
    "No native clients for desktop",
    "Limited number of servers",
    "Doesn\u2019t unblock Netflix or BBC iPlayer"
  ],
  "article": [
    "MyIP.io provides cloud-based VPN services for individuals and business users at reasonable prices, although the server network is small and the learning curve a bit steep, especially since it doesn\u2019t have apps for Windows and Mac.",
    "However, once you do learn how things work, you\u2019re in for a very fast and reliable experience. If MyIP.io is too complicated or limiting for you, then you\u2019re sure to find the right service by taking a peek at today\u2019s best VPN services",
    "The provider has three subscription packages. The Personal VPN package costs $2.49/month under the annual plan or $2.99/month (five users minimum) under the monthly plan. The Dedicated VPN package, meanwhile, can be yours at the price of $5.99/month if billed annually, $7.99/month if billed quarterly or monthly, and it will get you a dedicated IPv4/IPv6, as well as shell for SSH access.",
    "For those who may require a business-level solution, MyIP.io offers the fully managed Business VPN package with cloud integration, dedicated technical team, 24/7 support, and integration with AD/LDAP, starting at $29.99/month and you can contact the provider for a customized solution. The business package provides \u201centerprise-grade security, access, and management\u201d for multiple accounts under one master deck.",
    "If you were hoping to get a taste of the service before committing, you can do so during the 7-day money-back guarantee period - you\u2019ll just have to pay first. Payments can be made using credit/debit cards or PayPal, although there was an issue with the latter when we tested it at first. The credit card payment method allows you to either open a recurring subscription or make a one-off payment, which gives you more control over your subscription.",
    "Unfortunately, you\u2019ll only be able to run one connection at a time if you sign up for this provider\u2019s Personal or Dedicated account, whereas the typical number in this industry is three or five (some don\u2019t even have this restriction). This number is extended to up to 50 simultaneous connections if you opt for the Business VPN product.",
    "MyIP.io may be too complicated or limited for many, so instead, you might want to check out some of the competitors, like Surfshark or CyberGhost that are cheaper, or ExpressVPN or NordVPN that are the ultimate performers in their field. All of them are more beginner-friendly, support more simultaneous connections, have apps for all platforms, and many other features you won\u2019t see with MyIP.io.",
    "While access to popular services like Netflix and BBC iPlayer is one of the major reasons why many people seek out VPNs, not all VPNs are good for accessing them. MyIP.io is one of them, as we were told by the customer service that it \u201cis not compatible with streaming services such as Netflix.\u201d",
    "MyIP.io is registered in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Signing up for its services will get you access to 30 server locations in places like Hong Kong, Bahrein, South Africa, Singapore and others. Each server location is equipped with thousands of IP addresses.",
    "To protect your privacy online, this VPN vendor deploys \u201crobust encryption\u201d and OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, and PPTP transfer protocols.",
    "MyIP.io\u2019s privacy policy states that the company doesn\u2019t \u201ckeep logs of your browsing activities, sites visited, outgoing traffic or content accessed\u201d nor \"records of DNS queries of our users\u201d.",
    "It does, however, \u201ckeep a bare minimum set of data like the date you connected and from which IP\u201d and \u201ccollect minimal statistics to ensure superior performance of service and customer assistance.\u201d",
    "The provider states this data is necessary for it to assist you with any technical problems, region-specific issues and the like. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to confirm whether these claims are true or not until MyIP.io welcomes an independent audit by a third-party company.",
    "Judging by the provider\u2019s blog, torrenting is supported, although it says you shouldn\u2019t use its dedicated service for these purposes. The customer support agent told us that the company does indeed support P2P/torrenting but doesn\u2019t encourage it.",
    "This VPN is compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux. However, it only has apps for iOS and Android. If you want to install it on the other platforms, you\u2019ll have to use the OpenVPN Connect app and follow the instructions in the support library. This isn\u2019t terribly complicated, but more than we\u2019ve seen with the competition that typically have apps for all major platforms.",
    "The Android app has been downloaded 5,000+ times and received 3.9 stars (out of 5) as rated by 51 users. It was last updated quite a long time ago - on October 18, 2017. The iOS has been doing even worse - getting only 2.6 stars by five people. It was last updated on October 17, 2019.",
    "MyIP.io\u2019s support library isn\u2019t especially abundant, containing only about 15 articles, but it does offer some very useful video guides for enabling different protocols on Windows, Mac, and Linux.",
    "If you encounter any problems using the service and the how-to section doesn\u2019t address them, you can contact the customer support via email, phone, or online chat. Our email message was replied to over 35 hours after we sent it, but queries may be prioritized in terms of urgency. Regardless of the delay, we got all our questions answered.",
    "You\u2019ll only be able to download configuration for one server at a time and it isn\u2019t easy to figure out how unless you have a bit experience with configuration files (you\u2019ll have to visit your client area, choose the desired server location, select \u201cOpenVPN Profile\u201d under \u201cChoose App and OS\u201d, then click \u201cDownload MyIP\u201d, import the configuration to the OpenVPN Connect app and then finally connect). This all may be overly complicated for a novice. The mobile apps are much more straightforward and easier to navigate.",
    "Our testing delivered some pretty awesome results in terms of download speeds. The UK server reached a blazing 35Mbps on a 55Mbps test connection, while a server in Canada also came very close, with 34.43Mbps. The US-West server performed a little worse at 9.66Mbps, but that's somewhat expected since it's a bit further away.",
    "MyIP.io VPN is an excellent VPN service if you\u2019re looking for blazing speeds, budget-friendly prices and customer service available via phone.",
    "However, you'll have to be at least somewhat tech-savvy if you want to use it on a desktop machine, as it requires installation and use of OpenVPN Connect client and separate downloading and importing of configuration files. After all, the platform is \u201cdeveloped by professionals for professionals\u201d. It is a bit limited in terms of simultaneous connections, the number of servers, customer support and extra features, so if you want a VPN provider that has a proven track record for providing the best possible experience, you should give one of the industry\u2019s main performers such as ExpressVPN a chance - it may be more expensive but it\u2019s ultimately worth it."
