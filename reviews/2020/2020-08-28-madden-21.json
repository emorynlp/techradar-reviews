  "verdict": "On the gridiron, this is the tightest Madden yet and a great buy if you\u2019re just looking to play football with your friends. As a complete experience though, practically all of the extra game modes come with built-in flaws.",

    "Defending is more realistic",
    "Running is more fluid",

  "cons": [
    "Franchise mode neglected again",

    "Looks exactly like Madden 20"

    "The Madden series doesn\u2019t have any major competitors in the American football sim market, but even if it did, Madden 21\u2019s gameplay means it would still be the king.",
    "On the field, it\u2019s the cleanest Madden experience to date, especially when you\u2019re launching a perfect spiral from Patrick Mahomes downfield for Tyreek Hill to spin away from defenders. But every single one of the game modes - basic Exhibition aside - comes weighed down with too many problems for this to truly be great.",
    "Madden 21 is a football game first and foremost, and in that regard, it is stellar. While complaints about recent entries have primarily focused on the series' game modes, the actual play itself could be picked apart too, with over-powered interceptions, huge weighting on defender pace to control the game, and clunkiness around running plays. All of those issues disappear in Madden 21.",
    "There\u2019s more X-Factors and abilities in the latest Madden entry, but it\u2019s at a much more basic level where the real improvements have been made. The defenders are more realistic and, combined with a few smaller tweaks to offensive play, that makes for a much more rounded and far less frustrating experience. Commentary lines are reused, and players seem to hang in the air unnaturally if they\u2019re about to fumble, but they\u2019re minor quibbles.",
    "If you just want a game that lets you send OBJ long, Madden 21 is it. It clears four stars, maybe four and half stars. It\u2019s a slightly cleaner version than Madden 20 and will be great for getting your friends around to earn some bragging rights. It\u2019s once you start looking for Madden to be a more rounded experience that it falls apart though, and unfortunately it does so very quickly.",
    "Outside of simply playing football, there are three \u2018core\u2019 modes in Madden 21: Franchise mode, Face of The Franchise mode, and Madden Ultimate Team. Franchise mode itself is difficult to review, because it\u2019s the same as it has been since Madden 19. Exactly the same, right down to the aesthetics, the Super Bowl celebration footage, and the way you make progress and control your team. So, it\u2019s great, and will likely continue to be a popular mode in this instalment, but it\u2019s difficult to give credit to Madden 21 when the game itself adds nothing.",
    "Face of the Franchise is another core mode, one which puts you in the shoes of a high schooler who gradually makes his way to the NFL, and hopefully even the Hall of Fame with hands weighed down by Super Bowl rings. The obvious comparison is to Madden\u2019s cousin, FIFA, and its storymode The Journey. However, it feels like Madden is more inspired by NBA 2K\u2019s narrative, and if that\u2019s the case it falls short dramatically.",
    "Face of the Franchise is a guilty pleasure of a mode, with CW Network levels of drama constantly in play. Your friend/rival has a congenital heart defect, a secret he tells you within minutes of meeting you; that\u2019s the level of melodrama here. This rival is played by Tye Sheridan of X-Men and Ready Player One fame, but \u2018played\u2019 is too strong an adjective for what he brings.",
    "All of his lines feel like they were mumbled down the phone at 6am. The worst part is, this treacle-soaked drama could actually be a great mode if the end goal wasn't the NFL. If Face was all about high school drama between two rising football stars, it could be fantastic and unique, but it moves to the NFL too quickly and gets lazy. One game, after throwing for 4 TDs (including one 34 yarder), the player character was benched, because the story dictated he\u2019d had a bad game.",
    "Madden Ultimate Team works well enough, has a lot of bells and whistles, and obviously benefits from better on field mechanics, but it still is just Exhibition with loot boxes. Like Franchise mode, how you felt about MUT last year will be reflected this year.",
    "It isn\u2019t all gloom and doom on the game mode front. Although there\u2019s nothing to fix the issues above, there\u2019s definitely potential in the other game modes, but these point to big improvements for Madden 22 rather than providing them for Madden 21.",
    "The Yard is the new arrival this year, a version of backyard football likely inspired by NBA 2K\u2019s MyPark or FIFA\u2019s Volta and, with some fine tuning, it could really freshen things up. Madden has always basically been \u2018FIFA with geometry\u2019, and while the more tactical, make specific plays approach isn\u2019t that friendly to newcomers, it is very accurate to top level football, and so it\u2019s hard to criticise it. The Yard gives Madden an opportunity to be more free flowing and frenetic, but it just doesn\u2019t take it.",
    "Basketball and soccer are both already very fast games, so their street versions take that pace into overdrive. Football is much more sluggish and stop-start, but that doesn\u2019t need to continue in the street version of the game. Unfortunately, it does. The Yard is much more energetic than Exhibition, but still goes for pre-set plays with mini breaks between each Down, rather than something with lightning pace, multiple turnovers, and more of an escape from regular Madden. NFL Street, it ain\u2019t.",
    "Madden 21 is like catching the team\u2019s star player out partying until 5am on Super Bowl eve, then still watching him be the MVP in the game. On the field, it\u2019s glorious, and finally fixes a lot of Madden\u2019s issues. But off the field, when you take a look at the game modes, they feel empty, neglected and lazy. Worth getting for a better version of Madden 20\u2019s football, but the rest of the game can\u2019t justify the price tag.",
    "However, the focus on Positive Play and eradicating discrimination and abuse online in all of the menu screens is a nice touch, and hopefully will lead to some follow through on actions throughout the season."
