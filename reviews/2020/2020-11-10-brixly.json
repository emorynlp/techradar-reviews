    "Brixly is a relatively new web hosting provider, founded in 2014 by Dennis and Francesca Nind, a married couple, and focusing primarily on reseller hosting. Just six years after its inception, the provider is already managing more than 275,000 websites and blogs, making it one of the fastest-growing hosting platforms designed for the reseller market in the UK. They also offer web hosting, and their migration centre makes switching to them from another provider much easier than usual, but also faster, taking hours instead of days.",
    "Brixly has a London-based data centre network, made up of what they claim are the highest quality Tier 1 providers, in order to ensure that they\u2019re always online, plus a Chicago-based one. They promise 99.9% uptime, guaranteeing money back in the event that they can\u2019t keep that promise.",
    "Brixly is big on customer satisfaction, so they offer an almost-free month-long trial on every plan. This makes your choice much easier. They also like to take a more personal approach than most, which may not be for everyone, so expect to see a chat window (from the founder, apparently) pop up when you open a certain page and offer you assistance with it.",
    "When it comes to web hosting, Brixly offers unlimited bandwidth, a free SSL certificate, daily backups, and more with every plan, plus all of them are available for a month-long trial costing just \u00a31. Should you decide to stay with them, the Infinity plan (offering 10 GB SSD storage) will set you back \u00a33.95/mo, while the Infinity+ plan (with unlimited SSD storage) will cost \u00a38.95/mo.",
    "However, Brixly\u2019s main product is reseller hosting. Again, every plan is \u00a31 for the first month as a sort of cheap trial, the entry plan then costs \u00a39.95/mo and includes 20 cPanel accounts and 50 GB SSD storage, with every subsequent plan increasing the number of cPanel accounts and removing any storage restrictions. The most expensive plan, Unlimited, goes for \u00a359.95/mo and has 250 cPanel accounts.",
    "All plans offer a 30-day money back guarantee, and accepted payment methods are PayPal and credit/debit cards.",
    "Signing up with Brixly is simple: you just tell them whether or not you have a domain and if you\u2019re transferring an existing one to them, then select your billing cycle, keeping in mind that the annual one also includes a free domain for both reseller and web hosting. No matter which hosting plan you\u2019ve chosen, you can choose between a data centre in the UK and the US. Brixly does not try to upsell you too much: you can just add a dedicated IP address to your hosting account for \u00a32.95/mo. Choosing PayPal as your payment method also gives you the option of setting it as a one-time payment only, meaning the provider can\u2019t withdraw funds for a renewal without your express permission.",
    "Once you\u2019ve completed the signup process (you\u2019ll have to give them your name, address, and phone number, not unlike most other providers), you\u2019ll get a welcome email with what we found to be a nasty surprise: plaintext password storage. This is simply bad security practice, but may not be a dealbreaker to some. You get access to a client area from which you can manage your services, purchase new ones, see your billing information, and access support.",
    "You\u2019ll have to login to your cPanel separately, but once you\u2019re there, you can get started on your website. As usual, both File Manager and FTP are there if you want to upload an existing website, but lacking one, you have a whole host of one-click install apps available through Softaculous. A free website builder is also included with drag-and-drop features, so creating a new website should be a piece of cake.",
    "The loading speed of Brixly\u2019s main website is pretty decent: taking 8.3 seconds to fully load, just below the GTmetrix average of 8.4 seconds, plus 92 requests (average being 89), they\u2019re smack in the middle of the range in terms of performance. This means that most users are unlikely to be dissatisfied with their offer.",
    "When it comes to uptime, Brixly guarantees 99.9% of uptime, which translates to less than 9 hours of downtime per year, or 20 minutes in two weeks. We put that promise to the test over a two-week period, when they had a single 4-minute outage at one point. This is well below those 20 minutes, which is an excellent sign.",
    "Finding the help you need from Brixly should first be attempted through their Knowledgebase, at least according to our customer control panel. The Knowledgebase is separated into sections, where it says who contributed to each\u2014Dennis Nind, the founder, and Sam Morley, whose role isn\u2019t stated, are the only names. The articles within each section are clear, detailed, and with plenty of pictures so you can follow along.",
    "If you still can\u2019t figure it out, you can contact the provider\u2019s customer service team through phone, email, and live chat, while registered users can also submit a ticket to either the Technical or the Sales and Billing departments. The former is available 24/7/365, while the latter is only there on workdays, so you may have to wait a bit.",
    "Certa Hosting is another cheap, UK-based hosting provider, even cheaper than Brixly, but without nearly as many features as Brixly offers in even their lowest-grade plan. Plus, Brixly includes a free SSL certificate in every plan, which is not the case with Certa Hosting.",
    "Bluehost is also cheap and dependable, with plenty of options, but they simply don\u2019t have reseller hosting, which is the main thing Brixly has. Still, for customers who only need shared hosting, the choice may not be quite as clear-cut and may depend on personal preference.",
    "Hostgator suffers from a similar problem\u2014although their guides, tutorials, and general knowledge attainable through the platform are superior to Brixly\u2019s, and they offer reseller hosting as well, but they have bandwidth restrictions and the plans are more expensive than what Brixly offers.",
    "When it comes to excellent services for excellent prices, Linode offers all of this and more\u2014but they take a lot of technical knowledge, and reseller hosting, while available, is not as clear-cut as it is in the case of Brixly.",
    "Brixly offers great services for great prices, and their one month \u00a31 trial on every plan, no matter how elaborate or feature-packed, makes it easy to choose what works for you in terms of size and pricing. Although Bluehost and Hostgator are both decent alternatives, many customers may find exactly what they need with Brixly."
