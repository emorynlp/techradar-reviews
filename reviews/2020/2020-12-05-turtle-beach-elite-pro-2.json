    "As you can tell by its superlative-hoovering title and equally bold $250/\u00a3200 price tag, Turtle Beach\u2019s gen 2 Elite Pro isn\u2019t messing about. It\u2019s intended to provide competition to the very best headsets out there. And when you think of the very best out there, the likes of Astro\u2019s A40, Steelseries\u2019 Pro Wireless, and Sennheiser\u2019s GSP 670 all spring to mind\u2026 except unlike all the aforementioned models, the Elite Pro 2 is wired.",
    "It\u2019s not a straight fight, then. Wired models are becoming increasingly rare at this price point, and although they still offer a response time and fidelity that wireless equivalents can\u2019t quite match in pure numbers, the sheer quality of wireless cans in recent years has seen most of us ditch the cables. The Elite Pro 2 gives us a compelling reason to rethink, though.",
    "First on that list is the comfort. As a journalist who\u2019s often stayed in hotels booked on the company dime, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve slept on mattresses with less padding than these. It\u2019s an absolutely phenomenal wedge of high quality, super-squishy memory foam surrounding each earcup, and just as with Razer\u2019s foam earpads there\u2019s a tiny recess for glasses frames which shows how much attention Turtle Beach\u2019s designers are paying to comfort.",
    "There\u2019s a high degree of rotational movement to each earcup too, both at the headband and on a concertina-like joint at the driver. While all those axes of movement mean it\u2019s not totally silent as it adjusts to your head movements, neither is it noticeably loud.",
    "It\u2019s comfortable. You get it. But the groundwork in ergonomics is matched when it comes to sound. This is always a matter of taste, of course, but to this reviewer\u2019s ears the powerful thwomp delivered by an exaggerated low-end spike in the hardware EQ profile works brilliantly in-game.",
    "No, they\u2019re not a set of Beyerdynamic studio cans and they don\u2019t give anything close to a flat response, but unless you were hoping to use the Elite Pro 2 with all your devices, and possibly mix Brian Eno\u2019s next album with it, that\u2019s not a problem.",
    "As can sometimes happen with 50mm drivers and a large chamber around the ear formed by the earcup, there is some small compromise on clarity here, but you really have to A-B test with another headset to pick out the details that get lost in the Elite Pro 2\u2019s storm of thunderous bass. TLDR: it makes guns sound glorious, less so delicate classical music recordings that have been painstakingly digitally restored from scratchy vinyl. The mic can\u2019t match this powerful sound, though - as with other Turtle Beach models we\u2019ve tested, it sounds thin and a little weak, although it\u2019s clear enough for Discord chatter and playcalling without issues.",
    "A word on the setup: this particular model is compatible with either PC, PS4 or PS5 via USB and SP/DIF connections, but there\u2019s an Xbox and PC variant too for Team Green members. In either scenario, it\u2019s not the cleanest setup in the world.",
    "Breaking the signal chain along your cable is Turtle Beach\u2019s impressively titled Superamp, which turns a 3.5mm audio jack connection into a USB input to your output device.",
    "Without the use of an additional app, controls on the Superamp are limited to volume and.... Message ends. It\u2019s a lovely volume dial, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s notched, and the lighting\u2019s quite precise as it fills a bar to indicate your current level.",
    "The mic mute, meanwhile, is controlled by an inline switch on the 3.5mm cable which feels like an odd layout. Most of the control is handled by a third method, though: Turtle Beach\u2019s app. The app works fine and offers a few EQ presets in addition to chatmix and monitoring gain (the Superamp has a 3.5mm monitoring input), but this combination of control layouts feels like the Elite Pro 2\u2019s component parts have been retrofitted to work together. It\u2019s not very becoming of the model name.",
    "The decision you face is whether you can put up with a couple of extra cables dangling around, yet another app on your smartphone home screen, and a Superamp to house\u2026 somewhere, in the name of great sound and comfort. There are certainly more elegant setups out there, but there\u2019d be no buyer\u2019s remorse from anyone who slips the Elite Pro 2 over their ears."
