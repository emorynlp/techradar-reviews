    "Going by a few online reviews left by customers, we can assume that RAM Tracking offers long-term contracts of 3, 4 and 5-years in length. There is no mention of a monthly or short-term contract.

    "The software RAM Tracking offers helps businesses in creating efficient routing plans, cutting down the admin time required in route planning and other activities. It also ensures driver safety by keeping a check on the vehicle\u2019s speed, plus the software provides accurate ETAs for better client satisfaction, enabling re-routing options, accurate client billing and more.",
    "Drivers often follow their favorite route regardless of whether it is the most fuel and time-efficient one, potentially delaying deliveries as well as incurring extra expenses. RAM Tracking not only helps the operators to create routes efficiently but it also helps them in ensuring that drivers follow the assigned route.",
    "Other key features are:",
