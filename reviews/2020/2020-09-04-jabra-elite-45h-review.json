  "summary": "The best value on-ear headphones you could buy?",
  "verdict": "The Jabra Elite 45h are more convenient, better built and \u2013 most crucially of all \u2013 better sounding than they have any right to be at this money. They\u2019re not absolutely perfect, but then they cost 20% of headphones that are.",
  "pros": [
    "Weighty, balanced sound",
    "Impressive battery life",
    "Useful app"

  "cons": [
    "Leak sound somewhat",
    "Iffy call quality",
    "Can heat your ears more than a little"

    "Having established its credentials as manufacturer of some of the very best true wireless earbuds and Bluetooth earphones around, Jabra\u2019s now turned its full attention to wireless on-ear headphones. The Elite 45h are nominally a replacement for the company\u2019s Move Style wireless on-ears \u2013 and their combination of colossal battery life, fully competitive specification, and decently realized sound quality puts them right up near the top of the class.",
    "For just $79 / \u00a369/ AU$99, Jabra has wrapped Bluetooth 5 connectivity, 40mm full-range dynamic drivers and a smattering of physical push-button controls in a wireless on-ear frame. Faux leather and memory foam, combined with winningly un-creaky plastic, make for a comfortable fit (even if the earpads themselves absorb ear-heat quite quickly and then give it straight back).",
    "There\u2019s voice control available from Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. Jabra\u2019s Sound+ control app even walks you through a brief hearing test to establish exactly how the EQs should be set to best suit your ears. By the standards of overtly affordable headphones, the Elite 45h are feature-packed.",
    "And who\u2019s about to argue with 50 hours of battery life from a single charge? There are very few headphones around, at any price, that can challenge that figure \u2013 and the Jabras will go for another 10 hours after just 15 minutes of USB-C charging.",
    "The Elite 45h don\u2019t feel all that special, it\u2019s true \u2013 the plastics are a little hard, and the padding on the headband really couldn\u2019t be any thinner. But context is everything, and with the price uppermost in your mind there\u2019s really not much to complain about here. And despite the fairly prosaic nature of the materials, the Jabras are properly constructed, fold fairly flat and feel like they\u2019ll stand up to quite a lot of careless handling.",
    "Best of all, the Elite 45h sound quite a lot more expensive than they are. The highest frequencies are never far from sibilance, admittedly, and bass can occasionally sound slightly estranged \u2013 but it\u2019s all about context, remember? The Jabras don\u2019t emphasize any part of the frequency range, they uncover plenty of detail, they\u2019re punchily controlled and an all-around fully enthusiastic listen \u2013 which ought to make them sound like worthy of anyone\u2019s money.",
    "The Jabra Elite 45H were released in June 2020, having been announced at CES 2020 back in January.",
    "They\u2019re available to buy for $79 / \u00a369 / AU$99, making them cheaper than many of the best wireless headphones of 2020 \u2013 admittedly many of the pricier models come with extra features like noise cancellation, but the Jabras still offer a long battery life, support for voice control, and sound quality that you might expect from more expensive headphones.",
    "\u2018Functional\u2019 is perhaps the best way to describe the design of the Jabra Elite 45h \u2013 but then pretty much every pair of on-ear headphones look functional, doesn\u2019t it? There\u2019s not a lot of scope here for showy design flourishes.",
    "At 160g the 45h are light enough to remain comfortable for hours on end, and while you may have to fiddle with the fit just a little to get the earcups to sit flush on your ears, once they\u2019re in position they feel secure.",
    "Part of that pleasantly light weight build, is due to the fact that Jabra has specified some fairly thin plastics \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing wrong with the way the 45h are put together, and there are no creaks or groans from the frame when it\u2019s on your head. No matter how securely you position them on your ears, though, you won\u2019t be able to prevent some sound leaking out.",
    "The earcups articulate on their yokes to fold pretty much flat, and the looks are kept clean thanks to the headband adjustment arms being concealed in the headband itself. There are no stops or detents, but once you\u2019ve got the correct amount of adjustment the Jabras will maintain their position quite happily.",
    "The right earcup is doing all the work as far as the physical interface is concerned. There\u2019s a slider for \u2018power on / off / Bluetooth pairing\u2019, a USB-C input for the rare times you\u2019ll need to charge the battery, a three-button array covering \u2018volume up / down\u2019, \u2018skip forwards / backwards\u2019 and \u2018play / pause\u2019, and one further button to summon your voice assistant of choice.",
    "There\u2019s a two-mic array built into the right earcup, too - and in truth it\u2019s perhaps the least impressive aspect of the Jabras\u2019 performance. The company\u2019s claiming some noise reduction on outgoing voice signals and wind noise protection, but in any event calls suffer from extraneous noise of all kinds. Bounce-back of your speaking voice, wind noise, otherwise-inaudible sounds of the frame flexing\u2026 if you prioritize call quality over sound quality, the 45h may not be for you.",
    "The Sound+ app is a fair bit more impressive. It features a few EQ presets, as well as five-band custom equalization and the ability to both name and save a custom preset. On first acquaintance it\u2019ll ask your age (rude) and then run through a few test tones to find out what sort of state your hearing is in \u2013 some mild adjustment to the Jabras\u2019 default EQ will then follow. There are numerous other options to make your 45h experience as personal as you like \u2013 and the app, mercifully, proves stable throughout.",
    "If the idea of a \u2018perky\u2019 sonic signature appeals, you should read on. The Jabra Elite 45h have almost more perk than they know what to do with. If \u2018perky\u2019 sounds tiring to you, though, you might want to go and have a nice lie down while the rest of us discuss just how lively and up-front the 45h sound.",
    "There\u2019s real vigor and enthusiasm to the way the Jabras deliver music. From the foot-to-the-floor attack of Neil Young\u2019s Rockin\u2019 in the Free World to the rather more measured No Church on Sunday by Princess Chelsea, the 45h are an animated, up-and-at-\u2019em listen with little in the way of patience.",
    "Tonally, there\u2019s not a lot to take issue with here. The 45h are notably confident where low frequencies are concerned, and while there\u2019s not much wrong with the extension or control of bass notes, their forthright nature can sometimes make them sound slightly dislocated from all the frequency information above them. However, the bottom end is nicely detailed, and there\u2019s decent discipline where individual notes or hits start and stop.",
    "There\u2019s similar animation in the midrange, so singers really sound like they\u2019re giving it everything they\u2019ve got (even if, as with Princess Chelsea, they\u2019re shooting for \u2018remote\u2019 and \u2018detached\u2019). Again, detail levels are impressively high \u2013 and there\u2019s enough space on the Jabra soundstage to allow a vocalist as much room to maneuver as they need.",
    "A few problems lurk at the top of the frequency range, though. Treble always sounds a bit edgy when it\u2019s delivered by headphones as lively and engaged as these, and on plenty of occasions the 45h can sound this close to becoming downright aggressive. It never quite happens, though \u2013 the Jabras stay just about on the right side of the line. It\u2019s possible to finesse the treble response in the app, of course \u2013 but the range of adjustment is too subtle to make a significant difference.",
    "In most other respects, too, the 45h give a confident account of themselves. It almost goes without saying that they\u2019re as dynamic as you like, more than willing to shift up from \u2018quiet\u2019 to \u2018loud\u2019 \u2013 and, ideally, \u2018louder still\u2019. To their credit, the Jabras maintain what poise they have even if you decide to really pour on the volume \u2013 the three-dimensionality of their soundstage doesn\u2019t disappear just because things are louder.",
    "Yes, you may only play at a moderate volume to achieve it \u2013 but there\u2019s no arguing with 50 hours of playback from a single charge of the battery. Off the top of our heads, we can\u2019t think of a rival pair that can top this kind of stamina. And should the worst happen, the 45h can be fully charged from flat in around 90 minutes.",
    "There\u2019s no pizzaz (or, more accurately, no aptX capability) where the Jabras\u2019 Bluetooth implementation is concerned, but Bluetooth 5 is more than adequate for getting Hi-Res Audio streams from the likes of Primephonic or Tidal on board. And having made a wireless connection, the 45h are inclined to hold on to it \u2013 for once, a quoted range of 10m turns out to be pretty accurate."
