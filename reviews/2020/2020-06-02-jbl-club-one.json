    "If you compiled a list of every pair of wireless active noise-cancelling headphones by every brand currently building them, what you\u2019d end up with wouldn\u2019t be a list so much as a directory. You can\u2019t move for them, can you?",
    "And it can be hard to stand out in a crowd when the market-place is as crowded as this. Even a company with the history, the legacy and the cachet of JBL has had problems making a dent on the wireless active noise-cancelling over-ear headphones market. But, undeterred, JBL is back with its \u2018Club\u2019 range - and leading the assault is the JBL Club One.",
    "As far as looks, feel, build quality and specification go, the Club One seems about as serious and determined an attempt to impose itself on this market as JBL has ever mustered. But when you\u2019re going up against the likes of Bose, Bowers & Wilkins, Sennheiser and Sony, ticking those four boxes is just the tip of the iceberg...",
    "JBL debuted the Club One at CES 2020, and released them to the world in the first half of 2020. In terms of price, you're looking at \u00a3300 / $350 / AU$500, which puts them directly against the Sony WH-1000XM3 and Bose NC 700.",
    "How do they stack up? Well, Sony\u2019s universally admired WH-1000XM3s remains the one to beat - and with rumors of the imminent Sony WH-1000XM4 getting louder and louder, there may well be XM3 deals to be had. And it\u2019s equally worthwhile checking out Bose\u2019s elegant Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 - it\u2019s pricier, yes, and no more enjoyable in musical terms, but its nose-cancelling is phenomenal. Plus it\u2019s the best-looking pair of headphones Bose has turned out in ages.",
    "Considering how little scope there is to fiddle with the basic design of over-ear headphones, JBL has done well to make the Club One as discreetly distinctive as it has. If you can call a black-on-black colorway \u2018distinctive\u2019, anyhow.",
    "Despite a fairly porky 379g weight, the Club One is comfortable to wear - even for extended periods. A lot of that is down the well-judged padding of the leather-covered headband and the equally judicious balance of leather and memory foam that make up the earpads. The \u2018pads are attached to plastic earcups, which feel robust and resist fingerprint marks well - they use metal yokes (which have just a little forward/backward articulation) to attach to the headband.",
    "The headband itself is equally black and equally metallic, and the sliding action that helps them get a good fit on your head feels more than sturdy enough. When not in use, Club One can fold up almost into a ball for ease of transportation.",
    "JBL has kept these metal elements nice and slender, which means there\u2019s some braided cabling running from the top of each earcup into the headband \u2013 somehow this looks purposeful enough to give a little visual boost to the Club One\u2019s \u2018pro\u2019 credentials. The bottom of each side of the headband has a plastic cap bearing the legend \u2018CLUB\u2019 in black, while the outside of each earcup features the \u2018JBL\u2019 logo in black too. There\u2019s a narrow and stylised shiny silver \u2018circle\u2019 around each earcup too and, well, that\u2019s about it. Compare this level of branding to JBL\u2019s recent efforts in headphone design and the Club One, while strong lookers, are remarkably discreet.",
    "Along with the headphones themselves, the box contains a hard-ish travel case - Club One fold usefully small, and the case is nicely compact as a consequence. There\u2019s also a USB-C cable for charging the 730mAh lithium-ion battery, a 1m 3.5mm-3.5mm cable with an in-line remote control plus mic and a coiled 1.5m 3.5mm-3.5mm cable too. Both cables can accept the 3.5mm-6.3mm adapter that\u2019s provided. And completing a nap hand of connectivity, Club One comes complete with a flight adapter.",
    "JBL is claiming a whopping 45 hours of wireless playback time, or 23 wireless hours if noise-cancelling is engaged. Use them with a cable and noise-cancelling on, and 25 hours should be yours. From flat to full should take a couple of hours, and a 15-minute charge should hold you for a couple of hours of playback time.",
    "As far as the \u2018wireless\u2019 aspect of Club One goes, JBL has specified Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. This is more than enough to get the quite-important \u2018Hi-Res Audio\u2019 logo onto the packaging and, even more importantly, hi-res audio files into the headphones. If you subscribe to Tidal Masters, Qobuz Studio Premier or any of the other high-quality music streaming services, Club One should really make the most of it.",
    "The Club One can accept multi-point Bluetooth connection, too. It\u2019s possible to wirelessly pair two sources to the headphones at a time \u2013 although obviously it\u2019s only possible to listen to one at a time.",
    "Sound is delivered by a pair of 40mm graphene free-edge dynamic drivers. These, unusually, are visible in the earcups \u2013 they sit behind a metal grille which itself is behind a protective silk-like covering. Their dull orange finish adds a colorful bit of pizzazz to the Club One\u2019s otherwise quite stern monochromatic color palette.",
    "In terms of \u2018active noise-cancelling\u2019, JBL has managed to give itself a point of difference in comparison to competing designs by specifying and implementing an \u2018adaptive\u2019 system. Rather than offering degrees of noise-cancellation, Club One simply has \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 settings \u2013 but when noise-cancellation is \u2018on\u2019, the mic array monitors ambient conditions as often as 50,000 times per second and adjusts noise-cancellation accordingly. According to JBL, this system is sensitive enough to take things like hair- or glasses-movement into account. Owning neither glasses nor hair, we can only take the company\u2019s word for it.",
    "The edge of the right-hand earcup features a USB-C input, a 3.5mm analogue socket, and a rocker control governing volume up/down and play/pause. On the left-hand edge there\u2019s power on/off, Bluetooth pairing, another 3.5mm analogue socket and a \u2018smart ambient\u2019 button that can either boost external sound (\u2018ambient aware\u2019), drop the level of your music at the same time (\u2018talkthru\u2019), or defeat the Bluetooth connection while maintaining noise-cancellation (\u2018silent now\u2019).",
    "In the centre of the left-hand earcup there\u2019s a big, bold push/push button for summoning some voice assistance with support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.",
    "So far, so pretty much par for the course - but the \u2018My JBL Headphones\u2019 app (Android and iOS) brings an impressive degree of customisation to the Club One experience. As well as the option to assign \u2018ambient aware\u2019 or \u2018talkthru\u2019 to the control button on the left-hand earcup, or to engage or disengage active noise-cancelling, there\u2019s a lot of scope for EQ adjustment. It\u2019s possible to set your of bespoke levels, or enjoy sound as tailored by five different DJs in the \u2018DJ Signature\u2019 section of the app.",
    "With all EQ adjustments defeated and a Tidal-derived 16bit/44.1kHz file of The Specials\u2019 eponymous debut album playing, Club One doesn\u2019t procrastinate. Without the headphones being in any way pushy about it, the recording is organised and explained unequivocally.",
    "At the bottom of the frequency range there\u2019s weight, momentum and texture. Bass guitar notes begin with straight-edged alacrity and decay just as promptly, so they underpin the recording without dragging at tempos or swamping the information above them. This combination of rapidity and substance is beyond quite a few rival headphone designs, but JBL has made Club One sound like brisk, detailed bass information is the most natural thing in the world.",
    "A switch to Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s Let\u2019s Do It allows the JBLs to demonstrate similar surety where midrange fidelity is concerned. The purity of tone and effortless precision of Fitzgerald\u2019s singing is described in full - the controlled vibrato, the tiny palate noises, even the breath-management is given a little space to make itself heard. There\u2019s nothing uptight or analytical about the way Club One delivers the recording \u2013 the languid arrangement rolls along at its own speed \u2013 but nevertheless there\u2019s a natural sort of immediacy to the presentation that\u2019s very listenable.",
    "Up at the top of the frequency range, Club One displays a rather polite level of attack to Antiguo Automata Mexicano\u2019s Rother, Dinger, You and Me. Push the volume northwards and the JBLs can be provoked into some treble bite, but at more realistic levels there\u2019s just about enough shine to balance out the robust low-end reproduction. Rolling off higher frequencies in this manner can make for an easier and more comfortable ride in the long term, but it doesn\u2019t really help the tune drive forward in the manner it should.",
    "A desire for a little more high-end positivity might send you into the EQ settings of the \u2018My JBL Headphones\u2019 app \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly possible to add a little more top-end brilliance to the Club One sound without skewing the overall reproduction too badly.",
    "With noise-cancelling engaged, there\u2019s a definite reduction in external interference with very little of the \u2018pressurisation\u2019 sensation some alternative designs can introduce. But while the JBLs might well be analyzing your environmental circumstances thousands of times a second, Club One can\u2019t entirely dismiss the noise of concentrated traffic or enraged seagulls. Mind you, very few headphones can handle The Seagull Test.",
    "As far as looks, build, features and sound quality go, there\u2019s very little to find fault with here. Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM3 might have better sound quality thanks to the amount of high-end presence it delivers, but the JBL can compete across the board \u2013 even its adaptive noise-cancellation proves successful.",
    "If you want an alternative to the \u2019me too!\u2019 Bose and Sony default choices, the JBL Club One should be one of the pairs you listen to."
