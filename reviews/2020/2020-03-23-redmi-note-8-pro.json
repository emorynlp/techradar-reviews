  "verdict": "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro has a price tag that places it in the \u2018budget phone\u2019 category, but lots of its features like the 64MP main camera, big battery, and FHD+ display, make it feel like a decent mid-ranger instead. The 3.5mm headphone jack and microSD card support are important additions too, enough perhaps to make up for a few shortcomings like its bloatware, the addition of some unnecessary cameras, and a design that's a bit chunky.",

    "Redmi is Xiaomi\u2019s budget phone brand, but while its phones always have impressively low prices, they bring some decent features to the party too, and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is perhaps the best example of this.",
    "The Redmi Note 8 Pro represents the most top-end of the Redmi Note 8 series, although there\u2019s not too much in common between the phones beyond the user interface. And despite being more advanced than a few other Redmi phones, the Note 8 Pro is still decidedly affordable.",
    "The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a collection of features you wouldn\u2019t expect in a phone this affordable \u2013 there\u2019s a 64MP main camera with three other snappers, a large Full HD+ display, a big battery, and a decent chipset. So the phone has plenty of aspects you wouldn\u2019t expect given its price tag, but does that mean there\u2019s a catch?",
    "The Redmi Note 8 Pro is available online, via Mi.com, Amazon or certain phone retailers depending on your region.",
    "You can pick the phone up for $399 / \u00a3229 (roughly AU$600) if you want 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but if you want to downgrade the storage to 64GB it will cost you $349 / \u00a3209 (around AU$500).",
    "The cost in both cases is a lot higher in the US, so it\u2019s likely you\u2019re paying for import costs too. In the UK, though, it\u2019s a pretty affordable price.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro looks surprisingly like the the Realme X2 Pro, so if you\u2019ve seen that phone you\u2019ve basically seen this one. It\u2019s a big, fairly heavy phone, that\u2019s also pretty thick.",
    "On the back there\u2019s a vertical camera bump in the top center, one which also houses a fingerprint sensor (which looks like one of the lenses at first glance). There\u2019s also another lens to the side. A volume rocker and power button sit on the right-hand edge of the device, and on the bottom there's a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack.",
    "This back is glass, which is fairly rare at this price tag where most phones have plastic rears.",
    "The Redmi Note 8 Pro is rather chunky, thanks partly to the 6.53-inch screen, which is broken up by a teardrop notch at the top. This is a 1080 x 2340 LCD display, which is the display tech we\u2019d expect in a phone of this price, and while the colors are perhaps a little sub-par, the reasonably high resolution partly makes up for it.",
    "While a big display is good for viewing content, social media and more, the phone is arguably too big \u2013 we had trouble reaching the fingerprint scanner at times, so some users might find it prohibitively large.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 64MP main camera, which is one of its big draws, but there\u2019s also an 8MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensor present.",
    "The 64MP camera takes pretty decent-looking pictures when you use it in a well-lit environment, so if you like taking pictures of natural settings, or outdoors in any way, this could be a really good tool for you. Saying that, the pixel size is pretty small, so low-light shooting (and night mode) takes snaps that are quite noisy.",
    "The ultra-wide snapper takes pictures that are\u2026 well, very wide, as the name suggests. Pictures look reasonable, but there does seem to be a little distortion at the edges of images, more than perhaps in other handsets which have distortion-cancelling software.",
    "As you can expect from 2MP sensors, the macro and depth-sensing cameras don\u2019t seem super useful. Macro pictures are pretty low-res, although they are fairly bright, and we didn\u2019t notice the depth sensor having an impact on picture quality when we shot with or without it (the latter of which was achieved by putting a finger in the way).",
    "On the front there's a 20MP selfie camera, which is a pretty high-res snapper for a budget phone, and we did think the pictures taken on this looked quite good. If you\u2019re a prolific selfie taker, this could be a decent phone for you if you\u2019re on a budget.",
    "The battery in the Redmi Note 8 Pro is 4,500mAh, which is a good size, but then lots of budget phones have big batteries.",
    "We didn\u2019t test the Note 8 Pro enough to draw a final verdict on the battery life, but our initial impression is that it\u2019s quite good. We\u2019d expect the phone to last at least a day from a full battery, perhaps even getting you part way through the second day before you need to power it up again.",
    "Speaking of which, the Redmi Note 8 Pro supports 18W fast charging, which is roughly average for a phone at this price, and while charging it didn\u2019t take too long, it wasn\u2019t lightning-fast either.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro runs Android 9 Pie out of the box, but it can be upgraded to Android 10, and Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI 11 is laid over the top.",
    "This is mainly an aesthetic change, but it\u2019s worth noting the phone comes with a fair few bloatware apps that you might find yourself deleting straight away, like Opera, a web browser app that\u2019s redundant when you\u2019ve got Chrome, and the Mi Community and Mi Store apps, which few people will likely use.",
    "The chipset here is a MediaTek Helio G90T, which isn\u2019t exactly the most premium piece of kit (MediaTek typically makes mid-range and budget phone internals), but for this low price you could do a lot worse, especially since this is one of the company\u2019s better chipsets.",
    "A surprising spec given the low price point is the fact that there\u2019s 6GB of RAM here, as many other phones at this price tag would have just 4GB.",
    "When swiping between home screens and menus the phone didn\u2019t feel sluggish or slow, which is a big difference between this and the Redmi Note 8T. Gaming felt pretty snappy too, if we didn\u2019t boost the graphics too high, so if you\u2019re a mobile gamer this might be one of the best phones at its price.",
    "It\u2019s also worth noting that the Redmi Note 8 Pro could take multiple 64MP pictures in quick succession without slowing down, freezing or crashing, which is a sign that there\u2019s some decent optimization at play here.",
    "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro could be one of the best phones at its price, as it would very easily pass as a mid-ranger in quite a few ways. In fact, as we stated earlier in this review, it has a lot in common with the Realme X2 Pro, which goes for quite a bit more.",
    "Sure, the phone is a little larger than we\u2019d like, which may put off some users. There\u2019s a little more bloatware than we\u2019d like too, although a quick deletion spree should see off those offenders.",
    "The screen quality, main camera specs and battery life though are all impressive for the price, so when we\u2019ve conducted our full review we\u2019d expect to see this rank quite well in our list of the best cheap phones, and best Xiaomi phones."
