  "author": "sead-fadilpasic",
  "summary": "It\u2019s hard to say if it even works",
  "verdict": "Despite its name, IdealVPN is far from ideal. No matter how many times we tried, we just couldn\u2019t get it to connect and customer support was utterly unhelpful. There are other problems too, as well as some potential upsides (like torrenting support) but they\u2019re all overshadowed by the sheer general incompetence of its team.",
  "pros": [
    "Allows torrenting",
    "Website in multiple languages"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Doesn\u2019t work",
    "No native apps"

    "IdealVPN is a French-based VPN provider that has been offering (well, has tried to offer) its privacy services since 2010. Sadly, we aren\u2019t even sure if it\u2019s still even active since we couldn\u2019t get its VPN service to run nor did we manage to establish any contact with customer support.",
    "As usual in this industry, IdealVPN gives you several subscription options to choose from, with pricing expressed in euros. There\u2019s the monthly one at \u20ac4.90/month ($5.80), 6-month at \u20ac24.90 ($29.40) every six months (equal to $4.90/month), and 1-year at \u20ac49.90/year ($58.90/year, equal to $4.90/month).",
    "The 6-month plan includes a 3-day free trial, the only trick is that you have to leave your payment details and remember to cancel the account unless you want to pay for its entire duration. Fair enough.",
    "There\u2019s no mention of a refund or money-back guarantee \u201cexcept in special cases a appreciation [sic] of IdealVPN, especially in the case of inability of the user to establish a first connection.\u201d Considering our experience with its non-working service, you may have a strong case there.",
    "Funnily enough, IdealVPN prohibits simultaneous connections using the same account (as per its Terms and Conditions), \u201cunless they are provided to you by a formal offer\u201d. Since the number of allowed simultaneous connections isn\u2019t mentioned in the description of any of the offers, we were left baffled by what actually did the provider mean by this.",
    "IdealVPN isn\u2019t worth your time. Instead, you should give chance to some of the best VPN platforms on the market, headed by the celebrated ExpressVPN, followed by its very capable contenders like NordVPN, Surfshark, CyberGhost, and many others.",
    "All of them can provide more than simple VPN accessibility (which is the bare minimum we couldn\u2019t even get with IdealVPN) and you\u2019d be getting your money\u2019s worth in terms of service quality, server quantity, polite and speedy customer service, as well as numerous features, options, and capabilities.",
    "Many VPN providers can get you access to your favorite streaming content on various platforms like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, or Hulu that might not be available in all regions. Whether IdealVPN might be one of them is impossible to know, as there\u2019s no information available on the matter and the provider wouldn\u2019t even connect for us, to begin with.",
    "IdealVPN is a French-based VPN provider, and that\u2019s about as much as you can learn from its website about the company itself. Its servers are located in Germany, the Netherlands, and France but we have no idea how many there are and we\u2019re still waiting for a response to our email asking about this.",
    "The website seems to be available in over 40 different languages, including Arabic, Vietnamese, Bosnian, Catalonian, Japanese, and many others, but we have come to realize that these are more of Google Translate-esque interpretations that are teeming with mistakes and nonsensical sentences.",
    "Not much information about privacy and security is offered on the website, but what we do know is that the platform uses the VPN PPTP protocol with which you can create the connection on your own device. It also deploys the 128-bit encryption that is somewhat weaker than the typically used 256-bit algorithm.",
    "Torrenting is supported, except on the French servers. If you can get it to work, that is - as we couldn\u2019t.",
    "IdealVPN says it monitors the time, date, and duration of your VPN connection, as well as bandwidth used. It claims it uses this data to enforce its terms and conditions and \u201cto generate statistics and optimize the quality and reliability of service.\u201d Without much success, if we may add.",
    "There are no native clients, but the provider claims its service can be enabled on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. However, we couldn\u2019t find instructions for installing it on Android and iOS anywhere on the website.",
    "There\u2019s also a beta version of the vpnGuardian app, that is supposed to be an assisting VPN client or something, but we\u2019re not sure.",
    "Other than the installation manuals for the few supported platforms and a decent enough blog (although only in French), there isn\u2019t much information on the website, and an actual knowledge base seems to be too much to ask for.",
    "The provider claims to have a 24/7 support team you can reach via email or contact form but we so far had no luck in getting a response to our queries.",
    "Although it claims its lack of native clients makes it easy to set up, this is hardly the case. Instead of having a simple app that you just download, install, and you\u2019re good to go, not having such an option means you have to carefully follow the instructions on the website and hope you\u2019ve done everything right and that the instructions weren\u2019t wrong.",
    "The only easy thing was installing the vpnGuardian app but we\u2019re still struggling to see the point of it as it wasn\u2019t even working.",
    "Since neither the vpnGuardian app nor the PPTP connection via the device wouldn\u2019t work, no matter how many times we tried, our attempts at testing the download speeds were futile. Similar complaints could be found on the provider\u2019s Facebook page.",
    "IdealVPN is a laughably poor VPN service, one that is very far away from major platforms such as ExpressVPN for many reasons but mainly for not being able to connect at all. This is followed by a total lack of communication from the customer support\u2019s side, absence of important information and native apps, and many other issues. Due to the awful experience in trying to test it, we aren\u2019t even sure why this provider still has half-decent reviews online."
