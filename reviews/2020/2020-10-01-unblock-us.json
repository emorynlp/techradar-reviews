    "Free trial",
    "Top speeds",
    "Unblocks Netflix",
    "30-day money-back guarantee"

    "Unblock-US is not a typical VPN service. Instead, it routes your DNS queries through its servers, changing your location based on the sites you visit. This allows you to access any type of blocked content, without any buffering or throttling.",
    "If such a platform won\u2019t work for you and you\u2019re looking for a full VPN with all its advantages, then we strongly advise you to consider one of the best VPN solutions.",
    "There are two subscription plans on the table: monthly and annual. The former will set you back by $4.99/month, while the annual includes a $10 discount and costs $49.90/year (equal to $4.16/month).",
    "This is a bit expensive considering we are not talking about a full VPN service here - and Unblock-Us can only be connected on one device at a time.",
    "If you don\u2019t think Unblock-Us is the right choice for you, the provider offers a one-week free trial, no credit card required. Full refunds are also issued to users who cancel their annual subscription within the first thirty days after the purchase.",
    "A full VPN service can provide all the features Unblock-Us doesn\u2019t, especially a top-of-the-range offering like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, CyberGhost or Surfshark.",
    "Unblock-Us can provide access to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, and other streaming services that might be unavailable in certain regions due to geographical restrictions.",
    "Unblock-Us is owned by the company NetProtect Ltd, headquartered in Nicosia, Cyprus. It operates with the help of 100 servers in 17 countries.",
    "To provide you with access to all sorts of content on the internet privately, Unblock-Us uses its SmartVPN. Unlike its SmartDNS technology, where it deploys a proxy to conceal the source of your IP address to the domains that request it, SmartVPN adds a layer of security to your connection.",
    "However, it doesn\u2019t encrypt user data, but \u201csimply seals the contents of your data for transport so that the information within cannot be tampered with. That means no more snooping on your DNS traffic by your cellular carrier, and no more spying on behalf of Google\u201d.",
    "We were surprised to see that the provider\u2019s website didn\u2019t have an HTTPS certificate and it asked us to disable our ad-blocker, which isn\u2019t very encouraging in terms of security. That said, at least its sign-up page, where you leave your personal information, is secure and protected by Trustwave\u2019s Trusted Commerce program.",
    "The company claims in its Privacy Policy that it doesn\u2019t collect or log any traffic or use of its services, nor does it store \u201cany of your data that passes through our servers, and we never manipulate the content you access.\u201d It adds that it doesn\u2019t \u201cprovide information that we do have unless we are legally required to\u201d.",
    "In other words, some data does seem to be collected and if an authority asks it to hand over any information about you, it will comply. But since Unblock-Us states it doesn\u2019t collect any traffic data, sensitive information about your online activities should be safe.",
    "Unfortunately, we have no choice but to trust its word, because an external expert has not yet been brought in to verify the service's no-logging claims.",
    "Unblock-Us can be configured on all major computers and mobile devices, as well as various other devices, including Apple TV, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Wii, Amazon Fire TV, routers, and so on.",
    "However, there are no native apps for its SmartVPN service, so you\u2019ll have to make do with third-party software like OpenVPN or Tunnelblick, which can be a bit confusing for a beginner.",
    "Setup guides are available on the website and they\u2019re very detailed. Besides the setup walkthroughs, Unblock-Us\u2019 website also includes a support center with useful articles on various topics, such as billing, sites and channels, announcements, etc. If the website can\u2019t help with your problem, then you can contact human customer support via web form or phone.",
    "We tested the download speeds of the provider\u2019s service and were quite pleased. Since Unblock-Us doesn\u2019t route your traffic through any servers but just assigns you a new IP address, this means there were no losses in download or upload speeds during our testing. However, picking a server manually is impossible as the provider chooses the server closest to you automatically.",
    "Unfortunately, there are no native clients so if you\u2019re not used to such a system, you might feel overwhelmed and if you run into any problems, reading the log files might be overly complicated and confusing. Also, some may not be comfortable with tampering with their adapter options, which Unblock-US\u2019s DNS service requires.",
    "Unblock-Us has some strong unblocking capabilities, but that\u2019s as far as it goes. It\u2019s not a full VPN platform, so you shouldn\u2019t expect any fancy privacy features and options, thousands of servers, nor full identity protection, as you would with the industry\u2019s greatest performers such as ExpressVPN.",
    "It\u2019s great that Unblock-Us offers a free trial and 30-day money-back guarantee but the lack of native apps makes it less appealing to beginners."
