  "summary": "The Turtle Beach Stealth 600p has incredible sound hiding under a lot of plastic",
  "verdict": "Despite being a little too overloaded with plastic, we can't fault the sound quality of Turtle Beach's Stealth 600P gaming headset, and the battery life is solid too. For the $99/\u00a389 end of the console headset market, this is a strong choice overall.",
  "pros": [
    "Truly wonderful sound",
    "Improved comfort",
    "Tidy flip-to-mute mic",
    "15 hours of battery"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Heavy on the cheap plastic",
    "Mic isn\u2019t the best"

    "The original version of Turtle Beach\u2019s Stealth 600P (and its Xbox equivalent, the 600X) has been around for a few years now, delivering absolutely stellar surround sound and vaguely disappointing looks in equal measure. The audio really is that good though, so we were excited to hear about an updated \u2018Gen 2\u2019 model. And we were right to be.",
    "Priced at $99/\u00a389, it\u2019s entering the elbows-out end of the console headset market. Our current best overall console headset pick for 2020, the HyperX Cloud Revolver S, occupies that same price point, among formidable competition from Steelseries\u2019 Arctis 5 and the like.",
    "And at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like it commands that price tag. As with the older model, the predominantly plastic construction materials here look and feel on the cheap side. There\u2019s definitely been a visual refresh, and the earcup outers now feature a bold diagonal line break to accommodate a wider range of adjustment around the hinge, but in our subjective opinion this doesn\u2019t represent a step forwards aesthetically.",
    "With a substantially built headband though, It can take a knock without crumbling to bits, and whereas we had serious reservations about comfort and adjustability for different head sizes in our review of the original, the Gen 2 model sits more comfortably on the ears.",
    "Its foam pads around each earcup are covered in breathable fabric, and while it doesn\u2019t create that really snug fit you get from leatherette-finished memory foam earcups that tend to really pronounce the low-end, it\u2019s tight enough not to bob about when you move, without digging in over long sessions. The earcups are able to move pretty freely, so this should sit nicely around both smaller and larger heads.",
    "Setting it up on PS4\u2019s a breeze. Just pop the wireless receiver into a free USB slot, select the headset in your audio devices, hit the power button and you\u2019re done. Charging\u2019s handled via USB-C now and boasts a 15-hour life, which is more than ample. The same process works on PC, too.",
    "Most of the controls sit on the left earcup - power, a mode cycle, and a mic arm with a mute function built into the hinge mechanism all live here, along with the returning Superhuman Mode which amplified nearby in-game sounds, accessible via an additional tap of the power button.",
    "Characteristic of Turtle Beach\u2019s range as a whole, a series of pleasing bleeps and bloops lets you know what you\u2019ve just pressed and how many times, so you shouldn\u2019t have to take off your headset and examine it despite the buttons being placed in a relatively close cluster.",
    "Let\u2019s get to the sound, though: this is where the 600P really shines. The familiar smashes, sirens and footsteps of the GTA 5 loading menu absolutely come alive with the 600Ps on. Seriously \u2013 a game that came out 8 years ago suddenly sounds different and commands attention.",
    "All the more surprising is that unlike the previous Stealth 600, there\u2019s no virtual surround at work here. It just sounds like there is. Directional audio cues move front to back with real positional clarity, but this is a stereo set that\u2019s been engineered for a much wider soundstage than usual. To that end, the shape of the earcups has been redesigned into a \u2018D\u2019 and the 50mm drivers have been tuned to offer wider articulation around your ears.",
    "There are four EQ presets here but to varying degrees they all retain the 600P\u2019s essential quality: razor-sharp high end and a really cinematic bass response that works perfectly for first-person games. It\u2019s not an all-rounder that can be tamed back for neutral EQ music appreciation, but honestly we\u2019ve had so much fun cranking these up and enjoying how well they voice explosions and shattering car windows in Rockstar\u2019s veteran open world game that we barely care.",
    "The flip-to-mute mic is a nice touch, although the arm itself is quite stubby and there\u2019s not much repositioning to be done with it. Voice quality is clear although not quite as full-bodied as some pricier mics like Logitech\u2019s G Pro X and those on Razer\u2019s top-end models.",
    "Losing the cables matters to you",
    "Setup couldn\u2019t be much simpler with the Stealth 600P - plug in the USB receiver, power on, and forget about it. We had no dropouts, and the 15-hour battery life with USB-C charging means we\u2019re always exhausted before the headset is.",
    "You want to stay on brand with PS4\u2019s visuals",
    "Ok, no one\u2019s going to hang this one in the Louvre for future generations to enjoy, but the simple black and PS4-blue colour scheme works for those looking for a bit of consistency in their console setup.",
    "You\u2019re not always chatting",
    "The Stealth 600P\u2019s mic is serviceable enough for audio quality and noise cancelling, but the mic arm is a bit too small and lacks malleability. A very minor point for most of us, but those who spend a lot of time in voice chat might consider a rethink.",
    "You prefer a flatter response",
    "These cans are tuned to trick your ears into thinking you're hearing surround. For a more natural stereo soundstage, look elsewhere.",
    "You're clumsy",
    "Something about the feel of the plastic used in this model doesn't scream 'I sat on them but it was fine' to us.",
    "Comfort is your priority",
    "HyperX's headsets offer better padding and softer contact points for the same price."
