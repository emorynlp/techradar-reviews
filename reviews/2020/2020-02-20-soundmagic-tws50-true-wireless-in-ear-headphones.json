    "The SoundMAGIC TWS50 are the logical next step in the affordable audio brand's trajectory. Having enjoyed decent sales success and widespread critical acclaim with its very affordable E11C in-ear headphones, SoundMAGIC made them wireless with the similarly affordable E11BTs neckbuds.",
    "Now it\u2019s cut the remaining cord and served up the new true wireless earbuds, the TWS50. The company may have parked the \u2018E11\u2019 nomenclature for now, but don\u2019t be in any doubt \u2013 these are designed to continue the E11 story of delivering very acceptable sound and build quality at a price that will have some rival manufacturers wincing.",
    "The SoundMAGIC TWS50 are available to buy for $69 / \u00a379 / AU$155, making them pretty cheap for true wireless earbuds.",
    "For comparison, the Apple AirPods cost upwards of $159 / \u00a3159 / AU$249, while our top-performing earbuds, the Sony WF-1000XM3 cost $230 / \u00a3220 / AU$400.",
    "Cheaper true wireless earbuds are available, like the fantastic Cambridge Audio Melomania 1, and the cheap (but not great-sounding) JLab Go Airs.",
    "SoundMAGIC has ticked all the right boxes with the design of the TWS50. First off, they\u2019re discreet \u2013 no one wants their true wireless in-ears to make them look like they\u2019ve just left the bridge of the Starship Enterprise \u2013 and the TWS50 are small, light and, as a consequence, it\u2019s simple to achieve a comfortable fit. The choice of small, medium or large ear-tips provided in the package helps to achieve a satisfactory fit too.",
    "The touch-controls on each earbud are small but simple enough to find and use. The charging case (which holds around 24 hours of power, enough to recharge the TWS50s four times) is a circular puck sort of thing, with a rotating cover to reveal either the earbuds or the super-retro digital display which indicates remaining power.",
    "Neither the case nor the earbuds themselves feel anything special \u2013 they\u2019re light (45g for the case, just 4g each for the buds) and made of unapologetically hard, shiny plastic. But both feel sturdy enough, and their relative lack of luxuriousness is only in keeping with their price.",
    "Despite being among the more unobtrusive true wireless designs around, SoundMAGIC has found space for a 6mm neodymium full-range driver in each ear-bud. The TWS50s have an IPX7 rating, too, so getting them briefly wet shouldn\u2019t be a cause for alarm \u2013 and there\u2019s a choice of silicone tips in the package, so getting a snug and comfy fit should be straightforward.",
    "Wireless connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.0 - which is more than adequate for enjoying some high-resolution audio from the likes of TIDAL or Amazon Music HD.",
    "The touch controls can be used for answering or rejecting calls as well as controlling playback. If that\u2019s all a bit tiresome and hands-on, the SoundMAGICs are compatible with all Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa.",
    "The TWS50s pair quickly and without drama to our Sony Xperia 5 and, with a TIDAL Masters file of Tame Impala\u2019s Lost In Yesterday streaming, almost everything that makes SoundMAGIC\u2019s E11 models so enjoyable to listen to, and consequently such good value, is present here.",
    "They\u2019re quite an open, spacious listen, able to establish a stable and well defined soundstage. There\u2019s plenty of width to the presentation, and everything that\u2019s involved in the song\u2019s polite crescendos occupies its own pocket of space. Integration of each individual element is good despite this though, and the song has convincing overall coherence. Some less capable in-ear designs can present music as a collection of separate occurrences, but the TWS50s organize music well.",
    "Bass, while not the out-and-out punchiest you ever heard, is deep and textured, with enough detail to make even small tonal discrepancies apparent. The opposite end of the frequency range is rolled off just a little, which makes sense if you\u2019re listening to low-bitrate streams but is just a tiny bit galling when playing some full-fat Hi-Res files. In the middle of the frequency range there\u2019s sufficient space for a singer to stretch out a little \u2013 and, again, sufficient detail to make a vocalist\u2019s character explicit (or, in the case of Tame Impala, lack of character).",
    "Just as the TWS50s are able to convincingly combine the individual instrumental elements of a recording together, so they manage to travel from the top of the frequency range to the bottom smoothly. Beyond that slight sweetening of the highest treble sounds, nothing is overstated and nothing is underplayed.",
    "The SoundMAGICs have no problem dealing with the fervent harmonic dynamics of Anna Meredith\u2019s Nautilus either. The difference between blaring blown bass sounds and their electronic undercurrents is made apparent, and the amount of detail extracted means there\u2019s subtlety in among all the bluster.",
    "However, the same song\u2019s broad dynamics reveal a slight lack of TWS50 headroom \u2013 they\u2019re not quite able to make the distance between the recording\u2019s preposterous levels of attack and its brief moments of mercy quite as wide as it should be.",
    "In fact, the TWS50s don\u2019t have the sort of out-and-out volume some alternative designs can summon. Despite an ordinary-looking 107dB sensitivity, the earbuds just don\u2019t have it in them to completely mask the noise of the outside world \u2013 which is good news for your hearing in the long term, but bad news if you\u2019re the sort of listener who tries to provoke tinnitus in the name of excitement.",
    "All of the shortcomings mentioned, though \u2013 the lack of dynamic potency, the safety-first treble response, the rather hard and unyielding feel of the plastics used, the lack of really oppressive volume \u2013 need to be viewed in the context of the price. As it stands, the TWS50s have only two truly realistic rivals: Cambridge Audio\u2019s Melomania 1 and Lypertek\u2019s Tevi. And, the SoundMAGICs are handily cheaper than either of them.",
    "Not perfect, but way better than merely competent, the TWS50 are exactly what you\u2019d hope for from SoundMAGIC. It\u2019s not often that the most affordable option on any given shortlist turns out to be a bit of a bargain, but that\u2019s certainly the case here.",
    "They offer a wide, spacious soundstage, with a good, well balanced presentation, alongside a decent battery life and comfy fit \u2013 in short, if you're looking for some cheap AirPod-alternatives, the SoundMAGIC TWS50 are well worth a look."
