    "In the market for the best online fax services? Then it\u2019s worth giving HelloFax a close look. This electronic fax provider enables you to send and receive faxes using your existing fax number. Better yet, HelloFax integrates with a variety of cloud storage services. Unfortunately, though, it is relatively expensive, especially if you primarily need to send rather than receive faxes.",
    "HelloFax offers a free plan and three paid plans. The Free plan is essentially a trial, as you can only send five faxes per month and can\u2019t receive faxes with this option. The Home Office plan costs $9.99 per month and lets you send or receive up to 300 pages per month. You can also create up to five sender accounts, but you cannot port your existing fax number.",
    "If you want to keep your existing fax number, you\u2019ll need a Professional or Small Business plan. The Professional plan costs $19.99 per month and includes 500 monthly fax pages (sent or received) and 10 sender accounts. The Small Business plan costs $39.99 per month and includes 1,000 monthly fax pages and 20 user accounts.",
    "If you exceed your monthly page allowance, HelloFax charges $0.05 per extra page sent or received.",
    "HelloFax offers a handful of features that make this online fax service easier to use. First and foremost, it works well with your existing document services and processes. You can send a fax right from your email by sending attachments to the recipient\u2019s fax number @hellofax.com. HelloFax also integrates with a variety of cloud storage services, including DropBox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Evernote.",
    "Another major advantage to using HelloFax lies in the way the service deals with fax numbers. You can port your business\u2019s existing fax number to HelloFax with a Professional or Small Business account. In that case, when someone sends you a fax, it\u2019s automatically converted to a PDF document and emailed to you.",
    "In addition, if you create multiple sender accounts, every account can have its own fax number. That way, incoming faxes can go only to a single recipient instead of to everyone in your business.",
    "Getting started with HelloFax is extremely simple. You just need an email to sign up for an account, and you can invite others to create sender accounts from a Teams pane in your dashboard.",
    "Integrating with cloud storage services is also easy. In the Integrations dashboard panel, you\u2019ll find a list of all the providers that HelloFax currently works with. Just click Activate and sign into your cloud account to link it to HelloFax.",
    "The HelloFax interface is very user-friendly. When you log into your account, you\u2019ll find a menu on the left-hand side of the screen displaying your options. Notably, one of the dashboard panes enables you to see your entire fax history, which is helpful for monitoring what you sent and to whom, and whether it was received. Unfortunately, admins cannot easily monitor fax history for every user on a single HelloFax account.",
    "The other thing that HelloFax is missing is an address book. You can\u2019t store contacts, so you\u2019ll need to enter the recipient\u2019s fax number manually for every fax. It\u2019s not a huge deal, but this seems like something that the developers should have thought of.",
    "As for performance, we found that HelloFax works well. It struck us as odd that you can enter an email for the recipient\u2019s address, since this is functionally the same as email. But, when we sent a fax to a phone number, the system started dialing in about 20 seconds. We could also monitor the progress of the delivery using the fax history panel.",
    "HelloFax takes security extremely seriously. To start, the company makes clear that it collects minimal data from users and doesn\u2019t store the content of faxes. Moreover, you can contact the HelloFax support team at any time to request that any stored data the company has about you be deleted.",
    "When faxing, all documents are secured with transport layer security. For the short time that documents are resting on HelloFax\u2019s servers, they\u2019re secured with 256-bit AES encryption.",
    "Perhaps most importantly, HelloFax has an entire section of its website dedicated to security. The company is impressively transparent in this area.",
    "HelloFax offers technical support over email only during US Pacific business hours. The company\u2019s website has a wealth of documentation, including a video library that contains walkthroughs of many of HelloFax\u2019s team features. Just note that HelloFax\u2019s documentation is mixed in with that for HelloSign, its sister platform, and it can be difficult to figure out what settings are shared between the two services.",
    "HelloFax has some stiff competition in MetroFax and RingCentral Fax. MetroFax offers virtually all the same features except for cloud storage integration and charges a lot less. For example, sending and receiving 1,000 pages per month costs just $12.95 per month with MetroFax.",
    "RingCentral is better suited for high-volume faxing, since plans start at $22.99 per month for up to 1,500 pages sent and received. Both of these online fax services let you keep your existing fax number, just like HelloFax.",
    "Our HelloFax online fax review found that this service is a good option for most electronic fax users. Integration with widely used cloud storage services is a significant advantage, as is being able to keep your existing fax number. Still, the service is somewhat pricey if you send and receive faxes regularly, and it was missing simple features like an address book."
