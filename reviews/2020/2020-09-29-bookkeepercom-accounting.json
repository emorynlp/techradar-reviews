    "Bookkeeper.com bills itself as an all-in-one small business solution, which means that it covers several bases in one package. Therefore, alongside letting you tackle your accounts Bookkeeper.com can also help you take care of payroll, bill payments and tax matters too.",
    "The service is online and cloud-based, meaning there\u2019s the convenience of being able to access Bookkeeper.com wherever you need to, which might not always be when you're based in the office during the coronavirus crisis. Along with its one-stop array of services, Bookkeeper.com could be well suited if you\u2019re looking for a helping hand with your business tasks. That\u2019s because it comes with the added attraction of having real financial advisors available as part of the service.",
    "Variations on the accounting front include competitors such as Sage Business Cloud Accounting, QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks, Freeagent, GoSimpleTax, TaxCalc, Nomisma, ABC Self-Assessment, Crunch or Zoho Books.",
    "Admittedly, Bookkeeper.com does look quite pricey on the face of it. A Small Business package, for example, starts at $285 a month, which allows up to 125 transactions in the same time.",
    "The next package is Small Business Plus and that starts at $495 per month and allows 126 to 250 transactions monthly. A Small Business Advanced option is the last one on the Bookkeeper.com list and comes with a custom price tag for any businesses needing to process over 250 transactions per month.",
    "For any of these you\u2019ll need to make contact with the company, which is probably a good idea anyway so that you can pinpoint exactly what it is you need from the services of Bookkeeper.com.",
    "Even in its base level Small Business incarnation the package is a pretty good one with lots of features. You can reconcile bank and credit card accounts, along with being able to do the same for electronic transactions directly into QuickBooks.",
    "Regular tasks such as balance sheets, profit and loss, general ledger activity and cash flow statements are also handled.",
    "Added to that, there\u2019s general business consulting, strategic and tax planning plus training if it\u2019s needed. In addition, Bookkeeper.com also offers document storage and expense management. The other two Bookkeeper.com packages feature the same core list, but add on monthly performance reports too.",
    "With an intuitive browser-based dashboard along with the back-up of real people to support you then it\u2019s reasonable to expect Bookeeper.com to perform dependably. If you\u2019re already using QuickBooks then the service can also let you keep managing your business affairs using that platform, while their advisors can help you cover other tasks.",
    "Add-ons such as payroll tools and tax preparation advice from the team will also help ensure that the package performs as you\u2019d hope for what is a premium-priced package.",
    "You should find that Bookkeeper.com is fairly easy to get to grips with thanks to the added benefit of free financial advice and software training as part of the package. On top of that, the point behind Bookkeeper.com is that it's possible to work hand-in-hand with staff and advisors if you'd like them to take the lead on your accounting activities.",
    "They have teams of both accountants (CPAs) and enrolled agents (EAs) that can help you pick your way through anything and everything business related, including planning for tax returns.",
    "There are many different options when it comes to support from Bookeeper.com, with a Client Portal being one of the main benefits if you\u2019re a paid-up member. Elsewhere, inside the Client Center, which houses the Client Portal incidentally, there are calculators and tools, an area for client documents plus the ability to request an appointment amongst other features. Bookkeeper.com also has the usual ways of getting in touch, with web forms and chat-style tools that can be used to open a dialog with a member of staff.",
    "Bookkeeper.com does have plenty going for it, especially for the small business owner that needs some assistance along the way. Looking at the pricing you may think it's a little expensive, but having access to a team of qualified professionals could help you save your own time and money over the duration of a business year.",
    "We also like the way that there\u2019s plenty of training where needed, along with a cloud-based online setup that covers a multitude of accounting and bookkeeping tasks. It\u2019s a sizeable investment, but if you\u2019re looking to save time and enjoy accurate bookkeeping then this is an option that appears to be good value for money."
