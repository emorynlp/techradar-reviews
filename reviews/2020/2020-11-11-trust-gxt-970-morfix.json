  "verdict": "The Trust GXT 970 Morfix is a great budget option if you\u2019re an MMO/MOBA gamer, especially for those wanting to try using hotkeys for the first time. However, if you\u2019re looking to go pro we\u2019d recommend going with a more expensive gaming mouse.",

    "Trust has released the GXT 970 Morfix: a budget-friendly, customizable gaming mouse targeting players of MMO and MOBA games. People outside of Europe may not be too familiar with Trust, but they\u2019re known for affordable PC accessories at a range of price points, usually emulating the style of popular rival products. There\u2019s always going to be a bag of mixed feelings when it comes to creating similar designs, but we\u2019re hardly brand loyalists.",
    "The biggest selling point of this mouse is a homage to the Razer Naga Trinity: swappable side plates. The Trust GXT 970 Morfix can switch between a 9-digit keyboard (for traditional MMO or MOBA enthusiasts) or a three-button quick action set for scrolling through commands or options (better suited to FPS).",
    "You can even switch the right-side panel to help with ergonomics, though we found the panel with the finger rest to be especially comfortable. Unfortunately, the mouse is orientated for right-handed folk only, despite the switchable plates.",
    "Traditionally, an MMO-styled mouse from a reputable brand can set you back a hefty chunk of cash, so a manageable price of \u00a339.99 (around $50, AU$75) is less of a shock to your wallet.",
    "Some hunting online has confirmed that the Trust GXT 970 Morfix is available now in the UK and Europe, but there is no official word for when (or if) it will be released worldwide.",
    "The plates themselves attach magnetically and are mechanically operated. When attached, they\u2019re surprisingly sturdy, even when subjected to our very professional testing standard of rocketing the mouse wildly across our desk to mimic the result of us losing out on loot during an intense WoW raid. Despite this, it\u2019s very easy to remove them to switch to the setup you need.",
    "This sounds like it should be a fairly obvious statement, but as anyone who\u2019s transitioned from consoles into PC gaming will know, the learning curve to using nine closely sandwiched buttons is steep and brutal.",
    "Having access to so many programmable buttons will let you trigger your attacks, chug back some potions, and generally have quicker reactions to defend yourself in your games. Regardless, one slip of the thumb and you'll be dashing towards an enemy, rather than letting off a slowing spell to escape.",
    "To get the most out of the Trust GXT 970 Morfix, you\u2019ll need to download the Trust management software. This gives you full access to RGB styling, key binding, and assigning profiles.",
    "It's a very simple software, nothing overly complex or clunky. You can also assign a specific color to your DPI settings as a visual guide, which is pretty nifty. Unfortunately, you won't be able to sync up your RGB lighting with other products, as you can with Razer Chroma, so if you\u2019re looking for a unified lighting setup this may not be for you.",
    "The GXT 970 Morfix isn\u2019t without its faults. There were two instances where, after some pretty substantial button mashing, the mouse froze up \u2013 the cursor was free to go about its travels across our monitors, but we were unable to click on or select anything, and even the RGB lighting refused to continue its jovial fluxing.",
    "On both occasions we were able to fix the problem by unplugging and replugging the mouse USB cable into the computer. We\u2019re hesitant to make a call on this not just being a fault with our review unit, but we certainly wouldn\u2019t want to risk wielding this mouse in a ranked game.",
    "The Trust GXT 970 Morfix has a DPI count of 10,000, which is fairly standard for a gaming mouse, and it weighs in at just 0.16 pounds (74g), which is great for those who prefer a lighter mouse.",
    "An option for additional weights would have been nice, though; personally, we think the lack of heft here contributes to the mouse feeling a tad cheap. It's also worth noting that while those with smaller hands should find the Trust GXT 970 Morfix to be a snug fit, anyone with larger hands may have issues.",
    "For its intended purpose, the Trust GXT 970 Morfix is a great gaming mouse for anyone looking to get into MOBA or MMO games on a more serious level. That isn\u2019t to say that this is a gaming mouse for someone looking to go pro: there are better options for that without the issues I will go on to mention. But for the price, the Trust GXT 970 Morfix massively outperformed our expectations and is a fantastic stepping stone to train your thumb in rapid-button mashing shortcuts. You\u2019re getting a lot of mouse for your money, especially if you\u2019re not tied into any specific game genre. If you\u2019re looking to get into finessing your MOBA or MMO gaming then you could do worse than buy the Trust GXT 970 Morfix."
