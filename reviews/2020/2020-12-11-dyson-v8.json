  "summary": "The powerful middle child in Dyson's handstick line up",
  "verdict": "Sitting between the base V7 series and much more expensive Cyclone V10 handsticks, the Dyson V8 is like the middle child. It\u2019s got better battery life than the V7 and is still a pretty powerful tool, despite having originally launched way back in 2016. But quality doesn\u2019t come cheap. If you can afford it, the Dyson V8 is a lightweight, heavy-duty dust buster that can replace the traditional corded vacuum cleaner in most households.",

    "The Dyson V8 confusingly followed in the footsteps of the now-discontinued V6 in 2016, with the Dyson V7 series arriving a year later as the \u2018lite\u2019 version of the V8. But don\u2019t be fooled by the V8\u2019s age \u2013 it\u2019s still a very powerful Dyson handstick and could replace a corded vacuum cleaner for many people, even if you have a pet in a home with wall-to-wall carpeting.",
    "Like all the other Dyson handsticks, there are a few different versions of the V8 available. They all share the same motor and battery \u2013 the only real difference between them all is the number of extra tools they ship with.",
    "The most basic Dyson V8 model is the V8 Origin (not available in the UK or US, but can be purchased in Australia), which only comes with the standard direct drive cleaner head and the combination tool. For its rather high AU$749 price tag, that\u2019s not great value for money, even if it is a powerful tool. Instead, if you can spend a touch more, then the Absolute or Animal V8s (which are available in most countries) are far more versatile and offer better bang for your buck, thanks to the broader selection of tools included with them.",
    "Design wise, the V8 is identical to its V6 predecessor, but it\u2019s far from a simple upgrade. To put it all in a nutshell, the Dyson V8 has superior suction power than the V6, a much better battery life than even the V7, and is the first Dyson handstick to feature the current hygienic bin-emptying mechanism \u2013 and that's with a larger dustbin than the V6.",
    "Moreover, thanks to better sealing throughout the vacuum cleaner, the V8 also traps most microscopic particles, venting cleaner air that should help people with allergies.",
    "The Dyson V8 isn\u2019t just for floors \u2013 it quickly converts into a handheld minivac that can be used to clean upholstery at home, in the car, on the boat, or anywhere else you can think of. You can even get to ceiling corners without hurting yourself.",
    "If you can afford its highish price tag, the Dyson V8 might just be the only vacuum cleaner you will ever need.",
    "As we mentioned earlier, the V8 is actually the oldest handstick model in Dyson\u2019s current range. It was launched in 2016, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s particularly cheap. On the contrary, the starting price of the Dyson V8 is $399 / \u00a3349 / AU$749.",
    "In the US and UK, that base model is the V8 Animal (in fact, it\u2019s the only V8 model listed on Dyson UK\u2019s website), while in Australia, that\u2019s the V8 Origin. The other handsticks in this series are V8 Animal Pro+ (US), V8 Animal Extra (Australia) and V8 Absolute (available in most markets). The only difference between them are the color schemes used on the product and the number of tools they ship with.",
    "Every single Dyson product has a design aesthetic that\u2019s very appealing, and the same philosophy applies to the V8 as well. It looks similar to the older V6 (the newer model has a larger main unit) and identical to the current V7 models, with some minor differences in color schemes.",
    "Like the V7, you get a transparent 0.54L dustbin that makes up the bulk of the handheld unit, with 15 small cyclone cones arranged in a two-tier flower shape in front of it. The handle is broad and comfortable, even for people with small hands, and the power button \u2013 which resembles a trigger \u2013 ergonomically placed just where your forefinger should be.",
    "Like most other handsticks, though, you will need to keep your finger on the power trigger for the entire duration of your clean for the vacuum to run continuously. This can be uncomfortable for some people (people with hand and wrist injuries, for example), but for most users shouldn't be a problem at all.",
    "Above that there's a HEPA filter encased in blue/purple plastic, with air vents on the sides. Below the filter and air vents is the toggle switch to change suction power \u2013 there\u2019s just standard and max settings to choose from on the V8.",
    "A large red tab on the handheld unit with a bin icon is what you\u2019ll need to pull when the dustbin needs emptying. This was the design change that Dyson introduced with the V8 \u2013 pulling on the tab forces the cyclone part of the main unit to rise, while forcing the base flap to open simultaneously. Lo and behold, dust, debris and hair falls out, with only a very thin layer of fine particles sticking to the interior of the bin.",
    "As mentioned before, the V8 comes with a bunch of accessories, including a telescopic tube that\u2019s perfect for general use. Every single tool clips on and off the main handheld unit easily, even single-handed. The standard direct drive head is great on pretty much any surface, but if you happen to buy the V8 Absolute, you\u2019ll get a Soft Roller cleaning head that\u2019s the best option for hard floors.",
    "Using soft fibers and carbon bristles on a rotating bar, the Soft Roller is designed to glide directly over floors, and this means that if you have larger debris (like kitchen spills) that need cleaning up, they\u2019re not scattered willy nilly. And, depending on which V8 model you opt for, you also get a low-reach adaptor that you can fit onto the end of the telescopic tube to get under couches and low tables (as pictured in the image above).",
    "No matter which cleaning tool you use, the V8 remains well balanced and, thanks to swivelling heads, moving the handstick along hard floors and carpets is a breeze.",
    "Dyson has been improving suction power on its handsticks with each generation, but the V8 was the benchmark to work from. Despite an older motor, the Dyson V8 generates as much suction power as a budget corded vacuum cleaner, particularly when on its max power setting. And compared to the cordless competition, it can give even some newer models a run for their money.",
    "On carpets, the motorized direct drive head does a fantastic job. It\u2019s pretty good on hard floors as well, but if you can get the Soft Roller (or Fluffy) tool, there\u2019s nothing like it on wood and tiles. Alternatively, you can use the mini motorized tool on hard floors, but its footprint is small, and you\u2019ll need to go over the floor several times to finish a room. And that eats into the V8\u2019s limited battery life.",
    "Unlike the 30 minutes of 'fade-free' power you get with the V7, there\u2019s up to 40 minutes of runtime available here. We were expecting that to be less when using the motorized cleaning tools (like the direct drive and soft roller heads), but the V8 impressed. No matter which cleaning tool you use, you get the full 40 minutes of fade-free power. When the batter has drained, the motor just switches off, with no reduction in suction prior to that.",
    "On the max setting, though, the V8 doesn\u2019t do as well as the V7 \u2013 you\u2019ll get no more than seven minutes of fade-free power. This renders the max setting good only for spot deep cleans, but the V8's standard setting is more than enough for carpets with a layer of hair or fur.",
    "40 minutes of battery life is usually enough for an average-sized one-bedroom apartment, but if you live in a larger space, you'll need to charge the V8 again, which can take about five hours for a full top-up.",
    "As with the other Dyson handsticks, the V8\u2019s edge-cleaning prowess is pretty darn impressive. Where other budget vacuum cleaners don\u2019t have the power or the right design to ensure dirt along skirting boards and corners get sucked up, the V8 can handle the 90\u00ba angle in room edges and most corners as well. This is also helped by how well most of the cleaning heads swivel on their own axes.",
    "Then there\u2019s the two-tier radial cyclones that push air through 15 small conical chutes to generate a significant amount of centrifugal force that can suck up very small particles. Combine that with the V8 motor spinning at 110,000rpm and you\u2019ve got a lean, mean, sucking machine that\u2019s likely going to be the only vacuum cleaner you\u2019ll ever need."
