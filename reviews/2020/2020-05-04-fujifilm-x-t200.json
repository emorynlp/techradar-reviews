  "summary": "A capable entry-level camera with a viewfinder",
  "verdict": "Where Fujifjilm fell just short of hitting the mark with the X-T100, the company has succeeded the second time round. As a pared-back version of the X-T30, the X-T200 makes for a much better entry-level camera than its predecessor thanks to its better autofocus performance, superior video prowess and its burst of speed. But little niggles like an unreliable eye sensor and an uncomfortably placed joystick diminish the advantages of having a viewfinder.",
  "pros": [
    "Excellent color and dynamic range",
    "Sharp 3.5-inch rear touchscreen",
    "Reliable autofocus performance",
    "Sleek retro design that\u2019s lightweight"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Very low buffer depth",
    "Lacks subject tracking in video",
    "Unreliable eye sensor",
    "Joystick not well placed when using viewfinder"

    "Fujifilm\u2019s higher-end X series cameras are some of the best around, so when the company decided to launch a scaled-back version of the X-T20 two years ago, we expected something special. While a very capable camera, the X-T100 didn\u2019t quite blow us away but Fujifilm didn\u2019t give up. Second time round and the camera maker has come close to hitting the mark with the X-T200.",
    "The new entry-level equivalent of the X-T30 is essentially an X-A7 with a viewfinder. The X-T200 shares a lot of the latter\u2019s features, including the same sensor, autofocus system, ISO sensitivity and 4K video prowess. And that makes the X-T200 a major improvement over its predecessor.",
    "There\u2019s an increase in the price tag to match the upgrades that the X-T200 boasts. At $799.95 / \u00a3749 / AU$1,379 for a kit that includes the Super EBC XC 15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS lens, it\u2019s more expensive than the X-T100 at launch. It\u2019s also a tad more expensive than the X-A7 kit, but you are paying for the benefit of a viewfinder when purchasing the X-T200. But is there enough of an advantage here to make the new camera a worthwhile entry-level APS-C mirrorless camera? Let\u2019s find out.",
    "It\u2019s hard to justify spending top dollar on a high-end kit when there are more affordable options available like the X-T200, but while it appears great on paper, it doesn\u2019t quite match up with the X-T30. Firstly, it doesn\u2019t use the same X Trans CMOS sensor you\u2019ll find in Fujifilm\u2019s high-end cameras. Instead, there\u2019s a revised version of the APS-C CMOS image sensor found in the X-T100 \u2013 the upgrade here being the use of copper wiring rather than aluminum. The improvements to the sensor means the readout from the camera is now 3.5x faster than the X-T100 (which, Fujifilm promises, reduces the effects of a rolling shutter) and ups the maximum ISO value to 25,600 (which topped out at 12,800 on the older model). It\u2019s a similar upgrade that the X-A7 also boasts over the X-A5 and we found that the improved sensor produced some excellent results.",
    "The sensor is just one of many improvements the X-T200 has over its predecessor. The processor has also been given an upgrade, giving the new camera a slight bump in continuous shooting speed, taking it up from 6fps in the X-T100 to 8fps in the current model. That\u2019s better than the X-A7 as well, which shares the same 6fps burst as the X-T100.",
    "Video capabilities are much improved, with 4K capture at up to 30fps (compared to the rather disappointing 15fps on the X-T100) and Full HD 1080p video at up to 120fps now possible. The X-T200 has a new HDR video mode that combines multiple frames taken at different exposures to add more dynamic range to standard videos, but is only available at 60fps.",
    "To reduce shaky video when shooting handheld, Fujifilm has designed a \u2018digital gimbal\u2019 that uses the camera\u2019s built-in gyroscope, along with an image stabilization algorithm, to smoothen footage. It is important to note that this feature is different from the in-body image stabilization systems that many high-end bodies boast. That said, you can\u2019t use this for 4K video capture \u2013 it\u2019s only available for Full HD footage as enabling the feature crops out a large part of the sensor (perhaps to adjust framing).",
    "Another, albeit small, advantage the X-T200 has over its predecessor when it comes to video features is the ability to trim footage in-camera.",
    "The X-T200 brings over the 3.5mm mic input that was available on the X-T100. There\u2019s still no dedicated headphone port though, but there is a 3.5mm headphone adapter in the box with the X-T200 which can be plugged into the USB-C port. The camera is also capable of displaying audio levels on the rear display or the viewfinder.",
    "Speaking of which \u2013 the electronic viewfinder is the most obvious difference between the X-A7 and the X-T200. While it\u2019s not available on the former, it\u2019s the same 2.36 million dot panel we saw in the X-T100, with the same 0.62x magnification. There\u2019s a handy eye sensor as well, so there\u2019s no need to look for a button to swap between the EVF and live view.",
    "The other main headline feature the X-T200 boasts is the large 3.5-inch 16:9 rear LCD display borrowed from the X-A7. Not only is it larger than the one on the X-T100, it\u2019s now a fully articulating screen with a higher resolution panel of 2.76 million dots (over the older camera\u2019s 1.04 million dot display). It\u2019s a sharp display that will suit vloggers, the selfie-obsessed as well as help smartphone photographers transition to a \u2018real\u2019 camera easily.",
    "The X-T200 uses the NP-W126S Li-ion battery that has a CIPA rating of 270 shots in standard mode, but can provide up to 450 shots in Economy mode (which you will find under the Power Management option within the camera\u2019s menu system). There\u2019s no external charger in the box \u2013 the battery can be topped up in-camera via the USB-C port on the side.",
    "There are major physical differences between the X-T200 and its predecessor, and the first one you\u2019ll notice is the deeper, beefier grip. This makes it a more ergonomic entry-level option if you see yourself holding a camera for long periods of time. However, the thumb rest on the back panel isn\u2019t well positioned, mostly because the display takes up a majority of the space on the rear of the camera \u2013 something we complained about in the X-A7 as well.",
    "The lack of space on the rear panel also means that the control layout now sports a minimalist look. Gone is the four-directional D-pad control layout from the X-T100; instead we get a joystick multi-selector which, unfortunately, is uncomfortable to use. We had a similar issue with the X-A7 but it wasn\u2019t much of a bother there as we didn\u2019t need to raise the camera to our eye. With the X-T200, though, using the joystick becomes a lot more difficult when using the EVF as your grip will need to be adjusted when the camera is raised for framing through the viewfinder. It\u2019s also quite small, which may be a bother for some people with large mitts.",
    "Below the joystick are the menu and back buttons sitting flush against the body of the camera. They, too, are rather small and can\u2019t be found by feel alone \u2013 you will need to look at what you\u2019re doing to find the buttons.",
    "The top plate has the usual mode dial, along with two others to control aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation, but the latter pair are also small and some users may find it difficult to turn them as they will require a shift in grip to access.",
    "The function of the left-most dial on the top plate varies depending on which mode you\u2019re shooting in. When filming video, you can use it to change shutter speed, while it can be used to cycle through Film Simulation options when shooting stills. It is the only dial on the camera that we found easy to use \u2013 relatively easy to reach (although it does need a slight grip adjustment) and smooth to turn.",
    "The XC 15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS lens that ships in the box with the camera is quite good as far as kit lenses go, but there are some niggles there as well. The power zoom mechanism on the kit lens isn\u2019t fast, and it\u2019s hard to remember which way to turn the ring to zoom in and out \u2013 although if you use it long enough it might become second nature to you. That said, at 15mm, the lens is pretty wide, offering a 23mm equivalent focal length, and a 69mm equivalent when fully zoomed in at 45mm \u2013 a decent range for a kit lens.",
    "At first glance it seems as though Fujifilm hasn\u2019t added a flash to the X-T200, but it\u2019s there, neatly sitting around the viewfinder bump and raised with the switch around the left-most dial on the top plate. It\u2019s a beautiful design that adds to the camera\u2019s retro aesthetics.",
    "The X-T200 also shares the same refreshed menu system introduced in the X-A7. It\u2019s a much more user-friendly system and, best of all, offers a preview of various Film Simulation modes before you take the shot.",
    "Most of the shooting options are available on the touchscreen, so chances are you won\u2019t need to use (or customize) the physical buttons on the rear of the camera. If you want to keep it real simple, then just set the camera to the automatic SR+ mode (Advanced SR Auto) and everything will be taken care of for you, pretty much like how you\u2019d use your smartphone camera.",
    "The X-T200 boasts a hybrid AF system with 425 sensor-based phase detection points. To help you keep things in focus there are four AF modes \u2013 Single Point, Zone, Wide/Tracking and All. Thanks to an improved AF algorithm, there\u2019s very little fault when it comes to autofocus performance. In most cases, the X-T200 is capable of picking up your subject without too much prompting, although it\u2019s easy to change with the camera\u2019s touch-to-focus ability.",
    "Face and eye detection are spot-on, with the camera capable of locking onto a person\u2019s face with ease and following them even when they\u2019ve turned away from the camera. Eye AF works well even if the subject is wearing glasses, a feat many entry-level cameras are not capable of achieving.",
    "Subject tracking during continuous shooting is, however, a bit of a hit-and-miss. While you\u2019ll definitely get a few usable frames from a single burst, you will find that the subject can go completely out of focus in some others. We had the same issue while shooting videos as there\u2019s no subject tracking in this mode.",
    "And speaking of continuous shooting: while there\u2019s an improved 8fps burst mode here \u2013 handy for some sports and wildlife photography \u2013 the buffer memory hasn\u2019t changed very much. And that means the camera will slow down rather quickly in order to process and save all images to card.",
    "The X-T200 also shares the X-A7\u2019s 256-zone built-in metering system and, as before, works a charm. Considering we tested the new camera during the coronavirus lockdown and had to take most of our test shots indoors, the camera handled uneven lighting inside the house quite well.",
    "As we mentioned earlier, the EVF has an eye sensor which automatically detects when something is close to the panel and switches from live view to framing via the viewfinder. However, we found the eye sensor to be occasionally unresponsive, particularly when the rear LCD was opened away from the body of the camera. We had to switch off the camera, fold the screen back against the body and then restart the device for the eye sensor to work again. A couple of times the camera even froze up when we switched it on with the LCD display already unfurled, and we had to remove the battery to get things back to working order. That said, this happened rarely but well worth mentioning in case the issue goes beyond our review unit.",
    "The Super EBC XC 15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS kit lens needs a minimum focusing distance of 13cm for sharp images at the widest zoom (15mm focal length) and has a maximum magnification of 0.24x (or 1/4 life-size) \u2013 while that\u2019s not quite enough for macro photography, we have to admit that there\u2019s plenty of scope for experimentation and creativity here.",
    "One thing we can never fault Fujifilm for is its color science, and the X-T200 continues that trend, producing some excellent JPEGs. Of course, what makes any Fujifilm stand out are the several Film Simulation modes and filters available on board that add some fun and pop to the images. While our personal favorites are Velvia/Vivid and Classic Chrome, the colors with Provia/Standard are just as striking.",
    "Like the X-A7, the sensor on the X-T200 is capable of capturing plenty of tones, allowing us to retrieve details in shadows during post processing. But where the X-A7 had a tendency to deepen darker tones, the X-T200 renders them as close to natural as possible, irrespective of which Film Simulation mode you use.",
    "There\u2019s plenty of detail in the images, with barely any moir\u00e9 (striped patterns) \u2013 even at ISO 6400. Noise becomes visible only at higher sensitivities of ISO 12,800 and above, but we\u2019re hoping most beginner photographers won\u2019t need to head up to the faster speeds.",
    "RAW images are, of course, slightly noisier but perfectly usable up to ISO 6400. If, however, you don\u2019t want to edit RAW images in post, then there are two additional DR modes to improve contrast in images \u2013 DR200% and DR400% offer one and two stops of highlight compensation respectively.",
    "In terms of video, the digital gimbal is an excellent addition, although it's a shame it can only be used for 1080p footage. Full HD movies, while perfectly usable, felt a little lackluster to us. On the other hand, 4K video quality is pretty darn impressive, with very little rolling shutter effect and a decent amount of detail.",
    "Compared to the X-T100, the successor model is a far better camera, now that there\u2019s a larger and sharper rear screen and plenty more processing power under the hood \u2013 not to mention a much better autofocus system. It\u2019s also a lot more comfortable in the hand as compared to the older camera and the X-A7 as well. The retro DSLR styling will easily win fans, and its easy-to-use setup should get new photographers up and running in no time at all. The results it produces are marvelous and it can easily work well as a backup device for more advanced shooters.",
    "The X-T200 is one of the more affordable X-series cameras sporting a viewfinder \u2013 the main reason you\u2019d opt for it over the X-A7. However, an occasionally unreliable eye sensor had us using the rear screen more often, pretty much as we would the X-A7 \u2013 a camera that\u2019s cheaper to buy with the kit lens. Moreover, the superb X-T30 is also about the same price as the X-T200 at the time of writing, considering it\u2019s been on shelves for about a year now, making it a much better choice even for beginners as they\u2019ll get a camera they can grow with.",
    "Pricing aside, the X-T200 is a very capable camera and does a much better job of bridging the gap between Fujifilm\u2019s higher end X-series and entry-level bodies as compared to its predecessor."
