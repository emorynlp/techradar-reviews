    "Formerly known as SEOmoz, Moz has become one of the top SEO tools since its founding in 2004. Moz Pro, the site\u2019s monthly subscription, includes a wide range of features designed to facilitate more effective SEO campaigns and improve your digital marketing results.",
    "Moz includes an incredibly robust set of features, so other services may be easier to understand for companies new to SEO. That said, Moz is currently one of the best overall options for SEO marketing. Its versatile toolkit makes it an excellent all-in-one platform for both small and large businesses.",
    "Moz Pro is available at four price points, each with different features and monthly limits. All yearly subscriptions come with a 20% discount, so you should consider paying upfront if you know you\u2019ll continue using the service.",
    "Standard costs $99 per month and is designed for businesses that are new to SEO or have relatively limited needs. Standard users can create just 150 keyword queries per month and are locked out of important features like keyword lists and report templates.",
    "At $179 per month, the Medium tier introduces higher monthly limits on almost all features and adds support for report templates and keyword lists. You can also start with a 30-day free trial of Medium before deciding whether to pay for a monthly subscription.",
    "Large is available for $249 per month. While it doesn\u2019t add any features compared to Medium, it offers significantly higher limits compared to the two lower plans. For example, Standard users can start up to five campaigns per month, while Medium users are limited to ten. Large users can create as many as 25.",
    "Finally, Premium costs $599 per month and provides the highest limits of any plan with 50 campaigns, 30,000 monthly keyword queries, and 100 keyword lists. Premium lets users crawl sites ten times faster than the other three plans.",
    "The Keyword Explorer simplifies SEO analysis and helps subscribers determine which queries visitors are using. For any given keyword, you can view difficulty, volume, organic CTR%, priority score, mentions, and more through the Keyword Explorer.",
    "Minor site issues like missing tags and broken links can have a major impact on SEO. The Moz SEO crawler checks your site for common problems and explains the impact of each issue. It automatically crawls once per week, so you won\u2019t have to worry about missing any ongoing problems.",
    "Moz Pro provides powerful tools to help you develop a better backlink profile along with proprietary metrics for detailed analysis. You can track your own performance over time or compare results with top competitors.",
    "You can subscribe to Moz Local at one of three price points: Basic ($129 per year), Plus ($199), and Complete ($299). Plus introduces aggregator submission to Factual, Infogroup, and Localeze while Complete adds social posting plus review monitoring and management",
    "Moz Local is a separate subscription focused on local SEO marketing. It automatically stores, cleanses, and updates location data across the web in order to maximize visibility. The subscription also includes additional features like duplicate deletion, deep Google and Facebook integration, and a store locator.",
    "You can subscribe to Moz Local at one of three price points: Basic ($129 per year), Plus ($199), and Complete ($299). Plus introduces aggregator submission to Factual, Infogroup, and Localeze while Complete adds social posting plus review monitoring and management.",
    "The Moz interface is highly easy to use, with a sleek and professional design that streamlines countless SEO-related tasks. While the service includes complex functionality, it\u2019s easy to understand exactly how to find what you\u2019re looking for.",
    "In addition to access through the website, the MozBar provides instant access to the most important metrics. It also includes convenient features like custom searches, page overlays, and an on-page highlighter. The MozBar allows you to analyze SEO metrics without going through the website.",
    "There\u2019s no mobile app for Moz Pro or Moz Local, so you\u2019ll need to access the website in order to use the service on your phone or tablet. While the site works fine on mobile devices, it\u2019s clearly intended for use on desktops and laptops.",
    "Moz offers highly informative resources covering every area of the service. If you\u2019re new to SEO marketing, start with the Beginner\u2019s Guide to SEO. From there, it\u2019s easy to learn more in the SEO Learning Center or by posting questions in the Moz community.",
    "If you need more help, you can also contact the support team directly via email or through the website. Moz has teams in Seattle, Vancouver, London, and Australia, so you should get a quick response at any time of day. Unfortunately, there\u2019s currently no option for either phone or live chat support.",
    "While many platforms focus on a certain area of SEO, Moz Pro comes with a deep range of functions for keyword and competitor research, SEO crawling, backlink profiles, and more. It\u2019s one of the most comprehensive services for any company interested in SEO marketing.",
    "On the other hand, this depth can make it somewhat complicated to learn. If you\u2019re new to SEO or have relatively small-scale needs, a more targeted and affordable service could be the better option.",
    "With a Moz Pro subscription, you\u2019ll have virtually everything you need to optimize your site for search engines. While $99 per month may sound like a lot for your first SEO service, it can easily return much more than the subscription fee. All things considered, Moz Pro is among the best SEO platforms."
