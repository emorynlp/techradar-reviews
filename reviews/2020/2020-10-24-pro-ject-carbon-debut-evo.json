    "Pro-Ject introduced its first Debut turntable at the end of the last century, and it\u2019s been refined, upgraded, and become increasingly expensive ever since. This Debut Carbon Evo is the most refined and upgraded model so far \u2013 and it\u2019s also the most expensive.",
    "In terms of specification, though, the Pro-Ject goes a long way towards justifying its price. The carbon fibre tonearm is supplied with a very capable Ortofon (or Sumika) cartridge. A new motor design, some damped and adjustable feet, and automatic speed change contribute no end to improved performance and improved ergonomics. And with a choice of nine finishes, including five very attractive new \u2018satin\u2019 options, there\u2019s sure to be a Debut Carbon Evo to fit in with your interior decor choices.",
    "Setting up is simple: attach the drive belt, put on the platter, and attach counter- and antiskate weights to that single-piece tonearm. Attach to your wider system with the high-quality phono leads that are included, plug into the mains, and you\u2019re good to go.",
    "And it doesn\u2019t matter the sort of music you like to listen to \u2013 the Debut Carbon Evo laps it up. In every circumstance it\u2019s a detailed and revealing listen, able to focus on the minutiae even as it describes the complete picture completely convincingly.",
    "It has all the warmth and weight the vinyl format is famous for, but it\u2019s not musclebound and it doesn\u2019t get bogged down \u2013 instead it simply motors along in the most natural way imaginable. There\u2019s a sort of instinctive correctness to the way the Pro-Ject makes music that goes a long way to explaining why vinyl has endured as a format all these many decades.",
    "It\u2019s not the last word in absolute precision, and there are other similarly priced turntables that offer a little more bite and aggression. But if you value a smooth, informative ride from a beautifully engineered and nice-looking record player, don\u2019t spend any money until you\u2019ve heard the Debut Carbon Evo.",
    "The Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo is on sale now, and priced at $499 / \u00a3449 / AU$879. That makes it far less of an entry-level proposition than 1999\u2019s original Debut \u2013 but then Pro-Ject has covered off the entry level with its Elemental and Primary models, while the Debut Carbon Evo is a much better specified device than the original Debut could dream of being.",
    "At this price, the Pro-Ject goes up against some very capable and very well-regarded alternatives. The likes of Rega (with its Planar 2) and Thorens (and its TD190-2) are ready to turn your head \u2013 but Pro-Ject\u2019s reputation is the equal of that of any competitor, and the company is always an option at this sort of money.",
    "Nobody in their right mind messes with the design of a turntable, do they? Ever since the record player did away with the need for a trumpet horn, they\u2019ve all looked the same (apart from those self-consciously \u2018wacky\u2019 designs that are odd for the sake of it). A record player is a rectangle with a circle on it \u2013 and, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, a plastic dust-cover on the top.",
    "And that\u2019s how it is with the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo. At a glance, it looks just like every other record player \u2013 certainly it looks enough like the original Debut Carbon from 2017 to make you wonder why the price has risen from the original\u2019s $400 / \u00a3349 / AU$550. But like pretty much every record player, a lot of your money goes on the stuff you can\u2019t see: the bearing, the motor, the damping and all the other necessities.",
    "The Debut Carbon Evo has \u2013 ahem \u2013 evolved from the original Debut Carbon in a number of places. The new model features the same height-adjustable damped feet fitted to Pro-Ject\u2019s $899 / \u00a3749 / AU$1190 X1 turntable, and a new motor design with some hefty decoupling incorporated \u2013 the motor\u2019s now barely in contact with the main body of the turntable.",
    "Its steel platter is now heavier, thanks to a thermoplastic ring on its inside edge \u2013 it\u2019s a technique to reduce operation noise and was popularized by, among others, Technics. And there\u2019s now a suggestion of convenience in the shape of a speed-change switch at the bottom of the plinth \u2013 previously you\u2019d have to take off the platter and move the drive belt to change speeds, but now 33.3rpm can become 45rpm (or vice-versa) at a press. Of course, if you\u2019re the hands-on type (and you own some properly elderly records) you can change the drive belt itself in order to play at 78rpm. Both belts are included in the package.",
    "The one-piece tonearm is made of carbon fibre, and comes fitted with a very capable Ortofon 2M Red cartridge (except in America, where it features a Sumiko Ranier cartridge instead. Quite why the United States requires a different option is anyone\u2019s guess). All that\u2019s required is for the belt, platter counterweight and antiskating weight to be attached and the Debut Carbon Evo is ready to go.",
    "Mind you, before you get to that point you\u2019ll need to choose between the Pro-Ject\u2019s numerous finishes. As well as the wood veneer and glossy white, red or black of the previous model, the Debut Carbon Evo is also available in five satin finishes: black, white, yellow, blue or green.",
    "Our review sample is in Fir Green, and very nice it looks too. The finish is flawlessly smooth, and as reassuring as the build quality.",
    "Despite the only branding on the entire product being a discreet \u2018Pro-Ject\u2019 logo on the dust-cover, anyone who\u2019s familiar with the Pro-Ject family sound will have no trouble picking out the Debut Carbon Evo as a bit more of the same. And that\u2019s meant almost entirely positively.",
    "The Debut Carbon Evo is a luxuriously full-bodied listen, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s in any way languid. It has plenty of the warmth and richness that\u2019s so often held up as an unarguable vinyl virtue, but it doesn\u2019t wallow or slur. It\u2019s easy to listen to, but it\u2019s not uninvolving.",
    "And it\u2019s nigh-on impossible to wrong-foot. From A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s I Left My Wallet In El Segundo to Father John Misty\u2019s Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings, from Leonard Bernstein\u2019s Gee, Officer Krupke to Nina Simone\u2019s Pirate Jenny, the Pro-Ject sounds both right at home and thoroughly engaged.",
    "Like any worthwhile turntable, it\u2019s very adept and tying everything together. There\u2019s a tangible sense of performance from the Evo, even when it\u2019s playing cut\u2019n\u2019paste collages from the likes of A Tribe Called Quest. The unity of a recording, the way the midrange rides on the low-frequency underpinnings, and the way the treble balances securely on the top, allows every record to sound coherent and convincing. Even with the most processed, machine-derived recordings, this Pro-Ject glides along with the sort of casual authority of sound that can only come from a well-sorted record player.",
    "There\u2019s heat in the low frequencies, certainly, but they\u2019re not overcooked and it\u2019s certainly not at the expense of detail or texture. There\u2019s a similarly lavish amount of detail retrieved in the midrange \u2013 it reveals so much about the glee and malevolence Nina Simone imbues her performance with it\u2019s almost hair-raising \u2013 and while the top end is rolled off just fractionally, it\u2019s far from a blunt instrument.",
    "The Pro-Ject handles tempos and rhythms with equal assurance. Oh, you\u2019ll get a straighter edge and a more martial approach from a similarly priced Rega turntable, but the Evo counters (and strongly) with its unfussy nature and the almost ostentatious amount of detail it digs out.",
    "It\u2019s not lacking anything where dynamics, both great and small, are concerned either. The sparer and more low-key a recording, the more the Pro-Ject reveals about the harmonic details \u2013 and the more full-on and instrument-heavy a recording, the more the Pro-Ject enjoys giving every element full expression."
