  "summary": "These 'analytical\u2019 Sennheisers deliver the complete picture",
  "verdict": "If it\u2019s insight you want, and absolutely crystal-clear understanding of a recording, the HD 560S make an awful lot of sense. If you\u2019re just here to be entertained, though, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.",
  "pros": [
    "Astute, revealing sound",
    "Light and comfortable",
    "Simple to use"

  "cons": [
    "Not the most entertaining (or tolerant) listen",
    "Plastics feel a bit unyielding",
    "Slightly leaky"

    "The Sennheiser HD 560S are a very specific pair of headphones seeking a very specific customer.",
    "At a glance, they\u2019re an unremarkable (if slightly dated-looking) proposition. They\u2019re almost entirely plastic, of the black and hard and rather shiny variety \u2013 there\u2019s some nicely padded velour on the earcups and the inside of the headband, mind you, so comfort hasn\u2019t been completely dismissed.",
    "Look a little closer, though, and the HD 560S reveal their true intentions. They\u2019re an open-backed design, with all of the wide-open soundstage (for the listener) and the liberal sound-leakage (for those sitting near the listener) this configuration promises.",
    "They sport a wired design, using a 3m cable terminating in an all-business 6.3mm jack \u2013 and in case you\u2019re still not getting the picture, the packaging states \u201cfor analytical listening sessions\u201d. No wireless operation, no touch-controls, no app-based EQ adjustment. None of the niceties most over-ear headphones at this sort of price serve up as a matter of routine.",
    "The HD 560S are to be used as a tool, in the most literal sense. If you want to be able to look deep into the details of a mix, or to make A/B comparisons with absolute certainty, these are exactly the sort of headphones you need. If you want to be entertained, energized and invigorated by your music, though, they\u2019re less than ideal.",
    "Sonically, the Sennheiser HD 560S are a ruthlessly revealing listen. Sure enough, the soundstage they describe is big in all directions, and individual elements of a recording appear on the stage in an absolutely solid area of space. Detail levels \u2013 whether concerning instrument timbre, vocal technique or any other aspect of a recording \u2013 are absolutely sky-high, and the HD 560S maintain an even, neutral balance from the very bottom of the frequency range to the very top.",
    "There\u2019s nothing dull or inefficient about the sound the Sennheisers make \u2013 but in the flatness of their response, they\u2019re very carefully tuned to assist in comparative listening, in mixing, in DJing or similarly work-orientated applications. As a consequence, there\u2019s a relative lack of dynamism and animation to the sound they make \u2013 which renders them, yes, rather analytical.",
    "The Sennheiser HD 560S were released on September 29, 2020 and are available to buy now \u2013 they'll set you back $199.95 / \u00a3169 / AU$319.95.",
    "There\u2019s no shortage of over-ear headphones at this sort of money, but very, very few of them are tuned to do the job the HD560S are intended to do.",
    "Over-ear headphones don\u2019t get \u2018designed\u2019 all that much \u2013 and Sennheiser has never been the sort of company to get carried away where the \u2018design\u2019 of its products is concerned, anyhow. Consequently, the HD 560S are staunchly functional lookers.",
    "Naturally, this being Sennheiser, the build quality is well up to scratch. The plastics deployed here are on the hard and unyielding side, it\u2019s true, and they\u2019re not all that luxurious to the touch \u2013 but everything is fixed together with proper integrity . The HD 560S feel like they could survive many years of being chucked into a bag, or around a recording studio, without any ill-effects.",
    "And it\u2019s not as though the HD 560S are in any way uncomfortable or unpleasant to wear. At a stripling 0.5lbs / 240g (which includes the extensive three-meter cable and its chunky 6.3mm plug) they\u2019re light enough, and thanks to some judicious use of padding and soft velour on the earcups and inside the headband, they stay comfortable for hours on end.",
    "Behind the earcups are 38mm polymer-blend foil diaphragms to deliver the sound, and the open-backed rear of the earcups features a discreet \u2018Sennheiser\u2019 logo \u2013 just in case anyone was in any doubt as to your headphones\u2019 provenance.",
    "All in all, then, the Sennheiser HD 560S look unfrivolous and business-like \u2013 which, one presumes, is exactly how prospective customers will like it.",
    "Getting a comfortable, secure fit from the HD 560S is easy \u2013 the headband has plenty of adjustment, and once adjusted stays in position robustly. From there, the Sennheisers waste little time in dishing out the sonic details.",
    "Yet despite their powers of analysis, the HD 560S strike a very workable balance between \u2018scrutiny\u2019 and \u2018engagement\u2019. They\u2019re on the side of \u2018scrutiny\u2019, sure, but that doesn\u2019t make them a dull listen.",
    "One play through the murky, complex The National Anthem by Radiohead is enough to let the Sennheisers explain what they\u2019re all about. The multi-layered mix is opened up, separated, and rendered remarkably easy to follow. Individual elements emerge from the fog as complete, autonomous parts of the whole, their role in the overall make-up of the recording made more obvious than less \u2018analytical\u2019 headphones can describe.",
    "Tonally, the Sennheisers are as balanced as a tightrope walker. Bass is deep and textured, with scant overhang and reasonable momentum, while at the opposite end of the frequency range the treble sounds are absolutely loaded with detail and stop just short of being a little too bright.",
    "In between, the HD 560S deliver every scrap of midrange information as if their life depended on it. Detail levels across the board are very high, but where vocalists are concerned the Sennheisers don\u2019t let them get away with anything \u2013 the attack and decay of individual notes is observed fanatically, and as a result the HD 560S make singers sound as natural, as characterful, and as convincing as can be.",
    "Downsides are relatively few, but also fairly obvious. The Sennheisers\u2019 powers of insight and iron-fisted control can flatten recordings somewhat \u2013 dynamic peaks and troughs are smoothed out to mild bumps and dips. And the HD 560S deal with low-quality, low-bitrate recordings quite snobbily \u2013 they\u2019re certainly not about to tart up an inferior recording simply to make it more palatable.",
    "Overall, the HD 560S presentation is not unlike the sort of thing served up by near-field monitors in a recording studio. If you\u2019ve ever heard a pair of Yamaha NS-10, Tannoy Reveal or similar, you\u2019ll know the sort of thing we mean. If you want to hear the small differences in different mixes of the same tune, the Sennheisers will let you know exactly what\u2019s what. If you want to be transported by a piece of your favorite music, though, these might not be the headphones you\u2019re looking for."
