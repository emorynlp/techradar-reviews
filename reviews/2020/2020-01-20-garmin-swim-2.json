    "While Apple, Fitbit and others try to build the ultimate all-in-one fitness tracker, Garmin continues to spread its bets across an ever-growing portfolio of wearables.",
    "The Garmin Swim 2 is, obviously, a Garmin watch for swimming, and while that\u2019s not the only thing it can tracks, it\u2019s certainly the reason you\u2019d buy this over, say, the Forerunner 945 or the Vivoactive 4.",
    "Swimming has always felt like something of an afterthought in Garmin\u2019s watches, and given that the first Garmin Swim was launched back in 2014, we were starting to think the company had given up on the category entirely.",
    "Sure, if you wanted a watch for tracking pool intervals then something like the Forerunner was more than enough. But for the more serious swimmers and triathletes, Garmin\u2019s watches have always felt a little landlocked.",
    "The Garmin Swim 2 finally offers something for those who live life in the pool\u2019s fast lane, including some nifty features and metrics you won\u2019t find on other Garmin devices. And \u2013 in a first for a Garmin watch \u2013 it will track your heart rate underwater.",
    "The Garmin Swim 2 is available now for $249.99/\u00a3219.99. It\u2019s not obscenely expensive, but we think it\u2019s a little high for a watch meant specifically for swimming.",
    "Of course, it\u2019s a darn sight cheaper than many sports watches in the upper echelons of Garmin\u2019s arsenal, like the Forerunner 945/935 or Fenix 6 watches.",
    "As the Swim 2 launched in October 2019, it\u2019s unlikely to see a permanent reduction any time soon, but keep an eye out for those temporary discounts that Garmin applies now and then.",
    "Though at first blush it looks typically Garmin, the Swim 2 has been designed in a way that makes it perfect for the pool. It measures 42mm across, with a 1.04-inch display and five buttons around the case.",
    "The smaller size is good for two reasons. First, it makes for a more unisex design, something that Garmin isn\u2019t always good at. Second, it also makes for a lighter watch. The Swim 2 weighs 36g, helping it stay unobtrusive when you\u2019re in the water.",
    "The Forerunner 945, which we swam with before switching to the Swim 2, weighs 50g \u2013 and it\u2019s noticeably heavier, in the pool and out.",
    "The transflective MIP (memory in pixel) display means the screen reflects light to make it easier to read, which is especially helpful when you\u2019re underwater, while keeping power consumption low. We can attest to the clarity having tested it on several swims.",
    "While Apple\u2019s smartwatch has a much richer display with more data points, the Garmin display was actually easier to read at a glance when under the water or through slightly fogged goggles.",
    "Garmin\u2019s isn\u2019t a touchscreen, however, and all interactions happen using the buttons around the case. This is absolutely fine by us \u2013 there are few things more infuriating than trying to use a touchscreen with wet fingers, and navigation is easy enough that we don\u2019t mind foregoing the touchscreen here.",
    "As for the build and strap quality, this thing\u2019s not coming off without a fight. The silicone strap has two loops, the second added for keeping the watch extra secure when underwater. When your arms are continually breaking the surface of the water, you need to make sure everything\u2019s staying put. In the case of the Swim 2, it does.",
    "This is what you\u2019re here for, and the only reason you should buy the Garmin Swim 2. Note that this watch does have other modes for running, cycling and cardio, but these workouts are less rich in features and data than a) swimming and b) the equivalent modes on other Garmin watches. In short, we wouldn\u2019t recommend this watch if you plan on using any of those modes heavily.",
    "For swimming there are two workout modes: pool and open water. With pool swimming the Garmin Swim 2 unlocks some extras you won\u2019t get on other Garmin devices, the big one being heart rate tracking (more on that shortly).",
    "There\u2019s a lot this thing tracks: pace, SWOLF, stroke rate, training effect, and more. That\u2019s not to say you need to care about all of these, but they\u2019re there to digest in the Garmin Connect app once your swim is over, and you can switch them in and out of the watch\u2019s data screens as you wish.",
    "Before you even dip a foot into the shallow end, you\u2019ll want to select the pool size on the watch, in yards or meters. If the correct size isn\u2019t offered from the preset list of options then you can enter a custom length.",
    "Like with other Garmin watches, you can build custom workouts using Garmin Connect in the app or on a web browser, and send those to the Garmin Swim 2 watch, where you\u2019ll be able to view and start them from the Workouts menu. However, the watch does come pre-loaded with a critical swim speed test \u2013 a measure of your aerobic swimming threshold \u2013 made of a 400m time trial followed by (after a brief cool-down swim) a 200m time trial.",
    "You can also create alerts for time, distance or pacing right from the wrist. We set up pace alerts in a 25m pool, and once we\u2019d selected our target pace and time, the watch calculated how long each length should take and told us how frequently we\u2019d get an alert.",
    "These alerts come in the form of a bleep and a small vibration to notify you that you should be moving into the next length. You can also set it to buzz when you reach a certain distance, or hit a certain time.",
    "Auto Rest is one of the best new features on offer here, but it\u2019s only available for pool swimming, not open water. Turning this on simply means the watch will automatically start/stop rest intervals without you having to press the Lap button (that\u2019s the one bottom right). If it detects you resting for longer than 15 seconds, it will automatically create an interval, beginning a new one when you start swimming again.",
    "You\u2019ll know when the watch has moved into a rest because the colors invert to white text on a black display. We found this to be lagging behind a tad at times, with the display still black when we were a few strokes into the next lap.",
    "However, our biggest bugbear with this is that you can\u2019t adjust the perimeters. If you rest for longer than 15 seconds, the watch will automatically create a rest interval, although we found it did this even when our rests were clearly much shorter than this, suggesting it might not be as effective for this type of swimming. It\u2019s a good feature, but it needs tweaking.",
    "The good news is that you can still tap the Lap button to demarcate intervals if you wish. Oh, you can also enable the Countdown Start feature which, quite simply, gives you a three-second countdown before your activity starts.",
    "But speaking of reliability, we did find the overall distance tracking to be a tad off when in the pool. Now, granted, this is a really tricky one to nail when you\u2019re tracking without GPS and using movement alone, and even the Apple Watch Series 5 that we pitted it against didn\u2019t get it spot-on \u2013 but over longer distances we found it would overcount the distance, giving us credit for an additional lap or too.",
    "For open water swimming, the features on offer are slightly different. While you won\u2019t get workouts and pool-specific features like Auto Rest, you do get GPS tracking, along with laps, and alerts for time, distance and stroke rate.",
    "Heart rate is an interesting one, as no one else is really doing this from the wrist. Sure, the Apple Watch will technically track it, but we've sometimes found the results in the app to be spotty and we doubt Apple would ever claim it to be completely accurate.",
    "To test it out on the Garmin Swim 2, we put it up against Polar OH1, an optical sensor that was designed for swimming, among other activities, and can be worn on the arm or the head.",
    "Admittedly, optical against optical isn\u2019t the perfect test, but we\u2019ve found the OH1 to be very accurate in the past, particularly in the pool, as both the arm and temple (when clipped onto the goggles) produce less interfering \u201cnoise\u201d than the wrist, which is constantly breaking the surface of the water.",
    "The Garmin tracked a little under the Polar band, but not dramatically so. See here:",
    "The heart rate taken from the Garmin Swim 2 is above and the Polar OH1 below. It certainly seems accurate \u201cenough\u201d although the Garmin didn\u2019t track the peaks as highly as the Polar. For those who really care about this stuff, a chest strap is probably a better recommendation.",
    "And good news is that you can pair the Garmin Swim 2 with external heart rate sensors \u2013 but only heart rate sensors \u2013 so you could use it with something like Garmin\u2019s HRM-Swim chest strap. In fact, it will automatically nudge you to pair a sensor if it detects it nearby, as it did when I switched on my Polar OH1.",
    "The Swim 2 supports a couple of basic smartwatch features you\u2019ll find on other Garmin watches, but the overall offering is pretty meager. This includes smartphone notifications, but annoyingly you can\u2019t filter out apps \u2013 let alone contacts \u2013 so you have to choose if you want all notifications, calls only, or no notifications at all.",
    "There are some widgets you can access, including your calendar and a weather forecast, all of which can be reordered or removed as desired. However, some of the bigger features like onboard music and Garmin Pay are not to be found here. If you\u2019re planning to use this for running too \u2013 again, one of the supported workout modes \u2013 then you may consider the omission of the music a negative, but if you only have swimming on your mind, it\u2019s probably less of a niggle.",
    "As with just about all other Garmin watches, there\u2019s also sleep tracking on offer. It\u2019s fine, but we've found Fitbit\u2019s to be more accurate. Garmin\u2019s does an okay job so long as you\u2019re someone who leaps out of bed at your first alarm, and doesn\u2019t lie for 15 minutes looking at emails on their phones as we often do. Until we make some more dramatic movements, we\u2019ve found the watch tends to think we\u2019re still asleep.",
    "Overall it\u2019s a pretty bare-bones experience on the smart features; enough here to give the watch some additional use outside of the pool, but you\u2019ll find better smartwatch abilities on other Garmin watches.",
    "Garmin promises seven days of battery life in smartwatch mode, 72 hours in pool mode, and 13 hours if you\u2019re using the GPS and optical heart rate sensors together. We\u2019ve found this to be pretty accurate in our testing.",
    "The battery life on this thing is good, and unless you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of open water swimming, you\u2019ll probably reach almost a week on a single charge as we did.",
    "The Swim 2 should only be considered by those who consider the pool or open water to be their primary workout.",
    "For swimmers who hate wearing a chest strap in the water, we can definitely see the appeal of the HR sensor, while the wide range of swim metrics should keep most triathletes content.",
    "However, we\u2019re not convinced it has enough exclusive features to justify buying this over one of Garmin\u2019s more rounded sports watches, many of which offer a robust suite of swimming features anyway.",
