  "verdict": "If you're looking for a smartphone to play mobile games on, you'll be safely serviced with the Black Shark 3, as its hardware and software work well together to make your gaming experience a treat. It's also surprisingly good for photography, although it's not as good as dedicated camera phones. The actual build of it might put off many though, because it's big with a very bold appearance.",
  "pros": [
    "Relatively affordable for the specs",
    "Cameras are surprisingly capable",
    "Shark Space is great for gaming"

  "cons": [
    "Appearance may be divisive",
    "Will be too big for some hands",
    "Refresh rate is behind competition"

    "Let\u2019s use the Black Shark 3 to play \u2018Xiaomi bingo\u2019, seeing which of the common attributes of the Chinese phone brand are on offer with this handset from its gaming-focused sub-brand.",
    "Fairly top-end specs? Check. A price tag that\u2019s lower than other devices with similar specs? Check. Surprisingly good camera? Check. An operating system full of bloatware with a few big issues? Nope \u2013 and that\u2019s one feature we\u2019re happy to find is missing.",
    "Black Shark has previously downplayed its relationship to Xiaomi, but that seems more a PR stance than a reflection of any divide between the companies. The Black Shark 3 is a Xiaomi phone in the best way possible, and there\u2019s a lot to like about it \u2013 if you\u2019re an avid mobile gamer, that is.",
    "The Black Shark 3 is a great phone for the mobile gamer: between its top-end processor, oodles of RAM, large screen, and game launcher app that uses optimizations to maximize performance, people who find themselves spending most their phone time playing Fortnite, Call of Duty Mobile and other such titles will be more than happy with what they\u2019re getting here.",
    "The Black Shark 3 arguably leans a little too hard into the \u2018gamer\u2019 aesthetic though, just like the Black Shark 2. It comes in black or chrome colors, its rear is shaped like a large \u2018X\u2019 adorned with LED accents, and when you activate the dedicated Shark Space mode for optimized gaming performance a massive shark appears on your screen \u2013 so if you\u2019re not a serious mobile gamer, or you are but you just don\u2019t want to advertise the fact to the world, you might not like this phone.",
    "We were also impressed by the Black Shark 3\u2019s camera capabilities \u2013 we picked up the phone expecting it to be good for gaming, but we were blown away by how it was also good for photography.",
    "It can\u2019t compete with the best camera phones out there, but it doesn\u2019t fall far short, thanks to vibrant pictures, snappy autofocus, accurate background blur effects for portraits and smart optimizations; it\u2019s just a shame that there\u2019s no telephoto lens or dedicated macro mode.",
    "While the Xiaomi Black Shark 3 is definitely worth checking out, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention its contemporary, the Nubia Red Magic 5G. That gaming phone has very similar specs but it\u2019s different in two key ways: it has a 144Hz max screen refresh rate, much better for gaming than the Black Shark\u2019s maximum of 90Hz, and in most regions it\u2019s also a bit cheaper.",
    "Still, the Black Shark 3 has a lot to recommend it, especially to avid photographers and fans of the Shark Space gaming mode, so if you\u2019re in the market for a great gaming phone, read on.",
    "There\u2019s also a Black Shark 3 Pro coming which has a bigger screen, faster charging and physical trigger buttons on the side, which will be an even better phone for gaming, but it won\u2019t be light on your wallet.",
    "There are two Black Shark 3 release dates as the two models, differentiated by RAM and storage space, were released at different times in June 2020, with the Black Shark 3 Pro available later in the year.",
    "If you want the Black Shark 3 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, which we tested, you\u2019ll be paying $599 / \u00a3539 (around AU$950, although based on precedent we don\u2019t expect it to launch in Australia). The 12GB RAM and 256GB version of the phone costs $729 / \u00a3649 (roughly AU$1,150).",
    "The phone comes in black or gray variants, but the gray one isn\u2019t available in the 12GB/256GB combo, so if you want this specced-up version you\u2019ll have to buy a black phone.",
    "For context the Nubia Red Magic cost $579 / \u00a3539 (around AU$910), so in the US it\u2019s cheaper than the Black Shark 3 and it\u2019s on a par in most other countries. We\u2019re also expecting that two other gaming-focused phones \u2013 the Asus ROG Phone 3 and Lenovo Legion \u2013 will cost a similar amount when they\u2019re released, although at time of writing those phones haven\u2019t been officially announced.",
    "There are a range of optional-extra peripherals you can buy to add to your Black Shark 3: the FunCooler and FunCooler Pro are devices you attach to your device to keep it cool while you\u2019re gaming, and there\u2019s also a magnetic charging cable that lets you power up your phone without using the USB-C port (more on this later), a left-hand-side gamepad for the device (but not a right one, curiously), plus various cases, headphones, and more.",
    "Each of these will set you back a bit, although no more than non-Black Shark equivalents.",
    "The Black Shark 3 is a chunky phone, so avoid it if you\u2019re looking for something compact that you can easily carry around in a pocket.",
    "It measures 168.7 x 77.3 x 10.4mm, so it\u2019s one of the thickest phones around, as well as tallest, if only by a couple of millimeters. At 222g it\u2019s one of the heaviest handsets too. Still, it doesn\u2019t compare to the even bigger Pro model, so this isn\u2019t the biggest phablet you can buy.",
    "Needless to say, a phone this big can be a little hard to carry about \u2013 it was a noticeable presence in trouser pockets, and when we put it in shallower shorts pockets it was constantly poking out the top, so this is a phone you may want to keep in your jacket or bag. The phone is also a little hard to hold one-handed, unless you\u2019ve got big hands, with the power button out of easy reach for example.",
    "On the left edge of the phone is the volume rocker; on the right side, at the very top \u2013 and way out of reach without a fair bit of hand-shuffling \u2013 is the power button, and at the very bottom is the toggle to enter Shark Space, which we\u2019ll look at in detail in the Software section of this review. On the bottom is the USB-C port, and on the top is a 3.5mm headphone jack.",
    "There\u2019s an in-screen fingerprint scanner here too, and (unlike the power button) this feels like it should be pretty easy to reach for most people.",
    "We had an odd problem with the headphone jack \u2013 when we put the phone into pockets (top-first, as we feel is the normal fashion) the port would frequently pick up bits of fluff and scraps of tissue, and on several occasions we had to use the SIM tray tool to dig this out.",
    "We\u2019ve never had to do this with a phone before, and we\u2019d guess it had something to do with the placement of the jack combined with the size of the phone (and perhaps the state of our trouser pockets).",
    "The edges of the phone aren\u2019t rounded, like on most phones, but are angular, meeting at a ridge that runs around the middle of the handset. It\u2019s not necessarily uncomfortable to hold, but a device with rounded edges might feel better in the hand to many people.",
    "As mentioned, the rear of the phone has the distinctive \u2018X\u2019 shape, which is an evolution on the design we\u2019ve seen on the back of previous Black Shark phones. A triangular camera bump protrudes slightly from the upper part of this design, housing the three lenses and flash in a rather subtle way, while a mirror-image bump at the bottom of the phone houses a magnetic pin for a charging peripheral you can buy separately (more on that in the Charging section).",
    "The Black Shark 3\u2019s rear also sports three LEDs - two small ones at the foot of the camera bump and the top of the lower bump, and a larger one housed in the Black Shark logo. You can assign different functions to these \u2013 for example, they can light up red when the phone is charging, or flash green and blue when you\u2019re gaming. We\u2019re big fans of the fact that when you\u2019re listening to music the LEDs flicker with cyan and violet patterns, making it look like they\u2019re \u2018dancing\u2019 to your tunes.",
    "The design on the back may scream \u2018gamer\u2019 rather loudly, but we\u2019d argue that it isn\u2019t obnoxious, as is the case with the aforementioned Nubia Red Magic 5G or the Asus ROG phones, and the black version we tested looks pretty understated and sleek \u2013 it would certainly outshine some of its rivals in a fashion contest.",
    "The Black Shark 3 has a fairly big display \u2013 as 6.67-inch AMOLED screen it\u2019s on the large side (even in 2020, when we\u2019ve seen a number of palm-stretching phones), but is dwarfed by its 7.1-inch Pro sibling.",
    "The screen resolution is 1080 x 2400 (or 2K), so while it doesn\u2019t reach the 2.5K resolution of some non-gaming phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Oppo Find X2, it still looks good. Colors look punchy, which is great for the many games that rely on a bright art style, although we did feel the max screen brightness was a little low.",
    "The Black Shark 3 has a max screen refresh rate of 90Hz, which you can dial back to 60Hz to save battery if you want. This is a little lower than the 120Hz some phones have, and a good bit lower than the 144Hz of the Nubia Red Magic 5G, so people wanting the super-smooth scrolling experience that high refresh rates bring may want to look elsewhere. Saying that, not all games actually let you utilize super-high refresh rates in any meaningful way at the moment, your gaming experience will only be hampered if you\u2019re playing the games that support 144Hz or 120Hz.",
    "As with previous Black Shark phones, the Black Shark 3 doesn\u2019t have a notch or \u2018punch-hole\u2019 cutout for the front facing camera, instead housing it in a slender bezel above the screen. This results in the entire screen space being reserved for gaming, although given that most punch-holes are obscured by your thumbs when you\u2019re gaming anyway a punch-hole wouldn\u2019t have been terrible here.",
    "Xiaomi has made a noticeable push towards including always-on displays in its 2020 phones; the Black Shark 3 is the latest to get this feature, and you can opt for a range of designs to adorn the screen when you\u2019re not using the phone.",
    "Unlike the always-on displays on some other devices, though, you can\u2019t check your notifications from the always-on display beyond seeing the app icon, or change music tracks when listening, so it\u2019s arguably a little less useful than it could be.",
    "The Black Shark 3 has a 64MP f/1.8 main camera, which is teamed with 13MP f/2.3 ultra-wide and 5MP f/2.2 depth-sensing snappers. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we were pretty impressed with the pictures we took on the phone, given this isn\u2019t a handset that\u2019s designed with photography as its main focus, but it makes sense given we were also impressed by pictures taken on the Black Shark 2.",
    "Before we talk about image quality though, it\u2019s worth briefly touching on what the camera app is like to use. Switching between modes is seamless, autofocus is quick and generally pretty accurate, and in general the app felt very easy to use.",
    "It was a little harder to zoom, as when you pinch your fingers no zoom bar appears to help you adjust the zoom setting \u2013 you just have to hope you can get the right level of zoom with your fingers. Similarly there\u2019s a virtual button in the camera app for using the ultra-wide camera, you don\u2019t just pinch your fingers to activate it like on every other device, and this took a little getting used to.",
    "Pictures we took looked sharp, with particularly impressive-looking depth of field, likely thanks to the (relatively) high-res depth camera which can implement accurate-looking artificial background blur. This made the phone feel great for taking macro pictures, which made the most of the depth-of-field, but also snaps of subjects too.",
    "Colors didn\u2019t \u2018pop\u2019 noticeably, so users of Samsung or Apple phones might be a touch disappointed, but they were far from dim. In fact, images in general seemed very bright, sometimes curiously so: we took a few pictures at dusk \u2013 and in modes other than Night mode \u2013 that looked like they were taken during the day.",
    "This brightness effect was most noticeable when using Portrait mode, as this mode seemed to boost brightness and reduce contrast to artificial-looking levels, and seemed to struggle with dynamic range more than \u2018standard\u2019 mode.",
    "We\u2019d guess there\u2019s some overzealous post-processing going on here, and we preferred the naturalistic style of the standard photo mode. Saying that portrait snaps are far from bad, especially when taken during the day when extra brightness wasn\u2019t too noticeable.",
    "The Black Shark 3 was best at taking pictures during the day and in well-lit environments, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a slouch in low-light scenarios either. Because of the keen image-brightening, pictures taken in low-light settings with the dedicated night mode weren\u2019t that much different to snaps taken in standard mode, but there was a touch more detail at times.",
    "Video mode lets you capture recordings up to 4K/60fps, so not quite the 8K available on some phones, but few people will mind. There\u2019s also 1980fps slow-mo, which is twice as slow as the equivalent mode on most phones, but it can only record a very short burst of video, so we didn\u2019t feel able to make the most of this feature.",
    "The front-facing camera is a 20MP f/2.2 snapper, and pictures again showed good detail, but the keen image lighting clearly kicked into effect in Portrait mode again. Backgrounds also looked a little too blurred for our liking, but you can adjust the strength of the blur effect when you\u2019re taking a picture, or after you\u2019ve taken one, so we can\u2019t criticize it much.",
    "Selfies taken in the standard mode didn\u2019t have this effect though, so we came to prefer it.",
    "As the Xiaomi Black Shark 3 is a gaming phone, ultimately it\u2019s going to be judged on how well it runs games, and that\u2019s largely (but not solely) down to performance.",
    "The phone has a Snapdragon 865 processor from Qualcomm, which at the time of release (and likely until 2021) is the best chipset available to Android phones, and which you\u2019ll also find in all the top phones of the year. It\u2019s paired with 8GB RAM in the version of the phone we tested for the review \u2013 and mentioned, there\u2019s also a 12GB version available.",
    "When we put the phone through a multi-core benchmark test it returned a score of 3042. That puts it just a hair above the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, which scored 3034, and just below the Sony Xperia 1 II at 3085, but noticeably below the OnePlus 8 at 3401 and iPhone 11 Pro Max at 3424.",
    "Despite the Black Shark 3 not providing the best processing power among current phones, that\u2019s still a good score, and the phone is plenty powerful enough for gaming.",
    "When playing games on the phone \u2013 and especially in the Shark Space mode, which we\u2019ll get to \u2013 games were quick to load and always defaulted to the highest graphics settings, and we rarely encountered issues with even the most demanding games.",
    "We tested a large selection of games on the phone \u2013 a bigger range than we normally would, as this is a gaming phone after all \u2013 and popular shooters like Fornite and Call of Duty Mobile, mobile ports like GTA: San Andreas, and less-demanding games like Clash of Clans and Mario Kart Tour all ran flawlessly.",
    "The large screen and faster frame rate also enhanced the look of games, although after an extended bout of gaming the phone did heat up quite a bit.",
    "With all this processing power on board for gaming, the phone is easily capable of less-demanding tasks too like opening social media apps, editing photos and navigating the menus.",
    "The Black Shark 3 is a 5G-compatible phone, as all Snapdragon 865 phones are, and while 5G connection is still too sporadic in most areas to properly test out 5G gaming, it\u2019ll likely be enhanced by the fact the phone has more antennae than most, so that when you\u2019re gripping the phone while gaming your hands won\u2019t completely block out data signals.",
    "The Xiaomi Black Shark 3 runs Android 10, with JoyUI, a version of Xiaomi\u2019s MIUI, laid over the top. In terms of appearance, JoyUI looks a lot like MIUI, with icons designed with cooler colors and rounded edges, but it\u2019s better than that Android \u2018fork\u2019 in two key ways.",
    "First, JoyUI comes without the unnecessary pre-installed apps, otherwise known as bloatware, that Xiaomi phones typically have. There were one or two apps on the Black Shark 3 that we didn\u2019t touch, like Player Manual and Cleaner (the latter would be useful, but it\u2019s already available through the Security app on the home screen), but we didn\u2019t mind them too much, and we expect some users will like them.",
    "Second, JoyUI has an app drawer, so if you swipe up you\u2019ll find a scrollable list of all the apps you have installed, so you can easily hide them away from the home screens if you want without relegating them to some distant corner of your phone. In addition, you can sort this app drawer into categories like Communication and Entertainment, which makes it even cleaner and easy to use.",
    "Swiping through the Black Shark 3 feels smooth and easy, thanks in equal parts to the powerful processor, 90Hz screen and clean layout of the software.",
    "There\u2019s an interesting feature in the Black Shark 3 software in that, when you press or swipe the screen a small circle appears when you pressed, which remains visible for a while. The purpose of this isn\u2019t clear; we found it somewhat useful while playing games, as it showed us that we were frequently pressing in the wrong place to open menus in certain games, but not everyone will care for it, and we couldn\u2019t find a way to turn it off.",
    "It\u2019s time now to talk about Shark Space, the gaming mode that helps to make the Black Shark 3 such a great gaming phone. You can turn this on by flicking the aforementioned switch on the side of the phone, which opens up the Shark Space app.",
    "Shark Space contains a carousel of all your installed games, so you can easily choose what you want to play and boot it up, and the mode has a range of settings that you can adjust to enhance your gameplay. You can choose to auto-reject calls, hide notifications, and tweak different settings to better optimize the phone for gaming.",
    "When using Shark Space, gaming really does feel better \u2013 we noticed that the phone\u2019s battery lasted longer gaming when we used the gaming mode than if we didn\u2019t, not having notifications constantly getting in the way was useful, and the mode lets you easily map controls if you\u2019re using a gamepad peripheral.",
    "We had to get into the habit of booting up Shark Space ourselves though, as not many phones have dedicated gaming software, and lots of those that do have it automatically turn on when you boot up a game. If you\u2019re buying the Black Shark 3 purely as a gaming phone you might find it easier to remember, though.",
    "The Black Shark 3 has a 4,720mAh battery \u2013 we\u2019d say around 4,500mAh is typical for a phone of this size, although perhaps mobile gamers might want a bit more juice.",
    "We were impressed with the battery performance for average everyday use \u2013 so a fair amount of music streaming, regular social media checking, and some gaming here and there. Starting from full, we ended most days with about 30% charge left \u2013 and on one day we had a full 50% left \u2013 so we\u2019d see this phone lasting you well into a second day if you\u2019re not using it frequently.",
    "Obviously, if you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of intensive gaming your mileage could vary quite a bit, depending on how frequently you play, and what kinds of games you\u2019re playing. Suffice to say, the Black Shark 3\u2019s battery life can take quite a hit when you use it for extended gaming sessions, although that\u2019s to be expected.",
    "For example, half an hour of PUBG Mobile drained the battery by roughly 10%, while generally Call of Duty: Mobile and Mario Kart Tour were less demanding, while Fortnite depleted the battery faster.",
    "We\u2019d estimate that we went through 10%-25% of the Black Shark 3\u2019s charge per hour of gaming, depending on the title, which of course won\u2019t guarantee you a full day of general use if you\u2019re playing for a few hours.",
    "Black Shark has clearly identified this issue though, and you can buy a magnetic charger to use instead of the regular one that comes in the box. This charger connects to a pin on the back of the phone, and charges the device while you\u2019re gaming, rather than you having to plug in a USB-C cable.",
    "The magnetic cable is a little easier to ignore while you\u2019re gaming than a big cable sticking out the phone, so some may prefer it to the USB-C cable \u2013 but it\u2019s an additional outlay, and is very slow at charging your phone.",
    "From 0%, the Black Shark 3 took an hour to power up to 25% using the magnetic cable. This feels very slow by today\u2019s fast-charging standards, and we\u2019d imagine that for some games it won\u2019t actually add to the charge of the device while you\u2019re gaming, just offset the power you\u2019re using.",
    "If you plug the USB-C cable in instead, the 30W charging is a lot snappier, and we\u2019d generally recommend charging your phone this way unless you really want to use the magnetic pin and the few perks it brings. There\u2019s no wireless charging option though."
