    "On the hunt for the best data recovery software? Then you\u2019ll want to take a look at Auslogics File Recovery. This file recovery software for Windows can help you save deleted files, even if your hard drive has been reformatted or compromised by malware. It can search multiple drives simultaneously and tracks resource usage while scanning your drives.",
    "So, is this the hard drive data recovery software you need? Our Auslogics File Recovery review will help you decide.",
    "Auslogics File Recovery comes with a 30-day free trial to test out the software. You\u2019re limited in how many files you can recover and by file size during the trial. If you want to unlock the software, you\u2019ll need a paid license that costs $25.46 per year. You can use a single license on up to three PCs.",
    "Auslogics File Recovery has a variety of features, both for recovering files and for permanently deleting them. On the file recovery side, the most important thing to know about Auslogics is that it can handle any Windows file types and file systems. You can also recover files from external drives, including USB flash drives and SD cards.",
    "As for deleting files permanently, Auslogics File Recovery includes two options. The first, Free Space Wiper, erases all recoverable files from your hard drive to help clear up additional space. The second tool, File Shredder, enables you to select specific files or folders currently on your computer for permanent deletion. Be careful using this, as files run through the File Shredder will be unrecoverable by most commercial software.",
    "Auslogics File Recovery must be installed on your hard drive. You cannot run it simply from the downloaded executable. That\u2019s generally not an issue, but it can be problematic if you\u2019re worried about recovering files from a damaged hard drive",
    "The client itself is more complex than what we initially expected. That\u2019s in part because of the additional file deletion tools, but also because you can scan specific folders as opposed to entire drives. This is helpful, though, if you know where the files you want to recover were located before they were deleted.",
    "Better yet, you can choose to scan only for specific file types to reduce the amount of data you need to sort through in the results. Auslogics File Recovery also supports scanning multiple hard drives at once.",
    "We gave Auslogics File Recovery a test run on a 1TB internal hard disk drive. A quick scan took around 30 seconds. After that, we could home in on the recovered files that mattered using a series of filters to sort files by media type, size, or creation, or deletion date. Although the tool includes a Status label for detected files, the quick scan only appeared to find files that weren\u2019t overwritten and were easily recoverable.",
    "We ran a deep scan on the same drive, which is meant to be used when your hard drive has been reformatted or you\u2019re looking for files deleted relatively long ago. This took around four minutes and turned up a number of files that had been deleted from the system\u2019s Recycle Bin over a month ago.",
    "In addition to enabling quick and deep scans, which we appreciated for the sake of efficiency, Auslogics File Recovery also includes information on system resource utilization. This tracks everything running on your computer, but it\u2019s easy to monitor a spike in resource demand when you run a scan with the software. For example, we saw a massive jump in disk usage after initiating a deep scan.",
    "Just as useful is the file preview pane, which gives you a glimpse into your files\u2019 contents before you recover them. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re looking for documents or photos, and we noticed the resolution of the previews is much higher in Auslogics File Recovery than in other file recovery tools we\u2019ve tried.",
    "Auslogics offers customer support over email only for its File Recovery software. The company\u2019s website has fairly detailed answers to commonly asked questions, so that\u2019s a good place to start if you run into issues with the software.",
    "Auslogics also hosts a user forum where you can ask questions. However, there\u2019s not a forum category devoted to the File Recovery software.",
    "Auslogics File Recovery is relatively powerful data recovery software with a surprisingly large number of features to offer. We appreciated having the option to run a deep scan, and even for a large 1 TB hard drive the process only took a few minutes. While most users won\u2019t turn to Auslogics File Recovery for data deletion tools, the Free Space Wiper and File Shredder can also come in handy on occasion.",
    "The closest competitor to Auslogics File Recovery is EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. This software is significantly more expensive\u2014a one-year plan costs $99.95 for one PC. But, that price includes one-on-one tech support while you\u2019re trying to recover files, and the software can recover files even when an entire drive partition has been deleted. The EaseUS software can also recover SQL server databases and Microsoft Exchange server mailboxes, which Auslogics File Recovery won\u2019t do.",
