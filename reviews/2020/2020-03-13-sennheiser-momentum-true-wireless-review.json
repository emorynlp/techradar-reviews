    "It's hard not to recommend the Sennheiser Momentum range. With over-ear, on-ear, in-ear, and wireless models available, there's seemingly a set of headphones for everyone. But what should we expect from the company's first completely true wireless earbuds?",
    "Though conventional wisdom has long placed limits on what can be achieved with headphones' more compact, in-ear counterparts \u2013 or over a wireless Bluetooth connection \u2013 the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earbuds look to continue the company's audio heritage within those physical constraints.",
    "When we first tried out the earphones at IFA 2018 we were immediately impressed by the quality of both the audio and the craftsmanship that had gone into these compact, untethered earbuds. But at \u00a3259 / $299 / AED 1,249 (about AU$400), these true wireless earbuds are far from cheap, and since their release, they've been surpassed by the likes of the Sony WF-1000XM3.",
    "So are they worth the asking price? Read on for our full review of the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earphones.",
    "[Update: Sennheiser has launched the follow-up to its popular true wireless earbuds; the Sennhesier Momentum True Wireless 2 come with active noise cancellation, better battery, and stellar sound that could rival the AirPods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3. Read our hands-on Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 review for our initial thoughts.]",
    "The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earbuds are the company's smallest offering yet, doing away with the neck cable on the Momentum Free earbuds, and packing in a brand-new 7mm driver to boot.",
    "They carry the classic silver detailing of other Momentum earphones, with a pleasing pattern of magnetic gold points that connect each earbud to the accompanying carry case, securing them in place with a satisfying click.",
    "The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earbuds can only carry four hours of charge, but the charging case is able to carry two full charges for each earbud, giving you 12 hours in total \u2013 while the compact USB-C carry case is highly practical for transporting and charging on the go.",
    "The silicone earbuds are predictably lightweight, and easy to place in your ears, and they\u2019re certainly comfortable enough to wear, even if the boxy shape and lack of rubber wing tips don\u2019t help matters. You get three ear tip sizes in the box, and finding the right fit is crucial in order to prevent them from falling out.",
    "These are earbuds for the commuter, really. While we found they stayed in well enough for light exercise, there\u2019s a limit to what you can do to prevent true wireless earbuds from falling out. If you\u2019re looking for earbuds that will survive your circuits training or ultra marathons, you probably want something made with that activity in mind.",
    "The touch controls are intuitive \u2013 you use a simple tap on the left earbud\u2019s metal plate to pause/play, or a double tap to skip a track. Holding a finger on the right or left earbud turns the volume up and down respectively.",
    "It all works well, circumventing the fiddly nature of cable-line controls or having to constantly get out your phone, though prodding audio kit into your ears all day isn't a recipe for comfort.",
    "We would have liked the ability to change the rate at which the volume increased or decreased too \u2013 we sometimes found ourselves struggling to time how long to hold down the volume control, and slowing things down a notch would have helped with this.",
    "But things get really hands-free with the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless\u2019 smart capability. By tapping on the right earbud you can activate your phone\u2019s smart assistant \u2013 Siri, Google Assistant, and the like \u2013 to navigate your music library or streaming apps with just your voice.",
    "So how do the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earbuds perform? As we\u2019d expect from the brand, the audio doesn\u2019t disappoint.",
    "The usual high-standard sound profile of the Momentum range is here, with the boost from Sennheiser\u2019s new 7mm driver resulting in a controlled, capable audio performance beyond what you might expect from 'true wireless' earphones.",
    "It\u2019s not as wide a soundstage as we\u2019d like, and some of the low-end frequencies can muddy into each other slightly \u2013 when listening to Paramore\u2019s Misery Business (as we do, on repeat) the True Wireless could struggle to distinguish between percussive instruments. You won\u2019t get the head-banging bass of Beats headphones, either.",
    "Mid and high frequencies are wonderfully balanced though, with detailed vocals that draw out Hayley Williams\u2019 pounded syllables and intakes of breath between notes. The Momentum True Wireless earbuds sound natural, and will suit just about anything in your music library, even if they favor mid-range instruments and vocals over weightier sounds of house music, or drum and bass.",
    "The Transparent Hearing feature, which records outside noise and then transmits this into your ears to keep you aware of your surroundings, is somewhat useful \u2013 but the sound isolation on these small earbuds isn\u2019t really enough to block out the noise around you anyway. You may find the feature puts you at ease when walking in busy places, but it makes only a small difference to what you can or can\u2019t hear.",
    "With stylish design, smart controls, and professional sound, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earbuds are a fantastic cordless alternative for those who aren\u2019t fans of trailing cables or wired remotes.",
    "For an iPhone user, it's hard not to recommend the Apple AirPods instead \u2013 they're almost half the price, after all \u2013 or one of the cheaper options on our list of the best true wireless earbuds.",
    "But the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless earbuds still offer premium audio in a smart and well-designed package. While these earbuds are far from the first true wireless examples we\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re some of the most accomplished in their category.",
    "A Sennheiser representative admits the company has been \"late to the market\", but for those who can afford the brand\u2019s first \u2018true wireless\u2019 buds, it may have been worth the wait."
